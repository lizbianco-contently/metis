Mr. President, I express my appreciation also once again to \nour Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd John Ogilvie, and for his remembering \nour friend and my most trusted confidante, most reliable lieutenant, \nthe Senator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell. I don't know of a Senator who \nworks any harder or has a more indomitable spirit. I noticed \nparticularly Friday afternoon how happy he was as he took leave of this \nChamber because of the vote that we had just taken and realizing that \nhe would have the opportunity to be home in Georgia on Friday afternoon \nand on Saturday. Our thoughts and our prayers are with him as he \napparently undergoes a surgical procedure at this hour. I thank the \nChaplain for his prayer.\n  Coincidentally, this weekend I also had a little more time than I \nanticipated and was able to spend some time thinking about our country \nand reading some books. One of those that I read was ``Going For The \nMax,'' by Senator Max Cleland, also of Georgia. It is a really \ninspirational book about his life and his experience as a Vietnam \nveteran and the recovery period he had to go through and the \ninspiration from things he had learned in his life--12 principles of \nlife that he had learned and on which he relies. I talked to him this \nmorning to tell him how much I enjoyed his book; that I was inspired by \nit. And he said he was at that very moment standing there looking at \nPiedmont Hospital where our friend, Senator Coverdell, is, and he was \nsaying a prayer for him. He offered to cover any meetings or \nappointments that needed to be done today or this week by Senator \nCoverdell.\n  That is the kind of real love and appreciation and bipartisanship we \nneed more of in this institution and in our lives. So I encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate, if you have not read it, get a copy of \n``Going For The Max,'' and it will be an inspiration to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S6991-6", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6991-S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 3 p.m. with Senators Byrd and Thomas in control \nof the time.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Interior appropriations bill, and hopefully we will be able to \ncomplete our deliberations on that bill and get to final passage on all \namendments and the bill itself tomorrow morning.\n  Under the previous agreement, there are up to 10 amendments remaining \nto the Interior bill that must be offered and debated during today's \nsession. Hopefully, some of those amendments will be withdrawn, others \nwill be accepted, and maybe we will not need to have more than a couple \nof them actually voted on, and then go to final passage tomorrow \nmorning. I believe those votes will be stacked in the morning at 9:45 \na.m.\n  At 6:15 this evening, the Senate will begin the final votes on the \nreconciliation bill which provides for the elimination of the marriage \npenalty tax. Senators should be aware that during the remainder of the \nafternoon on Friday, when all amendments were offered and/or debated, \nalmost 40 potential votes could occur in regard to this legislation.\n\n  Again, I hope and I think that several of those amendments were just \nfiled as a precaution and that not nearly that many will actually \nrequire a vote; some of them can be accepted. But I do expect there \nwill be somewhere between 10 and 15, at least, that will require a \nrecorded vote. We will try to do a major portion of those tonight, if \nnot all of them. We may try to get a consent to finish the remainder of \nthe votes on amendments and final passage tomorrow morning after we \ntake a\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nlook at exactly how many we are going to have to do, look at how many \nwe would have to vote on tonight, how many we would have to vote on in \nthe morning, and try to be reasonable in how we schedule those votes. \nBut we do need to get both of them completed not later than tomorrow \nmorning. So votes are expected into the night. We could have, I guess, \nconceivably 10, 15, or more votes tonight beginning at 6:15. Of course, \nwe have stacked them and the votes will be limited to 10 minutes in \nlength after the first vote. Senators will be encouraged to remain in \nthe Chamber again during the votes.\n  We were able to record 10 votes in about 1\\1/2\\ hours I think on \nFriday, which probably is some kind of new record. A lot of the credit \nfor that goes to Senator Harry Reid, the assistant minority leader, \nbecause he stayed in the Chamber and helped me make sure that we \nwrapped those votes up as quickly as was possible.\n  This will be an important week. After we complete those two very \nimportant issues, we will need to go to the Agriculture appropriations \nbill which has been awaiting action in the Senate now for probably a \nmonth. Senator Cochran has indicated he will be ready to go tomorrow \nmorning or right after lunch, whichever is available to him, to begin \ndebate on this very important legislation.\n  We also would like to have the opportunity to consider the energy and \nwater appropriations bill this week also. It is ready and should not \ntake a lot of time. But that will depend on how long it takes on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  I see smiles throughout the Chamber, the idea that we would complete \nthese two bills I have already mentioned and then take up two \nappropriations bills, but with determination we can get it done.\n  We achieved more last week than most people thought we would be able \nto do. It took work and it took some time and it took cooperation \nbetween leaders on both sides of the aisle. We were able to get that. I \nhope we can do it this week. I thank my colleagues for their \nparticipation and their cooperation.\n  With that, I will yield the floor and I observe the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the eve of marking up the Conservation \nReinvestment Act--an act that can only be described as great politics \nbut very bad policy--to enact a law that gives the Federal Government a \nblank check to buy land for the purpose of conservation, preservation, \nor any other so called environmental cause is ill-advised and ill-\nconceived, it appears, on the surface, the idea of putting land under \nFederal control for conservation purposes is a good idea and good \npolicy for the nation. However, under the surface, hidden in the dark \nside of government ownership of lands, it is very bad policy.\n  Nobody has hunted or fished and appreciated it more than this \nSenator. Nobody enjoys the outdoors as much as I do--the cold crisp \nmornings in a hunting camp or a fishing camp is unequaled and one would \nnot need a fishing rod or a rifle.\n  I would say that nobody in this body has fought harder for habitat \nand policies that promote the enjoyment of the outdoors, hunting, and \nfishing. As former cochairman of the sportman's caucus and still active \nin the foundation, we guard this privilege.\n  There is no way, Mr. President, this piece of legislation can be made \nto reflect or fulfill our role in the protection and improvement of our \npublic lands. Just adding acres to the Federal estate does not get it \ndone. Just no way. The supporters of this legislation has been blinded \nby the prospects of dollars, free dollars coming to their respective \nStates. The money comes from royalties from off-shore drilling. I have \nno problem with that and, in fact, support such a scheme. It is the \npurchasing of land for the Federal estate that I cannot support.\n  I ask your patience to bear with me but I feel some facts should be \nmade part of this record and my colleagues need reminding of some \nstartling facts.\n  The Federal Government now controls one-third of the land in the \nUnited States. That is wrong and was never intended to be as envisioned \nby the Founders of our Nation nor the Framers of our Constitution.\n  However, the Federal Government has from its first day, a healthy \nappetite for land ownership and has never stopped acquiring more and \nmore land. Some for good and solid reasons. In the last 40 years, \nhowever, land acquisition has been under the guise of conservation and \npreservation.\n  Do we have enough surplus of money to squander on the idea that the \nFederal Government needs more land.\n  Since 1960, major Federal land agencies have added 33.6 million acres \nof land. That is the area the size of Florida.\n  These agencies control more than 612 million acres or just over one-\nfourth of the land area of the United States.\n  True, the majority of Americans support land conservation and some \nacquisition, but few know or understand what it entails.\n  Most of those demanding public ownership of lands have come from \ngroups who have little regard for private land ownership or property \nrights as provided by our Constitution. Land ownership is the \ncornerstone to individual freedom which most Americans hold very dear. \nHave you not seen the movie, ``The Patriot''?\n\n       . . . A major increase in Federal funding for land \n     acquisition has long been needed. There is a tremendous \n     backlog in land purchases. . . .\n\n  So says Carl Pope, Ex. Director of the Sierra Club.\n  Ron Tipton, a vice president of the National Park Conservation \nAssociation echoes the same line.\n  I would suggest that both organizations have the money and the \npolitical will to buy land for conservation, preservation, or to heal \nsome real or perceived environmental ill. The problem arises that they \nalso would be responsible for the operation and management of the \nlands.\n  That being the case, why in the world does the Federal Government \nneed more land? That is why I started to do some research some 3 or 4 \nyears ago and using some information gathered by very credible \norganizations, I was startled what I found.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has gone so far as to suggest a \nfreeze on Federal acquisitions. A 1999 report asserts:\n\n       Land management agencies should improve their stewardship \n     of the lands they already own before taking on additional \n     acreage and management responsibilities.\n       Environmental objectives might be best met by improving \n     that they already own.\n\n  There is one glaring fact that throughout our history, private \nindividuals and groups have offered the best and most sound resource \nconservation. Several organizations such as the Sierra Club has the \nfunds and expertise to do and I suggest they proceed.\n  Here is CBO's concern. BLM, USF, and NPS have added 840,000 acres \nper year since 1960. That is the area the size of Rhode Island.\n  In the 1990's, 3.4 million acres and 25 new units for NPS; 2.7 \nmillion acres and 24 new units for USF plus 18 million acres in \nmilitary installations, 8.5 million acres in BOR, and 11.7 million \nacres in the Corps of Engineers. Even the conservation reserve ``CRP'' \ncontrols 33 million acres.\n\n\n                 spiraling costs and ballooning budgets\n\n  Here are the reasons the Congressional Budget Office suggested a \nfreeze in land acquisition:\n  Annual costs for land management have far outpaced the rate at which \nthe Federal estate was expanding.\n  For the past 40 years, government's appetite for land ownership grew \nthe total acres just over 6 percent, yet operating budgets have risen \n262 percent above inflation.\n  From 1962 to 1998, land acquisition cost $10.5 billion. At that same \ntimeframe, managing Federal lands cost $176 billion, $6.6 billion in \n1999 alone.\n  It is a little easier to grasp when one looks at the cost of \nmanagement in 1962 at $3 per acre. In 1997 the cost has grown to $10 \nper acre adjusted for inflation.\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\n  The NPS operating expenses have risen 2.6 percent per year above \ninflation since 1980. During the same time, the system grew only 1 \npercent per year in acreage and units. The system has always gotten \nmore money to operate. Park visits, nationally, only grew 2.3 percent \nper year.\n  BLM generated .50 cents for every $1.00 invested and the NPS .08 \ncents for every $1.00. While operating budgets for day-to-day upkeep \nand services have grown faster than acreage, provisions for \ninfrastructure and major maintenance have not followed a similar \npattern.\n\n  In some instances, these capital budgets that provide for long-term \nfacility maintenance have shrunk. Between 1980 and 1995, NPS declined \nto an annual rate of 1.5 percent when adjusted for inflation. As a \nresult, the NPS has a $5.6 billion deficit for construction and \nmaintenance and a $2 billion deficit for resource management.\n  The USFS has a $5 billion maintenance backlog. Throwing more money \ninto the Federal trough is not getting us what we want. Eroding forest \nroads, deteriorating water quality, disappearing wildlife habitat, and \nloss of priceless artifacts are just the most obvious indicators that \ncurrent policies are not providing quality management.\n  Buying more land only contributes to a situation that is not \nachieving the environmental objectives that we want.\n  Billions of dollars are spent each year to manage our Federal lands, \nand the public is not getting the benefits of multiple-use fiscal \nresponsibility, or good resource stewardship.\n  A number of ecologists have also questioned the ability to fulfill \nits mission of resource protection. Biologist Charles Kay of Utah State \nUniversity has documented the destruction of the Crown Jewel of \nnational parks, Yellowstone. Overpopulation of elk and buffalo has \ntaken its toll. The result is starvation of thousands of elk, and \novergrazed range, the destruction of plant communities, the elimination \nof critical habitat, and a serious decline in biodiversity. Karl Hess \nreported the same in Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  Some 39 million acres of Federal forest land are, as we speak, at \nrisk of catastrophic wildfire and disease according to a GAO report of \nlast year.\n\n\n        better tools--better results--satisfied conservationists\n\n  It is clear that merely dipping into the Federal Treasury does not \nensure land conservation for the future. Under the current system of \ncommand and control, politics plays a major role in Federal land \nmanagement. Some pragmatic changes in our Federal land agencies, \nhowever, could help us get the incentives right.\n\n\n                           recreational land\n\n  Lands historically used for recreation, should pay or attempt to pay \ntheir own way and not rely entirely upon congressional appropriations.\n  There is no doubt that park managers can better care for the land \nthat Federal overseers in Congress who fail to allocate funds for \nnecessary maintenance. The Fee Demonstration Program is a step in the \nright direction.\n  As land managers generate revenues and decide how the money will be \nspent, they are allowed to be more responsive to visitors, more \nexpedient with maintenance, and more protective of natural resources.\n\n\n                            commodity lands\n\n  Not all Federal lands are equally deserving of preservation. In a \nworld of limited resources, it makes sense to sell lands with lesser \nconservation values to ensure adequate protection for those worthy of \nconservation.\n\n\n                           habitat set-asides\n\n  There are some lands under Federal management that are not likely to \never pay their own way, but have ecological or cultural value. The land \nmight be critical wildlife habitat, watershed for large, diversified \nusers, or the site of some historical event. These should be placed \nunder a trust or endowment board. A portion of revenues derived from \nuser fees at more popular sites or the sale of other lands could be \nused as endowment funds to manage these valuable areas. I am very \nsupportive of this idea.\n\n\n                            new acquisitions\n\n  Current Federal land management permits land acquisitions without \nregard to operating and maintenance costs. Before adding more land to \nthe Federal estate and obligating the American taxpayer, a detailed \naccounting of annual operating and maintenance costs should be prepared \nand, like private conservators, laws should require that funding for \nproper management be part of the appropriation. No O money, no deal. \nI will insist on it.\n\n\n                             land exchanges\n\n  There is no doubt in my mind that land exchanges are necessary. Small \nunits of range should be either traded or sold to block up large units \nfor management purposes. The funds derived from the sales should be \nplaced in the trust or endowment for management of other public \nholdings.\n\n\n                           private solutions\n\n  As an alternative to Federal land conservation, private conservation \nby individuals and groups is a viable option with a long history in the \nUnited States. The growing demand to protect land resources has created \na new impetus for private conservation through ownership and other \nlegal mechanisms. Whether the land is managed for profit or to fulfill \na mission, these private conservators have the right incentives. They \nface the opportunity costs for alternative uses of the resources. The \nresult is often better land management than that provided by our \nFederal land managers.\n\n\n                               fee simple\n\n  Private landownership is the oldest and simplest form of land \nconservation. It will continue to exist as long as property rights are \nwell-defined and owners can profit from their investment in \nconservation or achieve their conservation goals.\n\n\n                  land trusts, conservation easements\n\n  Tax benefits.\n  Perpetual easements.\n  Restructuring easements.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Changes that would improve land conservation and mitigate \nenvironmental damage without adding more land to the Federal estate \ninclude:\n  Lands for recreational use should pay their own way or generate some \nrevenue to cover costs;\n  Land use rights on commodity producing lands should be sold for the \nhighest value use. The winning bid could be commercial timber harvest, \nselective harvest to enhance wildlife habitat, wilderness, recreation, \nor some combination of uses;\n  Income from the sale of land and land use rights should be put into \nendowment funds to buy or manage lands with higher conservation values, \nsuch as those with critical wildlife habitat, scenic value, or \nhistorical significance; and\n  Barriers should be lowered to encourage private conservation and good \nstewardship.\n  At present our Federal land agencies are poor land stewards. Many \ntimes through no fault of their own, their budgets reach into the \nbillions, yet damage to roads, sewers, buildings, forest, and \nrangelands remain and continue to worsen.\n  Only the lands that are under long-term lease arrangements with \nindividuals or groups continue to improve.\n  Given the right incentives, we can protect areas like Yellowstone and \nYosemite, preserve the Bob Marshall Wilderness of Montana, and the east \nfront. But forests such as Clinch Valley, VA, are better left in \nprivate hands.\n  Again, I must iterate that the Conservation Reinvestment Act as \nwritten and presented this day, is ill-conceived and ill-advised. We \ncan and must invest those dollars where the environmental objectives \nare clearly achievable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the great English novelist, Charles Dickens, \nbegan his epic novel, ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' with these words, ``It \nwas the best of times, it was the worst of\ntimes. . . .''\n  Well over a century later, and a continent away from the writing of \nDickens' story, those words could well describe the plight of our \nnation in the last year of the 20th century.\n  That is this century--the last year of the 20th century.\n  The United States has never been more affluent, in terms of material \nwealth and creature comforts, or more impoverished in terms of \nspiritual well-being. It is the best of times materially. It is the \nworst of times spiritually. Millions are made daily on Wall Street, \nAmerican consumerism fuels booming international economic and trade \nmarkets, and our Nation's living standard is the envy of the world. We \nhave eliminated our staggering deficits at home, at least on paper, and \njobs are available for our people in abundance.\n  Yet, America is, in many ways, a hollow nation. We are a people on \nthe edge of a precipice. Despite all of our economic prosperity, \ndespite all of our fascination with the glittery toys that money can \nbuy us, despite all of the accouterments of success and prosperity, so \nenvied by the rest of the world, all of the material comforts we so \nenthusiastically chase, can never pacify the hunger beginning to emerge \nin our collective souls, nor even start to solve the endemic problems \nwhich crowd the dark corners of our national psyche.\n  Our children randomly slaughter each other in our schools, clothes \nare torn off of innocent women in a public park, smut crowds the \nairwaves, the traditional family structure continues to deteriorate, \nadvertising reflects little but sexual innuendo and the desire for a \nmad rush to some materialistic nirvana, song lyrics are not fit for \npolite company, and even the barest mention of the existence of a \nCreator is castigated as inappropriate or viewed as the unbalanced \nravings of the lunatic fringe.\n  We are a people seemingly in deep denial of our own humanity--in deep \ndenial of our own unquenched inner need for meaning and purpose and \ndirection in our lives. We have succumbed to the glossy promise of \nmore, and more, and more, in a vain and pointless effort to deny the \none essential element which is so glaringly missing from our aimless, \nrestless pursuit of prosperity.\n  Religion has all but vanished from our national life. Worse than \nthat, religion is discouraged; religion is frowned upon. Religion is \nsuppressed, spurred by what I believe is a misguided attempt to ensure \na completely secular society and a gross misreading of constitutional \nintent. Oh, what ills are born when we forget our history! What ills \nare born when we forget our history!\n  This Nation was founded, in part, so that religion could freely \nflourish. The Constitution was written and ratified by men who \npossessed a strong spiritual awareness. These were not Godless men who \nwrote the Constitution of the United States. They had a spiritual \nawareness. The universal principles espoused in the Declaration of \nIndependence in 1776, and other early American documents reflect \naspirations, which are, at their core, based on a belief in a Supreme \nBeing and on the existence of a human soul. What are these if not \nreligious principles? Such lofty and spiritual beliefs as the bedrock \nequality of all humans,--as the bedrock equality of all humans--and the \nendowment by a Creator of basic rights cannot be secularized out of \nexistence in a nation so rooted in a deep spiritual consciousness as is \nours. Every single value upon which this country was so painstakingly \nbuilt--individual sacrifice for the greater good, fairness, charity, \ntruthfulness, morality, personal responsibility, honesty--all of these \nare, at root, qualities derived from Judeo-Christian teachings. To try \nto separate this nation from the religious grounding which it so \nobviously exhibits in every aspect of its history, is like trying to \nbifurcate muscle from bone. Dysfunction is the result--sterile bone \nwhich cannot move, and useless tissue with no support. That is what \nhappens when spiritual values become separated from our national life.\n\n  Nowhere are the results of such an unfortunate rending more obvious, \nmore destructive or more heartbreaking than in the evident damage we \nhave done to our most precious commodity, our children. Millions of our \ninnocents are lost in a maze of drugs, cheap sex, violence, and \nmaterialism. They are starving--starving--for lessons by which to live \ntheir lives, and what do we offer them? We offer them only hedonistic \nbaubles. Love of pleasure, greed, gratification of sex, deification of \nthe crude and the outrageous, and the selfish culture of Me, me, me, \nand More, more, more, are no guidelines on which to build a life or a \ncharacter whether it be a nation or the individual. These are only \nempty distractions that lead down roads previously reserved for misfits \nand criminals. We must look hard at ourselves in the mirror each \nmorning and ask what in the name of God we are coming to if we continue \non this course? We are all at fault, all of us--the clergy for not \nspeaking out, the Church doesn't speak out like it used to when I was a \nboy.\n  The church took a strong stand on the great national issues. But the \nchurch, as so many of us, has been driven into a closet; so the clergy \nfor not speaking out; the leaders of business in this country for \nlooking only at profits; the leaders of both political parties for \npandering--pandering. Most of the issues that plague us nationally--\nsuch as violence in our schools, inadequate health care for the weakest \nin our society, crime, greed in politics, all of these issues, all of \nthem, are at their root--are issues of right and wrong, issues of \nmorality.\n  Yet in order to avoid offending anyone--don't offend anyone; that is \nwhy so many of the colleges and schools have taken history out of the \nrequired courses, because history might offend somebody. It might \noffend some group--in order to avoid offending anyone or any group, we \ntry to totally secularize our politics on the left and overly polarize \nour politics, with too much false piety, on the right. So both are in \nthe wrong. The result is only endless power struggle and pandering to \nthe various groups which keep us in power. As such, political power has \nbecome an end, not a means, and the leadership of this nation too often \nwinds up pursuing solutions to the effects of our ills and ignoring \ntheir causes.\n  A prejudice against the influence of religious commitment and moral \nvalues upon political issues now characterizes almost every sector of \nAmerican society from the media to law to academia. We have seen the \nSupreme Court rule, again and again, against allowing voluntary prayer \nin public school in this country. I believe that this ingrained \npredisposition against expressions of religious or spiritual beliefs is \nwrongheaded, destructive, and completely contrary to the intent of the \nFounders of this great nation. Instead of ensuring freedom of religion \nin a nation founded in part to guarantee that basic liberty, a literal \nsuffocation of that freedom has been the result. The rights of those \nwho do not believe in a Supreme Being have been zealously guarded, to \nthe denigration, I repeat, denigration, of the rights of those who do \nso believe.\n\n  The American doctrine of separation of church and state--and you \ndon't find that in the Constitution; it says nothing about separation \nof Church and State in the Constitution--forbids the establishment of \nany one religion by the state, but not, I repeat, not the influence of \nreligious values in the life of the nation. Religious faith has always \nbeen an underpinning of American life.\n  One of the most perceptive of observers of the early American scene \nwas Alexis de Tocqueville. Writing in the 1830's on his observations \nwhile traveling in America, de Tocqueville grasped the moral content of \nAmerica. Coming from France where abuse of power by the clergy had made\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nanticlericalism endemic, he was amazed to find it virtually unknown in \nAmerica.\n  De Tocqueville writes:\n\n       In France, I had almost always seen the spirit of religion \n     and the spirit of freedom marching in opposite directions, \n     but in America, I found they were intimately united, and that \n     they reigned in common over the same country. . . . Religion \n     . . . must be regarded as the first of their political \n     institutions . . . .\n\n  He is talking about Americans in the 1830s. Let me say that again--\nDeTocqueville:\n\n       Religion . . . must be regarded as the first of their \n     political institutions; for if it does not impart a taste for \n     freedom, it facilitates the use of it.\n\n  He concluded that most Americans held religion,\n\n       to be indispensable to the maintenance of Republican \n     institutions.\n\n  John Adams was the second President of the United States. He served \nas Vice President for 8 years under George Washington. He was a member \nof the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Declaration of \nIndependence. He greatly influenced the States to ratify the new \nConstitution by writing a three-volume work, entitled, ``A Defense of \nthe Constitutions of the Government of the United States.''\n  I like to go back to John Adams' work from time to time and just read \nit again. I recommend it to our people who are listening in this \nChamber. One might say that, when it came to building the governmental \nstructure of these United States, John Adams was in on the ground \nfloor. In his diary entry dated February 22, 1756, John Adams wrote--\nlisten to John Adams now:\n\n       Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the \n     Bible for their only law book, and every member should \n     regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited! Every \n     member would be obliged in conscience to temperance, \n     frugality, and industry; to justice, kindness, and charity \n     towards his fellow men; and to piety, love, and reverence \n     toward Almighty God . . . . What a Utopia, what a Paradise \n     would this region be.\n\n  That was John Adams. Obviously, John Adams believed that moral \nprecepts and Biblical teachings would be an ideal foundation on which \nto lay the government of a great nation.\n  On July 8, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read publicly at \nthe Continental Congress while the famous ``Liberty Bell'' was rung. \nWouldn't you have liked to have been there? Congress then established a \nthree-man Committee consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and \nBenjamin Franklin, for the purpose of designing a great seal for the \nUnited States. What were Franklin's suggestions? Franklin's suggestions \nfor a seal and motto characterizing the spirit of this new nation \nwere--this is Franklin talking, not Robert C. Byrd:\n\n       Moses lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and \n     pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters. This \n     motto: ``Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.''\n\n  What did Thomas Jefferson propose? This is Thomas Jefferson talking, \nnot Robert C. Byrd. Thomas Jefferson proposed:\n\n       The children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by \n     day, and a pillar of fire by night.\n\n  Try as I may, I sense no hypersensitivity about absolute separation \nof religion and the government of the new country in these suggestions \nfor symbols of our new nation. Would such men as Jefferson and Franklin \nhave suggested such symbols if they intended for an absolute wall of \nseparation to be erected between government and any sort of religious \nexpression? I think not.\n  When it comes to current attitudes about the proper role of religion \nin America, the apple has fallen very far from the tree. In fact, our \ngreatest leaders have shown no trepidation about God's proper place in \nthe American panorama. I am talking about our greatest leaders. Every \nsession of the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States \nSenate begins with a prayer. I heard the Chaplin pray today, and so did \nyou. And each House, from the Nation's beginning, has had its Chaplain \npaid with Federal tax dollars. The Supreme Court of the United States \nbegins each session only after a solemn pronouncement that concludes \nwith ``God save the United States and this Honorable Court.''\n\n  So it is then, with almost total incredulity, that I read the \ncontinued pronouncements on the subject of prayer in school by our \nSupreme Court, which since 1962, has steadily chipped away at any \nconnection between religion and the governmental sphere. How could such \nrulings be handed down time after time by learned men and women who are \nobviously familiar with the history of this nation, and with the faith-\nbased grounding of our entire governmental structure? And recently we \nhave this latest decision by the Supreme Court, involving voluntary \nstudent-led prayer at a Texas high school football game.\n  I don't attend football games. I have attended one in the 48 years \nthat I have been in Washington, and I attended that only at halftime to \ncrown the Queen; West Virginia and Maryland were playing. But even if I \ndon't attend football games, there are people who do attend. And if it \nis their wish to have prayers, if the students in the band or on the \nfootball teams want to have prayer, more power to them.\n  On June 19, the highest court in our land ruled in a 6-3 decision \nthat somehow this voluntary student-led prayer violated the \nConstitution's establishment clause.\n  Justice Stevens, writing for the majority opinion, said that even \nwhen attendance was voluntary and the decision to pray was made by \nstudents:\n\n       the delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of \n     coercing those present to participate in an act of religious \n     worship.\n\n  What nonsense--nonsense. Such a pronouncement ignores a separate \nFirst Amendment problem, in that it amounts to the censorship of \nreligious speech in a governmental forum. What about the rights of \nthose students who wish to pray, perhaps for the safety of their \nclassmates? Such a ruling tramples on the Constitutional rights of \nthose students in favor of some mythical possibility that coercement \nmight be felt by someone.\n  In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist summed up \nthe matter pretty nicely, I think, when he stated that the majority \nopinion ``bristles''--bristles--``with hostility to all things \nreligious in public life.''\n  Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist said it right: The majority opinion \n``bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life.''\n  For that statement, the Chief Justice will always have my gratitude. \nHe is eminently correct, and, of course, it took courage to say what he \ndid. As everyone knows, I am no fan of amending the U.S. Constitution, \nand I believe it should be done only rarely and with great care. \nCertainly this year, an election year, is no year to try to pass a \nconstitutional amendment on school prayer.\n  But I intend to implore the two major party candidates--and I do \nimplore the two major party candidates--to seriously consider including \na constitutional amendment in the nature of clarifying the intent of \nthe framers in the area of prayer in school as part of both party \nplatforms.\n  I have yet to read a party platform. Never read one. I have never \nread a Democratic Party platform or any other party platform, but there \nare many who do, and it is only natural the parties should have \nplatforms. People expect them to have a platform to indicate where they \nstand on the great issues of the day. So I urge Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore \nto work to put the words in the party platforms urging that there be an \namendment to clarify the intent of the framers in the area of prayer in \nschool.\n  The intent of the framers was clearly only to keep the new government \nfrom endorsing or favoring one religion over another, but not from \nfavoring a free exercise of religion over nonreligion. Certainly, it \nwas never to prohibit voluntary expressions of a religious nature by \nour citizens.\n  Just what do we teach our children? Upon what do we base the most \nfundamental codes of society if we are not to base them on moral \nprecepts and spiritual precepts? How can we lead our own people, how \ncan we grapple with issues of right and wrong, or how can we continue \nto inspire downtrodden peoples from around the globe if we continue to \ndeny and to sever our basic ties to faith-based principles?\n  Alarmingly, we are crafting a political secularism which does not \nreflect the views or practices of most Americans, the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans. Consider these facts:\n\n       Nine Americans in 10 say they have never doubted the \n     existence of God. Eight Americans in 10 say they believe they \n     will be called\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\n     before God on Judgment Day to answer for their actions, their \n     words, their deeds. Eight Americans in 10 say they believe \n     God still works miracles, and he does.\n\n  One sits right over there in the chair. Here sits some up here. These \nare miracles. There are literally millions of things that could have \nhappened to each of us, and we would never have been born or in being \nborn we would have been confronted with many health problems. There are \nmiracles every day.\n  Seven Americans in 10 believe in life after death. I do, and I \ndaresay most, if not all, of the people in this Chamber do believe \nthere is a life after death. What would there be to live for otherwise? \nOh, you may laugh now, but wait until you are 82, as I am, and well on \nyour way to 83. To what do you have to look forward to each day of your \nlife which is fast ebbing? Yes, you will change your mind then.\n  How can the beliefs of such sizable sections of the American \npopulation totally escape the attention of politicians and educators? \nThey are all going to die, too. Every one of them, and they are going \nto have to go out and meet God in eternity, which is a long, long, long \ntime.\n  How could these statistics escape the nine members of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States? Does the answer lie in the elitism that so \npermeates this arrogant capital city? Does theology tend to thin out as \none gravitates toward the top of the socioeconomic scale, rather like \nthe thinner air at the top of some elevated peak? Are we, indeed, \nwitnessing the writing of a new ``Tale of Two Cities'' as we watch \npublic policy diverge ever more dramatically from the views of the \npeople and the plain-as-day record of our own documented history?\n  Power unchecked by moral insight, teaching untempered by spiritual \nvalues, government unenlightened by faith in a Creator--no city and no \nnation can sustain such a course. While we may distract ourselves for a \ntime with the affluence that a booming economy provides, eventually \nthere is a kind of nihilism in a society whose God is materialism--\nwhose only God is materialism.\n  Look carefully around you at the culture of America today. Just stop \nand think for a moment. You do not even have to look around you. Stop \nand think for a moment about the culture of this country today. Note \nthe banality of most public discourse, the lack of respect for \nauthority, the absence of common civility, the crudeness of popular \nentertainment, the glorification of violence.\n  There is no map, there is no compass, there is no vision, and ``Where \nthere is no vision, the people perish.''\n  Mr. President, the very first sentence of the first amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States--here is the Constitution; so small \nthat it fits into a shirt pocket--the very first sentence of the first \namendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows: \n``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .'' It seems to me that \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, over the years, in its rulings on school prayer \nover the last 40 years has bent over backwards to enforce the first \nclause in that amendment dealing with an establishment of religion, but \nthe Court has seemingly exhibited a strong bias against the equally \nimportant--the equally important--second part of the sentence. That \nsentence has two parts. And the second part is, I quote: ``. . . or \nprohibiting the free exercise there-\nof; . . .''\n  In ruling after ruling, over the past 40 years the Court seems to be \ngoing farther and farther in the direction of prohibiting the free \nexercise of religion. In precedent after precedent, the Court, often by \nslim majorities, has seemed bent upon totally eradicating any semblance \nwhatsoever of religious speech in our public schools, even when such \nspeech is not in any way, shape, or form connected with an \n``establishment'' of religion.\n  When I read the first amendment clause dealing with freedom of \nreligion, the words of the amendment seem to strike a balance between \nan establishment of religion, on the one hand, and the free exercise of \nreligion, on the other. But the Court seems determined to completely \nignore, and thus obliterate, any right to a free exercise of religion \nin the public schools. No wonder many people take their children out of \nthe public schools. I believe that the framers of the United States \nConstitution--yea, the founders of this Republic itself--would be \nappalled. Can you imagine what the founders--the framers, the people \nwho framed the Constitution, the people who voted on the ratification \nof the Constitution--how they would feel? I believe they would be \nappalled at the Court's apparent drift over the last 40 years toward \ntotal secularism and away from any modicum of voluntary religious \nexpression in the public schools of this country.\n  Now let us briefly reflect upon the impact of religion on the \ndevelopment of American constitutionalism. Let's go back. Let's go back \nover the decades, yea, even over the centuries, and reflect upon the \nimpact of religion on the development of American constitutionalism. We \nwill find that the roots of religion run deep. As one scholar, Donald \nS. Lutz, has noted--this is what he says--``The political covenants \nwritten by English colonists in America lead us to the church covenants \nwritten by Protestants in the late 1500's and early 1600's and these, \nin turn, lead us back to the Covenant tradition of the Old Testament.'' \nThat is what he said. The American constitutional tradition derives in \nmuch of its form and content from the Judeo-Christian tradition--we \ncan't avoid it; it is there; nothing can erase it; you can take all the \nhistory books out of the schools that you want, but the fact remains \nthat it is still there--the Judeo-Christian tradition as interpreted by \nthe radical Protestant sects to which belonged so many of the original \nEuropean settlers in British North America.\n  Lutz, in his work, entitled, ``The Origins of American \nConstitutionalism,'' says this: ``The tribes of Israel shared a \ncovenant that made them a nation. American federalism originated at \nleast in part in the dissenting Protestants' familiarity with the \nBible''.\n  The early Calvinist settlers who came to this country from the Old \nWorld brought with them a familiarity with the Old Testament Covenants \nthat made them especially apt in the formation of colonial documents \nand State constitutions.\n  Now, let me refer to Winton U. Solberg. He tells us that in 17th \ncentury colonial thought, divine law--a fusion of the law of nature in \nthe Old and New Testaments--usually stood as fundamental law. The \nMayflower Compact--how many of us like to claim that our forebearers \nwere on the Mayflower? ``Oh, they were there. They were on the \nMayflower.'' Well, there was such a thing written as the Mayflower \nCompact.\n  The Mayflower Compact exemplifies the doctrine of covenant or \ncontract. Puritanism exalted the biblical component and drew on certain \nscriptural passages for a theological outlook. Called the Covenant or \nFederal Theology, this was a theory of contract regarding man's \nrelations with God and the nature of church and state.\n  If we examine the public political literature written between 1760 \nand 1805, the book most frequently cited in that literature is the \nBible.\n  Let me say that again. If we examine the public political literature \nwritten between 1760 and 1805, the book most frequently cited in that \nliterature is the Bible.\n  Saint Paul, the great apostle, is cited about as frequently as \nMontesquieu and Blackstone, the two most cited secular authors. \nDeuteronomy is cited almost twice as often as all of Locke's writings \nput together.\n  Many of the references to the Bible came from reprinted sermons, \nwhile other citations came from secular works. Saint Paul was the \nfavorite in the New Testament, especially his Epistle to the Romans, in \nwhich he discusses the basis for, and limits on, obedience to political \nauthorities. From the Old Testament, Deuteronomy was the most cited \nbook, followed by Isaiah, Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. The authors \nmost frequently referred to the sections about covenants and God's \npromises to Israel.\n  The movement towards independence found the clergy out in front--the \nmovement toward independence in this country found the clergy out in \nfront, not back in the closet; out in front--and the clergy were also \nmost vigorous in maintaining morale during the Revolutionary War. When \nreading comprehensively in the political literature\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nof the war years, one cannot but be struck by the extent to which \nbiblical sources used by ministers and traditional Whigs undergirded \nthe justification for the break with Great Britain, the rationale for \ncontinuing the war, and the basic principles of Americans writing their \nown Constitutions at the State level.\n  Let us look at the Mayflower Compact, of November 11, 1620. Here is \nwhat they wrote:\n\n       In the name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, \n     the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord, King James, \n     by the grace of God, . . . having undertaken, for the glory \n     of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, . . . by \n     these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of God, \n     and of one another, covenant and combine ourselves together \n     into a civil body politick, for our better ordering and \n     preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by \n     virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame such just and \n     equal laws, ordinances, acts, Constitutions, and offices, \n     from time to time, as shall be thought most . . . convenient \n     for the general good of the colony unto which we promise all \n     due submission and obedience. . . .\n\n  That was the Mayflower Compact. The authors of the Mayflower Compact \nhad no hesitation about mentioning God, no hesitation about placing \ntheir lives in his hands and saying so. Now let us examine briefly \n``The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut.'' Here we will find many \nreferences to the Deity, in these orders which were adopted by a \npopular Convention of the three towns of Windsor, Hartford, and \nWethersfield, on January 14, 1639, 361 years ago. The form, according \nto historians, was ``the first written Constitution, in the modern \nsense of the term, as a permanent limitation on governmental power, \nknown in history, and certainly the first American Constitution of \ngovernment to embody the Democratic idea.''\n  I shall quote the following references to the Deity from The \nFundamental Orders of Connecticut: Forasmuch as it hath pleased the \nAlmighty God by the wise disposition of his divine providence . . .''; \n``and well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God \nrequires that to maintain the peace and union of such a people, there \nshould be an orderly and decent government established according to \nGod, . . .''; ``. . . to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity \nof the Gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess, . . .''; ``. . . \ndo swear by the great and dreadful name of the everlasting God, . . \n.'';\n``. . . so help me God, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . . .''; \n``. . . according to the righteous rule of God's word; so help me God, \nand so forth.''\n  Now let us look at the opening words of the treaty with Great Britain \nin 1783, 217 years ago, providing for the complete independence of the \nAmerican states and acknowledgment by Great Britain: ``In the name of \nthe Most Holy and Undivided Trinity. It having pleased the Divine \nProvidence to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent \nPrince George III, by the grace of God. . . .''\n  The foregoing extracts, and others, from American historical \ndocuments are sufficient to impress us with the fact that religious \nconviction permeated the blood stream of American Constitutionalism and \nAmerican statecraft as far back as 200 years prior to the writing of \nthe Constitution in 1787.\n  Now let us examine the first inaugural address of George Washington, \n1789, who had been chairman of the convention which framed the \nConstitution. Here is the greatest President we have ever had. A few \nextracts therefrom will leave no doubt as to where the Nation's first \nPresident stood when it came to religious expression in matters \npertaining to Government: ``. . . it would be peculiarly improper to \nomit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that \nAlmighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the \ncouncils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human \ndefect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and \nhappiness of the people of the United States a government instituted by \nthemselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every \ninstrument employed in its administration to execute with success the \nfunctions allotted to His charge. In tendering this homage to the great \nAuthor of every public and private good, I assure myself that it \nexpresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellow \ncitizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to \nacknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of \nmen more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they \nhave advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have \nbeen distinguished by some token of providential agency.''\n  That is George Washington, the father of our country, the commander \nin chief at Valley Forge, the presiding officer of the Constitutional \nConvention, first President of the United States and the best by any \nmeasure, by any standard. He had no hesitancy in speaking of that \ninvisible hand that guides the Nation. If he were alive today and a \nMember of this Senate or a Member of the Supreme Court or President of \nthe United States again. How clear, how incisive, and how powerful were \nthese allusions to God by our first and greatest President!\n  Further expressions by George Washington in that same inaugural \naddress were indicative of an unabashed religious faith:\n\n       Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious \n     smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that \n     disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which heaven \n     itself has ordained; . . .; I shall take my present leave, \n     but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of \n     the human race, in humble supplication, that, since He has \n     been pleased to favor the American people with opportunities \n     for deliberating in perfect tranquility . . . .; . . . so His \n     divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged \n     views, the temperament consultations and the wise measures, \n     on which the success of this government must depend.\n\n  There you have it.\n  Having quoted from Washington's first inaugural address, now let me \nquote briefly from Lincoln's first inaugural address--no hesitation \nhere about calling upon--no hesitancy here about calling upon the \nCreator: ``If the Almighty Ruler of Nations--he is not talking about \nKing George III--with His eternal truth and justice, be on your side of \nthe North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will \nsurely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American \npeople . . . .; Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm \nreliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still \ncompetent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.''\n  Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln closed his \nremarks with these words: ``And upon this act, sincerely believed to be \nan act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military \nnecessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the \ngracious favor of Almighty God.'' That is Abraham Lincoln.\n  Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, rises to a rare pitch of \neloquence, marked by a singular combination of tenderness and \ndetermination:\n\n       If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those \n     offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, \n     but which, having continued through His appointed time, He \n     now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and \n     South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the \n     offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from \n     those divine attributes which the believers in a living God \n     always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope--fervently do we \n     pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. \n     Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled \n     by the bondsman's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, \n     and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be \n     paid by another drawn with a sword, as was said three \n     thousand years ago, so still it must be said: ``The judgments \n     of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.''\n\n  Now hear that, Supreme Court of the United States. Hear those words \nby Abraham Lincoln.\n  Lincoln then went on to say those words with which we all are so \nfamiliar: ``With malice towards none; with charity for all; with \nfirmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive \non to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to \ncare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his \norphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish just and lasting peace \namong ourselves and with all nations.''\n  How can one read and reflect upon these clear and unrestrained \nreferences to Almighty God expressed by our nation's two greatest \nPresidents--Washington and Lincoln--and hold any doubt whatsoever as to \nthe impact of religion upon the thoughts, the character, and the lives \nof the two greatest statesmen America has ever produced?\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\n  And yet, the Supreme Court in recent years, in majority opinions, has \nnot scrupled to bow to materialism in the Court's rulings concerning \nvoluntary prayer in public school settings!\n  A further examination of the inaugural addresses of the Presidents \nfinds John Adams, the second President, closing his inaugural address \nwith the following invocation:\n\n       And may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of \n     Order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages \n     of the world of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon \n     this nation and its government and give it all possible \n     success and duration consistent with the ends of His \n     providence.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson's closing words in his second inaugural address were \nthese:\n\n       I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands \n     we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their \n     native land and planted them in a country flowing with all \n     the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our \n     infancy with His providence and our riper years with His \n     wisdom and power, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in \n     supplications with me that He will so enlighten the minds of \n     your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their \n     measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, \n     and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and \n     approbation of all nations.\n\n  James Madison, the chief author of our Constitution, showed no \nhesitancy in expressing his dependence upon Providence:\n\n       My confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, \n     next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the \n     guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power \n     regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been \n     so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to \n     whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the \n     past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for \n     the future.\n\n  Having quoted from the inaugural addresses of our country's first \nfour Presidents, I shall now recall to my fellow Senators references to \nGod in the inaugural addresses of four Presidents in the current 20th \ncentury. I begin with William Howard Taft who, subsequent to having \nserved as President, fulfilled a lifelong dream in 1921 when he was \nsworn in as Chief Justice of the United States. He ended his inaugural \naddress with these words:\n\n       I invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellow \n     citizens and the aid of the Almighty God in the discharge of \n     my responsible duties.\n\n  Franklin D. Roosevelt refers to the Supreme Being in each of his \ninaugural addresses, but I shall quote only from the fourth and last:\n\n       The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has \n     given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to \n     strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to \n     our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples \n     in an anguished world.\n       So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way \n     clearly--to see the way that leads to a better life for \n     ourselves and for all our fellow men--to the achievement of \n     His will, to peace on earth.\n\n  Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been Supreme Commander of Allied Forces \nin Europe during World War II, and had served as Supreme Commander of \nNATO, took the oath of office as President using both George \nWashington's Bible and one given to him by his mother at his graduation \nfrom the Military Academy at West Point.\n  Many of us remember his prayer at the beginning of his first \ninaugural address:\n\n       Almighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future \n     associates in the executive branch of government join me in \n     beseeching that Thou will make full and complete our \n     dedication to the service of the people in this throng, and \n     their fellow citizens everywhere.\n       Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from \n     wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed \n     thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray \n     that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of \n     station, race, or calling.\n       May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those \n     who, under the concepts of our Constitution, hold to \n     differing political faiths; so that all may work for the good \n     of our beloved country and Thy glory. Amen.\n  Dwight D. Eisenhower led the Nation in prayer himself.\n  Eisenhower's was the first prayer to be uttered by a President in his \ninaugural address to the nation, but it was not to be the last. \nPresident Reagan, in his second inaugural address, began his inaugural \naddress with a silent prayer:\n\n       I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer. \n     [Moment of silent prayer.] Amen.\n\n  George Bush, after taking the oath with his hand placed on George \nWashington's Bible, began his presidency with a prayer:\n\n       And my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow \n     your heads:\n       Heavenly father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your \n     love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day \n     and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make \n     us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your \n     will, and write on our hearts these words: `Use power to help \n     people.' For we are given power not to advance our own \n     purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. \n     There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve \n     people. Help us to remember it, Lord. Amen.\n\n  That was George Bush.\n  I have a reason for quoting from these great American documents and \nfor these inaugural and other addresses by some of our Presidents. \nThere have been other Presidents whom I could have quoted.\n  All of these references to religious faith that I have quoted from \nearly American documents and from inaugural addresses by Presidents \nbear witness to the fact that a strong spiritual consciousness has \npervaded the fabric of American statecraft and American \nConstitutionalism for two centuries prior to the writing of the U.S. \nConstitution and for these two centuries following that event.\n  Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution, the voters who \nratified that Constitution, the members of the First Congress who \nsupported the first amendment to the Constitution, and the people in \nthe states who ratified the First Amendment, would be aghast at the \ninterpretations of the First Amendment clause by U.S. Supreme Court \nrulings concerning prayer in the public schools of America. I say that \nthose rulings are having the effect of ``prohibiting the free \nexercise'' of religion. The court has drifted too far from the shore.\n  I lauded the six members of the Supreme Court whose votes declared \nthe Line Item Veto Act of 1995 to be unconstitutional. But the Court's \nmajority has adopted a dangerous trend in case after case concerning \nthe free exercise of religion in the public schools. The situation has \nbecome so bad that most school boards frown upon the use of God's name \nby teachers or students for fear of being hit with a costly law suit. I \nhave had that happen right in West Virginia, and just within the last \nyear. Consequently, God is being driven out of the public schools \ncompletely. I shudder to think that what we put into the schools will, \nin a generation, dominate the nation, and what we drop from the schools \nwill, in a generation, leave the nation. Can it be said, therefore, \nthat the U.S. Supreme Court is heading us down the road to becoming a \ngodless nation?\n  The opponents of voluntary prayer in schools are quick to say that \nthe place for prayer is in the home--and it is--and not in the \nschoolroom. This argument portrays an amazing ignorance of the \nreligious awareness that has been the underpinning of our Republic from \nits earliest beginnings. Prayer in the public schools was prevalent in \nour country until the courts began to whittle away at this tradition in \nrecent years. So, we are told that there is no place for God in the \nschoolroom.\n  It must be confusing to the child who is taught by parents at bedtime \nto repeat the words: ``Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my \nsoul to keep; if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to \ntake'', but if the same child mentions the Lord's name in school, the \nteacher feels it necessary to say ``shuh, we must not mention the \nLord's name in school.''\n  At home and at the breakfast table, America's children are taught to \nsay: ``God is great, God is good, and we thank Him for this food; by \nHis goodness all are fed, give us Lord our daily bread,'' but in the \nschoolroom at lunchtime, the children must not say grace over the food. \nThat might offend someone. Hence, the home and the school are at war \nwith each other today.\n\n  I wonder if the high court is aware of the chaos that it is creating \nin the schools of the country? School administrators are caught in a \nbind. I wonder if the court is aware of the harm that it is doing to \nthe nation when it strongly enforces the first half of the religious \nclause while it shows a dangerous bias against the second half of the \nsame clause? Isn't it about time that the Supreme Court demonstrates an \nequal balance in its interpretation of the first sentence of the First\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nAmendment to the Constitution? It seems to me that the court is \ndrifting farther and farther to the left of center in its drift towards \nmaterialism and radical secularism as its opinions serve more and more \nto inhibit any display of religious belief by the nation's school \nchildren. In an effort to ensure a tolerance for all beliefs, the \ncourts are bending too far, in effect, establishing an environment of \nintolerance rather than tolerance.\n  Mr. President, we rail, and moan, and gnash our teeth, and wring our \nhands as we see more and more violence in our schools and a general \ndecline in morals throughout the nation. Is it any wonder? Our nation's \nleaders are no longer paragons of rectitude. Don't point to them as \nbeing the idols of our youth. The institution of marriage is crumbling; \nthe church, more and more, refrains from speaking out boldly on the \ngreat moral issues of the day; and God is being driven from the \nclassrooms of our nation's schools by the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecisions that favor secularism, materialism, and the stifling of any \nvoluntary and free exercise of religion in the public schools. Is it \nany wonder that more and more parents are determined to send their \nchildren to private schools and to religious schools?\n  Mr. President, George Washington, the Father of our country, our \nfirst President, bequeathed to us a clear vision of the importance of \nreligion to morality in our national life, when he said, in his \nfarewell address to the nation in September, 1796: ``Of all the \ndispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion \nand morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim \nthe tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great \npillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men \nand citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to \nrespect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their \nconnections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, \nGeorge Washington said, where is the security for property, for \nreputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the \noaths, which are the instruments of investigations in courts of \njustice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality \ncan be maintained without religion. It can't be done. Whatever may be \nconceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar \nstructure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national \nmorality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.'' I hope the \nSupreme Court will review those words by our first president, the man \nwho presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787.\n  Mr. President, it is not an idle reflection if, while discussing the \nissue of prayer in the public schools, we contemplate the profundity of \nBenjamin Franklin's words to the Constitutional Convention on June 28, \n1787, when he made a sobering suggestion that brought the assembly of \ndoubting minds ``to a realization that destiny herself sat as guest and \nwitness in this room.'' The weather had been hot, and the delegates to \nthe Convention were tired and edgy. The debates were seemingly getting \nnowhere and a melancholy cloud seemed to hover over the Convention. \nLittle progress was being made, and the prevailing winds were those of \ndiscouragement, dissension, and despair, when old Dr. Franklin, sitting \nwith the famous double spectacles low on his nose, broke silence; he \nhad said little during these past days. Addressing himself to George \nWashington in the chair, Franklin, according to Catherine Drinker \nBowen, in her book, ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' reminded the \nConvention how, at the beginning of the war with England, the \nContinental Congress had had prayers for Divine protection, and in this \nvery room. ``Our prayers, Sir, were heard,'' said Franklin, ``and they \nwere graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle \nmust have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in \nour favor. To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of \nconsulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national \nfelicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? I have lived, \nSir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I \nsee of this truth--that God governs in the affairs of men.''\n  Bowen, in her magnificent story of the Constitutional Convention, \ngoes on to say that on Dr. Franklin's manuscript of his little speech, \n``the word God is twice underscored, perhaps as indication to the \nprinter. But whether or no Franklin looked upon the Deity as worthy of \nthree capital letters, his speech was timely.'' You will read this same \nspeech in Madison's notes.\n  ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground unseen by Him,'' Franklin \ncontinued, ``was it probable that an empire could arise without his \naid? `I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his \nconcurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better \nthan the builders of Babel.''' Franklin proposed that ``henceforth \nprayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our \ndeliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed \nto business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be \nrequested to officiate in that service.''\n  Roger Sherman at once seconded Franklin's motion. Incidentally, on \nyesterday, July 16, 1787, the convention adopted the great compromise, \nwithout which none of us would be here today. That compromise \nestablished two bodies in the legislative branch and provided that each \nState would be equal in this branch, that we would have votes in this \nbranch. I won't go further, but you might recall it was only yesterday.\n  But Hamilton and several others, wrote Madison, feared that calling \nin a clergymen at so late a stage might lead the public to suspect \ndissensions in the Convention. Williamson of North Carolina made the \nfrank statement that everyone knew the real reason for not engaging a \nchaplain: the Convention had no funds. Franklin's motion failed, though \nRandolph proposed that on the approaching Fourth of July, a sermon be \npreached at the request of the Convention and that thenceforth prayers \nbe used. In any event, we can all learn a lesson from this episode: God \nwas very much a part of national life at a time when the greatest \ndocument of its kind--the Constitution of the United States--was ever \nwritten, a time when it was being formed.\n  Mr. President, I close with words from the Bible, which Franklin \naptly used in his speech: ``Except the Lord build the house, they labor \nin vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman \nwaketh but in vain.''\n  It would be well, Mr. President, if this Biblical admonition were \nkept in mind as future cases concerning school prayer come before the \ncourts of the land.\n  As a matter of fact, this admonition is one on which all three \nbranches of government should reflect. We here in the legislative \nbranch bear some responsibility. Here is where laws are made, and here \nis where some positive steps could originate on a path toward \ncorrecting a court imposed imbalance. The executive branch, too, could \nplay some useful role in that regard. This being an election year, I \nurge that the Democratic and Republican political Conventions adopt \nplanks--why not--in their respective platforms advocating a \nConstitutional amendment concerning prayer in schools. Both the \nDemocratic and Republican nominees for President should be urged to \nsupport such an amendment.\n  Both nominees should be urged to speak out on this subject during the \ncampaigns. I intend to urge that both nominees do that.\n  I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado is \nsupposed to take over the time. I ask unanimous consent to be yielded 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or his designee, has from 2 o'clock \nuntil 3 p.m.\n  Does the Senator from Colorado wish to respond to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am willing to grant the Senator from South Carolina 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S6999-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6999-S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DEBT AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

CBO'S 2001 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n       Mr. Hollings. Mr. President, Lyndon Johnson balanced the \n     budget in 1969. At that time, the national debt was $365 \n     billion with an interest cost of only $16 billion. Now, under \n     a new generation without the cost of a war, the debt has \n     soared to $5.6 trillion with annual interest costs of $365 \n     billion. That is right. We spend $1 billion a day for \n     nothing. It does not buy any defense, any education, any \n     health care, or highways. Astoundingly, since President \n     Johnson balanced the budget, we have increased spending $349 \n     billion for nothing.\n       Early each morning, the Federal Government goes down to the \n     bank and borrows $1 billion and adds it to the national debt. \n     We have not had a surplus for 30 years. Senator Trent Lott, \n     commenting on President Clinton's State of the Union Address, \n     said the talk cost $1 billion a minute. For an hour-and-a-\n     half talk, that would be $90 billion a year. Governor George \n     W. Bush's tax cut costs $90 billion a year. Together, that is \n     $180 billion. Just think, we can pay for both the Democratic \n     and Republican programs with the money we are spending on \n     interest and still have $185 billion to pay down the national \n     debt. Instead, the debt increases, interest costs increase, \n     while all in town, all in the Congress, shout: Surplus, \n     surplus, surplus.\n       Understand the game. Ever since President Johnson's \n     balanced budget, the Government has spent more each year than \n     it has taken in--a deficit. The average deficit for the past \n     30 years was $175 billion a year. This is with both \n     Democratic and Republican Presidents and Democratic and \n     Republican Congresses. Somebody wants to know why the economy \n     is good? If you infuse $175 billion a year for some 30 years \n     and do not pay for it, it ought to be good.\n       The trick to calling a deficit a surplus is to have the \n     Government borrow from itself. The Federal Government, like \n     an insurance company, has various funds held in reserve to \n     pay benefits of the program--Social Security, Medicare, \n     military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment \n     compensation,\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\n     highway funds, airport funds, railroad retirement funds.\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \n     Record a list of trust funds looted to balance this budget.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1998       1999       2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security........................        730        855      1,009\nMedicare:\n    HI.................................        118        154        176\n    SMI................................         40         27         34\nMilitary Retirement....................        134        141        149\nCivilian Retirement....................        461        492        522\nUnemployment...........................         71         77         85\nHighway................................         18         28         31\nAirport................................          9         12         13\nRailroad Retirement....................         22         24         25\nOther..................................         53         59         62\n                                        --------------------------------\n      Total............................      1,656      1,869      2,106\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Mr. Hollings. Mr. President, these funds are held in trust \n     for the specific purpose for which the taxes are collected.\n       Under corporate law, it is a felony to pay off the company \n     debt with the pension fund. But in Washington we pay down the \n     public debt with trust funds, call it a surplus, and they \n     give us the ``Good Government'' award.\n       To make it sound correct, we divide the debt in two: The \n     public debt and the private debt. Of course, our Government \n     is public, and the law treats the debt as public without \n     separation. The separation allows Washington politicians to \n     say: We have paid down the public debt and have a surplus. \n     There is no mention, of course, that the Government debt is \n     increased by the same amount that the public debt is \n     decreased. It is like paying off your MasterCard with your \n     Visa card and saying you do not owe anything. Dr. Dan \n     Crippen, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \n     describes this as ``taking from one pocket and putting it in \n     the other.''\n       For years we have been using the trust funds to report a \n     unified budget and a unified deficit. This has led people to \n     believe the Government was reporting net figures. It sounded \n     authentic. But as the unified deficit appeared less and less, \n     the national debt continued to increase. While the unified \n     deficit in 1997 was $21.9 billion, the actual deficit was \n     $187.8 billion. In 1998 the unified budget reported a surplus \n     of $70 billion, but actually there was a deficit of $109 \n     billion. In 1999 the ``unified surplus'' was $124 billion, \n     but the actual deficit was $127.8 billion.\n       Now comes the Presidential campaign. Social Security is a \n     hot topic. Both parties are shouting: Save Social Security. \n     Social Security lockbox. The economy is humming, booming. \n     With high employment, the Social Security revenues have \n     increased. It appears that, separate from Social Security, \n     there will be enough trust fund money to compute a surplus. \n     We have reached the millennium--Utopia--enough money to \n     report a surplus without spending Social Security.\n       Washington jargon now changes. Instead of a ``unified \n     budget,'' the Government now reports an ``on-budget'' and an \n     ``off-budget.'' This is so we can all call it an on-budget \n     surplus, meaning without Social Security. But to call it an \n     on-budget surplus, the Government spends $96 billion from the \n     other trust funds.\n       We ended last year with a deficit of $128 billion--not a \n     surplus. The President's budget just submitted shows an \n     actual deficit each year for the next 5 years. Instead of \n     paying down the debt, the President shows, on page 420 of his \n     budget, the debt increasing from the year 2000 to the year \n     2013--$5.686 trillion to $6.815 trillion, an increase of \n     $1.129 trillion.\n       They are all talking about paying off the debt by 2013, and \n     the actual document they submit shows the debt increasing \n     each year, and over that period an increase of over $1 \n     trillion.\n       Each year, Congress spends more than the President's \n     budgets. There is no chance of a surplus with both sides \n     proposing to reduce revenues with a tax cut. But we have a \n     sweetheart deal: The Republicans will call a deficit a \n     surplus, so they can buy the vote with tax cuts; the \n     Democrats will call the deficit a surplus, so they can buy \n     the vote with increased spending. The worst abuse of campaign \n     finance is using the Federal budget to buy votes.\n       Alan Greenspan could stop this. He could call a deficit a \n     deficit. Instead, appearing before Congress in his \n     confirmation hearing, Greenspan, talking of the Federal \n     budget, stated: ``I would fear very much that these huge \n     surpluses . . .'' and on and on. We are in real trouble when \n     Greenspan calls huge deficits ``huge surpluses.'' Greenspan \n     thinks his sole role is to protect the financial markets. He \n     does not want the U.S. Government coming into the market \n     borrowing billions to pay its deficit, crowding out private \n     capital, and running up interest costs.\n       But Congress' job is to not only protect the financial \n     markets but the overall economy. Our job, as the board of \n     directors for the Federal Government, is to make sure the \n     Government pays its bills. In short, our responsibility is to \n     eliminate waste.\n       The biggest waste of all is to continue to run up the debt \n     with devastating interest costs for nothing. In good times, \n     the least we can do is put this Government on a pay-as-you-go \n     basis. Greenspan's limp admonition to ``pay down the debt'' \n     is just to cover his backside. He knows better. He should \n     issue a clarion call to stop increasing the debt. While he is \n     raising interest rates to cool the economy, he should \n     categorically oppose tax cuts to stimulate it.\n       Our only hope is the free press. In the earliest days, \n     Thomas Jefferson observed, given a choice between a free \n     government and a free press, he would choose the latter. \n     Jefferson believed strongly that with the press reporting the \n     truth to the American people, the Government would stay free.\n       Our problem is that the press and media have joined the \n     conspiracy to defraud. They complain lamely that the Federal \n     budget process is too complicated, so they report \n     ``surplus.'' Complicated it is. But as to being a deficit or \n     a surplus is clear cut; it is not complicated at all. All you \n     need to do is go to the Department of the Treasury's report \n     on public debt. They report the growth in the national debt \n     every day, every minute, on the Internet at \n     ``www.publicdebt.treas.gov.''\n       In fact, there is a big illuminated billboard on Sixth \n     Avenue in New York that reports the increase in the debt by \n     the minute. At present, it shows that we are increasing the \n     debt every minute by $894,000. Think of that--$894,000 a \n     minute. Of course, increase the debt, and interest costs \n     rise. Already, interest costs exceed the defense budget. \n     Interest costs, like taxes, must be paid. Worse, while \n     regular taxes support defense, and other programs, interest \n     taxes support waste. Running a deficit of over $100 billion \n     today, any tax cut amounts to an interest tax increase--an \n     increase in waste.\n       If the American people realized what was going on, they \n     would run us all out of town.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point. Surplus, surplus, \neverywhere man cries surplus--paraphrasing Patrick Henry. But there is \nno surplus.\n  I know not, of course, what others may say, but as for me, I want to \npay down the debt rather than engage in this shabby charade. As a \nresult, the only way to do that and pay down the debt is stop this \nsweetheart deal of giving a little on spending increases and giving a \nlittle again, of course, on tax cuts. We do not have a surplus to \ndivide. That is the point of my particular amendment.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Colorado giving me these \nfew moments, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7002-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7002-S7004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ELIMINATING THE MARRIAGE PENALTY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to support \neliminating the marriage penalty. I think it is timely that we have \nsome votes scheduled this evening, I understand about 6:15 p.m. By \neliminating the marriage penalty, we eliminate one of the most \negregious examples of unfairness and complexity in the Tax Code to \ndate. Another example of that would be the death tax or the inheritance \ntax. We dealt with that issue last week. I am extremely excited that it \nhas passed the House, passed the Senate, and is now going on to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Both these taxes are prominent concerns of my constituents, at a time \nwhen the tax burden is at record high levels in this country. When we \nare talking about eliminating the death tax, we are talking about the \nfamily business and what happens to a family business after an \nunexpected death without any estate planning, and how much the \nGovernment takes of that estate, forcing the sale. Many times it is a \nfarm or a ranch that has been in the family for many, many generations.\n  When we talk about the marriage penalty--we are eliminating that \nunfair burden--we are talking about the family. We are talking about \nreducing the tax burden. We are talking about fairness and Tax Code \nsimplification.\n  Just a brief description needs to be made of the marriage penalty. \nThe marriage penalty exists when a married couple, filing a joint tax \nreturn, pays higher taxes than if the same couple were not married and \nwere filing as individuals. The penalty varies, depending on the tax \nbracket in which the couple may find themselves. The example that has \nbeen used before is based on an assumption that both spouses are each \nholding down separate jobs, each earning about $30,000, in 1999. It is \ndetermined they would pay about $7,655 in Federal income taxes. If \nthese two individuals were not married and both earned the same amount \nof money, and had each filed a single tax return, they would pay only \n$6,892 in combined tax liability. There is a $763 difference in tax \nliability. This is what we refer to when we talk about the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all \nmarried couples--it figures out to about 22 million--suffered from the \nmarriage tax penalty last year. The average penalty paid by these \ncouples was around $1,500. In the previous example, the marriage \npenalty was the result of a higher combined standard deduction for two \nworkers filing as singles than for married couples, and the income tax \nbracket thresholds for married couples are less than twice the \nthreshold for single taxpayers. We are trying to eliminate this \nproblem.\n  The best illustration of the real tax burden faced by families is to \ncompare today's tax burden of an average family with the tax burden of \na family with average income of four decades ago. The total tax burden \nfor the family today is 39 percent of its income. That is up from 18 \npercent in 1955. The Federal payroll taxes and State and local taxes \nhave literally doubled the total tax burden faced by families. As a \nresult, the middle-income family today has 25 percent less disposable \nincome than a similar family in 1955.\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\n  The bill we have been working on in the Senate, and which many of us \nsupport, addresses the standard deduction problem I alluded to, and it \nincreases the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to \ntwice the standard deduction for single taxpayers. According to the \nSubcommittee on Taxation, this provision provides tax relief to \napproximately 25 million couples filing joint returns. Hopefully, it \ncan be made effective after December 31, 2000. That is what we are \ntalking about in this particular marriage penalty relief bill.\n  It also raises the tax brackets. The bill expands, over a 6-year \nperiod--this is not happening all at once, it is gradually happening \nover a 6-year period--the 15-percent and 28-percent income tax brackets \nfor a married couple filing a joint return to twice the size of the \ncorresponding brackets for an individual filing a single return. This \nis a phase-in provision, ultimately providing relief to 21 million \nmarried couples, including 3 million senior citizens.\n\n  We also try to address the earned-income credit. This bill increases \nthe beginning and the end of the phase out of the earned-income credit \nfor couples filing a joint return. Currently, for a couple with two or \nmore children, the earned-income credit begins phasing out at $12,690 \nand is eliminated for couples earning more than $31,152. Under this \nbill, the new range would be $2,500 higher. The maximum increase in the \nearned-income tax credit in this provision for an eligible couple is \n$526. As you recall, the earned-income tax credit was put in place to \ntry to help low-income individuals so they would be encouraged to go \nout and get a job and to stay off welfare. Also, there is a provision \npreserving the family tax credits.\n  The bill permanently extends the current temporary exemption from the \nindividual alternative minimum tax for family-related tax credits. This \nis so that, once you grant tax deductions and credits, the alternative \nminimum tax doesn't come in and take that all away.\n  One of the complaints I hear from my constituents is it seems as if \nCongress has been working on tax cuts, they pass tax cuts, they get \nsigned by the President, but we don't seem to feel it when we are \npaying our taxes on April 15. One of the reasons that you do not feel \nit is because, in some cases, the alternative minimum tax kicks in, it \ntakes effect, and that means the previous tax cuts that were applied to \na particular taxpayer did not take effect because of the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Members of the Democratic Party have thwarted passage of any kind of \nrelief for marriage, as far as the Tax Code is concerned, since 1995. \nIn 1995, we had the marriage tax penalty bill passed by the Congress, \nsent to the President, a Democratic President. He vetoed it. In 1999, \nwe sent a bill to the Democratic President and he vetoed it. Earlier \nthis year, in April, there was a Democratic filibuster that prevented a \nmarriage penalty bill from moving forward. We need to pass and the \nPresident needs to sign a marriage tax penalty provision to give relief \nto married couples.\n  This year I have held town meetings in all 63 of Colorado's counties. \nAt those meetings I heard from many of my constituents about how \nstrongly they feel about tax relief. In Colorado, over 400,000 couples \nincur an additional tax burden simply because they are married.\n  I have some numbers here, numbers from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I find them very disturbing. Almost half of all married \ncouples, the 22 million couples I mentioned earlier, suffered from the \nmarriage penalty provisions last year.\n  Again, as in the rest of the country, many of these couples on \naverage have suffered a $1,500 penalty where, if they had not been \nmarried, they would not have had to pay this amount.\n  Cumulatively, the marriage tax penalty increases the taxes on \naffected couples throughout the United States by about $32 billion per \nyear. That is money that families could use toward their own needs, \nrather than Washington trying to set the priorities for American \nfamilies.\n  This penalty is not a tax on the rich. The marriage tax penalty \nexists because of multiple tax brackets and the fact that the standard \ndeductions for married couples are not twice those given to single \npeople. This tax can be incurred by folks in every tax bracket. In \nfact, families with two wage earners are the hardest hit by the \nmarriage penalty. There are more and more of these families in today's \nworkforce. Many of these folks are in the lower to middle class--people \nworking hard to provide for their children. Taxing these folks for \nbeing married is plain wrong.\n  Another one of the groups implicitly taxed under the marriage penalty \nis the working poor. The earned-income tax credit is an effective tool \nin helping these low-income workers, but the EITC is phased out more \nquickly for married couples than for individuals. So the families incur \na greater tax burden simply for being married.\n  Some colleagues of mine call for more Government spending for \neducation, health care, and housing. I believe if we simply allow the \nAmerican family to keep more of their money, we permit them to better \nafford the things they need.\n  In this time of a historic budget surplus, we still have nearly \nrecord high taxation. Hard-working American families deserve to keep \nsome of this money. It is theirs in the first place, and I see it as \nthe responsibility of Congress to return some of this money to the \npeople.\n  To permit the marriage tax penalty to continue is wrong. Allowing \nAmerican families to keep this money is the right thing to do, and I \nbelieve it is time to do away with the marriage tax penalty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. This much-needed bill \nhas had a long and difficult journey in getting to this point where we \ncan pass it in the Senate. Passage will occur today; and, as we did in \n1999, the Congress will send legislation to help married couples being \nhurt by marriage tax penalties to the President.\n  I congratulate my colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, for his very effective leadership on this issue. I \nrealize that this matter has not been an easy one for Chairman Roth \nthis year, because he has been unfairly criticized by our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle for taking the approach on marriage tax \npenalty relief that is reflected in this bill. Let me explain.\n  The Senate last year, led by Chairman Roth, passed a marriage penalty \nrelief provision in the Taxpayer Refund Act, which used a different \nsolution to the marriage penalty problem than the one included in the \nbill before us today. Last year's bill would have solved the marriage \npenalty problem by allowing married couples the option of filing as \nsingle taxpayers on a combined joint return. I supported that bill as \ndid a majority of our colleagues. It was a good approach to solving a \nmajor tax problem for American families.\n  Last year's bill was effective in relieving the marriage penalty. \nHowever, it left untouched another glaring family tax problem that I \nwill call the single-earner penalty. I would like to illustrate this \nwith a hypothetical example of three Utah families.\n  Let's suppose we have three families, all neighbors living on the \nsame street in Ogden, UT. These families are nearly identical, in that \nthey each have three children and household incomes of $80,000 per \nyear. The only differences in these three families are in the marital \nstatus of the parents and in who earns the income. In the first family, \nthe Allen family, the parents are married and both work outside the \nhome and earn $40,000 each for a total of $80,000. The second family, \nthe Brown family, are also married but only the husband works outside \nthe home, earning $80,000 per year. The third family, the Campbell-\nClark family, are unmarried parents and each of them earns $40,000 per \nyear for a total of $80,000.\n  As you can see from this chart, under current law, the Allen and the \nBrown families each pay about $9,200 in income tax each year. The \nCampbell-Clark family, however, because they can file as single \ntaxpayers, pay only a combined $7,900. Because the Allens each earn \none-half the family income, if they were to divorce and file as \nsingles, they could reduce their combined\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\ntax bill down to $7,900, the same as the Campbell-Clarks. Therefore, \nthe Allens suffer a marriage penalty of about $1,300 each year.\n  The marriage penalty relief provision included in last year's tax \nbill would have eliminated this marriage penalty and reduced the tax \nbill of the Allen family down to the same level paid by the Campbell-\nClarks. However, by doing so it would have left behind the Brown \nfamily, who would still be paying income taxes of $9,200 per year.\n\n  This is not fair. We must not, in the name of fairness, fix the \nmarriage tax problems of one category of families, but not another \ncategory. It is true that the Browns do not suffer a marriage penalty, \nbut why should they pay higher taxes simply because their family income \nis earned by one spouse and not two?\n  There are approximately 210,000 couples in my home state of Utah, \nwho, like the Allens, suffer a marriage penalty. However, there are \nalso about 108,000 couples in Utah who are like the Browns, and would \nbe left behind by marriage tax relief like we passed in 1999.\n  This is why this year's marriage penalty bill is superior to last \nyear's. The bill before us today lowers the tax burden of both the \nAllen family and the Brown family. It alleviates the marriage penalty \nand the one-earner penalty. It does not leave any family behind.\n  In essence, the Internal Revenue Code results in marriage tax \npenalties and bonuses because it pursues three conflicting ideals or \nprinciples--marriage neutrality, equal treatment of married couples \nwith the same household income, and progressive taxation.\n  The ideal of marriage neutrality states that a couple's tax liability \nshould not be determined based on their marital status. In other words, \nthere should not be a tax incentive either to marry, to remain single, \nor to divorce. Under our example, current law does penalize the Allen \nfamily, because they would pay about $1,300 per year less if they were \nto divorce and live together. That is ridiculous. We want to encourage \npeople to live together in marriage.\n  The equally important principle of equal treatment holds that married \ncouples with equal incomes should pay the same amount in taxes without \nregard to how much each spouse contributes to the couple's income. \nUnder this principle, the Allens and the Browns should pay the same tax \nsince they are both married with identical family incomes. Currently, \nthey do pay the same, but this principle would be violated if we did \nnot also lower the Browns' tax while fixing the Allens' marriage \npenalty.\n  Progressive taxation is the principle that those with higher incomes \nshould pay a higher percentage of their incomes in taxes than is \nrequired of those with lower incomes.\n  It is mathematically impossible for the Tax Code to achieve all three \nof these tax policy ideals simultaneously.\n\n  One of the three objectives must be sacrificed. If we continue to \ninsist on a progressive tax system, we cannot solve both the marriage \npenalty and the one-earner penalty. Simply put, last year's marriage \npenalty relief provision did solve the marriage penalty, but it \nviolated the one-earner penalty. The bill before us today does not \ntotally solve the marriage penalty, but it greatly alleviates it for \nmost families. And, it does not create a one-earner penalty. All in \nall, it represents the fairest approach for the most families in our \ncountry.\n  As long as we have a progressive tax system, we will never achieve \ntotal family tax fairness. Therefore, no marriage tax penalty bill will \nbe perfect. While making tremendous progress toward marriage penalty \nrelief for most families, the bill before us leaves some serious \nmarriage penalties in place.\n  For example, the current-law student loan interest deduction \nprovision penalizes married couples struggling to pay off student \nloans. In February, the Senate passed an amendment to the education tax \nbill that Senator Mack and I offered that would have eliminated this \nproblem. I had hoped to add that provision to this bill, but it would \nnot be germane under the reconciliation rules. I hope we can take care \nof that problem in another tax bill later this year.\n  President Clinton has given strong indications he will veto this bill \nbecause it gives tax relief to families who do not suffer from marriage \npenalties. This is a shortsighted point of view that ignores the \nstructure of our tax system and the needs of American families.\n  In fact, it kind of makes me wonder whether President Clinton's real \nconcern is the idea of cutting taxes. He has made no secret of his \nopposition to tax cuts. He has fought us every step of the way in our \nefforts to return a portion of the budget surplus to those hard-working \nAmericans who produced it.\n  But, I will be very sorry if a Presidential veto denies American \nfamilies even this tax cut which is not being made for its own sake, \nbut rather to correct a longstanding inequity in the Tax Code.\n  I implore the President to reconsider that all American families need \nfair and substantial tax relief--those where both spouses work outside \nthe home as well as those where one parent stays home. I hope he will \nsign this bill into law.\n  And, allow me to say just a word about parents who forego outside \nincome to remain at home. Everyone in this body knows that I believe we \nmust have adequate child care for those families who need it. I have \nworked with my Republican colleagues and my Democratic colleagues \nacross the aisle on child care legislation. But, I cannot \nsay emphatically enough that the best child care is still provided by a \nparent. I have yet to hear a single Senator disagree with that. Yet, \nour Tax Code penalizes a family in which one parent makes this choice \nto stay at home with their children.\n\n  I am glad that my wife stayed home with our children. She did work in \nthe early years of our marriage as a grade school teacher, but she \nstayed home virtually all of the time our children were growing up, and \nI think it shows.\n  It is high time we fix this problem. It is high time we correct the \nmarriage penalty for both the Allens and the Browns in Utah, and \nfamilies like them all over the country. Today, we have the means to do \nit. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: There are no \nmore excuses.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Roth for his insight and leadership on this \nimportant issue, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage of \nthis bill. I urge President Clinton to sign it.\n  One last thing, and that is, when you have a $4.3 trillion surplus in \nthe budget, you know darn well somebody is being taxed too much. Why \ncan't we at least solve these inequities that are literally calling out \nto us for a solution? Why can't we make it clear that being married \nshould not be a disadvantage to couples? Why don't we make it clear \nthat we are going to treat married couples just as well as those who \nlive together and are not married, who don't pay as much in taxes \ntoday?\n  These three families illustrate this as well as I think we can \nillustrate it. Why should the Allen family and the Brown family pay \n$9,222, while the Campbell-Clark family, just because they live \ntogether--each of them single, and each of them earning $40,000--why \nshould they get a tax bill of $1,300 less than the other two families?\n  I urge the President to sign this bill. I think it is the right thing \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, certainly, Kay Bailey Hutchison, our \ncolleague from Texas, has led us on the issue of the marriage penalty \ntax. I think probably she has sensitized all of us to it as only a \nwoman can. I mean that in the sense of understanding the true balance \nthat ought to be in this Tax Code that isn't in the Tax Code. She has\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\nbeen persistent with the Congress and with this Senate to assure that \nwe develop a sense of equity and balance in the Tax Code that our \nmarriage penalty tax relief legislation will offer.\n  Who pays the marriage penalty? In our country, about 22 million \nmarried couples do. They are not wealthy. They are modest- and middle-\nincome families. In my State of Idaho, that is 129,710 families.\n  To really bring this home, if, from the time a couple marries, they \nwere to put away, with interest, the difference in the disparity of \ntaxes between $1,000 and $1,400 per year, on the average, for their \nfirst child, they could afford to pay 3 years of his or her education \nat a State institution in my State of Idaho. So it is significant. It \nis important. There is no question it would help, and can help, the \nAmerican family.\n  The usual suspects out there who are opposed to this, I think, are \nusing the most tired and sad arguments against tax relief. They simply \nare arguing from a position of the wrong facts. We have heard them \nwhining about tax cuts and saying the tax cuts are for the rich and \nsomehow you ought not give the rich any opportunity. Of course, in this \ninstance they have simply missed the mark, and they know it. They know \nthey are on the wrong side of this issue.\n  Tax relief, in the area of the marriage penalty tax, helps working \nfamilies. It ends discrimination against married couples. It reduces \nthe Tax Code's antifamily bias that no tax code should have in it. We \nhave always said that the very foundation of our culture and our \ncountry is the family, and yet we take advantage of that union in the \nTax Code by causing them to pay more in taxes.\n  Low- and middle-income married couples are the ones who truly are \nhurt by this penalty. On average, a married couple hit by the marriage \npenalty will pay about $1,400 more a year in taxes than two single \npersons at the same combined income. That is where the penalty rests.\n  In total, the marriage penalty overcharges couples in this country \n$32 billion a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office--that \nis right, $32 billion a year--that could stay out there with those \nyoung couples.\n  I use the example in my State of Idaho that if they simply put it in \na bank, with interest, by the time their first child is old enough to \ngo to college, they can afford his first or her first 3 years at a \nState institution in my State.\n  I think those who oppose marriage tax penalty relief oppose, frankly, \nall tax relief. The more they can get to spend on Government programs \nand Government solutions--and go home to their constituents and talk \nabout what wonderful things Government is doing for them--somehow they \nthink that most of our citizens are either undertaxed, and not giving \nenough to Government for all those wonderful solutions to their \nproblems, or the current Tax Code is fair.\n  They are not worried about a Tax Code that charges a family an extra \n$1,400 or more, when a family certainly needs that additional income as \nthey become a family unit. They are opposed to all tax relief. If you \npay taxes, somehow, in this argument, you are rich; and the rich do not \nneed the relief.\n  How many times have we heard that? At least I have heard it in the \ngood number of years I have been in the Senate. Every time we talk \nabout tax relief, somebody over there on the other side of the aisle \nsays: Gee, those darn Republicans want to give that money back to the \nrich, and the rich don't need tax relief.\n  Low- and middle-income families do need tax relief. So the opposition \non the other side always ponies up some kind of what I call tax-relief \n``lite'' amendments to offer, so they can show some degree of \ncompassion. Yet at the same time they offer nothing except a new \nGovernment program.\n\n  Let me break it down into the three most significant ways that the \nTax Code extracts the marriage penalty for us to understand.\n  First of all, it is discrimination in the standard deduction area. \nAbout two-thirds of the taxpayers take the standard deduction. For a \nmarried couple, the standard deduction this year is $7,200. For two \nsingle taxpayers with the same combined income, it is $8,600. This is \nthe first $392 of the marriage penalty. Lower and middle-income \ntaxpayers are more likely to take the standard deduction than upper-\nincome persons. Many middle-income families who itemize are still hurt \nby standard deduction discrimination because the amount of the standard \ndeduction determines whether they itemize. In other words, one element \ntriggers the other element in our Tax Code.\n  The Senate bill would provide relief to 25 million couples by making \nthe standard deduction for married couples filing jointly equal to the \nstandard deduction for two singles with the same combined income. That \nis a little complicated, but it is easy to understand that for those \nwho take the standard deduction--and those tend to be the lower and \nmiddle-income families--the benefit is immediate and, as we have said, \nis approximately $1,400 a year.\n  The second area deals with discrimination in the earned-income tax \ncredit area, the EITC. We are all familiar with the EITC. It is \nsupposed to reward work, ease income tax and other tax burdens, and \nsupplement incomes for low-income working families with children. It is \nastonishing, in a program designed to help lower income families, the \nphaseout schedule for EITC benefits again imposes an antimarriage, \nantifamily penalty. This is the very program Congress designed to help \nlow-income families. Yet when we look inside the code, the way the IRS \nhas interpreted it and administers it, there is an antimarriage, \nantifamily penalty. The Senate bill would begin addressing marriage \npenalty inequity in the EITC by first increasing the maximum credit by \n$526, starting the phaseout range $2,500 higher than it was at an \nincome level just above $15,000.\n  The third area of discrimination is in the tax brackets. For the \naverage couple paying a marriage penalty, bracket discrimination \ncharges them another $1,000. Bracket discrimination usually takes the \nlower income earned by one spouse, which would be taxed in the 15-\npercent bracket if he or she were single, and taxes it at the other \nspouse's 28-percent rate. This devalues the spouse and the spouse's \nwork that provides the second income for the family. Of course, in some \ninstances, both spouses are professional and choose to seek their \nprofession in the marketplace. In other marriages, one spouse simply \nwants to supplement the overall family income to broaden the ability of \nthat family to earn, to save, to invest, and to provide for its \nchildren. In this instance, this particular structure of the Tax Code \nactually devalues the value of the income of that spouse who goes into \nthe marketplace to earn additional income for the family.\n  For folks with modest means, this adds what we could easily call \ninsult to the very injury that the Tax Code levees to the taxpayer. \nTime after time on this floor, we hear how many families are forced to \nearn a second income to make ends meet. Currently, the heavy hand of \nGovernment has the first claim on the second income. For anybody who \nwould choose to vote against this particular provision, shame on them. \nEspecially shame on them if they then turn around and argue that \ncircumstances are so tough out there that every family needs two \nincomes. Let us work today to lessen that burden, to make it less \ntough, to give that family unit greater choices as to whether they both \nwant to work in the marketplace or one would choose to stay home.\n\n  The Senate bill provides help for 21 million couples, including 3 \nmillion senior citizens, by expanding the 15-to-28 percent bracket for \none couple to a range equal to that for two singles. In addition, this \nbill preserves the full effect of the family tax credits enacted in the \n1997 Taxpayers Relief Act. We now find that particular provision taking \neffect. More and more middle-income families are slipping into the \nalternative minimum tax or the AMT. In fact, even some EITC families \nare now being affected by this. The AMT is already a dubious tax. It \nrequires thousands of taxpayers to figure their returns according to \ntwo different tax systems. I don't think anyone really intended the AMT \nto apply and wipe out the family tax credits we enacted in 1997, \nincluding the $500-per-child tax credit, the HOPE education credit, the \nlifetime earnings credit, and the ongoing dependency care credit. It is \ntime to cut back on the antifamily AMT, and that is exactly what this \nprovision will do.\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\n  In conclusion, we want a Government that is truly profamily. \nCertainly all of us--and in a sincere way--want to make sure our laws \nare profamily. Yet those who will vote against the marriage tax penalty \nare talking about two different systems. They are being very \ninconsistent with honesty and integrity in debating this kind of an \nissue. You cannot talk profamily on one side of the issue and turn \naround and vote against this provision that we will be voting on on the \nfloor this evening.\n  Our Tax Code says, unless we change it tonight, don't get married. \nAnd if you do, you are going to pay higher taxes. We say it is time we \ncreate equity in this equation. Our Tax Code says you will pay a \npenalty if both spouses work and you will be the most heavily taxed if \nyour incomes are about equal. We say the best antipoverty program is a \nfamily and a job in America, or two jobs in America taxable at a lower \nrate, leaving more money inside the family unit to provide for that \nfamily and those portions of the American dream they seek to secure. We \nencourage our citizens to dream a better dream, of a fairer and freer \nsociety. Our Tax Code has a great deal to say about the size and the \nscope of their dreams.\n  I hope we will vote tonight to strike a blow for a profamily, pro-\nAmerican, American-dream approach, not have the Tax Code constantly \nconfusing the message and sending a negative signal. We are going to \npass it, I do believe, and seize the opportunity.\n  In closing, I say to the President: Come on. Quit playing the \npolitical games you are playing right now. You have to have this new \nspending program and this new spending program with a multitrillion-\ndollar surplus. Give the highest taxed generation in history just a \nlittle break. When this bill gets to your desk, sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nthat I submitted on Friday to the marriage penalty bill, which the \nSenate will take up and vote on later today. My amendment, which is \ncosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Graham and Bryan, follows up on a \nsimilar proposal I offered in April to the Senate budget resolution \nthat would have required Congress to enact a new Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit before considering any massive tax cuts. While a \nprocedural hurdle prevented that amendment from passing, fifty-one \nsenators voted to waive a budget point of order, indicating they \nfavored it, and sending the American people a strong signal that a \nmajority of the U.S. Senate thought we should put the needs of our \nnation's seniors before excessive tax cuts.\n  The majority, however, has moved in the opposite direction since \nthen. This past Friday, we passed a large tax bill that would phase out \nthe tax on the estates of those seniors who die, but did nothing to \nprovide needed prescription drugs that can preserve the lives of those \nseniors who are living. Because I had cosponsored earlier legislation \nto ease the estate tax burden in order to preserve family farms and \nsmall businesses, I voted for this bill. Even though all of our \nDemocratic amendments were defeated--and look forward to crafting more \nequitable legislation to address these same concerns after the \nPresident vetoes the bill we passed Friday.\n  The bill before the Senate now, however, is very different. Under the \nguise of eliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' the majority has brought \na bill to the floor that would devote over half of its benefits to \npeople who either aren't married, or who are actually receiving right \nnow a tax benefit, or ``bonus,'' for being married. As I have stated \npreviously, Mr. President, this takes a lot of chutzpah.\n  Mr. President, I believe we ought to eliminate the marriage penalty \nfor those who actually suffer the marriage penalty and need the relief \nmost. With all the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle about \neliminating the marriage penalty, one might think that they'd share my \nview, and want to pass a bill that would actually focus on the penalty.\n  But a closer examination of the Republican bill reveals that it isn't \nquite what it's described to be. Mr. President, there are in fact 65 \nprovisions in the current tax code that contain a marriage penalty, \nincluding Social Security. The bill reported from the Finance Committee \non a straight party-line vote takes care of one marriage penalty \nprovision completely and two others partially, and leaves the other 62 \nmarriage penalties untouched. The Democratic bill addresses all 65 \nprovisions, and takes care of the entire penalty for almost everyone.\n  Mr. President, it's time that we set our priorities straight. We \nought not to be devoting billions of dollars of the surplus to \nindividuals who currently suffer no marriage penalty whatever when \nwe've done nothing to help those that suffer from the ``senior \ncitizens' drug penalty''--the high prices our nation's seniors are \nforced to pay for prescription drugs.\n  The amendment that I've offered would force Congress to address these \npriorities. It simply says that the tax bill before the Senate today \nwon't take effect until Congress has also fulfilled its responsibility \nto enact a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit. My amendment \nwon't prevent Congress from enacting marriage penalty relief this year, \nnor will it keep a single married couple from enjoying the tax benefits \nin this bill. What it will do is ensure that we don't backtrack from \nthe Senate's vote to enact a prescription drug benefit before we do \nmajor tax cuts.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that this isn't just rhetoric. The \nproblems faced by our nation's seniors in affording prescription drugs \nare immediate and real. I'd like to remind the Senate of a story I \nheard from a physician in my state recently about a patient who was \nsplitting her doses of Tamoxifin--a breast cancer drug--with two of her \nfriends who also had breast cancer, but couldn't afford the medication. \nAs a result, all three women had inadequate doses of the medication.\n  Or consider the story of a disabled father of three from Pennington \nGap, Virginia, who broke his neck several years ago, and went from \nmaking $50,000 a year to $800 a month in disability benefits. While he \nqualifies for Medicare, he's forced to choose each month between \nspending nearly half of his disability benefit on prescription drugs, \nor helping out his family, because Medicare offers no coverage for his \nmedications.\n  These Virginians are not alone in their troubles. The average \nMedicare beneficiary will spend $1100 on prescription drugs this year. \nMost of them won't have adequate prescription drug coverage to help \nthem cover these crushing costs. And the numbers of those that do have \ncoverage are dropping rapidly.\n  Despite the suggestions of some of my colleagues, this problem isn't \nlimited solely to the poor. One in four Medicare beneficiaries with a \nhigh income--defined as $45,000 a year for a couple--has no coverage \nfor prescription drugs. And while some seniors do have coverage, nearly \nhalf of them lack coverage for the entire year, making them extremely \nvulnerable to catastrophic drug costs.\n  Complicating this matter for the elderly is the ``senior citizens' \ndrug penalty'' that seniors without drug coverage are forced to pay. \nMost working Americans who are insured through the private sector pay \nless than the full retail price for prescription drugs. This is because \ninsurers generally contract with private sector entities that negotiate \nbetter prices for drugs, and pass on the power of group purchasing to \ntheir customers.\n  Seniors lack this option, however, and must still pay full price for \ntheir drugs. One recent study showed that seniors without drug coverage \ntypically pay 15 percent more than people\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\nwith coverage. And the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries without \ndrug coverage who report not being able to afford a needed drug is \nabout 5 times higher than those with coverage.\n  This ``senior citizens' drug penalty,'' in my view, is \nunconscionable. Senior citizens are more reliant on drugs, and have \nhigher drug costs, than any other segment of the population. They \ndeserve to have the same bargaining power that benefits other \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, in April, the other side spoke against my budget \namendment, claiming that there was already adequate language in the \nRepublican budget resolution to ensure that we pass a prescription drug \nbenefit this year. At the time, they pointed to the $40 billion reserve \nfund which was included in the budget resolution that the Committee had \nreported, arguing that this would provide ample money to enact a \nprescription drug benefit and offer tax relief.\n  Republicans asked, in essence, that we trust them that the Senate \nwon't put tax cuts before our nation's seniors. Let me say that I do \ntrust my good friends on the other side of the aisle. But to borrow a \nline from Ronald Reagan, I believe we should trust--but verify. That \nrequires deeds as well as words.\n  Mr. President, our nation's seniors deserve better than this. In \nApril, at least fifty-one senators felt the same way. I urge every one \nof them, as well as senators who opposed my amendment then because they \nthought the $40 billion reserve fund would guarantee a prescription \ndrug benefit, to support my amendment now. With its passage, we'll be \nable to eliminate both the true ``marriage penalty'' and the ``senior \ncitizens' drug penalty.''\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Any of the amendments reserved on the Interior bill will be \nvoted on, if, in fact, the vote is necessary, tomorrow morning.\n  I list 12 amendments that were reserved for debate during this period \nof time. I am informed by staff that we have settled 4 of them. That \nleaves eight amendments: two by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman; one by the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer; one by the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan; one by the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman; one by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles; one by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed; one by the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  Curiously enough, most of these Senators who have said they will be \nhere from between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock p.m., which takes a \nconsiderable portion of the debate time, are away.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, as we debate this bill to provide \nfunding for the Department of the Interior in the next fiscal year, I \nwould like to discuss an issue that is of increasing concern to me: our \nunderinvestment in our national parks.\n  There are 379 national parks in the United States and U.S. \nterritories, covering over 80 million acres. These parks provide \nAmericans with an opportunity to enjoy activities such as hiking, \ncamping, white water rafting, or horseback riding in some of the most \nbeautiful sites in the world. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nin my home State of Tennessee is often referred to as the crown jewel \nof the national park system, and for good reason.\n  But one can't help but be concerned about what is happening in our \nparks today. I have seen first hand the problems associated with air \npollution, traffic congestion, and invasive species in our parks. Folks \ncome to the Smokies to escape the big city and breathe the clean \nmountain air. Unfortunately, there are too many days now when the air \nquality in the Smokies is worse than in major cities. Already this \nyear, the park has recorded 13 days with unhealthy ozone levels. Who \nwould believe that visiting a national park could be hazardous to your \nhealth?\n  Air pollution is also diminishing the experience of visitors in the \npark. People visit the Smokies for the magnificent mountain vistas. \nUnfortunately, the pollution reduces their visibility not only by \naffecting how far they can see from a scenic overlook, but also how \nwell they can see. Ground level ozone washes out the bright colors of \nthe leaves in the fall and the flowers in the spring. These air quality \nproblems have landed the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the \nlist of 10 most endangered national parks compiled by the National \nParks and Conservation Association.\n  Another major threat facing many of our national parks, including the \nSmokies, is damage from invasive species. Organisms that are not native \nto parks are finding their way in and are killing wildlife. Virtually \nall of the frasier firs on top of Klingman's Dome in the Smokies are \ndead. At first glance, it would appear that they were killed by fire, \nbut that is not the case. These trees were killed by the balsam woolly \nadelgid which is not native to the Smokies and has no natural predator \nthere.\n  These and similar problems afflict our entire national park system. \nThat is why I'm pleased that the appropriations bill before us today \nrecognizes these serious threats by providing $11 million for the \nNational Park Service's Natural Resource Challenge. This money will \nhelp fund air and water quality studies in our parks. It will also fund \nefforts to address the problems caused by non-native invasive\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\nspecies. I thank the Senators from Washington and West Virginia for \ntheir attention to these needs. I especially thank Senator Gorton for \nhis leadership as chairman of this very important subcommittee.\n  I am also growing increasingly concerned that our national parks are \nshowing the wear and tear of neglect. Each year our parks are host to \nmore and more visitors. In 1998, almost 300 million people visited our \nnational parks. Ten million of those visitors went to the Smokies, \nmaking it the most visited national park in the country. That is more \nvisitors than the Grand Canyon and Yosemite combined--which rank second \nand third in terms of park visitation.\n  We in Tennessee and North Carolina welcome these visitors to our \nbeautiful mountains. National parks are here to be used and enjoyed. \nBut our parks are laboring under their popularity. One might say our \nparks are being loved to death. We must face up to the stresses to \ninfrastructure that result from increased visitation. More visitors \ncause more wear and tear on the trails, campgrounds, and roads. Growing \nvisitation also requires higher staffing levels in the parks since more \nvisitors mean more stranded hikers that need to be rescued, more \ncomfort stations that need to be cleaned, and more trash that needs to \nbe picked up.\n  Unfortuantely, park budgets have not kept pace with increases in \nvisitation. The National Park Service estimates that there is currently \na $4.3 million maintenance backlog. Park Service staff are struggling \nto do more with fewer resources.\n  Fortunately, they have been able to rely on a number of organizations \nfor help such as friends groups, the National Park Foundation and other \ncooperating associations. These organizations raise money to fund \nmaintenance and educational projects within the parks.\n  I am proud that the Friends of the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark is held up as the model friends group for the country. Over the \nlast 7 years, the Friends of the Smokies has raised $6 million--$1.5 \nmillion last year alone. This money has come from donation boxes in the \npark, license plate sales, telethons and direct contributions. And, it \nis used for a variety of projects. For example, the Friends just \nproduced a new orientation film to welcome park visitors. The Friends \nfunded the restoration of the historic Mount Cammerer Fire Tower. And, \nthe Friends help organize and manage volunteer projects in the park. \nWhen a team of volunteers goes out to work on a trail, it's the Friends \nof the Smokies that buys the materials needed to do the job. The hard \nwork and generosity on the part of the Friends of the Smokies is \ncritical to assisting the Park Service officials maintain our valuable \nnatural resource.\n  Just as important as the financial contributions to our national \nparks are the generous donations of time. This year alone, volunteers \nwill donate almost 75,000 hours valued at $1.1 million to run the \nvisitor centers and help maintain trails and campgrounds in the Great \nSmoky Mountains National Park. Because the Smokies was a gift from the \nresidents of Tennessee and North Carolina to the Federal Government, \ncitizens living near the park have a strong sense of ownership. They \nwant to volunteer to take care of their park.\n  Several years ago, Congress also recognized the need to increase \nresources to our national park system, and we passed legislation to \nprovide the Park Service with new sources of funding for maintenance \nprojects. This new law allows national parks to retain most of the \nentrance and other fees they may charge, and use that money for visitor \nservices. Fee revenue can be used to fund maintenance projects or to \npay seasonal employees, but it cannot be used to fund basic operations. \nThis year, Smokies' fees will generate $1.9 million over and above the \npark's $13.2 million annual appropriated budget.\n  Fee revenue, volunteer hours, and donations are critical to keeping \nour parks running, but they are just not enough. Without an adequate \noperations budget and enough permanent full-time staff, the Park \nService lacks the capability to handle the generosity of groups like \nthe Friends of the Smokies.\n  Again, I compliment my colleagues from Washington and West Virginia \nfor recognizing the most pressing needs of our national park system by \nproviding a substantial increase in the Park Service's basic operations \nbudget in this bill. The bill before us includes over $1.4 billion for \nthe National Park Service. That's an increase of more than $80 million \nover FY 2000.\n  But as impressive a job as the managers have done here today, I'm \nsure they would both agree with me when I say that Congress still must \ndo better for our national parks. I believe that the Federal Government \nhas a fundamental responsibility to ensure the protection of these \nnatural resources for the enjoyment of both the current and future \ngenerations. But we are not meeting that responsibility fully. We must \nprovide our park officials with adequate resources to maintain the \ntrails and campgrounds. We must give them better tools to combat \nthreats like air pollution.\n  As Congress debates what to do with the projected budget surplus, I \nthink we should start by determining whether government is meeting its \nfundamental responsibilities now. If we see that we are neglecting \ncertain responsibilities, then we need to make fulfilling those \nobligations a priority.\n  I believe that increasing our investment in our national parks is a \npriority. I intend to work closely with my colleagues in the years to \ncome to ensure that Congress provides the funding necessary to protect \nour precious natural resources for the enjoyment of my grandchildren \nand their grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want \nto tell him how very much I appreciate his statement. In years past, I \noffered amendments when we did not have a budget surplus to increase \nfunding for our park system. I hope next year we can work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to increase significantly the funding for our \nNational Park System.\n  I have not had the good fortune to be in the park to which the \nSenator referred, the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, but I have \nbeen to a number of national parks. For example, the living conditions \nour park rangers have to put up with in our national parks is a \ndisgrace. My colleague should see what park rangers live in at the \nGrand Canyon National Park. They are from World War II. They look like \nicehouses; they are square. It is disgraceful.\n  We only have one national park in Nevada. It is one of the newer \nones, so I really do not have the right to complain as many do, but we \nhave so many things that need to be done there. We do not have a \nvisitors center. Interpretive trails have not been built. There are \nparts of our great National Park System that we have closed as a result \nof dangerous conditions. The Park Service simply does not have the \nresources to keep up.\n  I commend and applaud my friend from Tennessee. He has given a great \nstatement. I look forward to next year. Perhaps we can work together to \ncome up with a funding formula that would be permanent in nature to \ntake care of the $5 billion backlog in our National Park System.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada for \nthose comments. This is something upon which I believe we can all \nagree. Even those who view the role of Government to be a limited one \nmust agree that there are certain basic obligations and functions the \nFederal Government has. Of course, national defense is one of them; \ninfrastructure is one of them. Our national parks are a precious \nresource that we must all protect.\n  They are, as the Senator indicates, being attacked from so many \ndifferent directions right now. We are taking them for granted and \nslowly, but surely, they are falling into disrepair, and they are being \ndamaged environmentally. We in the Smokies have a particular problem \nwith the weather patterns, for example. Not only do we have some old \ncoal-fired plants in the area, but we have a weather pattern that \nbrings the pollution in from other parts of the country that just seems \nto hover over that particular area. We have days where there is more \npollution on top of the Smoky Mountains than there is in downtown New \nYork City. It is an increasing problem. Hopefully, as my colleague \nsuggests, we can\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\njoin together and do even more next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first, I thank our distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader for his graciousness once again in \nproviding me the opportunity to say a couple of words this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7009-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7009-S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the Senate will be voting on two \ncompeting marriage penalty relief proposals. The choice really could \nnot be more clear. I want to talk a little bit about that choice this \nafternoon. The Republican bill has very little to do with the marriage \npenalty.\n  In fact, I was just commenting that if the Republicans were trying to \ntreat an illness, they would be sued for malpractice--given the bill \nthey are proposing this afternoon--malpractice because they are not \ncuring the disease. In fact, in some ways they are causing the disease, \nthis marriage penalty disease, to be even more problematic, more \ndifficult. They are actually creating another disease--a singles \npenalty. We need to be aware of the repercussions of what the \nRepublicans are attempting to do with their legislation this afternoon. \nThe singles penalty is something I will talk a little bit more about.\n  To begin, I don't think there is any doubt that if you asked all 100 \nSenators: should we fix the marriage penalty, the answer would be \nemphatically yes. The question is, How do we fix it, and are we really \nintent on fixing it?\n  Our Republican colleagues only deal with three of the marriage \npenalty provisions incorporated in the law today. If you were going to \ncompletely eliminate the entire marriage penalty, you would have to \ndeal not with 3 but with 65 of the provisions incorporated in the tax \nlaw that have caused the imbalance or the inequity to exist today. The \nRepublicans have only dealt with three. Yet the cost to the Treasury of \ntheir plan--the one we will vote on today--is $248 billion overall.\n  I don't know what it would cost if you were going to try to fix all \n65 under the Republican plan. Republican amendments were filed \naddressing six additional provisions, totaling $81 billion, in the \nFinance Committee. The remaining 56 provisions, untouched in the \nRepublican bill, not addressed at all, have yet to be calculated in \nterms of what the cost might be with regard to the approach our \nRepublican colleagues use.\n  The second chart spells out what that means. If you only deal with 3 \nof the 65 provisions, this is what happens. Take a married couple with \na joint income of $70,000. Under current law, if the couple were single \nand they each paid their share of the tax, their tax total would be \n$8,407, depicted on the chart. Yet because they are kicked into a \nhigher tax bracket when they reach that $70,000 joint income level, \ntheir tax is not $8,407; their tax is $9,532. So the marriage penalty \nis $1,125 under current tax law.\n\n  Here is what the Republicans do. The Republicans will provide, under \ntheir bill, 39-percent relief. That is all you get. Here they are, \nspending $248 billion, and they can't even do it right. They can't even \nfix all 65 provisions. They fix three. So you leave the balance, under \nthe Republican bill, for another day, apparently.\n  We don't believe that ought to be the way to fix the marriage \npenalty. We think you ought to fix the marriage penalty, if you are \nsaying you are going to fix it. We provide 100-percent relief, $1,125 \nin relief for that couple making $70,000 a year. That is what we do. \nThat is why we believe it is important for people to know there is a \nclear choice tonight when we vote on those plans: You can vote for the \n$248 billion Republican plan that fixes 3 or you can vote for the \nDemocratic plan that provides for 100-percent relief and fixes all 65.\n  I think it is very important for us to understand that not only is \nthere a choice in trying to address the marriage penalty, but there is \nalso another problem.\n  We know how doctors try to fix one disease and sometimes create \nanother side effect they had not anticipated because they prescribed \nthe wrong medicine. We have a true illustration of prescription drugs \nas we know it in this country today, with a $248 billion fix when you \ncould do it for a fraction of the cost. Not only that, their \nprescription doesn't cure the disease. Not only does it not cure the \ndisease, it actually creates a new one.\n  I guarantee my colleagues, within the next few years, you will have \nsomebody come to the floor and say: Now we have to fix the singles \npenalty. It is broken. We may need another $248 billion tax plan to fix \nthe singles penalty.\n  This is what happens under the Republican plan. You have a joint \nincome for that couple of $70,000. Current law requires their tax \nliability of $10,274. The Republican plan would provide $8,743, leaving \nthe $443 relief I mentioned a moment ago.\n  Let's take a widow, a widow who is making that $70,000 income--not a \ncouple but a widow. She has a tax liability under current law of \n$14,172. Yet her penalty, a singles penalty, would go from $3,898 under \ncurrent law to $5,429 under the Republican plan.\n  What happens with this tax plan for a single person under certain \ncircumstances--take a widow, a widow who is already probably faced with \nall kinds of serious financial pressures. Her tax burden goes up by \n$1,531, a new singles penalty created--I assume inadvertently--because \nour Republican colleagues are rushing to try to fix a marriage penalty, \nand they can't do it right. That is why this vote this afternoon is so \nimportant.\n  The Democrats will be offering a plan that recognizes another \ninequity in the Republican plan. I have already talked about two: \nFirst, the importance of recognizing that out of the 65 provisions, the \nRepublican plan only deals with 3; and then secondly, how we now have \ncreated--I assume inadvertently--this singles penalty.\n  Look at the third problem with the Republican plan that has caused us \nto want to come to the floor to offer the alternative we will tonight. \nIf you are making $20,000, the amount of tax relief you get under the \nRepublican plan is $567. That is all you get. But if you are making \n$20,000, under the Democratic plan, your tax reduction, the amount of \nrelief, is $2,164. If you are making $30,000 a year, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, which has analyzed this, under the \nRepublican plan you get $800. Under the Democratic plan, you get \n$4,191. Why? Because we fix the marriage penalty. We provide entire \nrelief, all 65 provisions.\n  Look at what happens if you are making $50,000. I don't know what the \nRepublicans have as a problem with those who are making $50,000, but \nthey are sure penalizing them here. You only get $240 under the \nRepublican plan in relief. Why you would want to penalize somebody \nmaking $50,000, I don't know. Under the Democratic plan, you get $1,913 \nin relief.\n  Let us skip all the way over to the other end of the spectrum. This \nprobably tells it best.\n  If you are providing real relief, you are going to go to those people \nwho need the relief the most, those people in the $30,000 to $50,000 \ncategory. Under the Republican plan, if you are making more than \n$200,000, that is when you start kicking in to real money. You get \n$1,335 in relief there. But if you make $50,000 in income, you get \n$240. That is the third reason we are so concerned about this \nRepublican plan.\n  Under the Republican plan, you get $1,335 in relief if you are making \ntons of money. If you are making $50,000, as are most people in the \ncountry--couples--you are going to get $240.\n  We are concerned for those three problems. That is why we are \noffering our alternative tonight. The Democratic marriage penalty \nrelief plan allows married couples to file separately or jointly--\nanother very important aspect: Give them the flexibility. Let them \ndecide what is most helpful to them.\n  That is how we avoid the so-called singles penalty, not the \nRepublican plan. It eliminates all marriage tax penalties for taxpayers \nearning $100,000 or less, 100 percent. It reduces all marriage tax \npenalties for those taxpayers earning up to $150,000 and does not \nexpand the so-called marriage bonus or the singles penalty that we are \nactually creating inadvertently today.\n  I want to show one last chart that probably makes the case as well as \nI can. The marriage penalty bill proposed by the Republican plan deals\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nwith three. The Democratic alternative deals with the standard \ndeduction and the problem we have with the marriage penalty and the \nstandard deduction; earned income tax credits; child tax credits; \nSocial Security benefits; rate brackets; IRA deductions, student loan \ninterest deductions, and the 56 other marriage penalty provisions that \nexacerbate the marriage penalty today. We do them all. The Republican's \ndo three.\n  There is one other nonsubstantive but procedural concern I have, \nwhich I am compelled to bring up. The regular order in the Senate right \nnow is the marriage penalty. We ought to be taking this bill up under \nthe regular order, but we are not doing that. I think everyone here in \nthe Chamber knows why. We are not doing that because the Republicans \ndon't want to vote on tax amendments. That is why we are not doing it. \nThey are using the brick wall they built around their marriage penalty, \nthis impenetrable wall. So this is an up-or-down vote, a take-it-or-\nleave-it vote. You either like it or don't; you either take it or leave \nit. That is the way it is going to be. We are not going to give the \nDemocrats an amendable vehicle. We are going to give them a vehicle \nthey can't amend, a vehicle that will allow the one alternative; and we \nare not going to debate tax policy, even though this goes to the heart \nof tax policy.\n  So for the second time in less than a week we are going to be voting \non a bill that I think deserves to be defeated. We should have defeated \nthe estate tax bill. I will offer to Senator Lott that I am willing to \nsit down today and negotiate with him and the Finance Committee \nDemocrats and Republicans to come up with a bill the President will \nsign. That isn't going to happen with the bill they passed last week. \nThis bill is going to get vetoed, too. This bill will be vetoed, and it \nwill be vetoed for good reason. It doesn't fix the marriage penalty. It \ncosts $248 billion. It helps those at the high end and leaves everyone \nelse in the lurch. It creates a singles penalty. That isn't the way to \nlegislate. That is why we normally have amendments--to try to fix \nproblems that were caused on purpose or inadvertently.\n  I am hopeful the majority will take great care before they pass the \nbill that they are going to be pressing this evening. I hope they will \nwork with us to come up with an alternative that the President will \nsign. We can do things the right way and we can enact them into law and \nprovide meaningful accomplishment and meaningful relief and meaningful \nhelp to victims of the marriage penalty. Or we can simply make more \nstatements about how some in this Senate prefer simply to help those at \nthe very top of the income scale, once again, whether they need it or \nnot. That is our choice. I hope Senators will take great care in making \ntheir choice, and I look forward to the debate and vote later this \nevening. Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Madam President, a noted sports figure in American sports \nhistory once commented that ``Bragging ain't bragging if you can prove \nit.''\n  On that basis, I want to brag a little bit about North Carolina which \nhas had its share of top sports figures--perhaps more than our share \nwhen you consider such outstanding sports figures, past and present, as \nArnold Palmer, Catfish Hunter, Charlie ``Choo-Choo'' Justice, Michael \nJordan, Richard Petty, David Thompson, Sonny Jurgensen, Dean Smith, \nEverett Case, Joe Gibbs, Enos Slaughter, and Wallace Wade, who by the \nway took two teams from Duke University to the Rose Bowl. But he didn't \nhave to go very far for the second one because it was held in Durham, \nNC, right after Pearl Harbor. It was feared that the Japanese might try \nto bomb the stadium out in California, so they moved the whole thing \nacross the country to North Carolina--the only time the Rose Bowl was \nnot played in Pasadena.\n  But I don't recall any previous teenager--from anywhere--who has been \ndescribed as a ``tennis phenomenon who walks in Chris Evert's \nfootsteps''. But that's the accolade handed 14-year-old Alli Baker of \nRaleigh my hometown--in the May edition of Metromagazine in a sparkling \nand detailed piece by Patrik Jonsson, writing from Boca Raton, Florida.\n  As I read the tribute to Alli Baker, I was reminded that this young \nlady is a great granddaughter of the late Lenox Dial Baker, one of \nAmerica's leading orthopedic surgeons. Dr. Baker almost single-handedly \nfounded a children's hospital, later named for him, at Duke University \nMedical Center in Durham, where hundreds of crippled children's lives \nhave brightened and their lives improved because of Dr. Baker's \nselfless and loving interest in them.\n  I am going to let the article about Alli Baker speak for itself. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that the tribute to the amazing 14-\nyear-old Alli Baker by Patrik Jonsson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Teenage Tennis Phenomenon Walks in Chris Evert's Footsteps\n\n                    [From Metro Magazine, May 2000]\n\n       Boca Raton, Fla.--Alli Baker is fuming. Frustrated during a \n     drill at the Evert Tennis Academy, the 14-year-old tennis \n     phenomenon from Raleigh huffs and puffs as if she's about to \n     blow somebody's house down. Then a few easy ground strokes go \n     into the net. That's it. Baker's Volkl racket goes flying \n     into a patch of grass. Conversations hush. Eyes glance \n     sideways at the lithe, freckled Southern girl whom everybody \n     knows as the number one ranked 14-year-old in the country, \n     and the highest-ranked female player yet to come out of North \n     Carolina. The court mood tenses the way it used to when John \n     McEnroe yelled at refs, or when the young German Boris Becker \n     pumped his fists in defiance. This is just practice. Still, \n     being Alli Baker's rival right now seems like a very, very \n     bad idea.\n       ``It's true, I get very competitive,'' says Baker, who is \n     also the seventh-ranked 16-and-under player in the country, \n     an hour before the brief blow-up on the court. ``I love to \n     win. It's my greatest strength.''\n       Tennis my not be a gritty contact sport, but it is, above \n     all, a game of mind over body. Anger and other unchecked \n     emotions are widely known top scatter the concentrations of \n     even the most experienced players in clutch situations. But \n     the coaches here already know that North Carolina's newest \n     sports star hones her on-court emotions, polishes them like \n     treasure, and beams them into that fuzzy yellow ball, \n     straight back at her opponents on the other side of the net \n     at center court. Indeed, she's beaten some of the world's \n     best tennis players in her age group by funneling her \n     competitive angst into devastating trickery.\n       ``She's a very mature player,'' says her coach, John Evert, \n     the brother of Wimbledon champ Chris Evert, and a 17-year \n     coach in his own right. ``Her strength is that she figures \n     out how to play exactly to her opponents' weaknesses, and she \n     doesn't let herself get into the dumps.''\n       Last year, Baker won five tournament tie breakers in a row, \n     an almost unheard of feat that epitomizes her unwillingness \n     to lose. ``I've yet to see her play in a tournament,'' one of \n     the other Evert Academy coaches confides. ``But they say she \n     is very, very hungry.''\n       Don't get the wrong idea, though. Off the court, Alli Baker \n     is about as sweet as strawberry pie, as humble as corn pone. \n     Freckled, tan and every bit the exuberant teenager, she talks \n     about fashion, missing home, seeing the world (Paris is her \n     favorite city), bonding with tennis stars Monica Seles and \n     Martina Hingis, how she loves her mentor, Chris Evert, and \n     the life-affirming step she's getting ready to take into \n     professional tennis. She's making ``a million new friends'' \n     while coaxing her Raleigh confidantes to hurry down to where \n     it's nice and warm and where the beaches stretch on and on.\n       So far, it's been a whirlwind tour from the halls of \n     Raleigh's Daniels Middle School to the star-studded tennis \n     courts of SoFla.\n\n\n                          hanging in west boca\n\n       It's here--to the Evert Tennis Academy, near some of the \n     world's largest country clubs, where the average annual \n     income is $65,000 and where the warm prevailing winds collect \n     tall afternoon thunder clouds over the coast--that Alli \n     decided to come this spring after it became clear that to \n     follow her dream, she had to follow it right out of North \n     Carolina.\n       Although the family will stay in Raleigh, where dad Bill \n     Baker is a vice president for a major construction firm, the \n     family just bought a house across Glades Avenue in west\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\n     Boca as a permanent base here. Baker and her family made the \n     decision after acknowledging the lack of a steady stream of \n     crack practice partners and full-time coaches in Raleigh. \n     While Bill works and helps shuttle their second daughter, 11-\n     year-old Lenox, to her soccer games, mom Leigh Baker has \n     found a permanent seat on the red-eye to Boca.\n       Of course, there were some questions among family friends: \n     How could the Bakers send a 13-year-old (her birthday is in \n     April) off to fend for herself in such a competitive, \n     cutthroat world? Bill Baker has an easy answer: ``She called \n     yesterday from a hotel room overlooking Key Biscayne. She \n     said, `Dad, I'm here looking our over the bay and the blue \n     water. It's so beautiful here.' I think she's going to be all \n     right.''\n       If Baker has what it takes to be an international tennis \n     star, Evert Academy is where the transformation from \n     sharpshooting local kid to Grand Slam winning hardball player \n     will likely take place. It's a place where the phrase, \n     ``Yeah, Agassi decided not to come down today,'' seems rote. \n     Don't be surprised to see top-ranked players such as France's \n     Sebastian Grosjean and Vince Spadea sweating through a four-\n     hour practice. Tiny, but fiery Amanda Coetzer shows up here \n     from time to time to practice--and to show the reverent young \n     ones how it's done.\n       On these finely groomed courts nestled amidst swaying \n     coconut palms is also where Chris Evert practices with \n     students three times a week, and where there's a \n     lyrical constant of English, French, Spanish and even \n     Czech spoken over the grunts of determined players \n     returning smashes. Bordered by dozens of clay and hard \n     courts, flanked by a beige dormitory hall, this tucked-\n     away facility is what the doorstep to the big time now \n     looks like for Alli Baker.\n       ``Her dream is to be the top-ranked tennis player in the \n     world,'' says Bill Baker at his Raleigh office overlooking \n     Falls of the Neuse Road. ``We knew that wouldn't happen if \n     she stayed here. She's doing all this herself. All that we're \n     doing is making the sacrifices to provide her with the \n     opportunities to pursue this dream. Sometimes it's hard as a \n     parent to not get emotionally involved. But in the end, the \n     fire to do it has to come from within her.''\n\n\n                              style points\n\n       Naturally athletic, Baker picked tennis over other sports \n     for reasons perhaps girls can best understand. First, it's \n     not so--she searches for the word--``tomboy-ish.'' The \n     outfits, in other words, look great. Plus, there's no \n     physical contact, only the physicality of pressurized felt \n     ball against tight catgut, the action crashing back and forth \n     across the net in an elaborate joust. It is a game you can \n     win by using your mind to imbue the body with the power of \n     wit, intensity and strategy.\n       ``I think it's the best game out there for girls,'' she \n     says. ``You can play hard and be super-competitive--and you \n     can look good doing it.''\n       Indeed, Baker already has the fresh, jaunty look that has \n     potential sponsors swooning. With the exception of Adidas \n     (clothes) and Volkl (racket), Baker has so far turned down \n     major sponsorships. In April, she unofficially entered the \n     pro circuit at a minor qualifying event. This spring, she \n     will play pro tourneys in Little Rock and Hilton Head. But \n     she's still an amateur, meaning she can't take any winnings \n     home yet. Still, it's at those tournaments, as well as at her \n     new home base here in Boca, where she's getting the first \n     real taste of her new life and where she is, as Bill Baker \n     says, ``meeting a lot of people who have been where she wants \n     to go--including some who made it and some who didn't.''\n       Impressed with Baker's natural talent, intense \n     competitiveness and impressive number of wins against tough \n     players, the United States Tennis Association and John Evert, \n     now Baker's development coach, ``recruited'' her into the \n     program.\n       ``She has shown great skill and promise, but this is the \n     time for her to get on the court and work hard, because this \n     is where it's going to get tougher now,'' says Ricardo Acuna, \n     USTA's Southeast region coach, who oversees Baker's overall \n     training program.\n       For coaches like Evert and Acuna, right now is when the \n     ball meets the clay for the great-granddaughter of the late \n     Sports Hall of Famer Lenox Baker, the famed Duke orthopedic \n     surgeon and sports medicine pioneer, and the granddaughter of \n     single-handicappers Robert F. Baker and Robert M. Hines of \n     Raleigh, the five-time Carolina Country Club Senior \n     Championship winner. Wedged between childhood and the \n     muscular 16- and 17-year-olds playing above her, this is when \n     this next generation Baker has to concentrate more on \n     fundamentals than winning--a difficult task for someone who \n     has gotten used to eating victories for lunch. She says she \n     still lags behind some of her key competitors as far as \n     skills go. ``Ground strokes are about the only part of my \n     game I'm really good at,'' she admits.\n       ``She's had a pretty easy time with practices up to this \n     point, where she's been able to turn it up and win matches,'' \n     says Evert. ``But now I'm trying to figure out how she can \n     match that intensity during practice. At this point, I'm even \n     ready to cut back on her practice time to foster that \n     intensity. For Alli right now, quality is more important than \n     quantity.''\n\n\n                          The Chrissie Factor\n\n       Although other tennis academies offer similarly competitive \n     programs, here Baker is becoming a member of the Famed Evert \n     family tennis tradition, which began with legendary tennis \n     coach Jim Evert's long-time directorship of Fort Lauderdale's \n     public Holiday Park tennis program from which Chris Evert \n     emanated. Indeed, it may have been the ``Chrissie presence'' \n     that finally convinced the Bakers to make the move.\n       Having a role model like Chris Evert, who won 18 grand \n     slams and 159 tournaments before retiring in 1989, rifling \n     balls at you from the other side of the net is unbelievable, \n     Baker says. ``I just love her. She comes out here to \n     practice, and she still plays really hard. My mom says she \n     would love to have her body.''\n       But Baker and Evert are not two peas in a pod as far as \n     playing style. Evert was known for staring her opponents down \n     from the baseline, playing a cool-headed volley game. Fans \n     recall her ``icy stare'' that unnerved some opponents enough \n     to immobilize them. On the other hand, Baker loves to explode \n     to the net with a tenacity that dad Bill Baker says has also \n     yielded success in her doubles game.\n       Indeed, as Baker has served, sliced and backhanded her way \n     to the top of the rankings, from playing in tourneys from Rio \n     de Janeiro to Paris, comparisons run more to former teenage \n     phenomenon Monica Seles than to Evert or today's young \n     superstars like Serena and Venus Williams. ``She has to play \n     smarter because she's not as big as some of the other \n     players.'' says her dad.\n       Still, Baker's skinny frame is mentioned as a potential \n     liability, especially when matched against the new breed of \n     power players such as the Williams sisters, who tower above \n     their competitors.\n       But don't dismiss a growth spurt yet, says, Acuno, the USTA \n     coach. ``I've seen her increase in size by a lot just this \n     year,'' he adds confidently, While Baker sometimes has \n     trouble getting fired up for practice, she loves the weight \n     room and working out. As part of her routine at Evert Tennis \n     Academy, she endures a strenuous regimen along with nearly \n     four hours of court time a day against some of the best young \n     players in the world.\n       Despite her early success, it's still not advantage Baker. \n     Most of her competitors were already enrolled in tennis \n     academies when then 8-year-old Alli Baker started playing \n     with her mom at Carolina Country Club, drawn more to the \n     sport for the ``cute outfits'' than the competition. Other \n     tennis kids get started way before that, as evidenced by a \n     muffin-sized front-court player, perhaps 5 years old, who \n     spent two hours cranking backhands at her dad-slash-coach on \n     a recent day at the academy. The girl rode her pink Barbie \n     bike with training wheels off the court after the practice. \n     In Baker's case, however, her natural talents shone through \n     right away, and she quickly made up for lost time. She \n     started beating her mom as a 9-year-old--showing right off \n     the bat a natural inclination toward not just good tennis, \n     but winning tennis.\n       ``It was a little bit later when I started to really like \n     the feeling of winning,'' she says. ``Before that, it was \n     just about the outfits and having fun with my friends.''\n       That love for the game and the big win is now starting to \n     pay off.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Interest in Baker began to percolate two years ago, when \n     USTA began sniffing around Raleigh, following rumors of a \n     phenom-in-the-making. After attending a few national camps \n     and doing well in a number of regional tournaments, Baker \n     bloomed for real last year.\n       Locally, North Hills Tennis Club coach Nancy Arndt, Raleigh \n     Racquet Club's Mike Leonard and Rali Bakita, and a handful of \n     other top-notch coaches worked on Baker's fundamentals, \n     knowing they had a potential star on their hands. But it was \n     at the Ace Tennis Academy in Atlanta, where Leigh Baker would \n     shuttle her daughter on weekends, that Baker culled those \n     extra pointers that propelled last year's successes.\n       Before last summer, Baker had already won both singles and \n     doubles at the coveted Easter Bowl, a triumph that sent her \n     like a projectile to the top ranking in the USTA under-14 \n     category. Against older girls up to age 16, Baker is still \n     ranked number seven. Impressed with the wily Raleigh \n     youngster, CBS included Baker in a segment called ``Top \n     Spin'' last summer, along with Pete Sampras and Serena \n     Williams.\n       The Easter Bowl victory led to Baker's USTA National \n     Champion ribbon. She finished third in the World Cup held in \n     the Czech Republic last year. She was also a runner-up in the \n     Banana Bowl in Brazil, and a semi-finalist in the Acunsion \n     Bowl in Paraguay, and the Windmill Cup in the Netherlands. \n     This year she is again on the U.S. National Team and this \n     spring worked her way into the doubles finals tourneys in \n     London and France. Right now is when competitive circuits \n     around the world are really starting to heat up.\n       On top of the thrill of competition another boon to her \n     meteoric rise into international tennis is the gang of cool \n     friends. Baker is building around her. Currently, she e-mails \n     a dozen friends in Russia and France, as well as her clan of \n     pals and fans in Raleigh.\n\n\n                         CHALLENGER FROM QUEENS\n\n       But Ally's best friend on the ground in Boca right now is a \n     gritty, 15-year-old power player from the blue-collar sky-\n     line of Queens, Shadisha Robinson. The two squared off \n     against each other last year where Baker came back from a \n     deep deficit, unwound\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\n     Robinson in a 7-6 second set and thrashed her 6-1 in the \n     third. They've been best friends ever since. Evert uses the \n     friendship to boost both players' performance on the court: \n     While Baker leans how to defend against pure power, Robinson \n     gets a lesson in wiliness from the freckle-cheeked \n     Southerner.\n       ``John doesn't really play us together competitively,'' \n     Baker says. ``He knows we are good for each other as \n     training partners, but he doesn't want us to get too much \n     of a rivalry going.''\n       A straight-A student through primary and middle school, \n     Baker is also managing to keep up with her academic work \n     through it all. While vacationing at the beach last year. \n     Retired Daniels Middle School teacher Lynn Reynolds heard \n     about Baker's decision to go to Florida. She immediately \n     called up the family and volunteered to come out of \n     retirement and ``sign up for the team'' as a home \n     schoolteacher. Reynolds and her young charge have since \n     become close friends, constantly in touch via e-mail and \n     fax--the methods they also use to exchange homework \n     assignments and tests. Daily, the teacher and student log \n     onto the College Boards web site to work out a daily test \n     question posted there--just to make sure Baker is ready for \n     the SAT's when that time comes.\n       ``This high-tech teacher and student relationship has \n     really been fun for both of us,'' Reynolds say. ``She's a \n     quick study and a very smart girl. We've become great \n     friends. This is one of the best teaching assignments of my \n     whole career.''\n       In two short years, Baker has traveled from Prague to \n     Paris, from Palm Springs to Rio. She says she's enamored with \n     this lifestyle that a simple game has already given her. She \n     misses her friends, but they'll come visit, they promise. \n     Everyone says they will.\n       If the ``tennis thing'' doesn't work out, Baker says, \n     ``with all the agents I've already met, I've got a chance \n     with my singing''--country, that is, her backburner passion. \n     Already the world has opened its doors to a talented Raleigh \n     kid with enough sense to know that dreams are out there for \n     the getting. ``I mean, if this were to give me a leg up to go \n     to a school like Stanford or Duke, then it's already worth \n     it,'' she says. ``Plus, just look at this place,'' she adds, \n     holding out her hands as if to weigh the fresh, precious \n     Florida air. ``This is prefect.''\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, between last Friday and today, in the \nspan of just 4 days, Republican Senators will pass tax breaks, \noverwhelmingly targeted for the wealthy, that will cost the Treasury \none and a half trillion dollars over the next 20 years. You would think \nthat careful attention would be paid to the merits of these \nastronomical tax giveaways before they are passed. Instead, they are \nbeing rammed through by a right-wing Republican majority in Congress \nbent on rewarding the wealthy and ignoring the country's true \npriorities that have a far greater claim on these enormous resources.\n  What about prescription drug coverage for millions of senior citizens \nunder Medicare? I have just returned from Massachusetts where I met \nwith the elderly people. They are asking, Will the Senate of the United \nStates, will Congress, take action to provide some relief to the \nelderly people in my State and across the country? Really, the \nunfinished business of Medicare is the prescription drug program. We \ndid not debate that last Thursday and last Friday. We are not debating \nthat issue today. We have basically said, let's find out how we can \ngive the one and a half trillion dollars away over the next 20 years, \ninstead of dealing with the Medicare issue on prescription drugs.\n  What about greater Federal aid to education to help schools and \ncolleges across the country and the students who attend them? We put \ninto the Record last Friday the most recent studies of the \nCongressional Research Service that showed that by moving to smaller \nclass sizes, there was an enhancement of academic achievement and \naccomplishment by students in California. That supports the STARS \nProgram of Tennessee. Senator Murray of the State of Washington has \nbeen our leader championing for smaller class sizes, because we believe \nthat that can be enormously important in enhancing academic \nachievement. If we do that, plus ensure that teachers get training and \nprofessional advancement in their classrooms, working to enhance their \nprofessionalism, we will see a very important, significant gain in \nacademic achievement and accomplishment.\n  We also know the value of afterschool programs, tutorials, and \naccountability, as Senator Bingaman has talked about; the newer digital \ndivide that Senator Mikulski has talked about; construction, the need \nto make sure our schools will be safe and secure and not crumbling, as \nso many of them are. But, no, we have set that aside. We are not going \nto have the resources to do that. Make no mistake about it, I say to \nAmerican families, we have made enhancing academic achievement for our \nteachers, smaller class sizes, afterschool programs, a lesser priority \nthan providing $1.5 trillion from the Federal Treasury to the \nwealthiest individuals.\n  What about health insurance for the millions of hard-working \nAmericans who have no coverage today? We made a downpayment in terms of \nthe children in the CHIP program in a bipartisan way. We reach out to \ntry to get coverage for their hard-working parents, an increasing \nnumber of Americans, who do not have health insurance. But we have not \nput that on the agenda. We are not debating that here on the floor of \nthe Senate. There will not be the resources to try to do that. We are \nsaying we want $1.5 trillion for the wealthiest individuals. Health \ninsurance for hard-working Americans is put aside.\n  What about raising the minimum wage for millions of low-income \nAmericans, the 13 million Americans, the majority of whom are women who \nhave children? It is a women's issue, it is a children's issue, and it \nis a civil rights issue because so many of these men and women are men \nand women of color. It is a fairness issue. People who work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, should not have to live in poverty. No, we \ncannot debate that up here in the Senate. We can get tax breaks for the \nwealthiest individuals in this country, but we will not debate an \nincrease in the minimum wage. We will not do it.\n\n  I hope we are not going to hear long lectures from the other side \nabout how we ought to be funding, now, the special needs programs. We \nhad great statements from the other side: We have failed in meeting our \nresponsibility to special needs children, to help local communities in \nthe area of education. We have heard that time in and time out, while \nwe have been trying to do some of these other actions for children in \nthis country. We had an opportunity to pay for all those special needs \nchildren, but I did not hear from the other side that this is a \npriority. We did not hear it when they had the $780 billion tax cut 2 \nyears ago, and we could have taken a fifth of that tax cut and funded \nspecial needs education for every child in this country for 10 years. \nNo, no, that is not enough of a priority. We are not going to do it. \nOur tax cut is too important. We are going to give $1.5 trillion away \nwithout spending a single nickel on special needs children.\n  The list goes on about protecting Social Security and Medicare. Right \nnow, I am sure there are scores of Members of the Congress and the \nSenate going on about how we ought to protect Medicare and Social \nSecurity. It is very clear what the priority has been in the Senate: \n$1.5 trillion, not to protect Medicare, not to protect Social Security, \nbut to provide it to the wealthiest individuals in this country.\n  That is what has happened over the period of these last 4 days, \nincluding a Sunday when we were not even here. All of these priorities \nand many more are being blatantly ignored by this Republican Congress \nin their unseemly stampede to enact these tax breaks for the wealthy. \nNever, in the entire history of our country, has so much been given \naway so quickly to so few with so little semblance of fairness or even \nthoughtful consideration.\n  I make that statement. I wait to be challenged on that. Never, never \nin the history of this body has so much been given away to so few, in \nsuch a short period of time, with such little semblance of fairness and \neven thoughtful consideration.\n  I hope we are not going to hear from the other side: We need to study \nthese\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nissues more carefully in our committee; this hasn't been carefully \nconsidered by the committee--when they come out with that $1.5 trillion \ntax cut, that never even saw the light of day in committee, on the \nestate tax. Think of having a committee report, think of having a \ncommittee discussion, think of having some debate about what the \nimplications of this might be in terms of a wide range of different \nissues? Absolutely not. We just took it, faced it, and passed it.\n  So it goes on. Plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else will \nbe the epitaph of this Republican Congress. It's a dream Congress for \nthe superwealthy and their special interest friends, and a nightmare \nCongress for hard-working families across America.\n  The Republican's trillion-dollar tax breaks will eminently deserve \nthe veto that President Clinton is about to give them. The Republicans \nfail to honestly weigh the nation's priorities, and I believe that this \nis an irresponsible and reckless way to legislate. Some may view it as \ngood political theater, red meat for the Republican right wing on the \neve of the Republican convention. But it is a disservice to all \nAmericans because it prevents action on the many true priorities facing \nthis Nation.\n  I suspect that Americans who see and understand what is happening \nhere this week in Washington will ask a single question: What if George \nW. Bush were in the White House? He would sign these irresponsible tax \nbreak monstrosities, and the nation would suffer for years to come.\n  I suspect that millions of Americans who see what is happening here \nwould say: No thanks, we don't need a Congress that would pass such \nirresponsible legislation--and we certainly don't need a President who \nwould sign it.\n  Last Friday's estate tax bill gave $250 billion to America's 400 \nwealthiest families, yet this same $250 billion would buy 10 years of \nprescription drug coverage for 11 million senior citizens who don't \nhave access to coverage now. Our senior citizens face a crisis today. \nThe extraordinary promise of fuller and healthier lives offered by new \ndiscoveries in medicine is often beyond their reach. They need help to \nafford the life-saving, life-changing miracle drugs that are \nincreasingly available. Cutting a trillion dollars from the federal \nbudget clearly jeopardizes our ability to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare.\n  Today, in schools across the country, students face over-crowded \nclassrooms, teachers go without adequate training, school buildings are \ncrumbling, and violence is a constant threat. One would think that at \nsome opportunity over these past few days we would have debated what \nmost families are concerned about, as well as insuring academic \nachievement for their children in a safe and secure area.\n  No, we are denied that opportunity. We cannot debate that. We are \ntold somehow that it is not relevant. It is relevant to what parents \ncare about, which is their children in school. I daresay it is a lot \nmore relevant than the fact that we will be giving $1.5 trillion, $250 \nbillion of which will go to the 400 wealthiest families. It is a lot \nmore relevant to their lives than that other factor, the giveaway.\n  Yet, Republicans are rushing through a trillion dollars in tax cuts \nwithout serious consideration of what it means for the nation's unmet \neducation needs. Today, the booming economy is helping many Americans, \nbut those who work day after day at the minimum wage are falling \nfarther and farther behind. A recent study by the pro-business \nConference Board finds that the number of working poor is actually \nrising, in spite of the record prosperity. The number of working poor \nfamilies who seek emergency help in soup kitchens and food pantries \nacross the nation is far ahead of the ability of agencies to meet their \nneeds.\n  Read the reports from last week about what is happening to children \nin our society. The total number of poor children has gone down by \nabout a percentage point, a point and a half, maybe, in the last 2 \nyears. But the ones who are living in poverty are living in deeper \npoverty than they have ever experienced.\n  We are finding an increased number of children who are not being \nimmunized against basic diseases, and here we are cutting $1.5 \ntrillion, when we are not immunizing our children and cannot find ways \nto make those programs workable and effective. We are not debating that \nand trying to find ways to improve it.\n  The cost of rental housing is skyrocketing in most cities because of \nthe economic boom, but the wages of millions of families who need that \nhousing has failed to keep pace.\n\n  My colleague and friend from Massachusetts, John Kerry, made this \ncase so well last week to, effectively, a deaf audience in the Senate. \nCutting tax revenues by a trillion and half dollars jeopardizes our \nability to respond to these needs.\n  The American people cry out for action on many other basic \npriorities, but the tax breaks being passed by the Republican Congress \nwould make fair action on all those priorities virtually impossible. \nRepublicans are well aware that their tax-cutting extravaganza would \nnot survive if it were honestly weighed against the nation's real \npriorities. That is why Republicans resort to gross distortion of the \nfacts.\n  They apply the phony label ``death tax'' of trying to deal with \nfamily farms and small businesses. Republicans told story after story \nabout how the estate tax hurts owners of small businesses and family \nfarms. Our Democratic alternative would grant them protection, but it \nwasn't enough for Republicans. Their position was to basically hold \nsmall business owners and small farmers hostage until they could get \nthe larger breaks for the largest estates and the wealthiest \nindividuals in the country.\n  They know this President is going to veto this measure, and instead \nof truly doing something that would benefit those small family farms \nand small businesses, they say: Oh, we would rather have it vetoed. We \nwill serve those small family farms up rather than deal with them. They \nknow this is true in the marriage tax penalty as well.\n  Listen to this: They apply the phony label ``marriage tax penalty'' \nto the current bill even though 58 percent of the tax cuts go to \ncouples who pay no marriage penalty at all. Do my colleagues hear that? \nFifty-eight percent of the benefits of this measure, according to the \nJoint Tax Committee, a measure which we will start voting at 6:30 this \nevening, will go to couples who pay no marriage tax penalty at all.\n  The Democrats have a simple alternative to address the marriage \npenalty: Let them file as a single person if it will mean it lowers \ntheir taxes. What in the world could be simpler than that? If one is \npaying more because of their marriage situation as a result of \ncommingling of the funds, Democrats say: OK, file as single \nindividuals. That will solve it. There is no red tape and no \nadministrative bureaucracy. It is simple. It meets a particular \nchallenge.\n  The Republicans: Oh, no. We want our program which will provide this \nextraordinary windfall to the wealthiest individuals.\n  Our Democratic alternative would cost $11 billion a year less than \nthe Republican bill--but it would provide greater marriage tax penalty \nrelief to families with incomes below $150,000 a year. But, our \nsensible Democratic approach does not overwhelmingly benefit the \nwealthy so the Republicans reject it. Republicans intentionally \ndesigned their bill to give 78 percent of the total tax savings to the \nwealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers.\n  Ending the marriage tax penalty is a thinly veiled pretext to their \nlatest installment of massive tax breaks for the wealthy. We saw the \nsame tactics during the debate on the estate tax. We heard story after \nstory of how the estate tax will hurt owners of small businesses and \nfamily farms.\n  I found Senator Conrad's presentation of our Democratic alternative \ncompelling and effective, virtually unchallenged on the floor of the \nSenate. Oh, yes, there was a challenge saying: Look, why are we \nsupporting that because all of the various groups evidently support the \nRepublican position?\n  I thought that was very interesting coming after our debate on HMO \nreform where we had 330 organizations support our HMO reform, and this \nparticular Senate voted against it when they did not have a single one \nsupporting their proposal and the responses by Senator Conrad were \nresponsive to this challenge.\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\n  They are holding small businesses and farmers hostage to their \nflagrant scheme to help the super-rich even while they talk piously of \nhelping the middle class.\n  This Republican Congress is the trillion-dollar-travesty Congress. \nFortunately, President Clinton and Al Gore are here--in this case, \nPresident Clinton--with a veto pen to burst their bubble. But thank \ngoodness that working families, middle-income families, have a \nPresident who really cares about the economic and financial situation \nin this country.\n  I take pride that I was one of 11 Members of the Senate who voted \nagainst the Reagan tax cut that took us from $400 billion to $4 \ntrillion in debt. That is why I am always interested in listening to \nthose on the other side talk about what wonderful economic programs we \nhave had over the recent times.\n\n  Let me finally use these charts to demonstrate, once again, what this \nrepeal of the estate tax will cost. It is $55 billion per year that we \nare effectively giving the wealthiest individuals by the year 2010. \nThis could fund every program in the Department of Education.\n  We are not saying that just throwing money at it answers all the \nproblems. But it is a pretty clear indication about what a nation's \npriorities are, about how we are going to allocate resources. We could \nhave fully done that, funded all of education, on this. We could have \nfunded the total cost of prescription drug medicines for every \nbeneficiary and had $15 billion left over. We could have had funding \nfor all the beneficiaries, for all of our senor citizens. We could have \nprovided the funding for the $20 billion which takes care of all the \nmedical research in the National Institutes of Health, and you would \nstill have $35 billion left.\n  This is an indication of priorities. This is another indication.\n  This chart depicts that from the Republican estate tax, those who are \ngoing to benefit from it, benefit from it to the average of $268,000. \nAll we are trying to get is a Medicare prescription drug benefit that \nwill be valued for our senior citizens at $900.\n  Here it is: $268,000, by 2010, for those who will benefit under the \nRepublican tax cut. All we are trying to do is get $900 for our senior \ncitizens, our 40 million senior citizens we will have at that time. Or \nto put it another way, the beneficiaries will have the estates worth \n$2.3 million. The people we are trying to help average $13,000 a year. \nThey are the people we are trying to look out for.\n  This is the contrast. I believe, as I have said, never has so much \nbeen given to so few in such a short period of time--without, I think, \nthe fair, adequate national debate or discussion in terms of what is \nreally necessary, in terms of meeting the human needs of families in \nthis country, the educational needs, the health needs, of what is \nneeded in terms of housing for working families and what is necessary \nin terms of prescription drugs.\n  How are we going to have clean air? How are we going to have clean \nwater? How are we going to clean up the brownfields? How are we going \nto make sure people are going to continue to have an opportunity to \nwork in employment and have the training and the skills in order to be \nable to compete in the new economy?\n  All of those priorities have been washed away. With $1.3 trillion, we \nwould be able to provide the investments for the American people. We \nhave given that away. We have given that away without adequate and fair \nconsideration of these priorities. I welcome the fact that we have a \nPresident who is going to veto those measures.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7014-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7014-S7043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Schumer be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would provide an additional \n$8 million for the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance \nProgram.\n  Across the country this summer, Americans have faced unacceptably \nhigh gasoline prices. Last winter, our constituents, particularly in \nthe Northeast, saw extraordinary increases in home heating oil prices.\n  Members of this body have offered various proposals to address this \nissue, ranging from urging OPEC to increase production; increasing \ndomestic crude oil production, by drilling in new areas; building up \nour refining capacity; and expanding our use of ethanol and alternative \nfuels. Essentially, all of these proposals are supply side proposals, \nincreasing the supply of energy.\n  In fact, we are reaching a point now where the proposal to encourage \nOPEC might be running out of time. I note that the Saudi Arabians are \nasking for a meeting of OPEC in the next few days, because if there is \nnot a meeting immediately, even if there is an increase in production, \nit will be insufficient in terms of reaching our markets for the winter \nheating season.\n  All of these supply side proposals are interesting, but we are \nneglecting an important aspect of the overall composition of the \nheating market--and that is demand.\n  The weatherization program goes right to this critical issue of \ndemand. By weatherizing homes, by making them more energy efficient, we \nare literally cutting down the demand for energy, and typically foreign \nenergy.\n  As Congress debates these proposals for supply relief, we should also \nstart thinking seriously about demand reduction. That is critically \ninvolved in the whole issue of energy efficiency and weatherization. At \nthe same time, our weatherization program protects the most vulnerable \npeople in our society because they are aimed at the elderly, \nindividuals with disabilities, children, all of them being subject to \nhuge increases in heating costs, not only in the wintertime--that is \nthe case in the Northeast--but in the Southeast and Southwest and the \nvery hot parts of this country in the summertime.\n  In fact, it was not too long ago--several years ago--in Chicago where \nthere was an extraordinary heat spell. People literally died because \nthey could not afford to keep their air-conditioners running, if they \nhad air-conditioning. Or they could not afford to keep paying \nexorbitant energy costs because their homes were inefficient in terms \nof retaining the cool air from air-conditioning. So this is a program \nthat cuts across the entire country.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program supports the weatherization of \nover 70,000 low-income homes each year. To date, over 5 million \nAmerican homes have been weatherized with Federal funds, and also local \nfunds, which must be part of the formula in order to provide this type \nof assistance for American homes.\n  Last December, I had a chance to witness this program in action. I \nwas in Providence, RI, with Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson. We \nwent to a low-income home in Providence. In just a few hours, a \ncontractor was able\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\nto blow in insulation between the walls; they were able to caulk \nwindows and doorways; they were able to conduct tests to ensure that \nthe energy efficiency of the structure had increased dramatically.\n\n  This was a home of a family of first-generation Americans. They had \ncome from Southeast Asia in the turmoil of the war in Southeast Asia. \nThe father was in his late 40s, early 50s, and had several children--\nall of them American success stories. The children were in college. His \nmother was living with them. She was disabled, suffering from \nAlzheimer's.\n  This is typically the type of families--low-income families, \nstruggling, working hard with jobs, trying to get kids through \ncollege--who are the beneficiaries of this program. It is an excellent \nprogram. It is a program that is terribly needed by these low-income \nfamilies.\n  Typically, low-income families will spend about 15 percent of their \nincome on heat--or in the summer, air-conditioning--more than four \ntimes the average of more affluent families. Over 90 percent of the \nhouseholds that are served by this weatherization program have annual \nincomes of less than $15,000. This is a program that works. It works \nfor these individual families.\n  Not only that, it also works for us. It creates jobs. About 8,000 \njobs throughout the country have been created because of this \nweatherization program. It also saves us from consuming and wasting \nenergy.\n  I argue, as I have initially, one should look at the supply side \ncomplications of the energy crisis. One should implore OPEC to increase \nproduction. One should have sensible problems to ensure supply. But if \nwe neglect the demand part of the equation, we are not only missing the \nboat, but I think we are deficient in our responsibility to formulate a \ncomprehensive approach to energy efficiency in this country.\n  In 1996, the budget was $214 million, but because of cuts generated \nby the Contract With America, and other proposals, it dipped down to \nabout $111 million--a significant cut. This was one of those programs \nthat was devastated by the budget policies of the mid-1990s.\n  Since that time, we have added money back because, again, I believe \nthis body particularly recognizes both the fairness and the efficiency \nof this program. But still we are at about $135 million in fiscal year \n2000.\n  That is still 37 percent below the 1996 figure.\n  If we can afford, as Senator Kennedy said, at length and eloquently, \nto engage in trillion-dollar tax cuts, multibillion-dollar benefits \nthat go to the very wealthiest Americans, we should be able to at least \nincrease our weatherization funding by $8 million to cover additional \nfamilies, low-income families, families who have disabled members, \nfamilies who are working hard trying to get by and need this type of \nassistance.\n  Again, as we look over the last several weeks, and even this week, \ntalking about relief for the marriage penalty, estate tax relief, it \nreminds me of a play on Winston Churchill's famous line about the RAF, \n``never have so many owed so much to so few.'' We seem to be in a \nposition of saying, never have so few gotten so much from so many.\n  I want to ensure that at least when it comes to weatherization we are \nresponding to the critical needs of families across this country. I had \nhoped we could move towards the President's request of $154 million. \nThat would be about a 14-percent increase over our present level of \n$135 million. My amendment does not seek that full increase. It simply \nseeks an additional $8 million. I think the money will be well spent. \nThe program works. It puts people to work. It helps low-income \nfamilies. It helps us address a problem which is growing with \nincreasing importance, and that is to control our insatiable demand for \nenergy, particularly petroleum.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. I hope, perhaps, we can even work out a way in which this \namendment can be accepted by the chairman and his colleagues.\n  If it is appropriate, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just under 2 hours ago, at the outset of \nthis debate, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, \ncame to the floor with an eloquent plea about the lack of money to \nproperly manage Great Smokey National Park and pointed out the \ntremendous challenges to that major national park in our system. The \nSenator from Nevada, the other Mr. Reid, spoke in agreement with that \nproposition. The Senator from Tennessee did not have an amendment to \nincrease the appropriations for Great Smokey National Park or for any \nother.\n  I have found it curious that in the several years I have managed this \nbill and written this bill, almost without exception the amendments \nthat are brought to the floor are amendments to increase the amount of \nmoney we donate to other units of Government for their primary purposes \nand almost never do they express a concern for increasing the amount of \nmoney to support the functions of the Government of the United States \nitself.\n  I have gone a long way--my committee has gone a long way--in drafting \nthis bill at least to begin to make up for the deferred maintenance in \nour national parks and in our national forests and with respect to our \nIndian reservations and our Indian programs and the management of the \nBureau of Public Lands. I think we have at least turned the corner. As \nI said in my opening remarks on the bill, this is our primary function \nand our primary goal; that is, to see to it that we manage the public \nlands of the United States and the other functions in this bill that \nare exclusively Federal functions first and deal with other matters \nlater.\n  I sympathize with the eloquent statement of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. In fact, I have supported that case in this bill for several \nyears. When one compares this appropriation with that in the first year \nduring which I managed this bill, it is increased by a good 20 percent. \nBut here we have a proposal to add another $8 million, which will come \nout of every program for which the U.S. Government has exclusive \nresponsibility. It will mean there will be less--not much less, but \nthere will be less --for Great Smokey National Park. There will be less \nfor the Fish and Wildlife Service and its multitude of obligations. \nThere will be less for the Smithsonian Institution. There will be less \nfor research and development of the very programs for energy efficiency \nwhich are the key to providing both energy independence and the proper \nand efficient use of energy.\n  With all respect to the Senator from Rhode Island, this has nothing \nto do with the tax debate. We have a budget resolution and a set of \nallocations that have given this committee a fixed number of dollars \nwith which to work. I repeat that: a fixed number of dollars with which \nto work. It is all spent in this bill. So we can't just add this $8 \nmillion or $18 million to the bill and say, well, let's take it out of \na tax cut or out of a budget surplus or the like. The Senator from \nRhode Island recognizes that. He has a match for this $8 million. But I \nsimply have to repeat: The match is from the primary functions of the \nFederal Government, the management of our national parks and forests, \nthe energy research we undertake, the cultural institutions of the \nUnited States. That is from where this match comes.\n  A year ago, we said: If this program is so important to the States, \nlet's require them to match what we come up with by 25 percent. Let \nthem come up with 25 percent. Some States do provide some money for \nthis. We had to postpone that for a year. In this bill we have had to \nhave a way to grant State waivers, when States regard this program \nevidently as so lacking in importance that they are not willing to put \nup 25 percent of the money for their own citizens for something that is \nprimarily their responsibility.\n\n  As I said, we are $3 million above the level for the current year. \nThe House is $5 million above the level for the current year. If we end \nup with a larger allocation--and, personally, I hope for a larger \nallocation--by the time the conference committee has completed its\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nwork, we will have a modestly larger amount of money for this program \nin a final conference committee report. But it is not responsible to \ntake it out of our National Park System. It is not responsible to take \nit out of our existing energy research. It is not responsible to take \nit out of the cultural institutions of the United States. That is \nprecisely what this does.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I do applaud the Senator's efforts over many \nyears to increase this account. He has done that. I think it makes a \ngreat deal of sense to provide a local match, which he has, and we \nwould encourage more local participation. It is true we have provided \nan offset because I recognize that we do not have unlimited free money \nto put back into the budget.\n  We have taken money from every Federal agency. But I am told that our \ncut represents .05 percent per agency coming out of travel pay, coming \nout of administrative overhead. I think that is probably something they \ncould well absorb. I daresay it would not require them to either turn \ndown the heat or turn off the air-conditioning, whereas we are talking \nabout a situation of homes throughout this country where they don't \nhave that luxury.\n  So I agree in principle that we are taking it from agencies, but we \nare taking such a minute fraction that I think it would be readily \nabsorbed. And we are putting it into a program that is both worthwhile \nand necessary in so many cases, and also going to the heart of ensuring \nthat people can go into this heating season --particularly in the \nNortheast--with a little more confidence. I am concerned we are going \nto see tremendous oil heating price hikes which will force people into \nvery difficult choices between heating or eating. This is a way, I \nbelieve, in which we can begin to start addressing this point.\n  Again, I recognize that the chairman has very diligently and \nsincerely tried to increase these funds. I hope we can do better. I \ndon't think we are penalizing the agencies, and I don't anticipate a \npark being shut down by the loss of .5 percent of their travel expenses \nand other overhead.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first, there is another far more important \nprogram and far more expensive program that goes to these very issues. \nThe appropriations bill for military construction included many other \nmatters. There was $600 million more for the direct assistance to \npeople with their heating oil bills. In some respects, this is every \nbit as important a program because it tries to lower the bills in the \nfirst place.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is correct; this is a small percentage \nof the budgets for the national parks. It is also the subject of match \nfor several other amendments here because it is so easy. We don't say \nthis program is much more important than another program, so let's cut \nthe other program; we just say, in effect, cut them all across the \nboard. But it is $8 million more in deferred maintenance for our \nnational parks, or for our other national lands. And since this is a \nprogram that, over the course of the last 5 years, has increased more \nrapidly, bluntly, than the amount of money we have for these primary \nresponsibilities, that is the reason we came up with the amount that we \ndid.\n  Would I have liked to come up with more? Yes. If I have a larger \nallocation later, I will. Will there be more? There will be. I don't \nthink at this point, for a State program, that many States aren't \nmatching--and the requirement for match is only 25 percent--that this \nis as important as the national priorities that are the subject of the \nrest of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3800\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for himself, Mr. \n     Craig, Mr. Grams, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3800.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide authority for the Secretary of the Interior to \n conduct a study on the management of conflicting activities and uses)\n\n       On page 125, line 25 strike ``$58,209,000'' through page \n     126, line 2 and insert in lieu thereof ``$57,809,000, of \n     which $2,000,000 shall be available to carry out the Urban \n     Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et \n     seq.).\n\n     SEC.   . MANAGEMENT STUDY OF CONFLICTING USES.\n\n       (a) Snow Machine Study.--Of funds made available to the \n     Secretary of the Interior for the operation of National \n     Recreation and Preservation Programs of the National Park \n     Service $400,000 shall be available to conduct a study to \n     determine how the National Park Service can:\n       (1) minimize the potential impact of snow machines and \n     properly manage competing recreational activities in the \n     National Park System; and\n       (2) properly manage competing recreational activities in \n     units of the National Park System.\n       (b) Limitation of Funds Pending Study Completion.--No funds \n     appropriated under this Act may be expended to prohibit, ban \n     or reduce the number of snow machines from units of the \n     National Park System that allowed the use of snow machines \n     during any one of the last three winter seasons until the \n     study referred to in subsection (a) is completed and \n     submitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nissue that is very important to many people. It is certainly important \nto me as chairman of the parks subcommittee in the Senate and as a \nsupporter of parks. Having grown up right outside of Yellowstone Park, \nthe parks there are very much a part of our lives.\n  Let me quickly summarize what this amendment does. I can do it very \nquickly because it is quite simple. It deals with the idea and the \nconcept of having access to national parks, when it is appropriate, for \nthe use of individual snow machines--something we have done for some 20 \nyears--frankly, without any particular objection until this last year, \nand without any real evidence that we can't make some changes that \nwould allow us to continue to do that.\n  Unfortunately, rather than looking for an opportunity to bring about \nsome changes in the machines, or some changes in the way they are used, \nor to manage the way they are used, this administration has simply \nsaid: We are going to bring about a regulation unilaterally that will \neliminate the use of snow machines in the parks of the United States.\n  What this amendment does, simply, is provide some money--$400,000; \nand we have found a place to get that money--to conduct a study to \ndetermine how the national parks can do a couple of things: One, \nminimize the potential impact of snow machines and properly manage \ncompeting recreational activities in the National Park System. That is \npretty logical stuff. In fact, you can almost ask yourself, haven't \nthey done this? The answer is that they have not. Two, properly manage \ncompeting recreational activities in units of the national park. Again, \nthat is pretty easy to do. In Yellowstone Park, where there is a great \ndemand for using snow machines, on the one hand, and cross-country \nskiing, on the other, with management you can separate these two so \nthat they are not conflicting uses. Of course, that requires some \nmanagement.\n  So then the second part of it is that no funds may be appropriated \nuntil such time, basically, as the Park Service has completed their \nstudy and submitted it back to the Committee on Appropriations in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations in the \nSenate. So this doesn't put any long-time restriction on what can be \ndone. It simply says: Here is some money; take a look at where we are, \nwhat the problems are, and what we can do about them, and bring that \nback and make some management decisions. It is fairly simple and, I \nthink, fairly reasonable. That is what this amendment is all about.\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\n  I guess the real issue comes about due to the fact that we have had a \nconsiderable amount of activity. What really brings it about is a \nwinter use study that is going on now in Yellowstone and the Teton \nParks. It has to do with the broad aspect of winter use and with \nbuffalo moving out of the park and what kinds of things can be done \nthere; and how people can get in and out of the parks and utilize them \nin the wintertime, which really brought about this whole thing. The \nAssistant Secretary of the Interior went out to look and came back with \nan idea--I think mostly of his own--that we ought to do away with \nsnowmobile use. He did this without having any facts, science, or \nlooking at what could be done so that you could be consistent with the \npurpose of the park.\n  The purpose of a park is basically to maintain the resource and to \nmaintain it in such a way that its owners can enjoy the use of it. \nThose things are not inconsistent. Those things are not inconsistent \nwith snowmobiles, in my judgment. But whether it is my judgment or not, \nmore importantly, the idea to come to the conclusion that they are \ninconsistent without any facts is something we ought not to accept.\n\n  I am a little surprised that someone in this Congress would rise to \ndefend the authority of the executive branch to go around the Congress \nand to do something without even including the Congress or the people. \nThat is not the way this place is set up. That is not what we are here \nfor. That is why we have a division between the executive and the \nlegislative and the judicial--a very important division. It is, \nfrankly, being ignored by this administration not only on this issue \nbut on many of them. They are overtly saying: If we don't get approval, \nwe will just do it. That is not the way things are supposed to happen.\n  I am also a little surprised, frankly, that a representative of a \npublic lands State would be interested in having the agencies that \nmanage--in the case of Nevada--nearly 90 percent of the land and, in \nWyoming, over half, making decisions without involving some of the \npeople who should be involved, who are involved with living in these \nareas.\n  I think we are really talking about a system of rulemaking--a system \nof regulation--and one that needs to be based on facts and based on the \nidea that you take a look at issues. Frankly, the substantial amount of \nevidence about what has been said about snowmobiles in west Yellowstone \nand other places simply isn't factual. I could go through all of that \nstuff, but I will not. But it is terribly important that we try to do \nthings based on real facts.\n  The Department of Interior has announced that it intends to ban \nsnowmobiles in all but 12 of about 30 parks--not all in the West, as a \nmatter of fact. We sent a letter to the Secretary of the Interior some \ntime ago with 12 signatures on it. They quickly came to the Senate from \nMaine, from Minnesota, from the west coast, and some from the Rocky \nMountains. It is not only in the area that has limited interest; it has \ninterest from all over the whole country.\n  The Department claims that only a complete ban to curb snowmobiles on \nissues and noise will protect the wildlife. That simply isn't the only \nalternative that is available.\n  I want to make it very clear that it is not my position, nor would I \ndefend the notion that snowmobiles ought to continue to be used as they \nare currently being used. They can be changed substantially. We have \nhad meetings with the manufacturers, which, by the way, have a very \nstrong presence in Minnesota. Lots of jobs and lots of issues are \ninvolved. Jobs isn't really the issue. The issue is access to the land \nthat belongs to the people of this country, but they can be changed.\n  One of the things that has not happened and that should happen is \nthere ought to have been some standard established for snowmobiles, \nsaying here is the level of emissions that is acceptable, and here is \nthe level of noise that is acceptable. If you want to use your machine \nin the park, you have to have one that complies with these regulations. \nThere have been none.\n\n  The same thing could be said about where you use the machine. If you \nare going to be in the same track as deer, it doesn't need to be that \nway.\n  We have had failure on the part of management of the Park Service to \ndo something to make these kinds of uses compatible with the purposes \nof the parks. Rather than do that, or rather than making efforts to do \nthat, they simply say, no. They are just going to cut it out; they \naren't going to do that.\n  I object to that process. I don't think that is the kind of process \nthat we ought to look forward to in this country--whether it is \nsnowmobiles, or water, or whether it is automobiles, or whether it is \nfood regulations, or whatever. We have to have something better. \nInterior has never considered a single management scheme to be able to \nmake it better.\n  Certainly I hear all the time: Well, the snow machine people should \nhave done something better. Maybe so. I don't argue with that. However, \nif you were a developer of snow machines, if you were a manufacturer \nand you were going to invest a good deal of money to make changes in \nthem, I think it would be important to you to know what the standard is \ngoing to be so you are able to meet those requirements and continue to \nbe able to put out the machine that would comply.\n  We have had hearings. We have met with those manufacturers. They \ntestified they can and will produce and market the machine, if EPA will \nset the standard.\n  It is kind of interesting that most of the parks, such as \nYellowstone, are full of cars, buses, and all kinds of things in the \nsummertime which do not seem to have an impact here. But in the \nwintertime, it seems that something much less in terms of numbers is \nwhat we are going to cut off.\n  I want to deal largely with the concept that we ought to really pay \nattention to the purpose of these resources--to make them available, to \nhave access to them, that we need to have a system that is based on \nfindings of fact and science, and be able to come up with alternatives \nrather than simply making the bureaucrat decision downtown that we are \ngoing to do away with this or we are going to do away with that.\n  We ought to put into effect a time that this agency can study this \nissue, look at the alternatives, provide some money to do that, have \nthem bring their findings back, and then certainly make some choices.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward. I think that is better \nthan the bureaucratic approach of just deciding somewhere in the bowels \nof the Interior Department we are going to do something.\n  I find a great deal of reaction to it in my State, of course, and the \nsurrounding States which are very much impacted.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I have worked with the majority leader \nand the Senator from Montana to try to find a solution. We are looking \nfor solutions. That is really what we need some time to be able to do.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nreverse the snowmobile ban in our national parks and provide funding \nfor a study to determine how the National Park Service can minimize the \nimpact of snow machines and properly manage competing recreational \nactivities in the National Park System. I want to thank Senators Thomas \nand Craig for their efforts to bring this important amendment before \nthe Senate for consideration.\n  While the Interior Department's ill-conceived ban will not \nimmediately affect snowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, \nit will impact snowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in \nmy home state--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix \nNational Scenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly \nimpact Minnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but \nin many of our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our \ncountry.\n  When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and \nfriends. I think of people who come together on their free time to \nenjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation \nallows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances \nsnowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. \nFor some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our \nstate. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue \nactivity. Whatever the reason,\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nsnowmobiles are an extremely important aspect of commerce, travel, \nrecreation, and safety in my home state.\n  Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles \nand 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota \nUnited Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 \nindividual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised \n$264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 \njobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is \nhome to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And \nyes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles.\n  People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They're \nfarmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. \nThey're men, women, and young adults. They're people who enjoy the \noutdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities \nour diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the \nnatural resources through which they ride, but understand the important \nbalance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources.\n  Just three years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a \nnumber of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride \ndidn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take \nus through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of \nplant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned \na great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to \nconserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon \nwhich the ride, and educate their members about the need to ride \nresponsibly.\n  The time I spent with these individuals and the time I've spent on my \nown snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and \nenjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride \nresponsibly and safely. It has also given me reason to strongly \ndisagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning \nsnowmobiles from our National Parks.\n\n  I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and \nthe rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing \nthe ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The \ntime has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat \nfor recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles \nwere, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' \nThese are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda has been handwritten \nfor him by those opposed to snowmobiling.\n  The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the \nagenda of the federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress \nshould be determining who is and is not welcome on our federal lands. \nAnd the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--\nnot the Clinton administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry.\n  I can't begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders \nthis Administration has undertaken without even the most minimal \nconsideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state \nafter state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard \nfor the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, \n1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:\n\n       When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't \n     need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had \n     authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to \n     draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found \n     that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds \n     of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the \n     game. We're not trying to do anything legislative.\n\n  As further evidence of this Administration's abuse of Congress--and \ntherefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:\n\n       We completely understand all of the executive tools that \n     are available to us--And boy do we use them.\n\n  While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around \nCongress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbitt in coming right \nout and admitting it.\n  Well, Mr. President, I for one am getting a little sick and tried of \nwatching this Administration force park users out of their parks, steal \nland from our states and counties, impose costly new regulations on \nfarmers and businesses without scientific justification, and force \nCongress to become a spectator on many of the most controversial and \nimportant issues before the American people. Quite frankly, I'm getting \na little sick and tired of this Administration's positions of zero-cut, \nzero-access, and zero-fun on public lands.\n  When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to \nconsider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most \nimpacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually \ncontact the state and local official who represent the area to see what \nthey have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I might \nmiss a detail that could improve my efforts are necessary or if \nthey're misplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a \nbroader consensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt \nthe people I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public \npolicy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials.\n\n  I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me \nto see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units In \nMinnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobile usage in Minnesota or on \nany complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While \nI've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local \nofficial has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In \nfact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to \ncurb snowmobile usage in some parks, I had no idea the Park Service was \nconsidering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I think they \nwould issue it this quickly.\n  This quick, overreaching action by the Park Service, I believe, was \nunwarranted. It did not allow time for federal, state, or local \nofficials to work together on the issue. It didn't bring snowmobile \nusers to the table to discuss the impact of the decision. It didn't \nallow time for Congress and the Administration to look at all of the \navailable options or to differentiate between parks with heavy \nsnowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands \nas a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formulation and is \nan affront to the consideration American citizens deserve from their \nelected officials.\n  That is why this amendment is so important. It reverses the dark of \nnight, back room tactics used by this Administration to arrive at this \ndecision. We cannot simply stand by and watch as the administration \ncontinues its quest for even greater power at the expense of the \ndeliberative legislative processes envisioned by the founders of our \ncountry. Secretary Babbitt, Administrator Browner, and Donald J. Barry \nmay believe they're above working with Congress, but only we can make \nsure they're reminded, in the strongest possible terms, that when they \nneglect Congress they're neglecting the American people. This amendment \ndoes just that.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas, regarding \na study on snowmobile use within our National Parks.\n  The development of the Yellowstone and Grand Tetons National Parks \nwinter use plan draft environmental impact statement has been a \nlandmark exercise for inclusion and cooperation between state, local \nand Federal Agencies involved in the land management planning process. \nWhile this endeavor has not progressed without flaws, it has \nestablished that local and state governments possess the expertise and \nability to respond in a timely and educated manner to address issues \ncritical to the development of a comprehensive land-use document.\n  In spite of these efforts, however, the United States Department of \nthe Interior has announced a decision to usurp this process and has \nchosen to implement an outright ban on all snowmobiles, in virtually \nall national parks, including Yellowstone.\n  I must admit I am not surprised at the over-reaching nature of this \naction. In fact, several months ago I predicted that the Park Service \nwould ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park and would\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nextend its ban on snowmobiles to all national parks. I am further \nconcerned that this action will spread to include other public land \nincluding the national forests. In fact, discussions with National \nForest supervisors surrounding Yellowstone indicate that all it will \ntake is an adverse opinion by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ban \nsnowmobiles altogether.\n  The United States Forest Service could claim that increased \nsnowmobile use on our national forests will impact the Canadian lynx, \nor some other threatened or endangered species, without proof or \ndocumentation to put such a ban in place.\n  After a ban in the forests, we can expect action on BLM lands. After \nsnowmobiles, what next? A ban on automobiles and then even on bicycles? \nIf that sounds farfetched, think back just three years ago when we were \nassured that snowmobiles would not be banned in Yellowstone Park. Soon, \nwe may even expect that bans on other types of recreation will follow \nand our public lands will no longer be available to the public.\n  As one of the Senators representing the bulk of Yellowstone, I feel \nit is my duty to correct some of the misconceptions that surround this \nproposal by the federal government to prohibit access to our nation's \noldest and dearest of national parks.\n  Millions of visitors come to Yellowstone National Park each year to \nexperience first hand the park's unique and awesome beauty. They come \nfrom all over the world to see Earth's largest collection of geothermal \nfeatures and to witness some of the largest free-roaming bison and elk \nherds in the United States.\n  In a proposal announced March 24, 2000 the U.S. Department of the \nInterior declared its plan to permanently ban snowmobiles from the park \nbeginning in 2002. This announcement was followed by a later statement, \non April 27, 2000, where the Department of Interior expanded a proposed \nban to dozens of other national parks across the country. If federal \nofficials and national special interest groups have their way, however, \na visit to Yellowstone National Park may become as rare and endangered \nas the trumpeter swan or black footed ferret.\n\n  There is little evidence to support claims that this proposal was \nmade to protect the environment or to reduce the impact on Park \nanimals. In fact, later statements by park personnel indicate that the \nmain reason for this ban was to comply with changing Park Service \npolicy which was developed to supersede ongoing efforts to reach a \nreasonable compromise on national park winter use.\n  As I stated earlier, the decision to ban snowmobiles was announced \nbefore the Park Service had completed its review of comments on a draft \nenvironmental impact statement created by the park and adjacent states \nand counties to address concerns over winter use in Yellowstone and its \nneighbor, Grand Teton National Park. The announcement also came before \nofficials could incorporate revisions and amendments to major studies \nthat the Park Service relied on in drafting the draft environmental \nimpact statement.\n  The Park Service admits these initial studies were seriously flawed \nand exaggerated snowmobile pollution estimates. The original draft \nstudy on snowmobile emissions erroneously computed emissions amounts \nusing pounds instead of grams as is used to compute all standard \nemission amounts.\n  So what is the real reason for banning snowmobiles from Yellowstone \nand all other national parks? The Park Service's proposal to ban \nsnowmobiles is all about deciding who will have the privilege of \nexperiencing the Park up close and in person, and who will be forced to \nstay home. Unfortunately, this will leave an even larger segment of the \nUnited States ignorant of how vast and wonderful our parks really are.\n  It is vitally important, therefore, that a true picture be painted \nfor the American public to understand what is really being taken away \nfrom them.\n  One poll touted by national environmental organizations claims most \nAmericans favor banning snowmobiles, partially based on an image of \nsnowmobiles as heinous, smog producing, noisy devices used to run down \npoor, defenseless animals and lacking a conception of the size of the \npark and the limited number of snowmobiles accessing the park on any \ngiven day.\n  The administration failed to inform the public of other alternatives \nto an outright ban that were in the works. For example: snowmobile \nmanufacturers are interested in cleaner, quieter machines. There was \nalso discussion about reducing the number of snowmobiles that could \naccess the park every winter. Not many people realize that local \nleaders were very involved in trying to resolve the situation to avoid \nimplementing a full fledged ban.\n  In addition, the snowmobile industry has been working for several \nyears to develop air and noise standards with the Environmental \nProtection Agency so there is a clear target for cleaner, quieter \nmachines. Industry has stated time and time again that once they have \nclearly defined standards they will develop the technology to meet \nthose standards (assuming some reasonableness to the standard) One \ncompany even gave the Park Service some advanced model snowmobiles to \ntest.\n  Right now, snowmobiles are only allowed on groomed roads, the same \nroads used by cars in the summer and average less than two-thousand \nsnowmobiles a day. A speed limit of 45 miles per hour is strictly \nenforced. Any driver who puts one ski off the designated trails is \nsubject to fines and possible arrest. The same goes for speeding.\n  This is a significant point to make by the way, because the Executive \norder this ban is based on regulates off-road vehicle use on our \nnational parks, and as I just noted, snowmobiles are not off-road \nvehicles in national parks.\n  What a snowmobile ban really does is deny access for old and young \nriders with physical limitations that preclude them from snowshoeing or \ncross country skiing into the park. The only alternative left for those \nvisitors unable to snowshoe or ski into the park will only be able to \naccess the park via a mass transit vehicle known as a snow coach.\n  Because of its size, and the type of terrain, it is incredibly \nimpractical to limit access to Yellowstone to just snow coaches or \ncross country skis and snowshoes. Yellowstone is made up of \napproximately 2.2 million acres, most of which is already closed to \npublic access other than by foot, snow shoe or skis, and has less than \n2,000 snowmobiles inside the park on any given day.\n  By comparison, the State of Connecticut is slightly larger than \nYellowstone Park with more than 3.3 million people, many of which drive \na car every day. Perspective is important.\n  On its face, and in the safety of your own living room, the idea of \nriding a van-sized, over snow vehicle may sound like a romantic mode of \ntravel, but in reality, snow coaches are large, cumbersome vehicles \nthat grind, scrape, and shake their way across high mountain passes. It \nis impossible to ride in a snow coach for long periods of time.\n  As a result, the proposal to only access the park by means of mass \ntransit further restricts time and access to the park by virtually \neliminating all entrances to Yellowstone except for the gate at West \nYellowstone, Montana. The terrain and elevation at Wyoming's East Gate \nis so rugged and high that it is impractical for snow coaches to travel \nin that area of the park. Sylvan Pass reaches an elevation of 8,530 \nfeet and is surrounded by mountains that rise well over 10,000 feet on \none side, and gorges with sheet drops of several thousand feet on the \nother. This is definitely not a place for a snow coach.\n  Furthermore, by moving the southern access point from Flag Ranch to \nColter Bay, the Park Service makes any southern day trip into \nYellowstone an impossible 113 miles round trip. This also creates a \nserious safety problem for Idaho snow groomers who, in the past, filled \nup their gas tanks at Flag Ranch. Under the current proposal, these \nfacilities will be closed and the groomers will not have enough gas to \nmake one complete round trip. This creates a serious safety problem and \nshuts off access to more than 60 miles of non-Park Service trails.\n  Once again, I would like to reiterate that the complete banning of \nsnowmobiles is not the only available alternative for national park \nrecreational winter use. For the past three years, I have worked with \nthe communities surrounding Yellowstone to develop a more practical and \nmore inclusive approach to Yellowstone winter use.\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nAfter holding dozens of meetings with residents and business owners, we \nhave been able to create a proposal that preserves the park's \nenvironmental health while at the same time ensuring future access--for \neveryone. This amendment will enable the Park Service to rethink its \nactions and hopefully incorporate a more positive approach to winter \nmanagement.\n  I grew up spending time in Yellowstone where grandparents camped \ninside the park all summer. I have been back many times since, \nsometimes on a snowmobile. In fact, I get there every year. Over the \nyears the park has improved, not been overrun or run down as efforts \nmostly to get additional funds imply. Anyone who knows and loves \nYellowstone like I do can attest to the fact that there is room enough \nfor wildlife, snowmobiles, snowshoers, cross country skiers and snow \ncoaches in Yellowstone, and a reasonable compromise can be reached to \ninclude all of these uses, that is unless federal officials don't step \nin first and ensure everyone is excluded. Wildlife and human enjoyment \nof the wildlife are not mutually exclusive. Good administration would \naccommodate both.\n  The study outlined in this amendment would establish a necessary \nfirst step in restoring access, not just to the park, but to the land \nplanning process, for those people who will bear the brunt of the Park \nService's decision to ban snowmobiles. Clearly, the Park Service's \ndecision in this matter is an arbitrary decision that bypassed local \ncommunities, counties, states and even Congress. The Park Service needs \nthe direction provided for in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand in support of my colleague from \nWyoming on his amendment.\n  I was quite surprised when Senator Reid of Nevada spoke on the floor \nabout this issue because I heard what he was saying before. It was \ngiven in testimony before the Subcommittee on Parks, chaired by the \nSenator from Wyoming, by the national environmental groups. He was \nfollowing their script. Their script says: Get all of the snowmobiles \nout of the park. For some reason that impacts the parks. I have ridden \nsnowmobiles in Yellowstone. I am not sure the Senator from Nevada has. \nI am not sure many Senators have. I don't dispute the need to manage \nthe number of snowmobiles and the entry of snowmobiles where they \ntravel.\n  But arbitrarily and without justification, Assistant Secretary \nBarry--who has now fled to the Wilderness Society once he tried to \naccomplish his damage here in this administration with the Park \nService--came before the committee and emphatically said they had to \ngo. In a press conference a few days prior to that hearing in almost a \ndefiant, arrogant way, he said he was going to take all of them out of \nthe parks, finish the rulemaking in Yellowstone, and so be it--failing \nto recognize the industries that have built up around snowmobiling at \nboth entrances to Yellowstone Park; failing to deal with them in a \nresponsible, cooperative way--so that he could ensure the mantra of the \nClinton administration, and that public lands generate economies in \nrecreation and tourism.\n  Here quite the opposite was going on--no economy, everything for the \nenvironment, even though the facts bear out that you can still have an \neconomy, meaning people on snowmobiles in Yellowstone in the \nwintertime, and still protect the environment.\n  How do you accomplish that? You work with the industry. What do you \ndo with the industry? You ask them to redesign their sleds so they make \nlittle to no noise and very little pollution --if there is any of \nconsequence that would damage the environment to begin with.\n  What does the industry say? They can do it. In fact, last winter they \nwere operating in Yellowstone with a prototype put out by one of the \nsnowmobile manufacturers. It was a four-cycle instead of a two-cycle \nengine. The Senator from Nevada was bemoaning the pollution of the two-\ncycle. We now know they can produce a four-cycle that will be certainly \nless environmentally damaging. They are willing to do that.\n  The moment the industry said to the Park Service we can supply you \nwith a new sled that meets these standards, the Park Service says: Oh, \nwell, it wasn't air pollution, it wasn't noise pollution, it was \nwildlife harassment.\n  Somehow the wildlife of Yellowstone is going through some emotional \nproblem as a result of snowmobiles trafficking by recreationists on a \ndaily basis. I am not quite sure they have had any examples of these \nwildlife species in therapy. But somehow they seem to know a great deal \nabout it.\n  The bottom line is simply this: The environmentalists have told this \nadministration they want snowmobiles out of the parks.\n  I suggest to the National Park Service that they have a real problem \non their hands in management. In other words, they are denying public \naccess to parks that were designed to protect the environment and also \nallow public access. They have a crisis in management.\n  They don't have an environmental problem in Yellowstone, they have a \nmanagement problem, a failure on the part of this administration, and \ncertainly this President, to recognize the cooperative balance between \nthe environment and the public and how one benefits from creating this \nkind of balance for all to benefit from.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note another Senator interested in the \nsubject. I note there are 55 minutes between now and 6:15. I have a \nminimum of 3 amendments that I know are going to be debated and will \nrequire votes, and perhaps five. While there are no limitations on \nthis, I appreciate it being concluded relatively quickly so we can go \nto the Senator from Nevada. His amendment will be contested, and there \nwill be more after that. We are scheduled to go off this bill, for \ngood, except for votes, at 6:15.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for giving an \nevaluation of the time remaining on the amendments that must be dealt \nwith. I know the chairman has been struggling since around 3:15 to get \nSenators to debate the amendments, and now all of a sudden they appear \non the floor in the last minutes.\n  I conclude my debate. The Senator from Montana, I know, wants to \nspeak to this issue. It impacts his State and the economy of his State. \nOnce again I say to the administration, shame on you for taking people \nout of the environment, all in the name of the environment. It doesn't \nseem a very good solution to me, if you are going to tout tourism and \nrecreation to us western States as an alternative to the elimination of \nthe extractive resource industries that have provided economies to our \nStates for the last 100-plus years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. It will not take long to make the point. I will facilitate \neverything, as the chairman of the subcommittee wants.\n  If Members want to talk about wildlife in Yellowstone, you will see \nvery little variety in wildlife in Yellowstone in the wintertime. If \nyou have been there, you know that about the only thing you will see is \nbison. Let me tell you, you don't bother them with a little old \nsnowmobile. They are just walking around, and they go wherever they \nwant to, whenever they want to. So let's not be worried about the \nbison. Whether you agree with it or not, there are too many bison in \nthe park. We have grazed that country right into the ground.\n  I remind Members that those who operate the snowmobiles out of West \nYellowstone have gone to the Park Service and said: We will make \narrangements to prevent line-ups at the gate, we will get new, cleaner, \nquieter machines, we will work with you in order to protect the \nenvironment of Yellowstone Park.\n  There will be more people in a week this summer through the park than \nall of next winter. You cannot even get through that park for traffic \nright now. One of these days, you will have to go to a gate and pick a \nnumber and they call your number and you get to go to the park. The \nimpact is in the summer, not in the winter, no matter what you are \nriding. It could be an old gray horse or a snowmobile, it doesn't make \nany difference. And are we concerned about that?\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n  Let's not be shocked. The Senator from Wyoming has a good idea. It is \ntime we take a realistic look at this, do the study, and go forward \nwith the recommendations that are made.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency has \nissued proposed regulations governing the emissions of snowmobiles in \nour National Park System. It is very clear that these vehicles cause \nbig problems. Why do I say that? A single snowmobile belches out the \nsame pollution that 20 automobiles do. One snowmobile equals the \npollution of 20 passenger cars.\n  Also, my friend from Tennessee earlier talked about the air pollution \nin the Great Smoky Mountains because of coal-fired generating plants in \nthat area. There isn't much that can be done, at this stage at least, \nto stop those longstanding power producers from generating the \nemissions they do. But there is something we can do to stop air \npollution from developing as it has in our National Park System.\n  It is a national disgrace that the levels of toxic pollution, such as \ncarbon monoxide--in Yellowstone National Park, to pick just one--rival \nmajor urban centers such as Los Angeles and Denver. I repeat, it is a \nnational disgrace that levels of toxic pollutants such as carbon \nmonoxide, in our national parks--especially Yellowstone--at times, \nrival major urban centers such as Los Angeles and Denver. That is \nsignificant.\n  But what is being proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency is \nnothing that is going to eliminate snowmobiling in our country.\n  For example, of the more than 130,000 miles of designated snowmobile \ntrails in the United States, less than 1,000 of those miles are in \nnational parks--to be exact, there are 600 miles. So this furor, and \nthe offering of this amendment, to eliminate this proposal to stop the \nair pollution of snowmobiles in national parks is really a red herring. \nThere are other places you can ride snowmobiles. In fact, you can ride \nthem over 129,000 miles in the United States alone. We need not ride \nthem this 600 miles in national parks.\n  Appropriate access to national parks is important, but such access \ndoes not include all forms of transportation at all times. Protecting \nparks from air, water, and noise pollution, for the enjoyment of all \nAmericans, should be our No. 1 goal.\n  I am very happy that the Senator from Tennessee spoke earlier about \nhow important national parks are. I agree with him. We are the envy of \nthe rest of the world with our national parks.\n  Yosemite, Great Basin National Park, Yellowstone National Park--these \nwonderful gems of nature, that we are attempting to preserve, need to \nbe preserved.\n  The amendment would prohibit the Park Service from doing its job to \nprotect some of America's most awe-inspiring national treasures. The \nlandscape of our national parks should reflect the wonders of our \nCreator, which I think we have an obligation to protect. National parks \ndo not need to serve as racetracks for noisy, high-polluting snow \nmachines.\n  The State of Nevada shares Lake Tahoe with California. We wish we had \nall of Lake Tahoe, but we do not mind sharing it with California. It is \na wonderful, beautiful lake. There is only one other lake like it in \nthe world, and that is Lake Bakal in the former Soviet Union, now \nRussia, an alpine glacial lake. Lake Tahoe it is very deep--not as deep \nas Lake Bakal, which is over 5,000 feet deep, but very deep. It was \nonly 35 years ago they found the bottom of Lake Tahoe. It is extremely \ncold. It is beautiful. It is emerald colored.\n  But one of the things contributing to the ruination of Lake Tahoe is \ntwo-stroke engines. They were outlawed last year. I am glad they were \noutlawed. People may complain: What are we going to do for recreation?\n  There are plenty of things to do for recreation without these two-\nstroke engines. They are gone now. The lake is less polluted. It sounds \nbetter. Two-stroke engines are also the engines that snowmobiles use. \nThey have been outlawed at Lake Tahoe. Why? Because they are \ninefficient, highly polluting, and contribute disproportionately to the \ndecline of the lake's legendary clarity and degradation of its water \nquality.\n  Our national parks deserve similar protection from the pollution \nproduced by these snow machines.\n  In sum, the use of snowmobiles currently prevents adequate protection \nof air and water quality for wildlife. Damage is being done to national \nparks not some time in the future but right now. The unnecessary delay \ncaused by this amendment would allow further damage to our parks.\n  Congress should allow individual parks that currently allow \nsnowmobiling to go through a public comment process to determine what \ncourse of action is appropriate. This amendment would eliminate that.\n  EPA agrees that the Park Service has the primary and immediate duty \nto take action to protect parks from snowmobile impacts. In comments on \nthe draft EIS for winter use at Yellowstone, EPA said:\n\n       We encourage the National Park Service to take the steps \n     necessary to protect human health and the environment \n     immediately rather than to depend on future regulations \n     of off-highway vehicle engines from EPA.\n\n  They are saying let's not wait for us to do it. The Park Service has \nan obligation to do it right now. Postponing Park Service action on the \nsnowmobile issue is a delay tactic, pure and simple.\n  The amendment we are debating assumes there is an inherent right of \nsnowmobiles to run wild in the national parks, irrespective of their \nimpact on other users and the environment. This is a very flawed \nassumption. They have no inherent right to run wild in national parks.\n  All Americans have the right to enjoy our national parks but only in \nways that do not damage the parks. Prohibiting snowmobiles in national \nparks will have an insignificant impact on recreational opportunities \navailable to snowmobilers. Again, there are more than 130,000 miles of \ndesignated trails in the United States, and less than 1,000 of those \nmiles are in national parks. That is less than 1 percent.\n  Because millions of acres of public lands are already open to public \nsnowmobiling, banning snow machines in national parks does not prevent \nrecreationists from using their vehicles. It just prevents them from \nusing the most sensitive and heavily visited public lands.\n  Arguing that every form of recreational access should be allowed in \nnational parks is silly. Visitors do not need to jet boat in Crater \nLake National Park. Visitors do not need to ride dirt bikes in the \nGrand Canyon. Visitors do not need to bungee jump from the Washington \nMonument.\n  Prohibitions against such activities do not restrict Americans' \naccess to our parks; rather, they indicate a willingness to protect \nparks for the enjoyment of all visitors.\n  Great Basin National Park in Nevada already prohibits snowmobile use. \nGlacier and Yosemite Parks do not allow snowmobile use.\n  What are some of the environmental problems caused by snowmobiles in \nnational parks?\n  Environmental analyses done at Yellowstone and elsewhere have shown \nthat snowmobiles can seriously damage park resources. According to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, existing scientific evidence ``clearly \nand convincingly demonstrates [that] current snowmobile use is \nadversely affecting the natural . . . aesthetic . . . and scenic \nvalues'' in Yellowstone.\n  Air pollution: Yellowstone and several other national parks are \nrecognized as Class I airsheds under the Clean Air Act. The Park \nService is required by law to protect these areas from any degradation. \nThe presence of snowmobiles in the park makes that task virtually \nimpossible.\n  Air quality monitors at Yellowstone's west entrance have found carbon \nmonoxide levels that rival or exceed those found in major urban areas \nsuch as Denver and Los Angeles.\n  Snowmobiles account for up to 68 percent of Yellowstone's annual \ncarbon monoxide emissions and up to 90 percent of hydrocarbon \nemissions, even through automobiles out number them 16 to 1.\n  Water pollution: Every winter, snowmobiles spew unburned fuel into \nthe snow in national parks and ultimately into their rivers and lakes.\n  Contaminants released by snowmobiles two-stroke engines include \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\n  PAHs in water are toxic to aquatic life, and MTBE is an identified \nhuman health hazard\n  Noise pollution: The preservation of natural sounds is a major \nnational park management objective,\n  A study of snowmobile noise interfered with visitors' ability to hear \nnatural sounds at 12 out of 13 popular locations, including Morning \nGlory Pool, Grand Prismatic Spring, and other destinations. At Old \nFaithful, the world's most famous geyser, snowmobile engines were the \ndominant sound 100 percent of the time.\n  Wildlife impacts: The NPS Biological Resources Division found that \n``snowmobile usage adversely affects wildlife.''\n  Noise and the physical presence of snowmobiles cause animals to alter \ntheir activity patterns, This behavioral response is of concern because \nsnowmobile use occurs when food supplies are low and an animal's \nability to conserve energy may be critical to its survival.\n  Heavily used snowmobile routes can cut off winter migration paths \nused by park wildlife.\n  Conflicts with other park visitors: Snowmobiles detract from other \npeople's experience in the national parks. A 1996 visitor use study \nconducted in Yellowstone found many people who reported that encounters \nwith snowmobiles were the least enjoyable part of their park visit \nbecause of the noise, pollution, and impact on wildlife viewing.\n  How will restrictions on national parks affect other recreational \nsnowmobiling opportunities?\n  According to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association \nthere are approximately 230,000 miles of groomed and marked snowmobile \ntrails in North America, and about 130,000 miles in the United States. \nThis does not include areas such as national forest roads that are open \nto snowmobiles but not explicitly designated for snowmobiles. In \ncontrast, there are only about 600 miles of roads and waterways open to \nsnowmobile in national parks in the continental United States, and 300 \nof those miles are excluded from the NPS April 26 announcement. Closing \nnational parks will not diminish recreation opportunities for \nsnowmobiles, but it will help reduce noise, pollution, and congestion \nin Yellowstone and other parks.\n  Many states have thousands of miles of designated trails for \nsnowmobilers to enjoy. Promotional material from the state of Wyoming \ndoes not even mention Yellowstone National Park, but does promise that \n``with over 2,200 miles of snowmobile trails, you can access some of \nthe most scenic back-country in the world.'' (See attachment #8)\n  Snowmobile opportunities in other States include: Colorado, over \n3,000 miles of trails; Idaho, over 7,200 miles of trails; Maine, over \n12,000 miles of trails; Michigan, 5,800 miles of trails; Minnesota, \n14,000 miles of trails; and Montana, over 2,500 miles of trails.\n  How much snowmobile use is there in the national parks?\n  There are 42 units of the National Park System that allow \nsnowmobiles, 28 of these parks are in the continental U.S. Over 175,000 \nsnowmobiles use these 28 parks annually. The five parks with the most \nannual use are: Yellowstone, 65,000 are 1.5 million registered \nsnowmobiles in the United States.\n  How will this affect individual national parks?\n  The National Park Service action DOES NOT immediately ban snowmobile \nuse in all national parks. Late this summer, the Park Service plans to \nrelease a proposed rule that will amend its overall snowmobile \nregulation, 36 CFR 2.18 and address each of the parks that currently \nallow snowmobiles. This proposed rule would modify or amend those \nspecial regulations to bring parks into compliance with the Executive \nOrders, statutes, and regulations. Public comments will be incorporated \nbefore the rule is made final.\n  For example, approximately 80 percent of existing snowmobile use at \nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore is expected to continue. and at St. \nCroix National Scenic Riverway, an annual ``Winterfest'' celebration \nthat includes snowmobiles is expected to continue under a special use \npermit.\n  There are arguments by opponents of Park Service regulations.\n  Argument: A snowcoach system in Yellowstone would deny visitors \naccess to the park.\n  Response: The snowcoach system proposed by the Park Service for \nYellowstone and Grand Teton national parks will provide park visitors \naccess to all of the areas currently open to snowmobile visitors.\n  The only access proposed to be limited is that of backcountry ski and \nsnowshoe visitors in off-trail areas of critical winter wildlife \nhabitat.\n  The snowcoach system will allow the same number, if not more, of \nvisitors to enter the park each winter, while reducing the number of \nvehicles by 90% (assuming average capacities of one person per \nsnowmobile and the ten per snowcoach).\n  There is a tendency to confuse access with recreational use. \nSnowmobiles as currently used are a form of recreation. The parks have \na duty to determine the means of access to park attractions that cause \nthe least damage to resources. In no way is public access being eroded, \nrather a recreational pursuit is being eliminated due to its negative \nimpacts on park resources. A less damaging mode of transportation will \nbe substituted to allow visitor access to the parks.\n  Proposals to allow snowmobiles but to cap their numbers would \nessentially limit the numbers of winter visitors to the park. People \nare not the problem in the parks. Noisy, polluting machines are what's \nneeded to be limited.\n  In relation to economic impacts--argument: The Yellowstone gateway \ncommunities are uniformly opposed to the removal of snowmobiles because \nit will destroy their winter economies.\n  Response: Scores of businesspeople in West Yellowstone, MT, the main \nwinter gateway to Yellowstone, have raised their voices in support of \nremoval of snowmobiles from the park. Several representatives of the \ncommunity/business owner organization West Yellowstone Citizens for a \nHealthy Park traveled to Washington, D.C. this spring to tell Congress \nthat the health of their local economy depends on the health of \nYellowstone National Park.\n  Current snowmobile use in Yellowstone creates numerous problems of \nsafety, noise and air pollution in gateway communities. A change in \nwinter park transportation will allow for much-desired diversification \nof gateway economies.\n  In relation to improved technology--Argument: The regulation of \nsnowmobiles in national parks should be delayed until new snowmobile \ntechnologies are available.\n  Response: The EPA has explicitly told the Park Service not to wait \nfor upcoming EPA regulations: ``This DEIS includes extensive analysis \nof the effects from current winter use and that analysis demonstrates \nsignificant environmental and human health impacts. We encourage NPS to \ntake the steps necessary to protect human health and the environment \nimmediately rather than to depend on future regulation of OHV engines \nfrom EPA.'' EPA comments on Draft EIS for Winter Use Plans, Yellowstone \nand Grand Teton National Parks and John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial \nParkway, Region 8 EPA, Denver, CO.\n  EPA regulations will not address noise emissions from snowmobiles and \nmay not require air emissions stringent enough to protect park air \nquality.\n  Compliance with park regulations and laws regarding wildlife, noise \nand visitor conflict will not be addressed by the development of \nsnowmobiles with less air pollution.\n  Less polluting snowmobiles would not address the mass transit needs \nof the parks. Many parks are adopting mass transit using the cleanest, \nquietest technologies available; this is also the case in Yellowstone. \nTransportation alternatives to the one-person, one vehicle model have \nbeen implemented in Acadia and Denali, and will soon be in place in \nGrand Canyon, Zion and Yosemite National Parks. The NPS should be a \nleader in promoting clean, quiet and affordable modes of group \ntransportation that are protective of the natural qualities of the \nparks.\n  Recognizing that it is the vehicles, not the people at the root of \nthe problem, Yellowstone in winter is a natural place to look next for \nexpansion of the alternative transportation program already taking \nplace in the Park System.\n  In relation to the history of Snowmobiling in Yellowstone National \nPark, in 1963, the first snowmobile enters Yellowstone. In 1973-1974, \n30,000\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nsnowmobiles enter Yellowstone. In 1972 the National Park Service \nRegional Director asked all parks to devise winter use plans. Glacier \nNational Park undertook such a review and noted the variety of problems \ncaused by snowmobiling in the park including air and noise pollution, \nwildlife disturbance and conflicts with other park users. For these \nreasons and because of strong public sentiment against disrupting the \nquiet and beauty of Glacier National Park with snowmobiles, the park \ndecided to ban them. Yosemite, Sequoia/Kings Canyon, Lassen and others \nfollowed suit.\n  Yellowstone, however, did not follow the directive to assess the \nimpact of snowmobiles on park resources. Complaints from visitors and \npark rangers concerning air and noise pollution grew commonplace and \nthe first studies documenting adverse impacts to wildlife from \nsnowmobile use were completed. Future superintendents of Yellowstone \nallowed further expansion of snowmobiling in the park despite ongoing \nconcerns about air and noise pollution and wildlife impacts. Finally, \nin the 1990s conditions in Yellowstone and Grand Teton grew so bad that \nthe parks were forced to take action.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss \nthe rulemaking that has been proposed by the National Park Service to \nlimit the use of snowmobiles in national parks.\n  National parks are the crown jewels of our nation's system of public \nlands. They harbor diverse wildlife, rare and beautiful species of \nplants and spectacular geological formations. In my home state of South \nDakota, the Badlands National Park is home to a rich trove of ancient \nfossils and it provides important habitat for the black-tailed prairie \ndog and black-footed ferret.\n  I support the efforts of the National Park Service to ensure that \nthese lands remain pristine so that future generations of Americans can \nenjoy them. I also understand the strong desire of many snowmobilers to \ncontinue to have wintertime access to these lands, where the activity \nhas been enjoyed for many years.\n  While snowmobiling does not currently take place in national parks in \nSouth Dakota, there is a great deal of interest in this issue in the \nstate and support for appropriately managed access to national parks. \nBy carefully managing the parks, I believe that we can provide this \naccess in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of the environment \nand to those who go to public lands in search of solitude and quiet.\n  Today, Secretary Bruce Babbitt wrote me to describe in greater detail \nhow the National Park Service intends to proceed in coming months. I \nbelieve that it is critical for the agency to review a variety of \noptions for managing snowmobiles and to ensure a full opportunity for \npublic comment. According to the Secretary's letter, the agency does \nnot intend to ban snowmobiles, but will proceed with a rulemaking and \npublic comment period that will allow a full analysis of this issue and \nprovide options for the controlled use of snowmobiles in national \nparks. I look forward to continuing to discuss this issue with my \ncolleagues, the administration, representatives of environmental groups \nand snowmobiling enthusiasts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary Babbitt be \nincluded in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                        Washington, July 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am responding to your recent \n     request for clarification of the status of National Park \n     Service actions on the use of snowmobiles in national parks. \n     Since there have been some misperceptions about what the \n     Service has done, I appreciate the opportunity to provide \n     this clarification.\n       In response to a petition for a rulemaking, the National \n     Park Service has reviewed the snowmobile use that is now \n     allowed in 42 of the 379 units of the national park system. \n     That review, including a review by the Office of the \n     Solicitor of the Department, had led us to conclude that much \n     of the snowmobile use that is now occurring is not consistent \n     with the requirements of Executive Orders 11644 and 11898, \n     issued by Presidents Nixon and Carter, and other legal \n     requirements. Accordingly, in April the Department and the \n     Service announced that we would undertake a new rulemaking to \n     modify the existing system-wide general rule (36 CFR 2.18), \n     and additional park-specific special rules, to bring them \n     into compliance with the applicable legal requirements. We \n     did not announce that any decision had been made, but instead \n     that we intend to initiate a rulemaking process. In that \n     process, we will comply with all established requirements for \n     rulemaking, including the requirements for seeking and \n     considering public comments. It is our current intent to \n     publish by mid-September a proposed rule, for public comment, \n     to begin the formal process of making these changes.\n       Until a new rulemaking is completed, the existing rules on \n     snowmobile use in the national parks remain in effect.\n       We will seek public comment on a proposed rule generally \n     following the format of the existing rule, which prohibits \n     snowmobile use in national parks except in certain instances. \n     The draft rule has not yet been completed, but, when \n     finalized, it would not affect snowmobile use opportunities \n     in national park system areas for the following purposes: For \n     access to private, or other non-federal property; for access \n     across national parks to reach private or other public lands \n     that are open to snowmobiles use; where the roads through \n     national parks are not under federal jurisdiction; and as \n     authorized in specific national park enabling statutes (i.e., \n     with respect to national parks in Alaska and Voyaguers \n     National Park).\n       In addition, as a result of settlement of litigation, the \n     National Park Service is in the final stages of preparing a \n     Winter Use Management Plan and EIS for Yellowstone and Grand \n     Teton National Parks. The final decisions on winter use have \n     not been made there, but those decisions will determine \n     future winter use management in these two parks, including \n     the use of snowmobiles.\n       If we do propose a rule containing these elements, and if, \n     following public comment, we finalize a rule along these \n     lines, the net effect would be that some level of snowmobile \n     use would continue in about 30 of the 42 national parks where \n     it is now allowed. Of course, since the proposed rule will be \n     subject to public review and comment, we are likely to \n     consider additional alternatives during this process and a \n     different outcome could result.\n       To summarize, the National Park Service has not made any \n     final decisions on what changes to make in the snowmobile use \n     that is allowed in national parks, and any decisions we make \n     will be made following public comment and in compliance with \n     other requirements for agency rulemaking. I appreciate the \n     opportunity to clarify this.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment \non the issue of snowmobiling in Yellowstone.\n  It is pretty clear to anyone who has visited Yellowstone during the \nwinter that changes need to be made to protect the park. I have met \nwith folks on all sides of this issue, and I think that most people \nagree that the noise, air pollution and wildlife impacts are \nunacceptable and have to be addressed.\n  Yellowstone is the engine for local economies and is part of our \nnational heritage. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to make \nsure that we don't harm the park and its wildlife.\n  That having been said, I don't think we need an outright ban. I \nbelieve that we can protect the park and its wildlife in other ways. \nAlready, people have put forth a number of creative alternatives to \nmeet these goals, including limiting the number of snowmobiles allowed \nin the park, requiring clean and quiet machines, and using guided \ntours.\n  I think we need to explore all these alternatives and work together \nto strike a common-sense balance that best serves Yellowstone and \nMontana. A balance that protects the Park, the local economies and \ninvolves people on all sides of this issue.\n  As my colleagues in this body know, I am not in favor of legislating \non appropriations bills. I am pleased that the Senate has decided to \nnot pursue that route for the time being. It is my hope that the \ncurrent administrative process that is underway for Yellowstone will \nproduce an administrative compromise that protects Yellowstone National \nPark and provides for a broad range of visitor uses of the Park.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3800, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Montana and the other Members \nwho have joined.\n  There is no one in this place who is a stronger supporter of national \nparks than I. I continue to support the national parks. Here is a \nchance to find some alternative ways to do that.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for giving time.\n  I do not intend to ask for a vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Senator withdrawing the amendment?\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will withdraw the amendment. I intend to withdraw the \namendment to try to find a mutual resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for that gesture. I \nsupport the cause to which he has spoken. If there is a way to get at \nleast part of that adopted, I will try to find it.\n  I express my appreciation to my friend from Nevada to whom I made a \npromise about debating this amendment earlier that I could not keep. He \nhas been most understanding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the distinguished leader's comments. The \nSenator from Washington has honored his commitment because, as the \nSenator knows, I had a previous commitment earlier in the day. I thank \nthe Senator for his accommodation.\n  As I understand the parliamentary status, I will need to seek \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment for the purpose of \noffering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3883\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, and Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, proposes an amendment numbered 3883.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To reduce the Forest Service timber sale budget by \n    $30,000,000 and increase the wildland fire management budget by \n                              $15,000,000)\n\n       On page 164, line 19, strike ``$1,233,824,000,'' and insert \n     ``$1,203,824,000,''.\n       On page 164, line 23, strike ``(16 U.S.C. 460l6a(i)):'' and \n     insert ``(16 U.S.C. 460l6a(i)), of which $220,844,000 shall \n     be available for forest products:''.\n       On page 165, beginning on line 6, strike ``Provided'' and \n     all that follows through ``accomplishment:'' on lines 11 and \n     12.\n       On page 165, line 25, strike ``$618,500,000, to remain \n     available until expended:'' and insert ``$633,500,000, to \n     remain available until expended, of which $419,593,000 shall \n     be available for preparedness and fire use functions:''.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment with my \ncolleague from Illinois that is a win-win for the American taxpayer and \nfor those communities that reside near our National Forests.\n  The Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment will cut $30 million from the Forest \nService's money losing timber program and shift $15 million to needed \nfire planning and preparedness activities.\n  Thee is a crucial need for increased fire planning on our National \nForests.\n  Our amendment responds to the findings of a recent internal Forest \nService report that found that the agency was violating its own \nNational Fire Management Policy due to the lack of ``Fire Management \nPlans'' for each national forest.\n  The report indicated that fire management planning has not been a \npriority within the Forest Service, with less than 5 percent of the \nNational Forests having current, approved fire plans.\n  The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy calls for ``every area \nwith burnable vegetation [to] have an approved Fire Management Plan.''\n  The Wildland Fire program protects life, property, and natural \nresources on the 192 million acres of National Forest System lands as \nwell as an additional 20 million acres of adjacent State and private \nlands that are protected through fee or reciprocal protection \nagreements.\n  In my home state of Nevada, we have a multi-jurisdictional \nfirefighting organization known as the Sierra Front, which is comprised \nof federal, state, and local fire management agencies. I might say, \nparenthetically, in my experience both as a former Governor and as a \nmember of this body, the Sierra Front has done an extraordinary job in \nterms of coordinating and preparing its own activities and is relied \nupon by local, State, as well as national forest administrators for a \ncoordinated effort.\n\n  There are similar organizations in other States, and all of these \norganizations depend heavily on Federal fire preparedness funds for \nnecessary training and organizational planning activities.\n  The amendment we offer will provide an additional $15 million for the \nForest Service to enhance its capability to prevent, detect, or take \nprompt, effective, official suppression action on wildlife fires.\n  There is a financial benefit, a cost-benefit analysis that needs to \nbe considered. I bring my colleagues' attention to an internal Forest \nService report issued earlier this year entitled ``Policy implications \nof large fire management, the strategic assessment of factors \ninfluencing the cost.'' I think our colleagues will be interested to \nknow that this report concludes that estimates have shown that for \nevery dollar of appropriated preparedness dollars received, there is a \nsavings of $5 to $7 in fire suppression and emergency rehabilitation \nfunds spent.\n  The point that needs to be made is, a little fire management planning \ngoes a long way to reduce and to minimize the overall impact when fire \ncomes because of the training, the planning, and the preparedness \nactivities that go on as a result of that. That is a dollar savings to \nthe American taxpayer and, in my judgment, is a very prudent \nexpenditure of Federal dollars.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding this assessment, the myth that \ncommercial logging is the best method of fuels reduction is driving \nsome of my colleagues to appropriate more funds for the timber program \nat the expense of needed fire plans for national forests, increased \neducation for residents on wildland boundaries, and on fire \npreparedness activities. In fact, to the contrary, it is widely \nrecognized in the scientific community that past commercial logging and \nassociated roadbuilding activities are the prime culprits for the \nseverity of many of our wildfires.\n  Commercial logging removes the least flammable portion of trees--\ntheir main stems or trunks, while leaving behind their most flammable \nportions--their needles and limbs, directly on the ground. Untreated \nlogging slash can adversely affect fire behavior for up to 30 years \nfollowing the logging operations.\n  According to the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project report, issued in \n1996 by the Federal Government,\n\n     timber harvest, through its effects on forest structure, \n     local microclimate and fuel accumulation, has increased fire \n     severity more than any other recent human activity.\n\n  In addition, a recent GAO report stated that:\n\n       Mechanically removing fuels through commercial timber \n     harvesting and other means can also have adverse effects on \n     wildlife habitat and water quality in many areas. Officials \n     told GAO that, because of these effects, a large-scale \n     expansion of commercial timber harvesting alone for removing \n     materials would not be feasible. However, because the Forest \n     Service relies on the timber program for funding many of its \n     other activities, including reducing fuels, it has often used \n     this program to address the wildfire problem. The difficulty \n     with such an approach, however, is that the lands with \n     commercially valuable timber are often not those with the \n     greatest wildfire hazards.\n\n  Logging causes adverse changes in forest composition--intensive \nthinning and clearcutting dry out soils and leave behind debris that \nbecomes tinder dry in open clearcuts.\n  Congress should invest in proactive fire planning and non-commercial \nhazardous fuels reduction projects as the best means of avoiding the \nhigh costs to taxpayers, damage to ecosystems, and risk to firefighters \nfrom reactive, unplanned, emergency fire suppression actions.\n  This bill contains $250 million for the administration of the timber \nsale program, which is more than $30 million above the Administration's \nbudget request.\n  These expenditures for a money losing timber program are an enormous \ndrain on the Treasury.\n  In their most recent Forest Management Program Annual Report, July, \n1998, the Forest Service admits to losing $88.6 million from their \ntimber program in FY97.\n  This was the second consecutive year that the Forest Service reported \na loss.\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\n  In addition to the reported loss, the $88.6 million figure excludes a \nfull accounting of all costs associated with logging.\n  In past fiscal years, independent analyses estimate the loss from \nbelow-cost timber sales are far greater than those reported by the \nForest Service.\n  The General Accounting Office estimated that the timber program cost \ntaxpayers at least $2 billion from 1922 to 1997, and in recent \ntestimony they indicated that ``[t]he Forest Service is still years \naway from providing the Congress and the public with a clear \nunderstanding of what is being accomplished with taxpayer dollars.''\n  Our amendment would reduce funding for the Forest Service's timber \nprogram by $30 million to the level requested by the Administration.\n  In spite of the fact that our National Forest supply a mere 4% of our \nnation's annual timber harvest, this bill continues to reflect the \ndominance of the timber program at the expense of other programs \ndesigned to improve forest health and enhance the public's enjoyment of \nour national forest.\n  Over 380,000 miles of roads criss-cross the national forests--that is \nover eight times the distance of the Federal Interstate Highway \nSystem--and, in addition, there are an additional 40,000 miles of \nuniventoried roads.\n  The Forest Service estimates that over 80% of these roads are not \nmaintained to public safety and environmental standards.\n  As a matter of public policy, I would argue that it makes more sense \nto maintain the roads we already have than to spend money building new \nroads we don't need for a logging program that costs taxpayers millions \nof dollars each year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment to cut \nwasteful subsidies for the commercial timber industry and to enhance \nthe Forest Service's ability to combat the devastating wildfires \nconfronting many of our communities in the West.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been listening with great interest \nfor the last several minutes as the Senator from Nevada made his \npresentation in relation to an amendment to take $30 million out of the \ntimber program. He has given the reason that we have a catastrophic \nsituation in the West today--some 39 million acres of our public \ntimbered lands are in a critical situation as it relates to stand-\naltering fires, and we ought to do better planning. Therefore, we ought \nto take the money out to do better planning so we could circumvent this \nsituation. And, oh, by the way, logging exacerbates that problem by \nleaving some slash on the ground.\n  The argument of the Senator might have some modicum of validity if we \nhad not done what we did last week. Last week, we passed Senator Pete \nDomenici's bill for which the Senator from Nevada voted. We put $240 \nmillion, not $30 million--$240 million in a fuel reduction program. In \nfact, the Forest Service says it funds entirely, Senator Bryan, all \nthat they can do. It even provides additional money for planning. So, \nreally, the fire issue should be set aside in your debate, based on the \nactions of the Senate last week. I think what the Senate did last week \nis responsible, to put that kind of money into fuel reduction, \nespecially in the urban interface and in those areas of the kind we saw \nat Los Alamos, in New Mexico, where we saw hundreds of homes go up in \nsmoke as a result of bad policy and bad management on the part of this \nadministration coming together.\n  What are we talking about, then, if the fire issue has been dealt \nwith appropriately by this Senate? If what we are talking about is the \nexisting timber program that obviously the Senator from Nevada opposes, \nas do many environmental groups that he finds himself here on the floor \ntoday representing, then the fire issue I think is relatively moot. So \nlet's talk about the timber sale program.\n  What the Senator from Nevada is doing when he talks about it being a \nmoney loser is he is taking money out of a program from a portion of \nthe program that really is the money maker. So he is fulfilling a \nprophesy of argument that somehow this will continue to be a money \nloser, and most assuredly it will be if you take money from that kind \nof program.\n  Let me talk about the program for a few moments, where it is as a \npart of an overall forest policy in our Nation, and why it is important \nwe keep some approach to a timber program, whether it is for green \nsales to supply dimensional timber to the housing industry of our \nNation, or whether it is for the purpose of thinning and reducing the \noverall burden of the number of trees within a stand of timber, \ntherefore increasing the viability of forest health in our Nation's \nforests.\n  Those 39 million acres of timberland that are in critical condition \ntoday across our Nation are, in fact, a result of the overstocking of \nthese acreages. Some 400-plus trees per acre now exist on land that 100 \nyears ago, long before man was out there logging them, had only 60 \ntrees per acre.\n  As a result, we need a concentrated program of management for fuels \nreduction for fire, but I also think we can reasonably argue that we \ncan take some of those trees out for timber, logging, home building, \npurposes for the Nation's economy.\n  Let me give an example of where we are with the industry at this \nmoment and why I think it is important we discuss it.\n  On this first chart, it shows in 1989 there were about 150,000 jobs \nin the timber industry nationwide. In 1997, that had been reduced to \nabout 55,000 timber jobs, almost a two-thirds reduction in overall \nemployment that is in direct correspondence, in part, to the amount of \nlogging that goes on.\n  Since the Clinton administration has come to Washington, its timber \npolicies have reduced logging on our national forests by over 80 \npercent nationwide--an 80-percent reduction nationwide in overall \nlogging.\n  What does that mean on a State-by-State basis? Let me give an example \nof what it means in at least three States. It does not mean much in the \nState of Nevada. They do not have trees to log, except in very limited \nways. This is what it means in the State of Washington from 1989 to \npresent: It means 55 mills closed and 3,285 primary mill jobs. That is \nwhat that kind of policy means. In my State of Idaho, 13 mills closed, \n1,083 people. In the State of Oregon, 111 mills closed and 11,600 \npeople. That is even after the President's new plan.\n  Remember, when he came to office, he held a big timber summit in \nOregon: Save the trees and save the jobs. They have not been able to \nproduce the jobs. In fact, they had to backtrack and even back away \nfrom their own policy because of the pressure from environmental \ngroups. They were unwilling to support their own policy. The Senator \nfrom Nevada is now on the floor trying to argue for a major reduction \nin that policy.\n  In the State of California, 46 mills and 4,427 jobs. It will not \naffect Nevada. They do not cut trees there, or cut very few.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Nevada on an area that I think is \ntremendously important. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \njust reported out S. 1925, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. The Senator \nfrom Nevada and his colleague have been extremely concerned about the \nhealth of the forest in the Greater Tahoe Basin, and he should be. That \nforest is an overmature, climax forest. In other words, it is beyond \nthe point of healthy adulthood. Trees are dying; trees are too thick. \nThere is an urban interface with beautiful big recreational homes built \namongst the stands of timber. They have a silviculture problem with the \npotential of massive wildfires in the Tahoe Basin, losing those \nbeautiful homes, and creating a catastrophic environmental situation \nthat could badly damage the beautiful Lake Tahoe itself.\n  The Senator from Nevada has a problem. He has a bill that authorizes \nwork to be done in the basin, but he has no money. What he is doing \ntonight is cutting out of one of the budgets of the Forest Service, \nsome of the very money that will go to restore Lake Tahoe and the Tahoe \nBasin. I am not quite sure he can get it both ways.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Nevada to try to assure the Tahoe \nBasin restoration program will go forward and that we will have \nadequate moneys to begin to do the kinds of\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nsilviculture programs, the thinnings and the necessary efforts, that \nwill create a higher level of forest health in the Tahoe Basin. We \ncannot do it tonight because the Senator from Nevada is cutting $30 \nmillion to the detriment of his own program.\n  I suggest when he was approached by the environmental groups to do \nthis amendment that was not a factor, but what is a factor is that the \nSenator from Nevada has not had money appropriated for his project. He \nwill hand it over to the Forest Service at large. It is a bill that \nwill authorize the Forest Service to move in that area, and he is even \ncutting the budgets of the Forest Service, or attempting to as we \nspeak.\n  That is frustrating. It is extremely frustrating to this Senator who \nhas worked very closely with the Senator from Nevada to assure that his \nTahoe Basin project is authorized because it is necessary and it is \nappropriate.\n  Last week, the Senator from Nevada joined with us to put over $240 \nmillion into a fire reduction program and a program to allow the Forest \nService to study even greater amounts of fire suppression by reduction \nof the fuel loading on our national forest floors.\n  Yet today he comes back with that argument. Let me suggest this \nargument is for one purpose and one purpose only, and his amendment \nwill serve for one purpose and one purpose only. We find it right here \nin a letter from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of \nAmerica. This labor union--men and women who work for the forest \nproducts industries--says:\n\n       The Bryan amendment places thousands of forest product jobs \n     at risk and jeopardizes the social and economic stability of \n     rural communities.\n\n  You are darned right it does. In the rural communities of Idaho, \nOregon, and Washington that still have mill jobs, that still ought to \nbe cutting trees. We have 13 and 14 percent unemployment, and this will \ndrive the unemployment up even further.\n  No, those communities are not reaping the benefit of the current full \nemployment economy. The mills on the eastern side of Washington are not \nreaping the benefit of the high-tech jobs of western Washington. The \nmills in north Idaho are not reaping the benefits of the high-tech jobs \nof south Idaho, and so on.\n  What we have attempted to do with reasonably consistent and \nenvironmentally sound policy is to ensure a balance. The Senator from \nNevada denies us that balance by refusing to allow the Forest Service \nto have the very tools necessary to properly manage the current timber \nprogram.\n  This is not about new roads. There is a road moratorium. The Senator \nfrom Nevada knows that. The environmental community last week claimed a \nmajor victory with the President's new roadless area initiative. The \nSenator knows there is not going to be any new roads built. So roads \nare not the argument, not now and not for the near future.\n  What is at stake is the very jobs that produce the dimensional lumber \nthat comes to the markets that builds the homes of America. It is right \nand reasonable to assume that some of it ought to come from the forests \nof Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and California.\n  I hope the Senator, recognizing that this whole issue has shifted \npretty dramatically in the last 72 hours, will recognize that his \namendment no longer has carrying with it the validity that his argument \nmight have had just last week.\n  Mr. President, $240 million later, this Congress, in a responsible \nfashion, has addressed the catastrophic fire situation that might now \nexist in our public lands and are willing to deal with it. Those are \nthe issues at hand that are so very important to all of us.\n  Lastly, the very money the Senator will eliminate from the projects \nand from the programs--here is a letter from the Society of American \nForesters saying that the fire in Los Alamos that cost us 235 homes \nclearly demonstrates that if we had been allowed to have used the \nstewardship timber sales programs that, in part, the Senator's \namendment will now deny us, we could have reduced the fuel loading and, \nin many instances, we might have saved those homes. That is exactly \nwhat we are trying to deal with here.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote with me in voting down the Bryan \namendment. There is no basis for the arguments that are placed today \nthat relate to the amendment itself. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I must say I have \ndifficulty following the arguments of my friend from Idaho. First, I \nhave no objection to--in fact, I am very supportive of it--the \namendment offered by Senator Domenici last week. That has to do with \nhazardous fuels reduction, $120 million going to the Forest Service, \n$120 million going to BLM. I am for that.\n  As the Senator knows, that is a separate budget category entirely \nthan the issue of the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment. That is a subcategory \nof fire operations. What we are talking about is preparedness money, a \ntotally different concept.\n  The issue is not whether Lake Tahoe could be harmed. Lake Tahoe does \nnot have a commercial harvest timber program as such. It is minimal. We \nare talking about the money that is necessary to do the hazardous fuels \nreduction. The Senator from Nevada is very supportive of that. The \nSenator from Nevada wants to see more money set aside for preparedness \nand planning which is cost effective.\n  Let me, by way of an additional comment, point out that the program \nwhich the Senator from Nevada supports is cost effective; that is, it \nsaves taxpayers dollars. It is a savings. The argument that the Senator \nfrom Idaho made refers to a program that has cost taxpayers, between \n1992 and 1997, $2 billion. We are subsidizing them. I do not think that \nis a particularly good value.\n  But even though I might not think it is a particularly good value, I \nhave not sought to eliminate that program. That program would be \nfunded, if the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment were offered, for $220 \nmillion. That is what the President recommended.\n  So what we are simply trying to do is to reprogram some of that money \ninto an area that would be cost effective, in terms of planning and \npreparedness--something that all of the agencies that interface with \nthe urban, forest, local, State, and Federal support and favor--and \nsimply reduce, by the amount of $30 million, the amount that would go \ninto a timber harvest program that has been found, by the GAO, and \nother internal reports, to be cost ineffective in a substantial \nsubsidy.\n  So the issue is not, as my colleague from Idaho suggested, whether \nyou favor timber harvest in the national forests--that is not the issue \nwe are debating today; maybe he wants to make that the issue--but the \nquestion of where you allocate the funds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We checked with the Forest Service when we prepared the \nForest Service budget, and their preparedness program has been fully \nbudgeted for the year. They told us that it was adequate to meet their \nneeds, and the current needs.\n  Does the Senator know otherwise?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada believes it is not adequate. \nIndeed, I think the amount of money that has been----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Even though the chief and his budget people say it is? I \nsee. That is what we understood. Does the Senator now have information \nfrom the Forest Service that says otherwise?\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator follows that line of reasoning, would he \nnot agree the same managers will tell you that $220 million is adequate \nfor the timber harvest program, would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, not at all, because what we did with the $220 \nmillion----\n  Mr. BRYAN. Did they argue for more?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Are you talking about timber harvest or the fuel reduction \nprogram?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The program that is called timber harvest.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am quite sure they would say that it is funded \nadequately because this administration does not want to cut trees \ncommercially.\n  Mr. BRYAN. You can't have it both ways.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, we can, because I am giving categorical facts that \nthe President's chief of the Forest Service\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nsaid the preparedness program was fully funded. That is all I am \nsaying.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would say to the Senator from Idaho, I thought we were \nall Americans, and these positions did not represent a particular \nparty; they represent the entire country. The national forests belong \nnot to Democrats or Republicans.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Now, the chief is a political appointee.\n  Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would yield for one more question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the Tahoe Basin Restoration Program, that is near and \ndear to the Senator--and it is to me; it is a beautiful part of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It is indeed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Where trees must be removed--merchantable timber--there \nare areas where thinning is clearly necessary and so proscribed under \nthe act.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada would agree with that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Those would be under the commercial logging program \nbecause they could be done for less money and more efficiently. And \nthat is the point of my argument, I say to the Senator. That is the \nprogram you are cutting.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am not sure I would agree with the Senator from Idaho. \nClearly, the hazardous fuels reduction program, in which we have \nprovided, as you pointed out, 120 million additional dollars, would be \nthe program that would address that issue, in my judgment.\n  I know other colleagues need to speak.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Connecticut has \nan amendment, so I will defer to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the extremely distinguished occupant of the \nchair. I also thank my friend from Oklahoma. I will try to respond to \nhis graciousness by being brief.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3811\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3811, which I \nfiled at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3811.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment along with \nmy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and Senator Leahy of \nVermont. I ask unanimous consent Senators Dodd and Leahy be added as \ncosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we think this amendment is critical for \nthe energy security of the Northeastern United States. Last winter, in \nthe Northeast, we were really whacked by oil market whims, as we saw \nthe prices of home heating oil soar, and we hovered dangerously close \nto heating oil supply shortages.\n  In New England, the price of home heating oil rose from an average of \n$1.18 a gallon to about $1.79 a gallon in just 3 weeks' time.\n  Some residents of my State were actually paying over $2 for a gallon \nof heating oil, which meant they were spending almost $500--some of \nthem--to fill their tanks. Of course, lower income residents and fixed-\nincome residents, including thousands of elderly, were faced with the \ntough choice of buying heating oil for their homes or food for their \ntables.\n  This burdensome situation was caused by high crude oil prices, \nresulting from low crude oil supplies and low stocks of home heating \noil converging with a downward turn in the weather that led to these \nprice shocks that so disrupted the Northeast.\n  There were a series of meetings and much concern last winter. I think \none of the best ideas that emerged was to build on the strategic crude \noil reserve that we have and to create a regional Northeast home \nheating oil reserve in which the Government would possess home heating \noil, which at times of crisis could be moved out into the market to \nincrease supply and therefore reduce price.\n  I recall that one of the places that this idea was discussed was at a \nbipartisan meeting of Members of Congress from the Northeast with the \nPresident at the White House. He said he would take this under \nadvisement. In fact, President Clinton did act to create a Northeast \nhome heating oil reserve earlier this month, pursuant to his \ncongressionally authorized authority under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act.\n  This amendment, which Senators Dodd and Leahy and I offer, would \nappropriate $4 million to maintain the Northeast heating oil reserve \nthat the President has now created. The President has directed that the \nreserve be filled with home heating oil by conducting oil exchanges \nwith the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Therefore, there is no initial \ncost of filling the reserve.\n  However, the funding that is made possible by this amendment is \ncritical for maintaining the reserve. The reserve itself is an integral \npiece of ensuring that if we do encounter exorbitant prices and short \nsupplies again this winter, we will be able to count on our own \npublicly owned reserves of heating oil to get us through the crisis.\n  In fact, the following Energy Information Agency report, \nunfortunately, indicates that the industry at the current time is way \nbelow the desirable level of building up inventories of home heating \noil, which means that if this continues as we head toward the winter \nand the weather turns cold, people in our region of the country are \ngoing to be suffering economically and physically. So that is the \nintention of offering this amendment.\n  I do want to indicate that I am exercising my prerogative as sponsor \nof the amendment to modify the amendment by striking the section of the \namendment that begins on line 8 on the first page, and ends at the end \nof the document. This section describes an appropriate trigger \nmechanism for releasing the home heating oil reserve. In addition, I \nwant to change the amount of funding requested from $8 million to $4 \nmillion. Finally, I would like to specify that the offset for these \nfunds would come from unobligated funds from the\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve petroleum account in the amount of $3 \nmillion, and $1 million from the Naval Petroleum Reserve and oil shale \nreserves.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3811, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk, therefore, a copy of the amendment \nas it emerges after the modifications that I have just announced, which \nis effectively a $4 million appropriation for this regional reserve the \nPresident has created.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 183, strike line 15 and insert ``$165,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended, of which $3,000,000 shall be \n     derived by transfer of unobligated balances of funds \n     previously appropriated under the heading ``STRATEGIC \n     PETROLEUM RESERVES PETROLEUM ACCOUNT'', and of which \n     $1,000,000 shall be derived by transfer of unobligated \n     balances of funds previously appropriated under the heading \n     ``NAVAL PETROLEUM AND OIL SHALE RESERVES'', and of which \n     $4,000,000 shall be available for maintenance of a Northeast \n     Home Heating Oil Reserve.''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Interior appropriations bill that I think is critical for the \nenergy security of the Northeastern United States. My amendment would \nfund the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which was created by the \nPresident on Monday, July 10. The President created this reserve under \nhis Congressionally authorized authority under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act.\n  The Northeast region of the country is heavily dependent upon home \nheating oil--instead of natural gas, as is the case in much of the rest \nof the country--for heating homes and other buildings during cold \nmonths of the year. As heating oil is refined from crude oil that is \nproduced both domestically and abroad, the price of heating oil is \nsubject to the same market whims that we have seen and continue to see \nin gasoline and other petroleum products. The difference, however, is \nthat when a family runs out of heating oil, they literally run out of \nheat. This is a dangerous situation in the Northeast, where people may \nface days at a time of icy-cold weather.\n  This part winter in the Northeast, we got a taste of market whims as \nwe saw the prices of home heating oil soar, and as we hovered \ndangerously close to heating oil supply shortages. The price of home \nheating oil rose from an average in New England of $1.18 per gallon to \nabout $1.79 per gallon in three weeks. Some residents were paying over \n$2.00 for a gallon of heating oil. Lower-income residents were faced \nwith buying heat for their homes versus food for their tables. In this \ninstance, we saw high crude oil prices and low stocks of heating oil \nconverge with extremely cold weather, leading to the price shocks that \nso disrupted the Northeast. We saw a similar situation in 1996, when \nprices of heating oil soared.\n  I want to offer my amendment to ensure that this type of problem does \nnot happen again. My amendment would appropriate four million dollars \nto maintain the Northeast heating oil reserve that the President has \ncreated. The President has directed that the reserve be filled with \nhome heating oil by conducting oil exchanges with the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. Therefore, there is no initial cost to filling the \nreserve. However, this funding is critical for maintaining the reserve. \nThe reserve itself is an integral piece to ensuring that if we do \nencounter exorbitant prices and short supplies again, we will be able \nto count on our own reserves of heating oil to get us through the \ncrisis.\n  I would like to exercise my prerogative to modify my amendment by \nstriking the section of the amendment that begins on line 8 on the \nfirst page and ends at the end of the document--this section describes \nan appropriate trigger mechanism for releasing home heating oil from \nthe regional reserve. In addition, I would like to change the amount of \nfunding requested from eight million dollars to four million dollars. \nFinally, I would like to specify that the offset for these funds will \ncome from unobligated funds from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nPetroleum Account in the amount of three million dollars and from the \nNaval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves in the amount of one million \ndollars.\n  Senator Dodd joins me in offering this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis explanation and for the modifications which have at least brought \nthis amendment within the parameters of the bill itself. I must say, \nwithout going into it, I think there are several serious policy \nquestions about this amendment, but more than that I think it needs to \nbe resolved in the context of a reauthorization of the Energy Policy \nand Conservation Act. I understand the Senator from Connecticut is \nworking with the chairman of the committee on that, and so we can defer \nour final decision until tomorrow.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to an amendment \nthat would make drastic cuts to the timber program.\n  While we have heard a lot of rhetoric regarding the timber program, \nit is important to understand the context within which these cuts to \nthe timber sale and road construction programs are being considered. \nFederal timber sales are in a steep and devastating decline. Forest \nhealth is increasingly at risk from fire, insects and disease.\n  Both the economic and ecological contexts created by this reduction \nare undesirable.\n  More than 80,000 jobs have been lost and a 1999 General Accounting \nOffice study reported that over forty million acres of National Forest \nsystem lands are at risk of catastrophic wildfire. Another twenty-six \nmillion acres are at risk from insects and disease. The recent fires in \nNew Mexico and in other states provide alarming evidence of the impact \nof increased fuel loads in our forests. Already this year, more than \nfour-and-a-half million acres have burned. Active management is vital \nto forest health, and it is irresponsible for the federal government to \nreduce the management options available to local forest managers who \nbest know how to deal with their specific situations.\n  It is confounding that additional cuts in the federal timber sale \nprogram are being considered at a time when the industry and those \nworking men and women who depend on it has already been crippled by \ndeep cuts and our forests are suffering from lack of active management \nthat includes responsible timber harvest. Since the early 1990s, the \ntimber program has been reduced by 70 percent and more than 75 percent \nof the National Forest system is off-limits to timber harvest. The \nfederal timber supply has dropped from twelve billion board-feet \nharvested to three billion board-feet harvested annually. This \namendment would jeopardize 55,000 jobs and $2 billion in employment \nincome, mostly in rural areas. In addition, national forests have 50 \npercent of our nation's softwood growing stock, which is used for home \nconstruction. New reductions in the availability of this supply will \nhurt housing prices.\n  In my home State of Idaho, small, rural communities continue to \nsuffer devastating reductions in Forest Service Payments-to-states \nfunds from timber sales. In rural Idaho and America, schools are going \nwithout needed renovation, county governments are struggling, and basic \nservices are already being jeopardized by steep reductions in federal \ntimber harvest in recent years. This amendment would further reduce \npayments to rural counties by $7 million and returns to the treasury by \n$30 million.\n  While some will claim that recreation receipts can replace timber \nreceipts, this simply is not true in Idaho. Eight counties in Idaho \nderive more than 20 percent of their employment activity from the \nprimary timber industry. There are only two counties in Idaho that have \nmore than a 5 percent dependence on the recreation industry.\n  This amendment is also counterintuitive from an environmental \nperspective. Active forest management, including thinning and other \ntimber harvest, has widely acknowledge benefits. In fact, most timber \nsales are currently designed to attain other stewardship objectives. \nInterestingly enough, it is the sales that have been planned to focus \non stewardship objectives that have been criticized as below cost. \nTimber sales are the most economical, efficient, and effective\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\nmethod available to local resource managers to treat and control many \ninsect epidemics. These harvests contribute greatly to reducing the \nrisk of catastrophic wildfire and promoting diverse stands.\n  Each year, the National Forest system grows 23 billion board-feet. \nSix billion board-feet die naturally. Only 3 billion board-feet are \nharvested annually. Tree growth in the National Forest system exceeds \nharvest by 600 percent. There is no need, environmental or otherwise, \nto further cripple this important program. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment and for the health of rural economies and the \nforests within the National Forest system.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, that would cut \nfunding for the United States Forest Service's Timber Sale program. Our \nNation is experiencing a renaissance in Forest Health initiatives. The \nterrible tragedies suffered in New Mexico earlier this summer have \nawakened our understanding of the current state of our forests.\n  These forests, that traditionally housed wildlife and produced \nvaluable resources used in building our Nation, have become deadly fire \ntime bombs. The Forest Service itself has reported that more than 40 \nmillion acres of our National Forest System are at high risk of \ndestruction by catastrophic wildfire and an additional 23 million acres \nare at risk from insects and disease. And yet, at a time when national \nawareness is up, and we have an increased commitment to improve forest \nhealth, there are still those critics who would remove the Forest \nService's single most effective tool for restoring forest health.\n  The use of modern silviculture practices in regards to Federal timber \nsales are designed to accomplish a number of goals and objectives in \nregards to forest management. And they do so in a way that provides \njobs for local communities, and money for rural schools and counties. \nWe have also just begun to realize the value that a well-designed and \ncarefully conducted timber sale can have on things like water quality \nand the future of a healthy water table.\n  The city of Denver had to learn this the hard way. Several years ago \na fire swept through the city's watershed and turned the surrounding \necosystem into ashes. Since then, the city has had to pay millions of \ndollars to dredge and remove silt and other particles carried into its \nwater supply. What the city learned is that fires, not timber sales are \nthe biggest threat to watershed health. The city now actively manages \nits watershed and conducts regular assessment and thinnings to maintain \na healthy, fire resilient forest.\n  Notice I said fire resilient, not fire resistant. Fire can be an \ninvaluable management tool when conducted under the proper \ncircumstances. Those conditions, however, do not exist in Western \nforests, nor will they exist until our forest managers are allowed to \nthin out the forests and remove the dense undergrowth and some of the \nincreasingly taller layers of trees that create the deadly fuel ladders \nthat feed catastrophic fires.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the impact this amendment could have \non rural economies. The United States is importing more and more wood \nevery year as a result of declines in federal timber sales. This means \nthat the American lumber market is being fed by highly-subsidized \ntimber that was produced under conditions that do not meet our Nation's \nhigh environmental standards. As a result, not only do we loose the \nenvironmental benefits that federal timber sales can produce, but we \nare feeling negative social and economic effects as America jobs are \nlost and moved offshore. The brunt of these losses are felt most keenly \nin rural areas, where forest products jobs are concentrated.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to add that the Federal \nTimber Sale Program is not a subsidy for the forest products industry. \nFederal timber contractors do not receive any special benefit, nor do \nthey pay less money for the timber they harvest on federal lands. \nFederal timber is sold by means of a competitive bid system. As a \nresult, these auction sales are the most likely of any type of \ncommercial transaction to generate the returns that meet or exceed \nmarket value. Because timber sales are designed to generate market \nvalue prices, we therefore must conclude that there is no subsidy.\n  Furthermore, the forest products industry has consistently \ndemonstrated that the benefits gained by the public through the Federal \ntimber sale program far outweigh the costs to the Federal treasury. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Bryan's amendment and to \nsupport our National Forest and rural communities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3884\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3884.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To defend the Constitutional system of checks and balances \n            between the Legislative and Executive branches)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FUNDING FOR NATIONAL MONUMENTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds shall \n     be used to establish or expand a national monument under the \n     Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) after July 17, \n     2000, except by Act of Congress.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment basically says: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds shall be used to \nestablish or expand a national monument under the act of June 8, 1906, \nthe Antiquities Act, after July 17, 2000, except by an Act of Congress.\n  What I am trying to do is to make sure we don't have additional \nnational monuments declared by this administration without some \ncongressional input.\n  I will insert a copy of the Antiquities Act for the Record. It was \npassed in 1906. The Antiquities Act states:\n\n       The President of the United States is authorized, in his \n     discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic \n     landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other \n     objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated \n     upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the \n     United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a \n     part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all \n     cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with \n     the proper care and management of the objects to be \n     protected.\n\n  That is the Antiquities Act.\n  This administration, particularly this year, has added millions of \nacres under the designation of national monuments without congressional \nauthorization or approval, without consent of Governors, without \nconsent of local entities. I am saying there is another process. I \nhappen to serve on the Energy Committee with Chairman Murkowski and \nothers. We pass land bills all the time. I urge the President, if he \nwants to pass or declare something a national monument, send it to \nCongress. We are happy to look at it. We are happy to pass it. This is \na committee that works in a bipartisan fashion. We pass land bills all \nthe time. This week we are supposed to mark up 17. We do that in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I also will include for the Record a comparison of lands that have \nbeen added as national monuments during all the Presidents.\n  This Antiquities Act passed under Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. It is \ninteresting to note, Theodore Roosevelt, who was quite the \nconservationist, made some very significant additions to the national \nmonuments, the total acreage of which was 1.5 million acres. President \nClinton has done more than that this year alone. As a matter of fact, \nPresident Clinton has already designated 3.7 million acres. He has done \nmore than any other President of the United States, with the exception \nof President Carter, who added a lot of land in the State of Alaska.\n  It is also interesting to note that the State of Alaska Senators had \namended the Antiquities Act to say no lands should be made into a \nnational monument that exceeds 5,000 acres unless there is an act of \nCongress. That doesn't apply to the rest of the country.\n  This administration, while they had designated 1.7 million acres in \nthe first\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\n7 years, in this year, since January, has already declared 2 million \nacres a national monument. There is some talk that there are additional \nmonuments in the works. If there are, great. If this amendment passes--\nI hope and expect that it will--I am sure Congress will be happy to \nreceive the request from the President. We will review it. We will \nconsider it. We will have hearings. We will go through the legislative \nprocess. We will hear from the Governors. We will hear from local \nentities. We will make a decision, as the process should be.\n  I believe the President's actions, particularly this year, have \ngreatly exceeded what is called for in the Antiquities Act. Again, in \nthe Antiquities Act, it says, that the area:\n\n       . . . in all cases should be confined to the smallest area \n     compatible with the proper care and management of the objects \n     to be protected.\n\n  We should abide by this law. When the President has added 2 million \nacres this year alone, I don't believe he is in compliance with it. I \nthink Congress has a legitimate role. If not, are we going to allow the \nPresident to declare wilderness areas, millions of acres?\n  My point is, I may well agree with the President on every single \ndesignation he has made, but the process needs congressional \nauthorization. It needs congressional input; it needs congressional \nhearings. It needs input from local officials and people who are \ndirectly impacted.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment. I appreciate the \nleadership of my friend and colleague, Senator Gorton of Washington, \nand also Senator Byrd. I used to chair the subcommittee. It is a \nchallenging subcommittee, one which the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from West Virginia have handled with a great deal of \nprofessionalism and expertise. I compliment them on their efforts.

I mentioned all of the Presidents. President Clinton has \ngreatly exceeded the amount of new additions compared to any President, \nwith the one exception of President Carter. To give a comparison, \nPresident Ford added 86 acres in national monuments in his tenure as \nPresident. President Reagan and President Bush added zero. Teddy \nRoosevelt added 1.5 million acres; William Taft, 32,000 acres. I could \ngo on down the list. My point is, the amount President Clinton has \nadded this year alone exceeds what almost any other President has done.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the \nAntiquities Act.\n  There being no objection, the act was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Antiquities Act\n\n                         TITLE 16--CONSERVATION\n\n  CHAPTER 1--NATIONAL PARKS, MILITARY PARKS, MONUMENTS, AND SEASHORES\n\n   Subchapter LXI--National and International Monuments and Memorials\n\n     SEC. 431. NATIONAL MONUMENTS; RESERVATION OF LANDS; \n                   RELINQUISHMENT OF PRIVATE CLAIMS.\n\n       The President of the United States is authorized, in his \n     discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic \n     landmark, historic and prehistoric structures, and other \n     objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated \n     upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the \n     United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a \n     part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all \n     cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with \n     the proper care and management of the objects to be \n     protected. When such objects are situated upon a tract \n     covered by a bona fide unperfected claim or held in private \n     ownership, the tract, or so much thereof as may be necessary \n     for the proper care and management of the object, may be \n     relinquished to the Government, and the Secretary of the \n     Interior is authorized to accept the relinquishment of such \n     tracts in behalf of the Government of the United States.\n\n     (June 8, 1906, ch. 3060, Sec. 2, 34 Stat. 225.)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has taken in \nthis area. It is so critically important.\n  About a month and a half ago, I got a call from the Secretary of the \nInterior, Bruce Babbitt, who said: I am headed to Idaho. I am going to \nlook at the Craters of the Moon National Monument. I might want to \nexpand it.\n  ``I might want to expand it,'' was what he said. It is currently \n54,000 acres. He has recommended that it be expanded to 754,000 acres. \nHe doesn't take into consideration grazing. He wants to overlay Park \nService and BLM management into a confusing new kind of configuration.\n  Most importantly--this is the point the Senator from Oklahoma has \njust made--there have been no public hearings, no local input. He went \naround and held some meetings with some affected or potentially \naffected parties.\n  If the Congress were handling this, we would have the full NEPA \nprocess. We would have an EIS. We would incorporate our county \ngovernments. We would look at the kind of impact this designation would \nhave. The Senator is right, he and I might ultimately agree with it, \nbut what about the county roads that go through it and some of the \nprivate roads that go through it and the elimination or the blockage of \nthose roads. Those are the kinds of issues this President and this \nSecretary have totally ignored in the name of the Clinton legacy.\n  I hope this amendment will pass. It is time we halt this action and \nbring this through the Congress to an appropriate public process to \nsort out all these difficulties. That is what the committee on which \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and I serve has the responsibility of doing: \nrefining and crafting public policy.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague, Mr. President.\n  I know the chairman of the subcommittee wants to address this and \nperhaps other issues.\n  One other comment: The President did this first in September of 1996 \nprior to the election. I know my colleague from Nevada might remember \nthis because he did it with a press conference overlooking the Grand \nCanyon, talking about the addition of a new national monument, except \nthe monument he was talking about was not in Arizona, not in the Grand \nCanyon; it was actually in Utah. It was the Grand Staircase National \nMonument, 1.7 million acres. It happened to have billions of dollars of \nraw materials.\n  Interestingly enough, the Utah Governor was not consulted. The Utah \ncongressional delegation was not consulted. People in the community \nwere not consulted. We had a massive land grab, power mineral grab--you \nname it--by the President of the United States for a photo op for \nelection purposes that, in my opinion, may have been granted but needed \ncongressional input and authorization. That is the purpose of the \namendment, to make sure this type of thing does not continue without at \nleast some input from other local officials.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have about 5 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Nevada is going to introduce two additional amendments, \nquite appropriately, before that.\n  In connection with this amendment, however, I need to say that this \namendment causes a conflict on my part more than any other here. I \nagree with the amendment. I think the power has been misused. I am not \nsure it can be reversed by another President. The Senator from Idaho \nseems to feel that it can be. But I believe we have had a number of \nactions that have raised far more questions than they have actually \nsettled.\n  By the same token, I know perfectly well if this amendment is in the \nbill that goes to the President, the President will veto the bill. I \nsimply say, since I know my friend from Nevada will be on the \nconference committee, I don't intend to send a bill to the President \nthat we don't believe he ought to sign, at the very least. I just have \nto leave that notice at this point.\n  We have 4 more minutes. I will say one other thing. At least in \ntheory, amendments can be brought up and discussed to this bill--the \namendments that are listed in the unanimous consent agreement--and they \ncould be further discussed after the end of the many votes that we have \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Nevada so he can introduce the \nremaining amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe temporarily set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3885\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3885.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be used \n     for the preventive application of a pesticide containing a \n     known or probable carcinogen, a category I or II acute nerve \n     toxin or a pesticide of the organo-\n     phosphate, carbamate, or organo-\n     chlorine class as identified by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency in National Parks in any area where children may be \n     present.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3886 To Amendment No. 3885\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Bond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3886 to amendment No. 3885.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit use of funds for application of unapproved \n       pesticides in certain areas that may be used by children)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR APPLICATION OF \n                   UNAPPROVED PESTICIDES IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT MAY \n                   BE USED BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Definition of Pesticide.--In this section, the term \n     ``pesticide'' has the meaning given the term in section 2 of \n     the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 136).\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--None of the funds \n     appropriated under this Act may be used for the application \n     of a pesticide that is not approved for use by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency in any area owned or managed \n     by the Department of the Interior that may be used by \n     children, including any national park.\n       (c) Coordination.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     coordinate with the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to ensure that the methods of pest control \n     used by the Department of the Interior do not lead to \n     unacceptable exposure of children to pesticides.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by \nSenators Lincoln, Kerrey of Nebraska, and Roberts, prevents funds from \nbeing used for the application of any pesticide that is not approved \nfor use by the Environmental Protection Agency in any area managed by \nthe U.S. Park Service that may be used by children. Further, it directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to coordinate with EPA to ensure that \npest control methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure of children \nto pesticides.\n  Let there be no mistake that every member of this Senate supports the \nprotection of children. It is the mandate of the EPA to do so. They are \nalready required by law to do so.\n  The strict standard that mandates EPA on product approval is: \n``reasonable certainty of no harm.'' That is a tall hurdle.\n  The shocking thing about this underlying amendment by the Senator \nfrom California is that its premise holds that the EPA, is not, I \nrepeat, not, doing its job protecting children. Let me repeat, this is \na referendum on whether EPA is protecting children. Now, I think, that \nif the EPA were paying attention, it would be news to the EPA \nAdministrator that her agency is not protecting children. As Chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD, I have listened to \ncountless hours of testimony about the Administrator's devotion to \nprotecting children. I would think, that if we had a Sense of the \nSenate that Administrator Browner is not doing her job protecting \nchildren, we would defeat that.\n  I asked the nominee (James V. Aidala) to be Assistant Administrator \nfor Toxic Substances of the Environmental Protection Agency if the EPA \nalready protects children on military bases from harmful pesticides and \nwe got the following response:\n\n       The protection of children is one of our highest \n     priorities. When we register, re-register, or reassess \n     tolerances for existing pesticides we try to ensure that our \n     actions are protective of all consumers, especially children.\n\n  He continued on to say that,\n\n       FQPA requires special protections for infants and children \n     including: an explicit determination that tolerances are safe \n     for children; an additional safety factor, if necessary, to \n     account for uncertainty in data relative to children; and \n     consideration of children's special sensitivity and exposure \n     to pesticide chemicals.\n\n  Let the record also show that the reason that many pesticides are \nused is to protect children from bacteria and disease including asthma, \nencephalitis, malaria, lyme disease, Legionnaires' disease, and other \ndiseases all of which that occur here in the U.S.\n  Mr. President, what is a pesticide? According to EPA,\n\n       . . . all of these common products are considered \n     pesticides. Cockroach sprays and baits; insect repellents for \n     personal use; rat and other rodent poisons; flea and tick \n     sprays, powders, and pet collars; kitchen, laundry, and bath \n     disinfectants and sanitizer; products that kill mold and \n     mildew; some lawn and garden products, such as week killers; \n     and, some swimming pool chemicals.\n\n  Pesticides eradicate a wide variety of pests, including cockroaches, \nbiting insects, algae, bacteria, poisonous Brown Recluse Spiders--as \nfound in the U.S. Capitol buildings--and infectious microbes which \nresult in unsanitary and unhealthy conditions at food and medical care \nfacilities.\n  Many common cleaners, disinfectants and sanitizer are used to \neradicate infectious microbes, bacteria, and algae in bathroom and \nkitchens and nursing homes, hospitals and other health care facilities. \nCooling systems and water supplies are treated. Chlorine, which is \nregistered as a pesticide by EPA could be affected by the underlying \namendment. Products that sterilize medical equipment are carcinogenic \nand would thus also be affected.\n  Used according to EPA--label instructions, pesticides not only \nprevent property damage from termites, but also protect our children. \nWest Nile virus and encephalitis, which have been detected throughout \nthe mid-Atlantic, are carried by mosquitoes. Deer ticks carry lyme \ndisease, and cockroaches have been linked to the worsening of asthma \nsymptoms.\n  According to the New York Times, asthma is now the most common cause \nof hospitalization among American children affecting a total of five \nmillion. Deaths among children with the condition rose 78 percent from \n1980 to 1993.\n  Again, these pesticides are approved by the EPA following a rigorous \nand science-based process to determine what is safe and what is not \nsafe. With our concern for the safety of our children in mind, this \nbody passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) unanimously in 1996. \nFQPA was designed to update the safety standards of pesticides \nespecially with respect to children and other vulnerable sub-\npopulations. The Environmental Protection Agency has been implementing \nthis law for the past four years. In the regulatory review process EPA \nreviews data from up to 120 tests conducted on pesticides prior to \nregistration.\n  When registration decisions are made, the EPA includes additional \nsafety factors for children. According to EPA, ``. . . these specific \nrequirements in the statute will help EPA in its efforts to implement \nthe NAS report and ensure that risks to infants and children are always \nconsidered. . . .'' And, under FIFRA, EPA has the authority to \nimmediately cancel the use of any pest control product that it believes \nposes an imminent risk to public health.\n  Obviously, EPA has the authority to protect children. Obviously, EPA \nbelieves that the law protects children. Obviously, EPA believes they \nare protecting children.\n  Since the new law in 1996, EPA has re-reviewed thousands of products. \nWe are spending about $50 million in taxpayer money to pay full-time \nexperts at the EPA to Administer the FQPA and to re-review the \nproducts. They tell us what is safe and what is not safe.\n  Contrary to what was mistakenly represented in previous debate, EPA \ndoes NOT support this amendment. According to EPA in answers in \nresponse to questions I submitted for the Record on June 30, 2000, ``. \n. . the amendment has not been subject to a full review by the \nAdministration, nor has the Administration taken a position on the \namendment.''\n  With this extensive regulatory process in place and recently updated, \nI cannot support the Senator's proposal to regulate further pesticides \nby completely ignoring and circumventing EPA's aggressive \nimplementation of FQPA, as well as the Clinton Administration's entire \nregulatory process. The Senator from California's proposal will \neffectively regulate pesticides from the Senate floor on an \nappropriations bill, which is not only bad science, but bad public \npolicy as well, and a process we all should want to avoid. I think if \nwe are going to have a referendum on whether the EPA protect's \nchildren, we should have some cursory review of the subject first.\n\n  I am also not an expert on asthma or encephalitis or lyme's disease \nor salmonella, or e. Coli or Legionnaires' disease or the West Nile \nvirus.\n  If the Senator from California has some information that says that \nthe EPA is not doing their job, then I think the information should be \nreviewed and the EPA should have the opportunity to respond and comment \nand defend itself. If there is an emergency that the Senator from \nCalifornia is aware of, EPA has the regulatory authority to deal with \nit and they should. If EPA is not appropriately dealing with an \nemergency, perhaps we should ask the Administrator to tell us why that \nis\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\nthe case. Absent that, it is not a very good idea for us to be \nsubstituting our scientific judgment for the judgment of Administrator \nBrowner's scientists as to what is and is not safe.\n  We also know that according to industry and EPA, there is no legal or \nregulatory or industry ``term of art'' for a ``category I or category \nII acute nerve toxin.'' If we are going to tell EPA to prohibit \nsomething, EPA should understand what we want them to prohibit. If we \nare going to tell industry that they cannot use a product, they should \nknow what product they are forbidden to use.\n  One organophosphate, for example, is Raid. Organochlorides, I am \ntold, are products that contain carbon and chlorine which wipes out all \nhard surface disinfectants. One such hard surface disinfectant which is \nused daily to clean our bathrooms is Lysol disinfectant. Some of the \nsame products are used to clean our cafeteria. Some carcinogens are \nused to sterilize medical equipment.\n  The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations has just \nreceived a bipartisan letter from the Chairmen and Ranking Members of \nthe House committee of jurisdiction stating that this is an issue under \ntheir jurisdiction which should be dealt with solely through the \nauthorization process. The bipartisan letter was signed by Congressmen \nCombest, Stenholm, Goodlatte and Clayton.\n  Mr. President, I am continuously amazed at the knowledge and \ndedication of my Senate colleagues but I will admit that I am not an \nexpert on organophosphates or nerve toxins. I fear that this issue \nabout nerve toxins and organophosphates and ``probable carcinogens'' \nmay be a mystery to a good number of my colleagues and it is a horrible \nprecedent for regulation, which will impact not only the urban uses of \npest control products, but also the agricultural uses for our Nation's \nfarmers.\n  We know that the EPA does not support this amendment. It has not \nreviewed it and I don't expect them to review it during an election \nyear.\n  My amendment protects children by allowing Carol Browner and her cops \non the beat to do their job.\n  We have a dreadful picture of a bite from a Brown recluse spider. \nThis spider is bad news as the picture indicates. This poisonous spider \nwas found in the Capitol on more than one occasion and it is called a \nrecluse spider because it is hard to discover. In the last three weeks, \na Senate appropriations staffer was bitten by this spider.\n  Used according to EPA-label instructions, pesticides protect our \nchildren by controlling harmful pests like disease carrying insects, \ninfectious bacteria, poison ivy, and other noxious weeds.\n  This underlying Boxer amendment would prohibit the use of products \nthat have been scientifically tested and approved for use by the EPA to \nhelp prevent disease and improve the quality of life for all Americans, \nespecially children. The EPA has a sound regulatory process in place \nthat protects children and provides safe, effective pest control tools \nfor use in the farmer's field, the cafeteria, hospitals, playgrounds, \nand the home. To undermine the process of the strictest pesticide \nregulations in the world would not only set a misguided precedent, but \nwould indeed threaten the health of our children. It would also send a \nshocking message that our EPA is not following its legal mandate and \nits perpetually-articulated mission of protecting children.\n  In summary, the underlying amendment it is unnecessary, it is overly-\nbroad, it is a horrible precedent and it is encumbered with far-\nreaching unintended negative consequences that are harmful to children.\n  I just do not believe the U.S. Senate should take an action which \nmakes the visitor's centers of our national parks the largest cockroach \nhotels on the planet.\n  My amendment prohibits the use of any pesticide not approved by \nAdministrator Browner's team and ensures consultation to ensure that \npest control methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure of children \nto pesticides. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and \npreserve the effectiveness and the integrity of the science-based \nregulatory system.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the Farm \nBureau opposing the underlying amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On behalf of the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, I am writing to express our deep concern and \n     opposition to the Boxer amendment to the Interior \n     Appropriations bill. The amendment as proposed would stop the \n     use of pesticides on public lands, pesticides use to prevent \n     and control noxious weeds, invasive species and other pests \n     that threaten the health and long-term sustainability of \n     those lands. The amendment is without merit or scientific \n     basis and should be defeated.\n       This amendment is misguided and would be harmful to the \n     public interest. The current federal laws governing pesticide \n     use, specifically the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \n     Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act \n     (FQPA) require scores of tests and large amounts of \n     scientific data to be submitted to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) before a pesticide is approved for \n     public use. Products used in accordance with the label are \n     safe. It is essential for public confidence that pesticide \n     decisions be based on sound science and objective regulatory \n     review. This amendment arbitrarily circumvents the regulatory \n     process and creates confusion in the public mind.\n       Agricultural producers who farm and ranch on or adjacent to \n     public land face increased threats to their economic \n     viability. The spread of pests, noxious weeds and invasive \n     species represents a real economic burden to farming and \n     ranching operations in many areas, particularly where they \n     are near public lands. Additionally, they pose a substantial \n     environmental and public health risk if left uncontrolled. \n     For example, efforts to control mosquitoes carrying the \n     deadly West Nile encephalitis virus could be threatened by \n     this amendment, as could efforts to control pests such as the \n     Gypsy Moth Caterpillar and Asian Longhorned Beetle that have \n     devastated hardwoods in both our urban and rural areas.\n       Please oppose the Boxer amendment to the Interior \n     Appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment I offered on behalf of Senator \nBoxer would limit the use of dangerous pesticides in our national \nparks. In particular, it prohibits the routine use of highly toxic \npesticides--those containing known or probable carcinogens, acute nerve \ntoxins, organophosphates, carbamates, or organochlorines--in our \nnational parks, where children may be present.\n  Such pesticides could be used in the case of an emergency. This is \nalready the policy of the National Park Service. This amendment would \ncodify this important policy.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Bond second-degree amendment prevents \nfunds from being used for the application of any pesticide that is not \napproved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency in any area \nmanaged by the Park Service that may be used by children, and directs \nthe Secretary of Interior to coordinate with EPA to assure pest control \nmethods do not lead to unacceptable exposure of children to pesticides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3887\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3887.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the protection \n          of Indian program monies from judgment fund claims)\n\n       On page 163, after line 23, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) in 1990, pursuant to the Indian Self Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (ISDEA), 25 U.S.C. et seq., a class \n     action lawsuit was filed by Indian tribal contractors and \n     tribal consortia against the United States, the Secretary of \n     Interior and others seeking redress for failure to fully pay \n     for indirect contract support costs (Ramah Navajo\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\n     Chapter v. Babbitt, 112 F.3d 1455 (10th Cir. 1997));\n       (2) the parties negotiated a partial settlement of the \n     claim totaling $76,200,000 which was approved by the court on \n     May 14, 1999;\n       (3) the partial settlement was paid by the United States on \n     September 14, 1999, in the amount of $82,000,000;\n       (4) the Judgment Fund, 31 U.S.C. 1304, was established to \n     pay for legal judgments awarded to plaintiffs who have filed \n     suit against the United States;\n       (5) the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 requires that the \n     Judgment Fund be reimbursed by the responsible agency \n     following the payment of an award from the Fund;\n       (6) because the potential exists that Indian program funds \n     in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Indian Health \n     Service (IHS) would be used in Fiscal Year 2001 to reimburse \n     the Judgment Fund, resulting in significant financial and \n     administrative disruptions in the BIA, the IHS, and the \n     Indian tribes who rely on such funds;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services should declare Indian \n     program funds unavailable for purposes of reimbursing the \n     judgment fund; and\n       (2) if the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services determines that \n     there are no other available funds, the agencies through the \n     Administration should seek an appropriation of funds from \n     Congress to provide for reimbursement of the judgment fund.\n\n                      kyoto protocol restrictions\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the FY 2001 Interior \nand Related Appropriations Act, I would like to take a moment to ask \nthe distinguished subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member a clarifying \nquestion concerning Section 329 of the bill. That section, as my \ncolleagues know, contains language concerning the implementation of the \nKyoto Protocol.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has clearly expressed its views regarding \nthe Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, the Byrd-Hagel resolution adopted \nunanimously by the Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on \nthe Administration to support an approach to climate change that \nprotects the economic interests of the United States and seeks \ncommitments from developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. The Administration is aggressively engaging developing \ncountries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through international \nprojects and activities emphasizing market-based mechanisms and \nenvironmental technology. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently engaged in \nclimate change negotiations to ensure meaningful participation of \ndeveloping countries and to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions are achieved in the most cost-effective manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask my friend from West Virginia if my understanding \nis correct that Section 329 of the FY 2001 Interior bill is not \nintended to restrict the Administration from engaging in these \ninternational negotiations related to both the Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, which was ratified by the Senate in 1992, and the Kyoto \nProtocol to that Convention? Am I also correct in my understanding that \nSection 329 is not intended to restrict international programs or \nactivities to encourage commitments by developing countries to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the question from my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont, whose background in international \naffairs is well known and impressive, indeed. In response, I say to my \nfriend that his understanding is correct, Section 329 is not intended \nto restrict U.S. negotiations or the other activities such as he has \ndescribed. On the contrary, the section is intended to prevent the \nAdministration from implementing the Kyoto Protocol prior to itss \nratification by the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I concur with the statement just provided \nby the Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                        sea turtle conservation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, will the distinguished Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will gladly yield to a question from my \ngood friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman. I want \nto commend the gentleman from Washington and the distinguished ranking \nmember for the great leadership they have demonstrated in crafting the \nFY2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Gentlemen, last year you were both \ninstrumental in securing funds for a project of great personal interest \nto Senator Lott and myself, the Kemp's ridley sea turtle project. The \nproject, funded in part through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a \ntwenty-year-old on-going success story in the recovery of a highly \nendangered species. Since 1978, the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService has spearheaded the sea turtle conservation work at Rancho \nNuevo, Mexico. This collaborative conservation project with the Mexican \ngovernment and the U.S. shrimp industry, through the National Fisheries \nInstitute, protects Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests and females from \npredation and other hazards, and ensures that young turtles make it \ninto the sea. I am pleased to report that this Spring, the project has \nreached an all time success level with some 750 turtles laying eggs in \nover 5,000 nests, a record in the past 40 years. However, this year, \ndespite the demonstrable success of the project, the Fish and Wildlife \nService did not request funds for the Kemp's ridley sea turtle project. \nI am extremely concerned and want to express my strong support for \ncontinued funding for this valuable conservation effort.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is clear from my friend's statement that he knows much \nabout the sea turtle conservation protect, and I share his enthusiasm \nfor these important efforts to project the Kemp's ridley sea turtle. \nWhile I am keenly aware of the fiscal constraints on the Fish and \nWildlife Service, I once again encourage the Service to consider \nproviding whatever support it can within these existing budget \nconstraints.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with my colleagues from Washington and Louisiana. \nThe Fish and Wildlife Service should make every effort to support this \nproject in order to uphold a scientifically justified success in \nendangered species management.\n\n\n   regarding the need for emergency funding for the washakie dam in \n                    wyoming's wind river reservation\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator \nGorton, for helping me address the need for emergency funding for the \nShoshone and Arapaho Tribes of Central Wyoming. On June 1, 2000, Gary \nCollins, Director of Tribal Water Engineers Office for the Shoshone and \nArapaho Tribes on the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming \nannounced the need to evacuate homes down river from the Washakie Dam. \nThe evacuation was the result of a ``first fill'' test being conducted \nby the tribe for the newly refurbished Washakie Dam. In accordance with \nfirst fill protocol and criteria, the dam was filled to the first of \ntwo target levels and then held at that first level for a specified \nnumber of days to allow inspection of the dam's operation. Because of \nunusually high seepage at a key structural point--50 gallons per minute \nat the toe of the dam, however, the tribe implemented its Emergency \nAction Plan, ordered the down stream evacuation and conducted temporary \nrepairs to stop the flow. The repairs were successful and the immediate \ndanger temporarily abated.\n  While the seep is now under control, the first fill protocol is still \nto be completed. Under normal conditions, the tribe would have \nrestarted the first fill protocol and would have refilled the dam to \ntest it again for additional seepage or any other problems. There is \nnot enough water, however, to complete the first fill on the Washakie \nDam. Wyoming, along with the rest of the west is suffering from a \nserious drought situation. The first fill test will not be completed \nuntil next spring when, hopefully, we will have enough snowfall to \ngenerate the water needed to fill the reservoir.\n  As with the first fill of any dam, there is always a concern that \nsome unanticipated event will occur which requires immediate action to \nprotect life and property. The reconstruction project was finished \nahead of time, and under budget, but the remaining funds will be \ninadequate to respond to any catastrophic incident. It makes much more \nsense to set aside funds up front to mitigate a possible catastrophe, \nthan to spend millions of additional dollars, and possibly lose human \nlife, for a disaster that could have been averted.\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\n  The decision by Congress to provide emergency funding for incidents \nbefore they occur is not without precedent. For example, in 1997 the \nU.S. Congress provided funds to prevent flooding in and around Devil's \nLake in North Dakota. No actual disaster had occurred, but impending \nweather conditions threatened surrounding communities and we provided \nthe means to avert disaster.\n  I am therefore asking my colleague for his thoughts on what we can do \nto help out the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes and ensure \nthe safety of the residents living around the Washakie Dam.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nand recognize the potential severity of the situation at the Washakie \nDam.\n  I would like to assure my colleague that I will work with him to \nensure that adequate funding is available to make any necessary repairs \nto the dam or to conduct other activities necessary to ensure the \nsafety of people living in the vicinity of the dam.\n\n\n                         hazardous fuel removal\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I'm pleased to sponsor Senator Domenici's \namendment, number 3782, to the fiscal year 2001 Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill which adds critical funding to the budgets \nof the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service for hazardous \nfuel removal. These funds are necessary to address the immediate \nthreats to wildland/urban interface areas across the country which are \nsurrounded by public lands choking with natural fuels build-up from a \nhalf-century of fire suppression. The Los Alamos fire was a tragic \nreminder of the threat that exists today around many communities. In my \nown state of Arizona, which has the largest ponderosa pine forest in \nthe world, the communities of Flagstaff, Tucson, Summer Haven, Pinetop-\nLakeside, Showlow, and countless others are virtually surrounded by the \nnational forest.\n  The work being done by the Ecological Restoration Institute at \nNorthern Arizona University to address forest ecosystem restoration is \nworld-class. I believe my colleagues are aware of the forest treatment \nand public education programs there. I understand that an agreement was \nreached to provide $8.8 million directly to the Ecological Restoration \nInstitute for its ongoing efforts from within the funds made available \nto the Bureau of Land Management. Is this correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I'm glad to have the Senator from Arizona as a sponsor \nof my amendment, which does provide additional necessary funding to the \nBLM and the Forest Service for fuels reduction. And I am aware of the \nwork being done by the Ecological Restoration Institute. My staff met \nwith the director of the program. It is my understanding that, from \nwithin funds provided for the Bureau of Land Management in this \namendment, $8.8 million is provided for the Ecological Restoration \nInstitute.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is what we have agreed to, with the concurrence of \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am in agreement with that understanding.\n\n\n                     historical sites in new jersey\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning \nthe conference.\n  Mr. GORTON; I would be happy to consider a request from my colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I rise to talk about two sites in New Jersey which \nare worthy of federal funding for their protection. I would hope that \nshould additional funding become available, the Senate would consider \nproviding federal funding to contribute to the acquisition of these \nsites.\n  The first is The Historic New Bridge Landing, located in Bergen \nCounty, New Jersey. I am concerned that this site will be lost unless \nfederal protection is afforded to it. In November 1776, reeling from a \nseries of devastating defeats in Brooklyn and Manhattan, the \nContinental Army fled across the Hudson River to New Jersey. The Red \nCoats, in hot pursuit, continually forced Washington to retreat.\n  After crossing New Bridge, Washington instructed a contingent of \ntroops to dismantle the bridge and protect the army's rear. Though \nunable to destroy the bridge, Washington's troops held off the British \nlong enough to allow the Army to escape.\n  This bridge called ``The Bridge that Saved a Nation,'' was \nstrategically situated at the narrows of the Hackensack River. The \nbridge and surrounding area were a hotly contested battleground, \nencampment ground, military intelligence post and headquarters. In \n1780, when the Continental army regained control of the area \nsurrounding the New Bridge, Washington used the Steuben house as a \nheadquarters and stayed in a second floor bedroom.\n  This property has been the object of attention for historians and \npreservationists for many years. The historical significance of this \nhas been confirmed; the site is listed on both the New Jersey and \nNational Registers of Historic Places. In addition, in 1999, the site \nwas named among the 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey by \nPreservation New Jersey, a private state-wide historic preservation \norganization. Finally, this site is included in the National Park \nService's Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield study, which \naims to catalog important sites in need of protection.\n  New Bridge Landing encompasses 18 acres on both sides of the \nHackensack River in Central Bergen County, New Jersey. Commercial \ndevelopment, neglect and time, have combined to erode and threaten to \ndestroy this historically significant site. Since 1995, the Historic \nNew Bridge Landing Commission has been working toward the establishment \nof a major new historic and cultural park at Historic New Bridge \nLanding, in Central Bergen County, NJ. The Commission has established a \nGeneral Management Plan which outlines the objectives of the proposed \npark.\n  Today, this site remains a hotly contested battleground, and while \nthe nature of the battle is different, the importance of prevailing is \nno less important. New Jersey has undergone a revolution from ``Garden \nState'' to ``Suburban State,'' More than 40 percent of New Jersey is \ndeveloped. New Jersey is by far the most built-over state in the nation \nand it is number 1 in the rate at which it is losing its open space. \nSince 1961, New Jersey has lost over half a million acres to sprawl. \nThe area adjacent to New Bridge Landing have not been spared. Virtually \nall of the land adjacent to the site has been developed. This \ndevelopment is visible from the site, altering its character and \ndiminishing the visitor's experience of the park's historic landscape.\n  Mr. President, I would like to introduce this letter from the \nNational Park Service testifying to the importance of Historic New \nBridge Landing, and the need for federal efforts to preserve and \nprotect it. Historic New Bridge Landing is worthy of our protection, \nand I would hope that the Senate would consider providing funding for \nthe protection of this important site.\n  The second site which I rise today to speak in support of, is the \nGlen Gray Boy Scout Camp, located in the heart of the Ramapo Mountains, \nin New Jersey.\n  Much like the rest of my state, this 850 acre tract is threatened \nwith development. Sprawl threatens to eat away at this pristine site, \nand the remainder of the Highlands. New Jersey knows all too well the \nperil of sprawl and has paid a terrible price at the hands of \ndevelopers of shopping malls and subdivisions.\n  An average of 10,000 acres of rural/agricultural land is being \ndeveloped piecemeal every year in New Jersey. The NY-NJ Highlands has \nseen a 60 percent increase in urbanization in the last 25 years, and is \nexpected to absorb a 14 percent increase in population by 2010. Years \nago, we made an important step in the preservation of the Highlands \nwith the effort to protect Sterling Forest. This effort was aided by a \nstudy of the New York-New Jersey Highlands Region, conducted by the \nForest Service.\n  That study also found the Highlands to be of national significance \ndue to the diversity and quality of its natural resources and \nlandscape. In addition, the study confirmed threats from development to \nwater quality, critical open space, and recreational resources.\n  The Highlands regional study has shown us that this region is \ndeserving of federal funding to allow for its protection. I am hopeful \nthat the Committee will share my concern for this region, and commit \nfunding for its protection.\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\n  I realize that the Committee faces many demands when putting this \nbill together. While these requests were not included in the bill, I \nwould ask the Committee to consider funding for these worthy projects \nin the Conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and assure him that \nthe Committee recognizes the importance of protecting threatened lands \nthroughout the country.\n\n\n                             idaho programs\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, would the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee yield for a colloquy regarding several important, proposed \nprojects under the jurisdiction of the Interior Subcommittee?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator from Idaho to \ndiscuss this important issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. First, allow me to thank the Chairman and the Ranking \nMember for their hard work on the Fiscal year 2001 Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill. Despite scarce resources and tough \nchoices, they came up with a fiscally responsible bill that meets \nimportant priorities, which I support.\n  There are some important projects to be funded in this bill that I \nwould like to work with the Chairman on.\n  We are proud to be the home of Lake Coeur d'Alene in North Idaho. It \nhas become a world-class destination for all sorts of outdoor \nactivities--from golf to water sports to mountain biking. This tourism \nis important to the local economy and the ability to partake in these \nactivities is vital to the local residents' quality of life. I know the \nChairman is very familiar with the area, since it is a short distance \nfrom Spokane, Washington and is a popular recreation destination for \nmany of his constituents.\n  The problem we have encountered is a lack of public boat launching \nfacilities. Most of the lake front land around the lake is privately \nowned, so land for public launch facilities is scarce. However, the \nBureau of Land Management has purchased land for a boat launch facility \nand has completed all of the appropriate studies and planning; they are \nsimply lacking the funds to build the facility. The local community, \nincluding many residents of Washington State, tenaciously support the \nproject and are willing to provide about $700,000 toward the project.\n  In the same part of the great State of Idaho, mining has been and, \nhopefully, will continue to be a substantial part of the local \neconomy--providng the minerals we all need. The University of Idaho and \nWashington State University want to work with the U.S. Geological \nSurvey to develop new high-tech methods of modeling geology, to be \ntested in North Idaho, but eventually applied world-wide, to provide \nbetter exploration and modeling techniques to find groundwater, \nminerals, etc.\n  In the Southern part of Idaho, we are very concerned about the \nproposed listing of the Sage Grouse as an endangered species. The U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the species, \nwhich would have a dramatic impact on the lives of the people of \nSouthern Idaho, as well as future BLM and Forest Service operations. It \nbecomes readily apparent when you visit Southern Idaho that the entire \nregion is habitat for Sage Grouse.\n  Local working groups have been formed across Southern Idaho to find \nlocal, collaborative projects to restore Sage Grouse habitat and the \nspecies which would make a listing under the Endangered Species Act \nunnecessary. To be successful, this effort appropriately requires some \nfederal support.\n  Finally, also in Southern Idaho, there is an urgent need to re-open \nthe BLM's air tanker resupply base at the Twin Falls airport. This base \nwas closed in 1998, after an internal inspection indicated unsafe \nconditions. This is the only such base within 100 miles of most of the \nIdaho-Nevada border, which uniquely suits it to provide the fastest \npossible response and turnaround times in this area during the fire \nseason. In this vast expanse of vulnerable landscape, in the dry \nseason, a small accident rapidly could become a major fire disaster. \nWe've seen that happen in other parts of the country and we should take \nsteps here to prevent it. The community has worked diligently with the \nlocal BLM office to re-open the base as soon as possible. However, in \nthe national office, this project has been slipped back from year to \nyear and down the priority list. Everyone agrees this base must be \nreplaced. Our concern is simply that it should be done now, rather than \nbe subject to further postponement.\n  I hope the chairman will work with me when this bill goes to \nconference to find funds for all of these important and fiscally \nresponsible projects.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator from Idaho's interest in these \nprojects. I am familiar with them and recognize their value.\n  I would be happy to work with the Senator to make sure appropriate \nconsideration is given to these projects in the Conference Committee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                         clean coal technology\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year 2001 \nInterior and Related Agencies appropriations bills, I wish to take a \nmoment to address the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology \nDemonstration program, one of the most successful public-private \nresearch ventures ever undertaken, and one of the more important \nprojects funded in this legislation.\n  Fundamentally, the goal of the Clean Coal program is simple: \nEncourage the private sector to design and demonstrate advanced \ntechnologies which will use coal, our most abundant fossil energy \nresource, more cleanly and efficiently. To achieve that goal, I \ninitiated the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program in 1984 with \nan initial appropriation of $750 million. In subsequent years, I was \nable to add to those funds for a total amount in excess of $2.0 \nbillion. I am pleased to recall that then-President Ronald Reagan \njoined with me in endorsing the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration \nprogram.\n  As established, the program calls for the cost of clean coal \ndemonstration projects to be shared equally between the Federal \ngovernment and the private sector. Forty clean coal projects have been \nselected through a series of competitive solicitations issued by the \nDepartment of Energy. And while Congress required industry to \ncontribute 50 percent of the cost of selected projects, I am proud to \nsay that, in toto, industry has in fact contributed more than 66 \npercent of the total cost. Moreover, project sponsors are required to \nrepay the Federal government's share of the project cost if and when \nthe technologies are commercialized.\n  Beyond the successes that have come from the Clean Coal program, \nthough, a few simple facts will also underscore the real necessity of \nthe program as well. Our nation has approximately 274 billion tons of \nrecoverable coal reserves. At current rates of consumption those \nreserves amount to more than a 200-year supply. Furthermore, more than \none half--54 percent to be exact--of the electricity generated in this \ncountry last year came from coal. Mr. President, those are staggering \nstatistics which prove that American coal is, and will remain, an \nabundant and critically important energy source. But those statistics \nalso suggest that our reliance on coal must be carried out in a manner \nwhich utilizes the cleanest and most efficient technologies possible. \nAnd that is what the Clean Coal program is intended to accomplish.\n  In furtherance of that objective, the Committee on Appropriations, \nthrough its report accompanying this bill, has directed the Department \nof Energy to issue a report to Congress by March 1, 2001, depicting the \nnature and content of a potential new round of Clean Coal Technology \nprojects. This information is vital if we in the Congress are to direct \nthe Department to utilize funds already available in the Clean Coal \nprogram for the purpose of funding additional demonstration projects.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, I have heard from a number of companies \ninterested in coal and the development of technologies that will allow \nthis nation to make the best use of this abundant energy resource. \nThese companies, some of which are in my own state of West Virginia, \nhave recommended that any new clean coal solicitation be focused \nprincipally upon technologies that will reduce the environmental \nimpacts from existing, as well as new, coal-fired facilities. In \naddition, I believe that we ought to be encouraging newer technologies \nthat are even more advanced than the clean coal technologies that\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\nhave been demonstrated thus far. A new solicitation should therefore \nencourage technologies capable of reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide \n(SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), or mercury, as well as \nincreasing the operating efficiency of coal-fired power plants thereby \nreducing--and through technologies, working to eliminate--carbon \ndioxide emissions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia in addressing the Clean Coal \nTechnology program. I would also like to commend the Chairman of the \nInterior Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, and of course the Ranking \nMember, Senator Byrd for their work relating to the Clean Coal \nTechnology Demonstration program.\n  Mr. President, I share the optimism of the leaders of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee with respects to the innovations that could \nbe made with further clean coal technology projects. I specifically \nwant to draw attention to one area in which I think that there is great \npotential--lignite energy development. In my state of North Dakota, the \nlignite industry provides a low-cost, reliable energy source for more \nthan 2 million people in the upper Midwest. This industry directly \nemploys 3,000 people in North Dakota and has great potential to \nincrease the efficiency of coal-fired power plants while reducing the \nemissions with the application of new coal technologies.\n\n  Mr. President, because of the importance of lignite coal, I would \nurge the Department of Energy to specifically explore the development \nof low-rank coals, coals containing high-sodium, and mine-mouth \napplications and concepts in any new round of Clean Coal Technology \nprojects. I also believe, and I would hope the Department would agree, \ntoo, that preference should be given to those states that have lignite \nresearch and development programs requiring public and private \ncollaboration. This kind of work should be aspects of the study that \nthe Committee report requires of the Department.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota and I agree that the lignite \nenergy industry has the potential to develop more environmentally sound \nand economically efficient technologies. I certainly welcome efforts to \nensure that the lignite energy industry is given due consideration by \nthe Energy Department as it develops its criteria for further Clean \nCoal Technology projects.\n  Mr. President, does the Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee agree \nwith us about the need to consider the potential of lignite energy \ntechnologies in any new round of Clean Coal Technology projects?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I recognize that the Clean Coal Technology \nprogram is an important priority for Senator Byrd and Senator Dorgan \nand I urge the Department of Energy to consider the viability of \nconcepts not fully developed on low-rank coals and coals containing \nhigh sodium as it works on the study we have requested.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his consideration, \nand wonder if he would answer a question or two to help clarify the \nCommittee's directive regarding the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration \nprogram?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would be happy to answer the Senator's \nquestions. I know he is a champion of coal and the Clean Coal \nTechnology program, and I am also aware of his abiding interest in the \nenvironmentally sound use of coal as a source of power for this nation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would it be the Senator's thought that the \nDepartment should support technologies which control emissions from \ncoal use or increase the operating efficiency of coal-based power \nplants?\n  Mr. GORTON. In response, let me say, Mr. President, that those are \ncertainly the types of technologies that the Department should address.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator also agree with me that \nfurther demonstrations projects should be at a size that would permit \nimmediate scale up to commercial capacity? And also, in that instance \nwhere the technology is to be applied to an existing plant, that the \ntechnology should be widely applicable to a very significant number of \nexisting coal-fired generating facilities?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, again, I agree with the Senator. Given \npending environmental requirements applicable to these coal-fired \nunits, it would be my hope that the Department of Energy would consider \nlarger scale projects able to be commercialized immediately. Also, any \nprogram should be aimed at developing technologies that could be \napplied to the greatest number of existing units possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his \ncourtesy in answering my inquiries.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to ask the Chairman a question about the \nlanguage concerning the 1994 Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan on page 18 \nof the report accompanying this legislation. It is the Chairman's \nunderstanding that the language refers specifically to certain tasks \nwhich the Fish and Wildlife Service committed in the Recovery Plan to \ncomplete by 1999 and, to my knowledge, have not even begun?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. As the Chairman knows, I am deeply troubled that the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and \nother federal agencies have moved very quickly to impose the land use \ncontrols recommended in the Recovery Plan, but have failed to undertake \nthe basic tasks called for in that document to determine whether those \nland use controls are truly appropriate and are proving to be \neffective. I am speaking of three tasks: the desert tortoise monitoring \nthat the Plan called ``crucial to determining if desert tortoise \npopulations are stationary, declining, or increasing''; the desert \ntortoise population estimations that the Plan stated would be made \nevery three to five years; and the Plan's reassessment that also was to \nbe conducted every three to five years.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. The Committee fully expects the \nUSFWS to fulfill its commitments in the Recovery Plan to carry out the \ndesert tortoise monitoring, population estimation, and Recovery Plan \nreassessment. Additionally, the Committee expected the plan called for \nin the report language will focus solely on those three tasks.\n  Mr. BENNETT. One last point. To ensure that appropriated funds are \nspent wisely, I want to voice my concern that any methodology to be \nemployed in conducting the monitoring be designed to permit correlation \nof the new data with the data gathered between 1980 and 2000. This will \nensure that population trends, and the efficacy of programs and \nmitigation undertaken since 1980, can be determined.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator makes an excellent point. The Committee \nagrees that the desert tortoise monitoring methodology should be \ndesigned as you suggest.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n              Land and Water Conservation Funds for Idaho\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, would the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee yield for a colloquy regarding Land and Water Conservation \nFunds for Idaho?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator to discuss \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. CRAPO. First, allow me to commend the Chairman for his leadership \nand hard work on this bill. He and the Subcommittee have had to make \ndifficult decisions with scarce resources and have worked hard to do so \nin a fair manner. I appreciate the Chairman's efforts and diligence.\n  Idaho is a state of spectacular natural beauty and wildlife habitat. \nAs the Chairman knows, an opportunity exists to use Land and Water \nConservation Funds (LWCF) to acquire easements in the state to protect \nthese valuable habitats and scenic values.\n  While I am concerned regarding the level of funding appropriated, I \nappreciate the Subcommittee's recognition of the importance of funding \neasements in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, near the Snake \nRiver Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, and on the Lower Salmon \nRiver. However, many other LWCF projects in the state were not funded. \nProtecting deer habitat in the Soda Springs Hills, acquiring inholdings \nto protect elk range and address historic mining activities in the \nSilver Spar Land Acquisition, securing easements along the Upper Snake \nRiver and South Fork of the Snake River, and acquiring private land, \nthe\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nSulfur Creek Ranch, within the Frank Church River of No Return \nWilderness area are all important projects. These projects are all \nlocally-driven, with wide-spread support, and anxious willing-sellers.\n  I recognize that the Subcommittee is operating under significant \nfinancial restraints and that, unfortunately, not all worthy projects \ncan be funded. It is my hope that if additional LWCF money becomes \navailable, the Chairman can revisit these important Idaho projects. I \nwould ask the Chairman if he would work with us in conference to \nevaluate these requests, with an eye toward inclusion in the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. Gorton. I appreciate Senator Crapo's interest in these projects. \nI am familiar with these projects and recognize the value in protecting \nthese lands.\n  I would be happy to work with the Senator to reevaluate these \nprojects in the conference committee. If additional LWCF funding \nbecomes available, we will consider what can be done to address these \nneeds.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Nation is blessed with many natural \ntreasures that hold unique scientific or cultural value.\n  That's why in 1906 the Congress passed and the President signed the \nAntiquities Act to give us a way to protect these unique lands.\n  Since 1906, presidents of all parties have used the act to designate \nover 100 national monuments--including several which Congress later \ndesignated as National Parks including the Grand Canyon, Grand Teton \nand Olympic National Parks.\n  Each year, more than 50 million visitors enjoy our country's national \nmonuments. Today, there are other unique areas throughout our country \nthat hold similar value. Unfortunately, some of these remarkable areas \nare threatened by growth, development, and harvesting.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to protect these natural \ntreasures. I believe we have a responsibility to be a good steward of \nthese lands and to pass them on--untarnished--to future generations\n  I'm proud that Washington state is home to the Hanford Reach--which \nis the last-free flowing stretch of the Columbia River. During World \nWar II and the Cold War, the people of the Tri-Cities made sacrifices \nthat helped our nation end World War II and win the Cold War. Because \nof the high security around the nuclear facility, for decades this part \nof the Columbia River and the surrounding land was protected from \ndevelopment. Unfortunately, its future was not certain.\n  The Hanford Reach is a key salmon spawning ground and as many of my \ncolleagues know we are working in the Pacific Northwest to help recover \nour once-abundant salmon stocks. I was pleased that the President used \nhis authority--under the Antiquities Act--to designate the Hanford \nReach as a National Monument.\n  Mr. President, it was the right thing to do.\n  That designation will help us recover salmon stocks, will ensure \nfamilies can continue to enjoy the Reach, and will share the history of \nthe Tri-Cities with the American public. And of course, the designation \nwill preserve a unique habitat for future generations.\n  I hope that in the future, the Hanford Reach National Monument \nreceives the attention and recognition that it deserves. The Olympic \nNational Park began as a National Monument--one of the first--\ndesignated by President Roosevelt in 1909. Many generations of \nAmericans have enjoyed the natural splendor that the Olympics and the \nsurrounding area offer. I hope that the Hanford Reach will also become \na destination for Americans eager to learn more about our past.\n  Unfortunately, the Nickles' amendment would deny the possibility of \nsuch protection to other deserving areas around the country. It is \nclear that supporters of this amendment are unhappy with the \nPresident's use of the Antiquities Act. But in the end, the President \nhas legally exercised the authority vested in him by the Act.\n  If this Congress is really unhappy with the Antiquities Act, it could \namend the Act itself or override particular designations. But we all \nknow that won't happen. The reason it won't happen is because the \nmajority of Americans believe that the lands protected under the \nAntiquities Act are deserving of such protection.\n  The Grand Canyon, Devils Tower, Mt. Olympus, Jackson Hole, Death \nValley, Joshua Tree--have all been named as national monuments. Few \nwould argue these areas are not worthy of such recognition and \nprotection. The fact is many of these designations have been so popular \nthat Congress later designated them as national parks, often expanding \nthem at the same time. Again, Olympic National Park in my home state is \nan example of such Congressional action.\n  In 1906, Congress had the wisdom to grant the President the power to \nprotect important natural and historic areas of our country. The need \nfor such power is not at an end. Threats of development and impacts \nfrom other activities will continue and in some cases will lead to the \nrecognition that greater protection for certain federal lands is \nwarranted. At that time, the President, who ever she or he may be, \nshould have the ability to act as every President has since 1906. \nIndeed, since the Antiquities Act was passed 14 of the 17 Presidents \nhave used its powers.\n  If it is indeed the will of Congress to limit this historic power of \nthe Presidency, then let us do so after a full and public legislative \nprocess. This amendment is simply a back-door attempt to accomplish \nwhat the sponsor and supporters know they cannot do through a stand \nalone bill.\n  Despite some controversy, the President's designations have had the \nsupport of members of Congress and the public. In fact, I--along with \nmany members of my state's delegation in the House--supported the \nPresident's recent designation of the Hanford Reach as a national \nmonument. This designation was also supported by many people in the \nTri-Cities and across the state.\n  Before I close I remind my colleagues that a similar amendment was \nincluded in the House Interior bill as it was reported by the \nCommittee. Fortunately, thanks to the leadership of Congressman Dicks \nand Congressman Boehlert, that amendment was removed from the House \nbill. However, before the amendment's removal, the House bill received \na veto threat because of this provision. We can certainly expect a \nsimilar veto threat from the Administration if this amendment is \nadopted.\n  For the first time in years, we have the opportunity to pass a free \nstanding Interior Appropriations bill into law. This amendment would \nseriously compromise that possibility.\n  We should stand up for the people and communities who are eager to \nshare in the benefits of these national monuments.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bryan \namendment, which would ensure protection of our nations forests. This \namendment would cut $30 million from the National Forest System's \nforest products program and would redirect $15 million to the Wildland \nFire Management's fire preparedness program. The amendment would return \nthe remaining funds to the Treasury to reduce the national debt. There \nare many reasons why I support this amendment, but let me discuss just \ntwo.\n  First, is the need to end corporate welfare. It is estimated that \nwithin the federal budget corporate welfare makes up anywhere from $86 \nbillion (CATO Institute) to $265 billion (Progressive Policy \nInstitute). A recent report by the Green Scissors Coalition estimates \nthat over a five year period the Federal government will spend $36 \nbillion on wasteful and environmentally harmful projects such as the \nforest products program.\n  Second, simply, is that by passing this amendment, we enact good \nenvironmental policy. The continual construction of new roads required \nto access our nation's forests removes ground cover and creates a \nchannel for water to run down, accelerates soil erosion, weakens \nhillsides and fouls steams, destroying the foundation of our \nrecreational and commercial fisheries. Logging roads are a major source \nof non-point source water pollution. According to the National Forest \nService, 922 communities receive their drinking water from streams \nwithin the national forests-streams that are polluted from contaminated \nrun-off associated with construction.\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n  The protection of our roadless areas is important because they \nrepresent an important legacy for future generations. Areas without \nroads are becoming scarce in this country and in our national forests. \nRoadless areas provide significant benefits including: opportunities \nfor dispersed recreation, clean, clear sources of public drinking \nwater; large undisturbed landscapes that provide privacy and seclusion; \nbulwarks against the spread of invasive species; habitat for fish and \ngame and other rare plant and animal species.\n  While I would prefer to see this program eliminated completely, at \nthe minimum timber companies should not be subsidized by the taxpayers. \nThe timber industry, like any other business, should bear its own \ncosts. At a time when we are asking all Americans to do more with less, \nwe should have the courage to ask the special interests to at least pay \ntheir own way. I support the Bryan amendment, and ask my colleagues to \njoin me by voting for this important initiative.\n  While I have the floor, I will take a moment to comment on \nlegislation that the Senate will soon consider. The Conservation and \nReinvestment Act would guarantee full funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and afford permanent protection to our nation's \nthreatened natural, cultural, and historical treasures.\n  In 1964, Congress made the decision to reinvest revenue from the \ndevelopment of non-renewable resources into acquisition and permanent \nprotection of key land, water, and open space. In the 30 years since \nits creation, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has been \nresponsible for the acquisition of nearly seven million acres of \nparkland-contributing to the creation of the Appalachian Trail, \nEverglades and Rocky Mountain National Parks. In New Jersey, it helped \nfund the acquisition of Sterling Forest, and the Cape May and Walkill \nNational Wildlife Refuges.\n  However, the LWCF is not a true trust fund in the way ``trust fund'' \nis generally understood by the public. Despite the fact that by law, \nthe revenues are supposed to go to the LWCF, Congress must appropriate \nthe money before it can be spent; if appropriations are not made, the \nrevenues instead go to the General Treasury, to be spent on defense, or \nroads, or whatever Congress decides. The practical effect is that \nhistorically, only a small portion of the funds in the LWCF has \nactually been used for land preservation.\n  At no time has full funding of the LWCF been more needed than today, \nas the demands of development and suburbanization jeopardize land \npreservation efforts. The United States loses 50 acres an hour to \ndevelopment. In New Jersey, we know all too well the effects of \nsuburban sprawl. Since 1961, New Jersey has lost half a million acres \nto sprawl. This is not surprising when you consider that New Jersey \nranks 9th in terms of population. The reality is that sprawl is \nsettling in over our open space.\n  In a very exciting development, the House of Representatives recently \npassed LWCF legislation, and this bill now stands in the Senate. I am \nhopeful that the Senate will mark up its legislation this week, and I \nurge the Leadership to schedule floor time for this landmark initiative \nas soon as possible.\n  Inscribed in one of the hallways of our nation's Capitol are the \nwords of Theodore Roosevelt. He said: ``The nation behaves well if it \ntreats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the \nnext generation increased, and not impaired in value.'' Let us act on \nthis vision and pass this extraordinary initiative during the 106th \nCongress.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, every year at this time it seems we're here \non the Senate floor debating another attack on the Forest Service's \nTimber Management Program. Every year those who wish to eliminate \nlogging in our National Forests come up with another angle which they \nclaim helps protect the environment by eliminating ``wasteful'' \nspending on logging practices. Every year people throughout northern \nMinnesota and forested regions across the country see their jobs and \ntheir livelihoods threatened in the name of preservation or \nconservation. And every year, those of us who represent the good people \nof the timber and paper industry in our states have to fight, scratch, \nand claw our way to a narrow victory that saves those jobs and those \nfamilies from economic ruin.\n  I come from a state in which the forest and paper industry is vital \nto our economy. The reduction in the timber program on National Forests \nhas had a dramatic impact over the past ten years on the number of jobs \nand the economic vitality of northern Minnesota. According to Minnesota \nForest Industries (MFI), jobs provided by the timber program in \nMinnesota dropped from over 1,900 in 1987 to less than 1,100 last year, \nand they continue to decline.\n  The reduction in timber harvests on federal lands has had an equally \ndramatic effect on unrealized economic impacts. MFI estimates that \nunrealized economic benefits include over $10 million from timber \nsales, $25 million in federal taxes, $2.5 million in payments to \nstates, and $116 million in community economic impact in Minnesota \nalone.\n  It's important to point out that the timber program in National \nForests have a very positive impact on the amount of federal money that \ngoes to rural counties and schools. Nationally, the program contribute \n$225 million to counties and schools each year through receipts from \ntimber sales in national forests. In Minnesota, the timber program \nprovided roughly $1.7 million to counties and schools in 1998 alone. If \nthe timber program would have met its allowable sale quantity in 1998, \nthat number would have risen to nearly $2.5 million.\n  I'm fascinated by the claims of some of my colleagues that the timber \nprogram is a subsidy to wealthy timber and paper companies and the \nclaims that the timber program loses money because we're giving timber \naway to these companies. If you truly believe that, I challenge you to \nvisit forested regions and speak with the families who have lost their \nmills and the loggers who have lost their jobs. Talk to the counties \nand the private landowners who cannot access to their own property \nbecause the Forest Service doesn't have enough money to do the \nenvironmental reviews. Or talk directly to the Forest Service personnel \nand let them tell you how lengthy and costly environmental reviews and \nthe overwhelming number of court challenges to those reviews are making \nthe timber program so costly.\n  Then go speak with state or county land managers and ask them why \ntheir timber programs are so successful. Ask them why their lands are \nso much more healthy than the federal lands and why they're able to \nmake money with their timber programs. In Minnesota, St. Louis County \nonly has to spend 26 cents in order to generate one dollars of revenue \nin their timber program and the State of Minnesota spend 75 cents to \ngenerate one dollar of revenue. The Superior National Forest, on the \nother hand, spend one dollar and three cents to get the same results.\n  I cannot see how my colleagues can stand here on the Senate floor and \ntell me that the forest and paper industry in our country, and its \nemployees, are the bad guys. The forest and paper industry in America \nemploys over 1.5 million people and ranks among the top ten \nmanufacturing employers in 46 states. These are good, traditional jobs \nthat help a family make a living, allow children to pursue higher \neducation, help keep rural families in rural areas, and provide a \nlegitimate a base from which rural counties can fund basic services. \nThese are jobs that we in Congress should be working diligently not \nonly to protect, but to grow.\n  Unfortunately, many Members of Congress who advocate these ideas have \nnever taken the time to understand the positive economic and \nenvironmental benefits of science-based timber harvests. They've never \nsat down with a county commissioner who doesn't know where he is going \nto get the money for some of the most basic services the county \nprovides to its citizens. They've never considered that for every 1 \nmillion board feet in timber harvest reductions in Minnesota, 10 people \nlose their jobs and over $570,000 in economic activity is lost. And \nthey've never taken the time to go into a health forest where prudent \nlogging practices have been essential to ensuring the vitality and \ndiversity of species.\n  If Members of this body want to make the timber program profitable \nacross the country, then we should have an honest debate about what\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nworks and does not work in the program. We should discuss frankly the \nridiculous number of hoops public land managers have to jump through in \norder to process a timber sale. I think we need to discuss the fact \nthat under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act the \nfederal government must provide access across federal lands for state, \ncounty, and private landowners to access their land. Yet in Minnesota, \nthose landowners either have to wait a number of years or pay for the \nenvironmental reviews themselves because the Forest Service claims it \ndoesn't have enough money. We should also discuss openly the dramatic \nimpact court challenges are having on the ability of the Forest Service \nto do its job and to carry out the timber program in a cost-effective \nmanner. On top of that, it's clear that under this Administration the \nForest Service doesn't want a timber program that shows a profit and \nthey've done an effective job of using the powers of the Executive \nBranch to vilify both the timber program and the men and women of my \nstate who rely upon that program in order to meet their most basic \nneeds.\n  Virtually everyone in this body, including this Senator, is committed \nto the protection of our environment and to the conservation of our \nwildlife species and wildlife habitat. I believe we can expand upon our \ncommitment to wildlife and provide additional resources for habitat \nprotection. But I do not believe we must do so on the backs of timber \nand paper workers throughout the nation. I am willing to work with \nanybody in this chamber towards those conservation efforts, but let's \nnot do it by pitting timber and paper workers against conservationists.\n  We cannot simply stand here and claim that the Bryan amendment is an \neasy way to throw some money towards planning for the threat of forest \nfires. Rather, this amendment is going to take jobs from my \nconstituents and hurt the economy of the northern part of my state. The \nBryan amendment is just one more step down the road toward eliminating \nlogging on federal land. This amendment is going to reduce the ability \nof a number of rural counties in my state to make ends meet and to \nprovide necessary services to residents. These are just a few of the \nrealities of the Bryan amendment and just a few of the reasons why I \ncannot and will not support its passage.\n\n\n              archie carr national wildlife refuge funding\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to first thank my colleagues, \nSenators Gorton and Byrd for their support in obtaining $2 million in \nthe Fiscal Year 2001 Interior Appropriations bill for the Archie Carr \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1991. It is \n900 acres in Brevard County Florida which makes up the twenty mile \nsection of coastline from Melbourne Beach to Wabasso Beach in Florida. \nIt is the most important nesting area for loggerhead sea turtles in the \nwestern hemisphere and the second most important nesting beach in the \nworld.\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to join my colleague in thanking Senators \nGorton and Byrd and the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for their \nsupport for the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge. Twenty percent of \nall loggerhead sea turtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the \nUnited States occur in this twenty mile zone. Nesting densities of \n1,000 nests per mile have been recorded. Approximately half of this \narea is available for acquisition. The funds in this legislation will \nbe critical in our ability to move forward on these acquisitions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Despite the importance of this refuge to the loggerhead \nsea turtle, there is no refuge station at Archie Carr. The result is \nboth a lack of educational opportunities for visitors and a lack of \nsecurity at the refuge. I join my colleague, Senator Mack, in proposing \nthat $200,000 of the funds provided by the Fiscal Year 2001 Interior \nAppropriations bill for the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge be \navailable for use by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the purpose \nof site evaluation for a visitor center/research and education center.\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Senators Mack and Graham. I share your desire \nto support the need of our National Wildlife Refuges, in particular the \nneeds of Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, and will work with \nSenators Mack and Graham to see if funds can be identified to support \nsite evaluation for a visitor center/research and education center.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you, Senator Gorton. I, too, share the goal of \nensuring that our National Wildlife Refuge System receives the funds it \nrequires to preserve the critical habitat it was designed to protect. I \nconcur with your position on the proposal made by Senators Graham and \nMack.\n\n\n        north carolina's stream gauges and monitoring equipment\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank you for including my amendment to provide \n$1,800,000 in emergency funds for the United States Geological Survey \nto repair and replace stream monitoring equipment damaged by natural \ndisasters. As you know, your Committee recommended a significant \nincrease in the USGS's Real Time Hazards Initiative, including \n$3,100,000 for new or upgraded stream gauging stations.\n  1999 was a devastating year for North Carolina. Hurricanes Floyd, \nDennis and Irene did extensive damage across eastern North Carolina. \nAnd early indications are that this hurricane season will be just as \nactive for North Carolina as last year. North Carolina's stream gauges \nand monitoring equipment are in desperate need of upgrade and \nenhancement. I respectfully request that the Committee recommend that \nthe United States Geological Survey give special consideration to North \nCarolina's needs and address the need for upgrades and enhancements \nthrough this appropriation.\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand that the USGS is willing to address North \nCarolina's specific needs for stream gauges and monitoring equipment \nthrough the Real Time Hazards Initiative. The Committee recognizes the \nunique danger in North Carolina and, therefore, strongly encourages the \nUSGS to ensure that North Carolina's stream gauges and monitoring \ndevices are enhanced or upgraded to the degree possible within \nappropriations provided for these types of activities.\n\n\n                   electro-catalytic oxidation (eco)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues, Senator \nGorton, Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee; and \nSenator Byrd, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, about a new and \ninnovative technology. Mr. Chairman, are you aware of an emerging \ntechnology known as electro-catalytic oxidation (ECO), which has the \npotential to reduce emissions, as well as unusable byproducts at coal-\nfired power plants?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would inform the Senator from Ohio that \nI have been made aware of ECO.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask if he concurs that the Secretary of Energy should \nparticipate in a full-scale demonstration of this technology that is \nplanned for the near future.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would certainly encourage the Department to take a \nclose look at this technology within the context of its coal research \nprograms, and consider carefully any related research or demonstration \nproposal that may be submitted.\n  Mr. DeWINE. As the senior Senator from West Virginia is aware, the \nearly tests of this technology show a significant reduction of nitrogen \noxide (Nox), sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury, and fine particulate \nmatter. Would the Senator agree that a cost-effective reduction of \nthese emissions is in the best interest of coal-fired power consumers \nas well as the coal industry?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would agree with the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the very distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia and would note that the Senator from New Hampshire, the state \nwere ECO was developed, is optimistic about the potential of the \ntechnology. Would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. SMITH (of New Hampshire). I would agree with my colleague from \nOhio and add that I applaud the innovative efforts that have led to the \ndevelopment of this emerging emissions control technology. As many of \nyou know, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is \ncurrently working to develop a bill that will address the significant \nproblem of the hodge-podge of overlapping Clean Air Act regulation on \nutilities. Our goal is to draft a comprehensive, multi-pollutant bill \nto provide a more sensible\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nemission control regime on utilities while at the same time achieving \ngreater reductions of pollutants than is currently possible under the \nClean Air Act. New technologies, much as electro-catalytic oxidation \nwill be critically important to our ability to successfully revise our \napproach to utility emission control. I would support any efforts to \nexpedite the development of this technology.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for his support of this important \ntechnology, and I would welcome the opportunity to more closely examine \nhis proposals related to Clean Air reauthorization, and comment on them \nat a future time. I also thank the Chairman of the Interior \nSubcommittee and the senior Senator from West Virginia and would \nencourage them to consider the benefits of ECO to consumers of coal-\nfired power as well as coal producing states when this bill moves to \nconference with the other body.\n\n\n           FY 2001 Interior Appropriations for Maine Projects\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Maine and the nation have an opportunity to \naccomplish an enormously meaningful level of forest protection in \nMaine's 10 million acre Northern Forest if significant funding for \nForest Service accounts is allocated for Maine projects in fiscal year \n2001. In the last two years, an astounding 20 percent of Maine's total \nforestland acreage has changed ownership, an occurrence that represents \na significant shift in the pattern of stable long-term ownership and \nuse that has characterized the Maine woods for at least the last \nhundred years.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senior Senator for Maine is correct, Mr. Chairman. \nThis tremendous turnover calls into question whether the traditional \nuse of these lands for forestry and for outdoor recreational activities \nwill continue. We are fortunate that the present owners of these \nvaluable lands are offering an opportunity to secure their lasting \nprotection and productivity. I, along with Senator Snowe, support these \nefforts through funding from the Forest Legacy Program and the Forest \nService's land acquisition program and hope we can work together during \nthis appropriations process to take advantage of the opportunity \nafforded us at this time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank you for your strong support \nfor Forest Legacy funding in FY 2000 in approving $3 million Title 6 \nfunding for Maine for Phase I of the 656,000 acre West Branch project. \nThis funding, along with the $2 million already allocated from the \nstate grant portion of LWCF, will complement the $4 million being \nsecured through non-federal sources for the conservation and protection \nof 70,000 acres of undeveloped forestland, including more than 100 \nmiles of undeveloped shoreline along Moosehead Lake, Seboomook Lake, \nand several smaller lakes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Phase II of the West Branch project consists of the \nremaining acreage of approximately 580,000 acres of what is one of the \nlargest contiguous blocks of forest under single management in the \neastern United States and has sustained a flow of timber products for \nmore than 100 years.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senators' interest in this worthy \nproject and I would be happy to work with the Senators to ensure \nappropriate consideration is given to these projects in Conference.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The second Forest Legacy project, Mr. Chairman, known as \nMt. Blue/Tumbledown Mountain, is a two-phase project totaling \napproximately 33,400 acres and will protect some of Maine's most scenic \nareas--including Tumbledown Mountain, Jackson Mountain, Blueberry \nMountain and trailheads leading to these peaks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. An amount of $1.2 million in Forest Legacy funding will \nallow the acquisition in fee of 3,600 acres immediately adjacent to \nMaine's Mt. Blue State Park, and will bring needed protections to \nMaine's scenic and popular Western Mountain region. I want to express \nmy strong support for the project.\n  Mr. GORTON. Once again, I appreciate the Senators' interest in this \nworthy project and I would be pleased to work with the Senators to see \nthat this project is considered fully in Conference.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I also want to thank you for your appropriations support \nfor funds for the Pingree Forest, which is an excellent example of \nprivate sector cooperation and conservation, while at the same time \npreserving the working forests of our State. The Pingree Family of \nMaine has been exemplary in the way it has managed its lands for seven \ngenerations--160 years. As you are aware, the Pingree Family has \nentered into the Pingree Forest Partnership with the New England \nForestry Foundation, which has committed to raise $30 million for a \nconservation easement on 754,673 acres of land in Northern and Western \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The New England Forestry Foundation is within $11.5 \nmillion of its goal, which, under the terms of the partnership \nagreement with the Pingree family, must be met by December 31 of this \nyear. I would note that the Pingree Family has agreed to sell this \neasement on their land at only $37.10 an acre.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am very much in support of what the parties are trying \nto preserve--a way of life through forestry in Maine and the \nconservation of the magnificent Northeast forests of this nation--and I \nwill carry that support into conference. Funding of this project is \ncertainly a wise use of federal funds for the conservation of \noutstanding undeveloped lands, and also keeping the Maine woods in \nsustainable forestry.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank you for your close scrutiny of the merits of this \nproject and your support for what is currently the largest single land \nconservation project in the world. I would like to point out that, for \nany appropriation to work under the agreement, I urge you to allocate \nthe funds through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to the New \nEngland Forestry Foundation, which will hold the easement for the \nPingree land.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to add that, in the past, all of NFWF's \nfederal grants have been appropriated through a designation to the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service's Land and Water Conservation Fund, and NFWF \nhas received funds from the Forest Service for grants over the past ten \nyears. NFWF's excellent track record gives me confidence that it is the \nright steward of this important project.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree that this clarification is necessary and agree \nthat the funds should be allocated through NFWF.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Once again, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWashington State and praise his continuing efforts for the conservation \nof our nation's private lands, especially those of great importance to \nthe people of Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I also thank you for your support, Mr. Chairman, for \nsupporting these appropriations that will enable Pingree land to \ncontinue to supply area mills and support the local economy while \nallowing the public continued recreational access.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Gorton, concerning future demonstration projects \nunder the Clean Coal Technology program. Mr. President, clarifying the \nintent of the program will be helpful in my efforts to ensure that a \nvery worthwhile initiative in Pennsylvania received full consideration \nby the Department of Energy.\n  The lack of a coherent and consistent energy policy has contributed \nto the high fuel prices that have hit the working families in \nPennsylvania and across the nation very hard. It is the lack of a \nnational energy policy that has led to our nation's reliance on foreign \noil. Today, we import 56 percent of our fuel. This is the highest level \nin the history of our country. For a historical perspective, we only \nimported 36 percent of our oil during the energy crisis of the 1970s.\n  Mr. President, we must reduce our reliance on imported oil. We must \nconserve energy resources, improve energy efficiencies, and increase \ndomestic energy supplies. We also need to aggressively expand our \nresearch and development efforts to encourage the use of domestic \nrenewable energy sources.\n  The Pennsylvania initiative that I referred to would do just that by \ndeveloping a facility that would convert Anthracite culm to a clean \ndiesel fuel. The project would produce 1.4 million\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nbarrels a year of zero-sulfur, high-energy diesel fuel, at the same \ntime reclaiming land now rendered unusable and environmentally \ndamaging. Additionally, it would create 1,000 construction and 150 \npermanent jobs.\n  Would the Senator agree that the establishment of such a facility, \nwhose principal focus is to develop domestic renewable energy sources \nby transforming coal and coal waste into high quality diesel fuel, is \nthe type of activity that the Clean Coal Technology program should \nencourage?\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree with my friend that the Clean Coal Technology \nprogram is meant to encourage projects that develop environmentally-\nfriendly technologies, such as coal conversion. I believe that the \nDepartment of Energy should use its limited funding resources to expand \nits efforts to encourage the development of domestic renewable energy \nsources.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As this bill moves forward into conference, is it the \nSenator's intention to seek adequate funding for the Clean Coal \nTechnology program so that the Department of Energy can begin a new \nround of demonstration projects, including a project such as the \nPennsylvania initiative I have described here today?\n  Mr. GORTON. As my colleague is aware, the Senate report accompanying \nthe FY 2001 Interior bill directs the Department to report on options \nfor a new solicitation in the Clean Coal program. In the context of \npreparing this report, and in conducting any future solicitation, I \nwould expect the Department to give full consideration to such \nworthwhile projects as the one described by my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, with 1 minute to spare, that concludes the \nintroduction of all amendments pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement of last week.\n  I repeat, if Members wish to speak to these amendments, they may do \nso after the conclusion of all of the votes on H.R. 4810, which will \nbegin almost immediately. These amendments, to the extent that they \nrequire rollcall votes, will be voted on tomorrow, with the exception \nof the Bingaman amendment. It has 15 minutes for debate tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I think we agree that we have \nheard adequate explanation previous times about these amendments. The \nSenator is not soliciting more comments, is he?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nevada states my position perfectly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7043-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

However, the majority leader \nsubsequently offered an amendment that will be considered later.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Lott amendment be included in the \noriginal waiver that I raised.\n  Specifically, the new motion is to waive all points of order under \nthe budget process arising from the earned-income credit component in \nthis pending tax--the amendment by Senator Moynihan, the amendment \noffered by Senator Lott, the House companion bill, any amendment \nbetween the Houses, and any conference reports thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n  Does he yield for a quorum call?\n  Mr. REID. Isn't his minute up?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there is no quorum call.\n  I urge the adoption of the chairman's proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman has requested a modification of \nthe motion.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. As modified, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion is so modified.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask that we vitiate the yeas and nays on \nthe motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the substance of the \nmotion, which is now a unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The revisions are so adopted.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is the spirit. Let's get on with it.\n  Mr. ROTH. All right.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the motion of the \nSenator from Wisconsin to commit the bill to the Finance Committee.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate is again considering \nlegislation that will provide, at long last, relief from the marriage \ntax penalty.\n  The marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married \nworking couples. For example, a manufacturing plant worker makes \n$30,500 a year in salary. His wife is a tenured elementary school \nteacher, also bringing home $30,500 a year in salary. If they both file \ntheir taxes as singles they would pay 15 percent in income tax. But if \nthey choose to live their lives in holy matrimony and file jointly, \ntheir combined income of $61,000 pushes them into a higher tax bracket \nof 28%. The result is a tax penalty of approximately $1,400.\n  The Republican marriage penalty relief bill eliminates this \nunfairness without shifting of the tax burden and without increasing \ntaxes on any individual. Middle and low income families would benefit \nas much as earners with higher incomes.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all \nmarried couples--21 million--are affected by the marriage penalty. Over \n640,000 couples in Virginia are affected, according to one study.\n  Most of the tax relief under our plan goes to the middle class. The \nCongressional Joint Committee on Taxation's distribution analysis \nestimates that couples making under $75,000 annually will be the \nbiggest winners. Additionally, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that \ncouples earning between $20,000 and $30,000 will receive the biggest \npercentage reduction in their federal taxes out of any income level, \nwith couples making between $30,000-$40,000 fairing almost as well.\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\n  This money belongs to the taxpayers. With a surplus of over $2 \ntrillion, not including Social Security, all taxpayers are entitled to \na return of their tax overpayment. In addition, the federal government, \nthrough tax policy, should not discourage either parent from staying at \nhome with children. The government should not penalize a family simply \nbecause it takes both spouses working outside of the home to make ends \nmeet. Being a stay at home parent should be rewarded.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will send \nUncle Sam almost $2 trillion in additional surplus taxes over the next \nten years--after Congress has locked up 100% of Social Security surplus \nand paid down the public debt. This proposal gives back to the middle \nclass families just 10 cents out of every surplus dollar they send to \nWashington. As I have said before, the Federal government should not \nput a price tag on the sacrament of marriage.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, are there 2 minutes equally divided for \nthe rest of the evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this motion requires we do first things \nfirst. It says we should pass marriage penalty relief, but it also says \nwe should substantially extend the solvency of Social Security and \nMedicare at the same time. By 2037, the Social Security trust fund will \nhave consumed all of its assets. By 2025, the Medicare HI trust fund \nwill have consumed all of its assets.\n  To fix Social Security and Medicare, we can make small changes now or \nbig changes later. That is why President Clinton was right when he said \n``save Social Security first.'' It would be irresponsible to enact tax \ncuts this size before doing anything about Social Security and \nMedicare. Before the Senate passes tax cuts this size, the Finance \nCommittee should report a plan to extend Social Security and Medicare. \nWe should do first things first. That is what this motion requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Feingold's motion to commit to the \nFinance Committee will not accomplish its stated purpose of Social \nSecurity and Medicare reform. The bill before the Senate is limited \nunder the budget resolution to tax cuts. As chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I can tell you we are actively pursuing a real bipartisan \nMedicare reform package. Our efforts are not a political stunt, like \nthis motion. On Social Security reform, everyone believes that it is a \nworthy goal but not one where there is currently a bipartisan \nconsensus. I urge my colleagues to reject Senator Feingold's motion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw Senator \nBrownback's amendment No. 3849.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nDemocratic alternative, amendment No. 3863, and related amendments and \nmotions be considered next, and that amendment No. 3863 be considered \ngermane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                            Motion To Waive\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Roth motion to \nwaive the Budget Act for the amendments that would strike the sunset \nprovisions in the bill and the Democratic alternative.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Finance Committee complied with the Byrd \nrule by terminating or sunsetting the tax cuts in the bill generally on \nDecember 31, 2004. I note the Finance Committee Democratic alternative \ncontained a similar sunset provision. The case before us that benefits \na simple, broad-based tax policy change that reduces some of the tax \nburden placed on married couples, outweighs the implications of the \nByrd rule.\n  Frankly, I think there are few more compelling cases for waiving the \nByrd rule. Clearly, though, we differ on how to deliver it. Every \nSenator should place an importance on permanent marriage tax relief. I \nurge my colleagues to strike a blow for permanent marriage tax relief \nand support my motion to waive the Byrd rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I regret that I have to disagree with my chairman. The \nByrd rule has proved such an important measure to maintain budgetary \ndiscipline. It has brought about the present happy circumstances; and \nthis is no time, in our view, to move back to earlier practices which \nwere so devastating in their effect during the 1980s.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I will exercise a brief 1 minute to \ndescribe the Democratic alternative, which is now to be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this amendment can be described in one \nsentence. There are not many such, and I would hope the body might hear \nme: We propose that married couples be enabled to file jointly or \nsingly, period, end of subject.\n  There are, sir, 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. This amendment \nabolishes them all. It would not allow the alternative minimum tax to \ntake away the benefits of marriage penalty relief either. Whereas we \nhave before us as a basic amendment that which would only take care of \none marriage penalty and touch two others, here is the opportunity to \nget rid of them all.\n  In our tax system, no matter how large or small, whatever we do, we \nmust see that the American public believes the tax system is fair. If \nthere is a considerable judgment anywhere that something is not fair, \nthen it ought to be corrected. Our amendment will do that, sir.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment is the same one we considered \nin the Finance Committee. Supporters of this amendment claim it is \npreferable because it is more targeted, that it only benefits certain \nmarried families, and that it provides more comprehensive marriage \npenalty relief.\n  I do not shy away from the fact that our bill benefits virtually \nevery American family. I welcome it. The Joint Committee on Taxation \ntells us that our bill will help over 45 million families. They also \ntell us the Democratic alternative will assist only 24 million.\n  Our bill also addresses the marriage penalty without creating a new \npenalty--a so-called homemaker penalty. With our approach, all married \ncouples with the same income will be treated alike. This cannot be said \nof the alternative.\n  Finally, the Democratic alternative includes that income cap. If we \nare serious about addressing the inequity of this tax, we should not \nmake this an issue of rich versus poor. Our bill is fair, it is \ncomprehensive, and it is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to \noppose this Democratic substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate the \nChaplain including him in the opening prayer this morning.

I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, amendment No. 3845. There are \n2 minutes equally divided between each side.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment cuts taxes for 7 of 10 \ntaxpayers who take a standard deduction and ensures that many working \nAmericans would not owe any income taxes at all. It would increase the \nstandard deduction for individuals by $250, and would also increase the \nstandard deduction for heads of households. It would continue to \nincrease the standard deduction for married couples to twice that of an \nindividual. It is paid for by striking the provision in the bill that \nbenefits only taxpayers in the top quarter of the income distribution \nby expanding tax brackets.\n  My amendment better targets the marriage penalty relief and would \nsimplify taxes and free many from paying income taxes altogether. The \ntradeoff is clear. Strike the new benefits for the best off quarter of \ntaxpayers to fund benefits for 7 out of 10 taxpayers.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the increase in \nthe rate brackets of the underlying bill. As my colleagues may know, in \ndollar terms, the greatest source of marriage penalty for American \nfamilies is the rate brackets. Under current law, for instance, the 15 \npercent rate bracket ends for singles at $26,250; it ends for couples \nat $43,850. Our bill has remedied that unfairness by phasing in a \ndoubling of the married couples' rate bracket so that it ends at twice \nthe ending point of the single's bracket.\n  While I agree that a further increase in the standard deduction is a \ngood idea, I do not believe we should do it at the expense of the \nincrease in the rate brackets. Accordingly, I must oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3845.

The vital program known as COBRA helps ensure that \npeople who lose their jobs do not lose their health insurance at the \nsame time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, can we have order in the Senate so we can \nhear what the Senator is saying?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \nplease take their conferences off the floor.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The vital program known as COBRA helps ensure that \npeople who lose their jobs do not lose their health insurance at the \nsame time. My amendment would expand access to affordable health \ninsurance through COBRA in two ways. First, it would expand COBRA to \ncover retirees whose employer-sponsored coverage is terminated.\n  Employers who promise retiree coverage and then drop it will have to \nallow early retirees to have COBRA-continued coverage until they \nqualify for Medicare.\n  Second, it would create a 25-percent tax credit for COBRA premiums \ngenerally. This credit will improve access to and affordability of \nhealth insurance for this very vulnerable group. The amendment pays for \nthis health coverage by eliminating an inequitable tax loophole: the \npercentage depletion allowance for hard rock minerals mined on Federal \npublic lands.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield such time as the Senator from Nevada may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment would be devastating to one \nof the finest industries in America today: hard rock mining. It is a \nnet exporter of gold especially. Tens of thousands of jobs will be \nwiped out. These are the highest paid blue-collar jobs in America.\n  This amendment is bad. We should do everything we can to defeat it. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I move that the pending amendment is not \ngermane and raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator has \n1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if we are for equal pay for women and men \nwho do the same work, then this is the amendment to do it--the Paycheck \nFairness Act, which was introduced under Senator Daschle's leadership. \nIt provides stronger remedies in wage discrimination cases and provides \nresources to educate employers on wage discrimination. It ensures that \nwomen cannot be retaliated against for sharing their pay information \nwith fellow employees.\n  It is time to stop giving America's women lipservice for equal pay \nfor equal work, but to actually do something to make it happen. That is \nwhat this amendment does. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we discuss the tax code and the issue \nof fairness for families, Senator Harkin has offered an important \namendment to address an issue of fairness faced by millions of working \nwomen and their families. Senator Harkin and I have worked hard to \ncraft legislation that addresses the wage gap between men and women in \nthis country. This amendment is modeled after my bill, S. 74, the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. In an era characterized by economic opportunity, \nit is time for the Senate to consider how America's prosperity can be \nbroadly and fairly shared.\n  While much has changed over the past 35 years, one thing has remained \nthe same: the wage gap between men and women. When President Kennedy \nsigned the Equal Pay Act in 1963, a woman earned only 59 cents for \nevery dollar earned by a man. This landmark bill reduced the pay gap \nand helped women make great strides to narrow the pay gap. Nonetheless, \n35 years later, women, on average, continue to earn only 73 cents for \nevery dollar earned by a man. This disparity is patently unfair. The \ntime has come to improve and strengthen President Kennedy's landmark \nlaw.\n  Some have suggested that the pay gap is insignificant, but working \nwomen know better. Even after accounting for differences in education \nand the amount of time in the workforce, a woman's pay still lags far \nbehind the pay of a man doing the same work. This persistent wage gap \ndoesn't shortchange just women. It shortchanges families. The wage gap \ncauses the average American working family to lose more than $4000 a \nyear. In fact, it is women's salaries that often bring children and \nfamilies out of poverty. And families suffer more in South Dakota than \nin most states because we have the highest percentage in the nation of \nworking mothers with children under the age of 6. These mothers deserve \nequal pay for equal work.\n  To address this serious problem, the Paycheck Fairness Act uses a \nsimple approach: we believe that the pay gap will decrease if women and \nmen have more information about it; we believe the pay gap will \ndecrease if we enable women to pursue meaningful suits against \nemployers that have discriminatory practices; and we believe that the \npay gap will decrease if employers are educated and rewarded for doing \ntheir part to end wage discrimination.\n  My bill is a modest but needed step in the fight against wage \ndiscrimination. The simple fact remains--working families face the \nproblem of wage discrimination every day and lose billions of dollars \nin wages because of it. Instead of the risky tax scheme the Senate is \nconsidering today, we should give women and American families a much \nneeded raise. We should pass the Harkin amendment today and continue to \nwork towards the day when the pay gap is eliminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment that my colleague from \nIowa has offered amends the Fair Labor Standards Act but it has never \nhad a hearing before the Labor Committee. It has never been marked up \nby the Labor Committee. It is legislation that would make the trial \nlawyers very happy because it authorizes unlimited punitive and \ncompensatory damages for discrimination cases brought under the Equal \nPay Act. In fact, it would authorize remedies not available in any \ntitle VII discrimination case or Americans with Disabilities Act case \nbecause damages under those statutes are capped. It would also make it \neasier for trial lawyers to create class action lawsuits. It is bad \nlegislation and it does not belong on this bill. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the point of order and reject the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Iowa is not germane to the underlying bill and would, \ntherefore, result in a section 305(b)(2) point of order under the \nBudget Act. I, therefore, raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We can do better and save \na lot of time if we can vote within the 10-minute period.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3848\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Kennedy amendment No. \n3848.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are talking about relief from the so-\ncalled marriage penalty in the Tax Code. But low-income married parents \nface a more serious marriage penalty under Medicaid. Under the current \nlaw, parents who are married lose their health coverage under Medicaid \nin some 14 States. In other States, they lose their health coverage \nunder Medicaid if they work more than 100 hours a month. That is wrong.\n  Our answer to this problem is to provide States with the resources \nand authority to expand S-CHIP and Medicaid to the parents of the \nchildren who are covered under these programs. It is a sensible system. \nThe President has paid for it in his budget. It provides needed relief \nfrom the health marriage and work penalty under Medicaid. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the FamilyCare initiative prematurely \ndoubles the size and scope of the new State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. S-CHIP has been enrolling children for less than 3 years--and \nit has not reached its goals in terms of covering eligible children. \nLet us make sure the S-CHIP model works before we expand it so \ndramatically.\n  In fact, Mr. President, it is worth noting that if the states want to \nextend coverage to parents, they may do so now under Medicaid waivers, \nor even under S-CHIP, if that coverage is ``cost-effective''.\n  In addition to program concerns, FamilyCare raises a fundamental \nquestion. Should parenthood be the driving factor in terms of \neligibility for health insurance coverage? FamilyCare rewards \nparenthood and disadvantages working poor individuals who decide to \npostpone having families until they are better able to afford to raise \na child.\n  Finally, this new initiative is extremely costly. We are talking \nabout creating a new program with a cost of $50 billion over ten \nyears--all without holding hearings on the bill and without any \ndiscussion of priorities.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Kennedy amendment is \nneither germane nor relevant to the reconciliation bill, it is in \nviolation of 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the Bond \nsecond-degree amendment to the Durbin amendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is not fair that a self-employed person \ncannot deduct 100 percent of health care costs when a large business \ncan. A self-employed person is denied that deductibility, even though \nwe have worked since 1995 when this body accepted my amendment at that \ntime to increase the deductibility of insurance costs for the self-\nemployed. Still, only 60 percent of the health insurance cost is \ndeductible by the self-employed.\n  I have talked to a lot of these people. They cannot wait until 2003 \nwhen they will get 100-percent deductibility. My amendment says there \nis 100-percent deductibility this year and makes sure that the 5 \nmillion Americans in households headed by self-employed can get health \ncare coverage, including 1.3 million children.\n  It also corrects a disparity in current law which says if a self-\nemployed person is eligible for health coverage from another plan, a \nsecond job, or a spouse's plan, they cannot deduct. This says you can \ndeduct so long as you do not participate in another health care plan.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides and my colleague from Illinois.\n  I urge this body to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Missouri has taken a very good amendment \nand made it even better. I hope Members will join in supporting the \nsecond-degree amendment by Senator Bond to my amendment, for the full \ndeductibility of the health insurance premiums for the self-employed. I \nhope you will resist efforts, if we are successful, to remove this \namendment at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3852\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have another amendment at the desk, which if I am not \nmistaken, is next in order on the list for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment 3852.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are 44 million Americans without \nhealth insurance. Among uninsured workers, most of them work for small \nbusinesses. This amendment creates a tax credit for small businesses \nwhich will offer health insurance for their employees. The tax credits \nespecially favor those businesses which have not offered it in the \npast. I think it is a good investment to help small businesses take \ncare of their No. 1 concern: health insurance for the owners of the \nbusiness, health insurance for the employees of the small business.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I look at my colleague's amendment, and \nhe says for health care we will make it a tax credit. That means it is \nmore valuable than wages; that means it is more valuable than any other \nexpenditure for an employer.\n  We passed several tax provisions to encourage employers and \nindividuals to buy health care. We passed that with the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. We passed it with minimum wage. The amendment of my \ncolleague from Illinois, in my opinion, is misdirected and very \nexpensive. We have not had a hearing in the Finance Committee. I think \nit happens to be bad policy. It says for this type of expenditure, it \nis more important than any other that an employer would make.\n  I make a budget point of order under section 305 that it is in \nviolation of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for consideration of the pending bill, and I seek \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire).

Mr. President, recognizing this is the last rollcall vote \nof the evening, I will not take the time of this Chamber. It is a very \nsimple amendment. A majority of this body has already gone on record \nsaying that we will make certain we pass a prescription drug benefit \nfor seniors before we pass all of these other tax cuts. We passed a \nmajor tax cut on Friday. We are proposing to pass tomorrow morning \nanother major tax cut.\n  All this amendment says is, before these tax cuts go into effect, we \nwill have actually delivered on the promise to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  I hope it will be the pleasure of this Senate to adopt this amendment \nand keep the faith with our seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is an amendment that undermines, not \nadvances, progress on two important issues. Its only effect will be to \nstop tax cuts for families while not advancing by a day Medicare reform \nthat should include a prescription drug benefit. If anything, it slows \ndown Medicare reform by politicizing the issue.\n  Prescription drugs should not be pitted against family tax cuts. We \ncan and should be for both. The budget surplus allows for both. The \nbudget passed by Congress allows for both and both are necessary \npolicies, but they must first each be correctly thought through.\n  Now is the time to pass marriage tax relief, an issue on which we \nhave been working for years. Now is the time to be working together on \nMedicare reform, as we are in the Finance Committee. Working together \nwe can succeed on both policies. Seeking division we will fail on each. \nNotwithstanding any policy objections, the pending amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Virginia is not germane to the underlying bill and \nwould, therefore, result in a section 305(b)(2) point of order under \nthe Budget Act. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the \namendment pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, The Cleland Savings Bond Tax-Exclusion \nfor Long-Term Care Services Amendment would exclude United States \nsavings bond income from being taxed if used to pay for long-term \nhealth care expenses. Current law provides an income exclusion for \nsavings bond income used to pay for qualified higher education \nexpenses. This amendment expands the tax code section 135 to allow the \nsavings bond income exclusion for eligible long-term care expenses as \nwell. This measure will assist individuals struggling to accommodate \ncosts associated with many chronic medical conditions and the aging \nprocess. A staggering 5.8 million Americans are afflicted with the \nfinancial burdens of long-term care.\n  This legislation will assist families by:\n  Providing a tax exclusion for savings bonds used to pay for long-term \ncare;\n  Allowing families to use their savings bond assets to face the dual \nchallenge of paying for long-term care services and higher education \nexpenses.\n  Thank you and I urge you to support this proposal to provide tax \nrelief to Americans burdened by the financial constraints of providing \nlong-term care and higher education expenses. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3860\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, we have on the books today a special \nenhanced tax deduction for individuals and corporations which donate \ncomputers to our nation's elementary and secondary schools. This \ndeduction--which helps to keep America on the cutting-edge in \ntechnology--is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. The \namendment I am offering is twofold: it would extend this tax deduction \nfor five years and it would expand it to include computer donations to \npublic libraries and non-profit and governmental community centers as \nwell.\n  My amendment will help to close the ``digital divide'' which exists \nin this\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\ncountry by providing a viable alternative for Americans who are being \nleft behind because they do not have access in their homes to computer \nand Internet use. We know, for example, that Americans earning less \nthan $20,000 who use the Internet outside the home are twice as likely \nto get their access through a public library or community center. And \nAmericans who are not in the labor force, such as retirees or \nhomemakers, are twice as likely to use public libraries for on-line \naccess.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It would extend a tax \ndeduction which has proved invaluable in boosting efforts by \nindividuals and companies to donate computer equipment and web access \nto our Nation's schools. And it will help to keep this Nation a leader \nin the global economy by helping to close the gap between the \ntechnological haves and the have nots.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3856, 3857, 3861, 3862, 3866, 3867, 3876, 3879, 3880, \n                           and 3882 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJohnson be added as a cosponsor of the Moynihan amendment No. 3863.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \nreconciliation bill before us containing marriage penalty tax relief.\n  This is an issue about fairness, Mr. President for around thirty \nyears our Tax Code has been penalizing people just becuase they happen \nto be married. This is a perfect example of how broken our Tax Code is. \nJust like the earnings limitation that discriminated against older \nAmericans, this unfiar Tax needs to be dumped. It took a Republican-led \nCongress to repeal the Social Security earnings limit.\n  And now, it's the same Republican-led Congress that's talking the \nlead in repealing the marriage penalty tax. We tried it a couple of \nmonths ago, but we were blocked by the Democratic side from passing the \nbill. Now, we're back under reconciliation instructions that prevent \nthe other side from gridlocking the Senate.\n  Of course, the minority side wants you to believe they're all for \ngetting rid of the marriage penalty tax. Of course, they had control of \nthe Congress for decades and never once tried to repeal it.\n  What's worse, now they're using the old bait-and-switch routine. They \nsay they're for this tax relief, but not until Social Security and \nMedicare are fixed.\n  We all know neither the administration nor the Democratic side have \ncomprehensive proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare, so this is \njust a delyaing tactic to kill the bill so, they say they're for \nmarriage penalty relief--but only sometime in the unknown future. \nThat's Washington D.C. double-talk.\n  Delaying this tax relief really means no tax relief at all.\n  Mr. President, we've heard other misleading arguments that under the \nmajority bill, married couples would get a tax cut, but single mothers \nwith kids would not get one. However, an important part of our bill \nrepeals the alternative minimum tax for over then million people. Many \nof those helped will be single mothers. But, guess what's even more \ninteresting? The Democrat alternative bill is the bill that doesn't \nhelp single mothers at all.\n  In addition, it's important to note that the Democrat alternative \ndiscriminates against stay-at-home moms. That's right, the Democrat \nproposal only helps two earner couples. So, it not only doesn't helpt \nthose single mothers the other side was crying crocodile tears over--it \nhurts those families where one partent decides to stay at home with the \nchildren.\n  I hope all of you stay-at-home parents out there listening understand \nwhat the Democratic alternative will do to them.\n  Mr. President, we're going to pass this tax relief measure anad send \nit to President Clinton.\n  This begs the question--where is the Clinton-Gore administration on \nproviding this tax reljief to working Americans? Well, a few weeks ago, \nthe administration offered to accept mariiage penalty tax relief for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. This is the same tax relief bill \nthe Clinton-Gore administration and Democrats have been attacking and \nderiding for months. Now, they're saying, forget all those bad things \nwe said, we're ready to deal.\n  This just shows the Clinton-Gore administration either doesn't have \nany principles, or they're willing to trade them to the highest bidder.\n  Of course, for years this administration has been saying they would \nwork with Congress to save social security and medicare. But, here we \nare near the end of this administration, and it has no comprehensive \nplan to save either program. They're reduced to trying to salvage a \nlegacy by creating a hugely expensive entitlement program that could \nend up draining the hard-earned surplus. This is a surplus earned bythe \nAmerican people, not the Government, who wants to spend it all. \nInterestingly, a recent polly said that 60 percent of Americans credit \nAmerican workers and businesse for our successful economy. Only 39 \npercent credit the administration, who would like you to believe they \ndid it all.\n  I think the American people are finally figuring out the Clinton-Gore \ncharade.\n  We're going to see more and more of these con-games as sthe Year \nwinds down, and this tired, worn-out administration desperately tries \nto reshape its disappointing place in history.\n  Mr. President, the time for delay is over. The time for gridlock is \nover. Now is the time to pass this important tax relief measure, and I \nurge the members of this body to come together and do what's right, by \npassing this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4810--\nlegislation that would dramatically reduce one of the most insidious \naspects of the tax code: the marriage penalty.\n  As my colleagues are aware, there are several primary causes of the \n``marriage penalty'' within the tax code, including different tax rate \nschedules and different standard deductions for joint filers versus \nsingle filers.\n  In terms of the impact of these differing tax provisions, the \nmarriage penalty is most pronounced for two-earner couples in which the \nhusband and wife have nearly equal incomes. While this may not have \nbeen as noticeable in society 30 or 40 years ago, the demographic \nchanges that have occurred since the 1960s--with more married women \nentering the workforce to help support their families--has led to a \nsignificant increase in the share of couples who suffer from the \nmarriage penalty.\n  Make no mistake, the impact of the marriage penalty is severe. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42% of married \ncouples incur marriage penalties that average nearly $1,400.\n  When measured by income category, fully 12% of couples with incomes \nbelow $20,000 incurred a marriage penalty in 1996; 44% of couples with \nincomes of $20,000 to $50,000; and 55% of couples with incomes above \n$50,000.\n  In addition, according to CBO, empirical evidence suggests that the \nmarriage penalty may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's \nsecond earner. Specifically, because filing a joint return often \nimposes a substantially higher tax rate on a couple's second earner, \nthe higher rate reduces the second earner's after-tax wage and may \ncause that individual to work fewer hours or not at all. As a result, \neconomic efficiency is harmed in the overall economy.\n  Furthermore, while I would hope that the tax code would not be a \nfactor in a couple's decision to marry or stay single, the simple fact \nis that a couple's tax status could worsen if married and could, \ntherefore, impact a couple's decision to marry. Therefore, we should \neliminate this potential barrier to marriage and ensure that couples \nmake one of life's biggest decisions based on their values and \nbeliefs--not on the federal tax code.\n  As a strong opponent of the marriage penalty, I am an original \ncosponsor of S. 15, legislation introduced by Senator\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nHutchison that eliminates the marriage penalty through a proposal known \nas ``income splitting.'' Under this approach, a married couple would \nadd up all their income and then split it in half. Each spouse would \nthen file as a single individual and pay taxes on his or her half of \nthe total income, with exemptions, deductions and credits being split \nevenly between the two spouses.\n  Last year, to advance this legislation or any other proposal that \nwould provide marriage penalty relief, I offered an amendment during \nthe markup of the FY 2000 budget resolution that ensured a significant \nreduction in--or the outright elimination of--the marriage penalty \nwould be a central component of any tax cut package adopted during last \nyear's reconciliation process.\n  Later that summer, in accordance with my budget amendment, the $792 \nbillion tax cut reconciliation package that was passed by the Senate \nincluded such relief, as did the final House-Senate conference report. \nHowever, just as President Clinton vetoed the tax bill in 1995 that \nincluded marriage penalty relief, last year's tax bill was vetoed as \nwell.\n\n  In an effort to address this issue outside a broader tax package, the \nHouse of Representatives passed legislation earlier this year--by a \nbipartisan vote of 268 to 158--that would reduce the marriage penalty. \nThe Senate considered its version of the legislation in April, but a \nDemocratic filibuster prevented us from bringing the bill to a final \nvote. Today, we are considering nearly identical legislation yet again, \nbut--thanks to the budget reconciliation process--we are assured it \nwill come to a final vote.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 4810 would dramatically reduce the marriage \npenalty by doubling the standard deduction for married couples relative \nto single filers; expanding the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax \nbrackets for married couples to twice the size of the corresponding tax \nbrackets for single filers; increasing the phase-out range of the \nEarned Income Credit for couples filing joint returns; and permanently \nexempting family tax credits from the individual Alternative Minimum \nTax.\n  I am especially pleased that the legislation does not penalize \nfamilies in which a spouse foregoes an income to raise children. \nUnfortunately, the proposal that is being espoused by the minority \nwould do just that.\n  Specifically, by allowing married couples to file their taxes as if \nthey were single, the substitute proposal would provide relief only to \nfamilies in which both spouses have taxable incomes. As a result, if a \nspouse has no earned income by virtue of the fact that he or she is \nworking at home to raise the family's children--but doesn't actually \nearn a salary for each of the myriad of tasks this profession entails--\nthe couple would receive none of the benefits of the larger tax \nbrackets or standard deduction that a single taxpayer currently \nreceives because only one-half of the couple has an income to report.\n  I believe a spouse's decision to work outside the home and utilize \ndaycare, or work at home to raise children, should be made with only \nthe best interests of the family in mind--not the tax code. We should \nnot take a significant step to eliminate the marriage penalty only to \nreplace it with a ``homemaker penalty''--and I'm pleased that H.R. 4810 \nensures that the benefits it provides can be used by all couples, \nincluding those in which a spouse foregoes an income to raise a family.\n  It is my hope that, by considering this package of marriage penalty \nrelief proposals as a stand-alone bill--and not as part of a broader, \nand potentially controversial, tax cut package--we will not only pass \nthis legislation with strong bipartisan support, but ultimately send a \nbill to the President that he will sign for the benefit of all married \ncouples.\n  The bottom line is that we should not condone or accept a tax code \nthat penalizes married couples or discourages marriage, and this bill \nprovides the Senate with the opportunity to correct this inequity in a \nstraightforward manner.\n  Ultimately, the bill we are considering is not simply about providing \nthe American people with a reasonable and rational tax cut--rather, it \nis about correcting a gross discrepancy in the tax code that unfairly \nimpacts married couples. Accordingly, even though individual members of \nthis body disagree on a wide variety of tax cuts policies, I would hope \nwe would all agree that the act of marriage should not be penalized by \nthe Internal Revenue Code--and would support S. 4810 accordingly.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor this pro-family, pro-economic growth legislation. It is unfortunate \nthat government continues to burden its citizens with excessive and \nunfair taxation. Indeed, America's income tax system reduces freedom \nand economic growth. An embarrassing example of this inequity is the \nmarriage penalty--essentially, a quirk in the income tax code that \ncauses some married couples to be penalized and taxed at higher rates, \nsimply because they marry.\n  The treatment of marriage provides an important example of why we \nneed to support equity in the tax code. Consider that two couples who \nare exactly the same--except one is married and the other couple is \nnot. A peculiar feature in our tax code is that these two couples may \npay different taxes. Simply put, when a man and woman get married, \ntheir tax liability can rise and the federal government can take more \nof the married couple's money. This is a fundamental problem in the tax \ncode. I believe in fairness and simplicity when it comes to taxes. A \nmarried couple should not pay more taxes than an unmarried couple with \nthe same total income. This is poor policy.\n  Marriage neutrality is the principle that when two people get \nmarried, their total bill should not change. Unfortunately, the U.S. \nincome tax is not marriage neutral. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, almost half of all married couples--22 million--suffered \nfrom the marriage penalty last year. In my home state of Idaho, 129,710 \ncouples were adversely affected because of this system. These married \ncouples on average paid an extra $1,500 in income tax. Moreover, as \nwomen are working hard to achieve salary equity, it is unfortunate that \nas women approach income levels similar to their husbands, the marriage \npenalty increasingly kicks in and the federal government simply takes \ntheir money back.\n  Under this bill, beginning next year, Congress will restore marriage \nneutrality to the code. The Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation \nAct will increase the standard deduction for married couples to \napproximately $8,800. This is twice the basic standard deduction for a \nsingle tax filer. The bill will also widen the 15 percent and 28 \npercent income tax brackets for married couples filing a joint return \nto twice the size of the corresponding rate brackets of single \nindividuals. This is a commonsense solution to ending any disparity for \nmarried couples who find they are paying a penalty. Fortunately for \nthem, the rules under which we are debating the Marriage Tax Penalty \nRelief Reconciliation Act will also shield senators from excess delay \nand we will have an up-or-down vote. True to the bill's name, we are \nhere to reconcile an unfair tax provision that is counterproductive to \nour goal of equity and fairness.\n  Today, we have finally put an end to expensive entitlements and the \nreckless fiscal behavior that created large deficits in the 1970s, \n1980s, and early 1990s. Indeed, the surging U.S. economy has produced \nan unprecedented tidal wave of federal tax receipts. This year, the \ncountry will see a $76 billion dollar surplus--over the next ten years \nthe non-social security surplus is estimated at $1.9 trillion. This \nraises the question: when will the government start returning money to \nthe people? With these surpluses there is no doubt that there is room \nfor marriage tax relief and additional debt reduction. Therefore, we \nshould seize this opportunity to return these surplus dollars, before \nthe bureaucrats in town start spending them. If we do not, an \nopportunity to restore horizontal equity to the tax code will be lost, \nbecause surpluses--like we have today--will certainly invite an \nirresponsible flurry of new spending.\n  Americans have historically and consistently expressed their \ndiscontent for excessive and unfair taxation. I have stacks of letters \nin my office from honest and hard-working Idahoans who rightfully want \nto know where their\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\ntax cut is. Let us take this opportunity to return something to those \nAmerican families who are married and working to support families and \nloved ones. Let us make good on our constituent promise by voting to \neliminate the marriage tax penalty and let us give the President an \nopportunity to honor his State of the Union promise by signing this \nbill.\n  The federal tax code remains intrusive, overly complicated, and \nexcessively burdensome. As part of my effort to bring tax relief to the \nAmerican people, I have co-sponsored or voted for legislation to reduce \nthe death tax, gas tax, beer tax, and telephone excise tax. Today, we \nhave an opportunity to vote for a bill that I hope will have broad \nbipartisan support. Senators should be mindful of the opportunity to \nprovide needed relief to married couples. Death and taxes are \ncertainties in life. Let us vote to ensure that fairness is too. I urge \nmy colleagues to support repeal of the marriage tax penalty. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it was about two-and-a-half years ago that I \ncame to the Senate floor to call on the Senate to repeal two of the \nmost egregious and unfair taxes imposed by the nation's Tax Code: the \nsteep taxes imposed on people when they get married and when they die. \nThe good news is, for the second time in two years, the Senate has \ncleared legislation to repeal the death tax. And this week, for the \nthird time, we will clear a measure to repeal the marriage penalty.\n  In 1995, Congress passed legislation that would have provided a tax \ncredit to married couples to offset this penalty somewhat. President \nClinton vetoed that bill.\n  In 1999, Congress again approved a measure to provide married couples \nwith some relief. Last year's bill would have set the standard \ndeduction for couples at twice the deduction allowed for singles. It \nwould also have set the lowest income-tax bracket for married couples \nat twice that allowed for single taxpayers. President Clinton vetoed \nthat measure last September.\n  According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden \nborne by American taxpayers dipped slightly in 1998. That is the good \nnews. The bad news is that Americans still spent more on federal taxes \nthan on any of the other major items in their household budgets. For \nthe median-income, two-earner family, federal taxes still amounted to \n39 percent of the family budget--more than what they spent on food, \nhousing, and medical care combined. One of the reasons why they paid so \nmuch is the continuation of the marriage penalty that exists in the \nNation's tax code.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly half of all \nmarried taxpayers--about 21 million couples--filing a joint return paid \na higher tax than they would have if each spouse had been allowed to \nfile as a single taxpayer.\n  The marriage penalty hits the working poor particularly hard. Two-\nearner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight \npercent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. Eight percent is \nan extraordinary amount for couples that count on every dollar to make \nends meet.\n  Let me stop here and give an example of the marriage penalty at work. \nIn this example, the penalty comes about because workers filing as \nsingle taxpayers get a higher standard deduction, and because income-\ntax bracket thresholds for married couples are lower than the threshold \nfor singles. Consider a married couple in which each spouse earns about \n$30,000 a year. They would have paid $7,655 in federal income taxes \nlast year. By comparison, two individuals earning the same amount, but \nfiling single returns, would have paid only $6,892 between the two of \nthem. That is a marriage penalty of $763.\n  The average penalty--average penalty--paid by couples is even higher \nthan that--about $1,400 a year, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Think what families could do with an extra $1,400. They could \npay for three or four months of day care if they choose to send a child \noutside the home--or make it easier for one parent to stay at home to \ntake care of the children, if that is what they decide is best for \nthem. They could make four or five payments on their car or minivan. \nThey could pay their utility bill for nine months.\n  The bill before us is the most comprehensive effort yet to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty. It would expand the standard deduction for \nmarried couples filing jointly; widen the tax brackets for such \ncouples; and increase the income phase-outs for the earned income \ncredit.\n  Unlike President Clinton's so-called relief bill, the plan Chairman \nRoth brings to us today does not neglect married couples who choose to \nhave one parent stay at home to raise the children. It gives them \nrelief, and, in so doing, it lets them know we value the choice they \nhave made to stay home and raise a family.\n  Unlike the Clinton plan, which would preserve the penalty for many \ncouples, our plan would eliminate the marriage penalty in its entirety. \nSure, that means the revenue loss associated with this legislation is \ngreater than the President proposed, but the smaller cost of providing \nrelief under the Clinton plan is also indicative of just how little it \nwould do to solve the problem. We should not be stingy when attempting \nto ensure fairness in the tax code.\n  Passage of this legislation would continue the good progress we have \nmade this year in making the tax code fairer. First, we passed the \nmeasure to repeal the Social Security earnings limitation, a tax that \nhas unfairly penalized seniors for more than 60 years, simply because \nthey wanted to earn some extra income to supplement their monthly \nretirement checks. That measure is now law.\n  Last week, we voted to eliminate the death tax, which unfairly taxes \npeople simply because they die. We voted to substitute a capital-gains \ntax so that inherited assets are taxed at the appropriate time--when \nthey are sold, and when income is actually realized.\n  Hopefully, the marriage-penalty repeal bill, like the death-tax \nrepeal, will pass with a strong, bipartisan majority, and President \nClinton will rethink his opposition and sign it when it reaches his \ndesk.\n  We can debate the merits of any number of changes in the tax code: \nwhether a flat tax is preferable to a sales tax; whether tax rates \nshould be reduced across the board; or whether we should make the tax \ncode more conducive to savings and investment. There are legitimate \npoints to be made on both sides.\n  But when it comes to fairness, we need to do what is right. The \nmarriage penalty, like the earnings limit and the death tax, is wrong, \nit is unfair, and it is time to put it to rest. I urge support for the \nmarriage-penalty repeal bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider legislation \nto address the anomaly in the tax code known as the marriage penalty. \nThe Senate will consider this legislation in light of recent budget \nprojections that show a windfall in federal budget surpluses over the \nnext ten years, and under expedited rules that will almost guarantee \npassage of some form of marriage penalty relief.\n  First, I am, as are many other Senators, concerned about the so-\ncalled marriage penalty. I can think of no reason why a married couple \nshould have a higher tax liability simply because they have chosen to \nmake a lifelong commitment together through the sacred bond of \nmarriage. I doubt that any Senator would refute the assertion that the \npromotion of marriage and family stability benefits the nation at \nlarge. Indeed, the marriage bond as recognized in the Judaeo-Christian \ntradition, as well as in the legal codes of the world's most advanced \nsocieties, is a cornerstone on which societies build their morals and \nvalues. The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 7 to ``. . . let every man \nhave his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. Let the \nhusband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the \nwife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the \nhusband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, \nbut the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent \nfor a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come \ntogether again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.'' The \ninstitution of marriage was prized in the Bible, and likewise, by the \nancient world in Rome, and more particularly, in Greece. ``There is \nnothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\neye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and \ndelighting their friends,'' wrote Homer in The Odyssey (9th Century \nBC).\n  Our federal government has no official policy on marriage with \nrespect to taxing or subsidizing the institution. Still, what can only \nbe referred to as a quirk in the tax code causes some married couples \nto pay higher taxes than they would if they were single. I have always \nbelieved that the federal income tax code should, at the very least, be \nmarriage neutral. Unfortunately, marriage neutrality has proven to be \nan elusive goal. The reason is that marriage neutrality is incompatible \nwith a progressive tax system that allows for joint tax returns. When \ntwo single taxpayers are married, their incomes increase and can, in \nsome cases, push the couple into a higher tax bracket than when they \nfiled as separate singles. The opposite can also happen, where married \ncouples find themselves in a lower tax bracket than when they were \nsingle.\n  Both the Republican and Democratic proposals before the Senate today \nattempt to balance the competing interests of progressive taxation, \njoint tax returns, and marriage neutrality in the best way possible. \nThe Republican proposal, for example, reduces the marginal tax rates \nfor married couples so that recently married couples would not be \nbumped up into a higher tax bracket. This would effectively eliminate \nthe marriage penalty relating to marginal tax rates. The trade-off is \nthat marriage bonuses, which occur when a married couple pay less in \ntaxes than they would if they filed as two single taxpayers, would be \nincreased.\n  While some Senators would argue that the Republican proposal is a tax \ngiveaway to households that already receive favorable tax treatment \nbecause of marriage, marriage bonuses provide increased assistance for \nfamilies who make the difficult choice to forgo a second income or \ncareer and for one parent to stay at home with their children. Families \nin this situation ought to be extended tax incentives just the same as \nthose families with a limited income and a child in the child care \nsystem. Raising children to be responsible, caring, law-abiding adults \nis one of the most important tasks that any of us will ever undertake. \nAs we can see daily from the steady stream of frightening newspaper \nheadlines on schoolyard shootings and gang activities, it is also one \nof the hardest. The fabric of our society, the warp of family closeness \nand the woof of community, is torn and frayed. If a family makes the \nincreasingly difficult choice to allow one parent to stay at home and \nfocus on child rearing, then, frankly, I think we ought to make it \neasier for them to do so. We certainly should not make it harder, or \nmore financially punitive! It is too important for the continued \nstrength of our society. I am pleased that this bill takes this \nimportant step of recognizing the role of the stay-at-home parent by \nproviding these families with a small amount of relief to assist with \nthe costs of raising a child.\n\n  The Democratic proposal also attempts to balance the goals of joint \ntax entities and progressive taxation with marriage neutrality. This \nproposal would allow married couples to calculate their income tax as \neither a married couple or as two singles, depending on which method \nwould be less costly. The effect of this approach would be the \nelimination for eligible couples of all sixty-five marriage penalty \nprovisions in the tax code, while maintaining the existing marriage \nbonuses.\n  Both proposals provide marriage penalty relief to families of all \nincome levels. In the Republican proposal, lower-income families who \nreceive the earned income tax credit would benefit from marriage \npenalty relief, while the elimination of the marriage penalty caused by \nthe standard deduction would benefit middle-income households. The \nDemocratic proposal, however, is more targeted to lower- and middle-\nincome households because the marriage penalty relief is phased out for \ncouples with an income above $150,000 per year.\n  But, make no mistake, both proposals, even in the glow of recent \nsurplus projections, would be extremely expensive. The Republican \nproposal would cost $248 billion over ten years, and $39 billion per \nyear thereafter. The Democratic proposal is slightly less expensive \nbecause of the income cap, but would still cost $54.2 billion over five \nyears. My concern is not so much the cost of these proposals, because I \nthink that the cost would be justified by the marriage incentives \nprovided in each, but that marriage penalty relief could open the \nfloodgates to other, more massive tax cuts. Most Senators are aware \nthat the Office of Management and Budget announced during the week of \nJune 26 that projected budget surpluses would exceed estimates made \njust four months ago by $1.3 trillion, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice is close to releasing its projections that are likely to predict \nsimilar results. These new projections raise the estimate of surpluses \nthat will be collected by the government over the next ten years \n(excluding Social Security) to $1.9 trillion, and, consequently, have \nfanned the furor for massive tax cuts.\n  These surplus projections can have an intoxicating effect, so much so \nthat massive tax cuts seem suddenly affordable. What is forgotten is \nthe fact that these surplus projections are highly volatile, and \nsubject to dramatic change. Just since last year, these ten-year \nsurplus projections have increased by almost $2 trillion. Some of that \nincrease stemmed from an increase in tax revenues from the strong \neconomy, but most resulted from simple changes in expectations about \nhow well the economy would perform five and ten years out into the \nfuture. These expectations could easily change in the next few years so \nthat, just as quickly as these surpluses appeared, they could \ndisappear.\n  I think that it is unfortunate that higher-than-expected surpluses \nhave paved the way for the enactment of massive tax cuts. The repeal of \nthe estate tax, for example, which was recently passed by this body, if \nenacted into law, would cost $105 billion over ten years, and then $50 \nbillion per year thereafter. No hearings were held on this proposal in \nthe Senate. Little consideration was given to an alternative plan that \nwould have been less costly and would have more expeditiously addressed \nthe plight of farmers and small businesses by eliminating most from \nestate tax rolls. Little, if any, consideration was given to the \nnegative effect that repealing the estate tax would have on charitable \ncontributions, which are deductible from the gross value of an estate \nunder current law. Yet, this body repealed the estate tax under the \nguise that it was necessary to protect small family farmers and \nbusinesses, when much less costly proposals might have done the job \njust as well.\n  Let us disabuse ourselves of the idea that all tax cuts are good \npolicy because they are politically popular. They are not. It is easy \nto vote for tax cuts. It does not require courage. And, in the end, the \nAmerican people will not thank us for acting in a fiscally \nirresponsible manner. As I have said on many occasions, while budget \nprojections look rosy now, the future is fraught with peril as the \nbaby-boomers exit the economy, and the Social Security and Medicare \nprograms become unable, as presently structured, to pay full benefits \nto recipients. The Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees \nprojected last March that Social Security payroll taxes by themselves \nwould not be enough to cover benefit payments by 2015, and that the \nSocial Security trust fund would be insolvent by 2037. Likewise, the \ntrustees projected that the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund \nwould be insolvent by 2025.\n  While I support eliminating any marriage penalties that may exist in \nthe tax code, my preference would be to delay enactment of these costly \nproposals until the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare \nhave been addressed. However, in order to meet the political deadline \nof the upcoming Party conventions, the Senate is acting on this \nlegislation today, which is unfortunate.\n  I support marriage penalty relief, and I believe that both the \nRepublican and Democratic proposals would provide substantial relief. \nHowever, I object to the fashion in which these proposals are being \nconsidered. As I said before, these proposals are extremely expensive. \nThey should be debated in a way that would allow for many amendments \nand ample debate time. Unfortunately, they were brought up under\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\nreconciliation protections to avoid such restrictions. While the intent \nof the legislation may be worthwhile, I object to legislation being \npushed through in this manner. The fast-track reconciliation procedures \nthat were enacted in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 were never \nintended to be used as a method to enact massive tax cuts that could \nnot be passed without a thorough debate and amendment process. I know, \nbecause I helped to write the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and it \nwas never my contemplation that the reconciliation process would be \nused in this way and for these purposes--never! I would not have \nsupported it. I would have voted against it.\n\n  In fact, I would have left some loopholes in the process that would \nhave saved us from this spectacle every year, where tax legislation \nwith wide-ranging ramifications on domestic and defense spending \npriorities that should be debated at great length and amended many \ntimes is rushed through this Chamber in order to fulfill a political \nparty's agenda. Reconciliation has become a bear trap that cuts off \nsenators from debate and ensures that legislation will be voted upon \nregardless of whether there has been ample debate. Reconciliation \ntypically allows for only twenty hours of debate, equally divided \nbetween the two leaders, which can be yielded back by the leaders under \na nondebatable motion. This year, the reconciliation bill will be voted \nupon after only two hours and twenty-two minutes of debate. Less than \ntwo and one-half hours on a measure that would cost $248 billion over \nten years. We owe the American people the assurance that their \nrepresentatives are enacting legislation that will substantively \naddress the marriage penalty problem in the most cost-efficient method \npossible.\n  I spoke in April on marriage penalty relief and the majority party's \ninsistence on pushing this particular legislation through the Senate. \nWhile I supported marriage penalty relief then, I still opposed cloture \nto end debate on the underlying bill to allow senators to offer \namendments, debate those amendments, and then vote on those amendments. \nIncidentally, this legislation was withdrawn from the floor after the \nminority party insisted on these rights, which is why this marriage \npenalty relief bill is now being considered in this fashion, under \nreconciliation protection. I made remarks in April on the marriage \npenalty relief bill, and made reference to James Madison's ideas on \npopular government, and the irony of how pushing through marriage \npenalty relief based on the notion that it is politically popular \nrepresented Madison's most profound worries about the character of \nrepublican politics. A fear of impulsive and dangerous influence that \nrunaway public opinion could exert over legislation lay at the core of \nhis thinking in 1787 and 1788. Indeed, Madison searched for the proper \nmechanics for the safe expression of public opinion to prevent popular \nmajorities from pursuing their purposes through means that wore away \nthe bonds that might otherwise restrain them. I think it is also fair \nto say that Madison would have opposed legislating in this fashion, and \nthe enactment of tax legislation under reconciliation instructions \nbecause it removes the bonds that ordinarily would prevent the majority \nparty from pushing through legislation which happens to be the hot \npolitical issue of the moment. The Senate will learn one day the \ndetrimental cost of legislating in this fashion.\n  Nonetheless, as I have said before, I will support both marriage \npenalty relief proposals in order to eliminate what can only be \ndescribed as an unintended and unfair consequence of the income tax \ncode. However, I do so with a certain degree of reluctance out of \nconcern that my support would, in any way, be considered an endorsement \nof this style of legislating or that it would indicate my willingness \nto forsake fiscal responsibility relating to Social Security and \nMedicare in order to finance massive tax cuts.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that votes occur in \nrelation to the following amendments in the following sequence, \nbeginning immediately after the adoption of the Interior appropriations \nbill, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation: Burns No. \n3872, Hollings No. 3875, Lott No. 3881, final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, with those conferees being Roth, \nLott, and Moynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Therefore, there will be no further votes, as already has \nbeen announced, this evening. Up to 11 votes will occur in a stacked \nsequence beginning at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7055-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3909\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take but 2 minutes of the Senate's \ntime, given that it is so late this evening.\n  I thank the managers of the legislative appropriations bill for \naccepting this amendment. I think the Chair would be interested in it \nas well, given the fact that he is the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee on which I proudly serve.\n  This amendment merely says that we would limit the use of dangerous \npesticide spraying here at the Capitol and on the Capitol Grounds where \nwe have so many children and so many families visiting us every year. \nMy amendment prohibits the routine use of highly toxic pesticides. \nThose are the ones that contain known or probable carcinogens. They are \nacute nerve toxins and others that contain highly toxic chemicals.\n  We do permit the spraying of such highly toxic chemicals in the rare \ncase of an emergency. If there were a sudden emergency, if there were \nan outbreak where we needed to go to those highly toxic pesticides, \nunder my amendment we would be allowed to do that. But for routine \nspraying, we would go to the mildest forms of these pesticides, the \nones which are classified by the EPA as having the greatest risk to \npublic health.\n  I could cite studies that show how vulnerable children are to these \nvarious compounds. Children are not little adults. They are changing; \ntheir bodies are changing. They react very badly to these toxic \nchemicals.\n  Seven to ten million people visit the Capitol and surrounding \nbuildings every year. A million take guided tours of our historic \nbuildings. We don't know how many of those are children, but just by \nlooking at the crowds, quite a number are. I know in my office alone--\nand I am sure the Chair has thousands of youngsters visiting in his \noffice--we studied it, and we have visits by over 33,000 school-age \nchildren every year. I think by adopting this amendment, we are setting \na valuable example here at the Capitol that I hope all the State \ncapitols will follow. We will begin to see that we can in fact control \nthese pests in a way that is much more friendly to our children.\n  In closing, there is a wonderful organization in California named \nafter a beautiful little child who died of environmental causes several \nyears ago. Her parents founded this organization. It is called CHEC, \nthe Children's Health Environmental Coalition. They are the ones, years \nago, who got me interested in this area. What we are trying to do on \nevery bill that we can is to set this example and say we won't be using \nthis highly toxic form of controlling pests. Tomorrow I will have a \ndebate with one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am \ntrying to offer a similar amendment to the Interior bill, but we may \nget into a bit of a debate then.\n  Tonight is the night for me to say thank you to you, Mr. President, \nfor your indulgence, and to the managers who are here late this evening \nhandling this. I will yield back my time, and I expect we will have a \nvoice vote and I would like to be present for that, if we could do \nthat.\n  I yield back my time and ask that we have a voice vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3909) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3909\n\n                (Purpose: limit funds for pesticide use)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be used \n     for the preventative application of a pesticide containing a \n     known or probable carcinogen, a category I or II acute nerve \n     toxin or a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate, or \n     organochlorine class as determined by the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency to U.S. Capitol buildings or grounds \n     maintained or administered by the Architect of the U.S. \n     Capitol.''\n\n\n                          pesticides amendment\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill for agreeing to my amendment to \nlimit the use of toxic pesticides on U.S. Capitol buildings and \ngrounds. My amendment prohibits the preventive use of pesticides \ncontaining a known or probable carcinogen, a class I or II acute nerve \ntoxin or a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate or \norganocholorine class as identified by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Such pesticides could be used, however, in the case of an \nemergency.\n  Every year, approximately 7 to 10 million people visit the Capitol, \nmany of them children. The National Academy of Sciences has found that \nchildren are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of toxic \npesticides, that current Environmental Protection Agency pesticide \nstandards are not protective of children and that up to 25% percent of \nchildhood learning disabilities may be attributable to a combination of \nexposure to toxic chemicals like pesticides and genetic factors. My \namendment will help protect young visitors to Washington from the \nharmful effects of toxic pesticides by limiting the use of such \npesticides at the U.S. Capitol.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers for their support and I hope that \nthey will work to ensure that this amendment is preserved in \nconference. May I inquire of the distinguished Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee if she will support the amendment in conference with the \nHouse?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague from California for her \nquestion. I assure her that I will work in conference to retain the \nSenator's amendment on pesticide use at the U.S. Capitol.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The provisions of the unanimous consent \nagreement are executed.\n  The bill (H.R. 4516), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 4516) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2001, and for other purposes.'', do pass with the following \n     amendments:\n\n     (1)Page 2, after line 5, insert:\n\n                                 SENATE\n\n                           expense allowances\n\n       For expense allowances of the Vice President, $10,000;

I am pleased that the Board had the \ncourage to call a time-out on rail mergers to reexamine its rail merger \npolicy before proceeding further at this important crossroads for the \nrail sector. I am also gratified that the Court shared my view, and the \nview of many of us in the Senate, that the Board has the authority to \ndo what needs to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7066-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WILDLIFE AND SPORT FISH RESTORATION PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of the men and women \nof this country who value hunting and fishing as an important part of \ntheir lives. I am one of them, and I know I am not alone in the Senate. \nMany of my colleagues have joined me as members of the Sportsmen's \nCaucus, and I am pleased that we enjoy such strong support. In my home \nstate of Montana, hunting and fishing are incredibly important. These \nare some of the activities we engage in to enjoy our beautiful \noutdoors. Hunting and fishing give us the chance to spend time with our \nfamilies, and to take part in the traditions that generations of \nMontanans have enjoyed.\n  It is this strong tradition that brings me here today. There has been \na grave injustice dealt to America's sportsmen. I am referring to the \nabuse of Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson funds by the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service. These are funds from the Wildlife and Sport Fish \nRestoration Programs which impose an excise tax on the equipment \nhunters and fishermen buy. Then the tax monies from the sporting goods \nare used for things like wildlife habitat and hunter safety programs. \nThese programs were started in 1937, with the strong support of both \nthe sportsmen who pay the tax and the states who administer the \nprojects.\n  As years went by, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which manages \nthe programs, started straying further and further from the original \nintent of Pittman-Robertson funds. After an oversight investigation by \nHouse Committee on Resources, chaired by Mr. Young of Alaska, it was \nfound that the Fish and Wildlife Service was using Pittman-Robertson \nfor purposes far outside the intent of the law. Funds were used for \neverything from foreign travel to grants for anti-hunting groups and \nprograms that work against the interests of hunters. This is just plain \nwrong, and goes against everything the program was originally intended \nto accomplish.\n  In response to the abuse uncovered by his Committee, Mr. Young \nintroduced legislation to fix the problems. Part of the legislation \ncaps the administrative expenses for the program and sets in stone what \nis an authorized administrative expense. This is a step in the right \ndirection, because it will restore the integrity to this program. His \nbill, H.R. 3671, passed the House on April 5th with an overwhelming \nvote of 423-2.\n  I am proud to be included as a co-sponsor of the Senate version of \nthis bill, S. 2609. My colleagues from Idaho, Mr. Craig and Mr. Crapo, \nhave modeled it after H.R. 3671 and included provisions for valuable \nprograms like hunter safety, as well as a multi-state conservation \ngrant program.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the ground-\nbreaking and encouraging work being performed by the Healthy Culture \nInitiative, a non-profit group with which I am honored to be \nassociated. The Healthy Culture Initiative (HCI) is an organization \ncommitted to strengthening and improving the health of America's \nculture by recognizing and replicating the many innovative, local \ninitiatives aimed at solving community challenges.\n  The Healthy Culture Initiative recognizes that there are many \nchallenges we face as a nation--over the last thirty years, we have \nseen huge increases in family breakdown, out-of-wedlock births, single \nparent families, teen suicide, drug abuse, violence, and civic \ndisengagement. But for every problem in America, there is already a \nsolution--a solution that is in place in neighborhoods across America. \nIndeed, many of the most effective solutions to the complex social \nproblems of crime, drug abuse, family breakdown, teen suicide, \nillegitimacy, and poverty arise from the committed efforts of a small \ngroup of individuals working within their own community.\n  The Healthy Culture Initiative seeks to recognize these exciting \nefforts, and encourage their replication. HCI has four primary \nobjectives:\n  First, through a series of Success Summits to be held in cities \nacross America, the Healthy Culture Initiative will recognize, and help \nreplicate, community-based solutions to pressing social challenges.\n  Second, the Healthy Culture Initiative will jump-start important \ncivic dialogue about ways that ordinary people, working alone or in \nsmall groups, can help strengthen families, schools, neighborhoods, and \nultimately, our Nation.\n  Third, HCI will measure the success of new initiatives. In \nconjunction with the Gallup organization, the Healthy Culture \nInitiative will work to quantify the actual results of each new \ninitiative launched, so that resources and attention can be \nconcentrated on the most effective efforts.\n  And finally, HCI will develop a network of information resources, \nincluding web links and educational materials, to assist community \nactivists in initiating new programs in their neighborhoods.\n  I can personally attest to the exciting work undertaken by the \nHealthy Culture Initiative, in that I and Senator Joe Lieberman, \ncurrently serve as honorary co-chairs. I am excited by the caliber and \nquality of individuals who are leading this initiative--including Don \nClifton, President and CEO of the Gallup Corporation; Charles Krulak, \nformer Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Executive Director \nCindy Cobb; Don Eberly, CEO of the\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\nNational Fatherhood Initiative, Curt Smith of the Hudson Institute, Jay \nSpeigel of the Reserve Officers Association, and many others.\n  The plans of the Healthy Culture Initiative are ambitious and wide-\nranging. It is my hope that by celebrating the many exciting success \nstories taking place in our communities across America, we can \nencourage their replication--and build a healthier culture, and a \nstronger America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7067-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommemorate the 225th Anniversary of the United States Army and ask \nunanimous consent that an article written by the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Eric K. Shinseki, which pays due tribute to the U.S. Army \nand its contributions to our freedoms be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [Copyright 2000 The Baltimore Sun Company, The Baltimore Sun, Thurs., \n                             June 15, 2000]\n\n                   The Army at 225: A New Patriotism\n\n                         (By Eric K. Shinseki)\n\n       WASHINGTON--In two weeks, Mel Gibson's latest movie, ``The \n     Patriot,'' opens nationwide. Set during the American \n     Revolution, it is the story of a colonist who becomes a \n     militia leader when the sweep of war and the advance of the \n     British endanger his farm and family.\n       Whether by design or mere coincidence, the release of ``The \n     Patriot'' comes at a particularly fitting time in our \n     nation's history because this month marks the 225th \n     anniversary of the birth of our Army.\n       The birth of our Nation and the birth of our Army are \n     inseparably linked.\n       A year before we formally declared our independence, we had \n     already begun fighting for it at Lexington and Concord and \n     the Battle of Bunker Hill, the bloodiest single engagement of \n     the Revolution. On that small piece of ground, over the \n     course of one day, the British lost a staggering 1,054 \n     regulars. The colonists lost about 440.\n       After Bunker Hill, the British would never again \n     underestimate the tenacity and fighting spirit of the \n     American soldier. These early engagements surprised the \n     British, who saw themselves as professionally trained \n     soldiers and the militiamen as little more than a \n     disorganized rabble.\n       But let us not forget that we surprised ourselves as well. \n     Despite our dogged determination to confront the foe, we were \n     unproven and uncertain of our abilities. Who could have \n     imagined that our ill-equipped and untrained colonial militia \n     would fare as well as it did? Our success in those early \n     battles was significant.\n       The victories strengthened national pride, engendered new \n     confidence and bolstered the will to fight. When word spread \n     down the coast that New England farmers had successfully \n     stood up to the well-equipped and well-trained British \n     regulars, colonists everywhere were filled with newfound \n     courage and patriotic fervor. Frustration turned to \n     motivation, and from that point on, the cry for independence \n     simply would not be quelled.\n       On June 14, 1775, Congress took the first formal step in \n     the march toward independence by voting to establish what was \n     then the Continental Army.\n       In those days, the term patriot more closely equated to \n     insurgent. A patriot was a revolutionary who promoted the \n     independence of his people from the country or union of \n     countries that controlled them.\n       From the British perspective, patriots were criminals; to \n     them, the term was an epithet carrying the negative \n     connotation of disloyalty. Thus, in 1775, when George \n     Washington dubbed the original rag-tag band of fighters ``the \n     patriot army,'' he was making a profoundly political and \n     deliberately inflammatory statement; this newborn army would \n     win independence for America.\n       Over time, the word ``patriot'' evolved to a more heroic \n     meaning--a person who loves his country and who defends and \n     promotes its interests. It is especially applied to soldiers \n     who fight for love of country. Thanks to the success of the \n     American Revolution, the connotation of that simple term \n     changed from one of disloyalty to one of allegiance.\n       Since the end of the Revolution, American soldiers, imbued \n     with the spirit of the original patriots, have pledged their \n     allegiance to this nation through their sacrifices in \n     uniform. In doing so, hundreds of thousands of them have \n     given their last full measure of devotion in ultimate \n     demonstration of love for country.\n       Today, thousands of soldiers serve around the globe to \n     maintain our freedom and to provide the promise of a better \n     life to others for whom liberty is but a dream. They are the \n     finest men and women the nation has to offer--active, guard \n     and reserve soldiers doing the heavy lifting so we can enjoy \n     the comforts and freedoms of our way of life.\n       They are unknown to most of us, but they sacrifice daily in \n     places like Kosovo, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, East Timor, Kuwait, \n     Korea and Macedonia in order to promote democracy and to \n     preserve peace and stability.\n       These men and women are our patriots. They are prepared to \n     defend our country, and they are also the best ambassadors \n     for democracy we could have, carrying the same torch of \n     liberty that was lit 225 years ago. In the remotest corners \n     of the globe, American soldiers command respect because they \n     symbolize the traits of our forefathers; a passion for \n     liberty and a willingness to fight to protect freedom.\n       As we reflect on the Army's 225th birthday, let us remember \n     that with our Army was born a nation; with that nation was \n     born democracy; and with democracy was born the hope that \n     peace and liberty could someday be attained by all oppressed \n     peoples of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7067-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Commerce.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7067-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 8:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 3544.

In a coordinated \n     manner, the Indonesian military and militias forced hundreds \n     of thousands of East Timorese at gunpoint to board trucks, \n     boats, and airplanes for transportation to West Timor and \n     other parts of Indonesia; and\n       Whereas, By the end of 1999, United Nations agencies \n     reported that over 125,000 East Timorese had returned home; \n     however, more than 100,000 East Timorese remain unable to \n     return home, many months after the announcement of the \n     referendum results and despite repeated pledges by the \n     Indonesian government to remedy the situation. Thousands of \n     East Timorese taken to other areas of Indonesia remain \n     unaccounted for now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly.

and\n       Whereas, Filipinos all over the world, including the \n     Filipino-American community in Hawaii and the United States \n     and their friends, commemorated the centennial of the birth \n     of the Republic of the Philippines (June 12, 1898), a \n     culmination of the Filipino peoples' struggle for freedom and \n     independence against Spanish colonial rule; and\n       Whereas, in December 1992, United States military forces \n     withdrew from Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, thus \n     ending almost a century of United States military presence in \n     the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, reports from the United States General Accounting \n     Office, United States Department of Defense, the World Health \n     Organization, United States experts, environmental baseline \n     surveys conducted by American firms, and recent media \n     reports, including those conducted by the Boston Globe and \n     CNN, identified serious contamination at forty-six sites at \n     both Clark and Subic bases; and\n       Whereas, many of the chemicals identified, such as \n     polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Aldrin, Dieldrin, Benzene, \n     and Heptachlor,\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n     are part of the family chemicals known as persistent organic \n     pollutants (POPs) because of their persistence in the \n     environment and association with health problems like cancer, \n     reproductive failure, and behavior disorders; and\n       Whereas, a ``Health for All'' survey conducted by \n     internationally-recognized health expert Doctor Rosalie \n     Bertell on behalf of the Canadian Institute for the Concern \n     for Public Health and released in November 1998, found \n     conspicuously high and disparate levels of kidney, urinary, \n     nervous, and female system health problems among 716 families \n     surveyed in the Clark Air Base area alone; and\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1999, the Philippines House of \n     Representatives Committee on Ecology released a report \n     holding the United States responsible for toxic wastes left \n     behind in the former United States military bases at Clark \n     and Subic, which threaten to make these areas economically \n     devastated, largely uninhabitable, and unusable; and\n       Whereas, the Filipino-American community, including the \n     National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NFFAA) \n     and various church groups, such as the Church Coalition for \n     Human Rights in the Philippines and the 20th General Synod of \n     the United Church of Christ (United States), have expressed \n     grave concern for the United States government's lack of \n     response and responsibility over its legacy of toxic wastes \n     in the Philippines;

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the Federal \n     Communications Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 00-031\n\n       Whereas, According to its comprehensive plan and its duly \n     adopted zoning regulations, the Board of County Commissioners \n     of Jefferson County, Colorado denied an application by Lake \n     Cedar Group, LLC, to rezone land on Lookout Mountain from \n     residential and agricultural zoning to planned development \n     zoning in order to allow construction of an 854-foot \n     telecommunications supertower and a 26,000 square foot \n     support building; and\n       Whereas, Such decision was a quasi-adjudicative decision \n     based on factual evidence presented to the Jefferson County \n     Board of County Commissioners and application of applicable \n     legal standards and as such can be appealed judicially to \n     Jefferson County District Court, which court is fully \n     empowered to grant full and appropriate relief to the \n     appellant if appropriate under the facts of the case; and\n       Whereas, Lake Cedar Group filed an appeal of Jefferson \n     County's decision in Jefferson County District Court, which \n     appeal is now pending the filing of briefs by the parties; \n     and\n       Whereas, Despite the pending judicial appeal, and after \n     Jefferson County spent several months preparing the \n     voluminous record of proceedings for the Jefferson County \n     District Court action, Lake Cedar Group, without notifying \n     the Jefferson County Board of County Commissioners or any \n     other interested party, filed a petition with the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) requesting the FCC to \n     ``preempt'' Jefferson County's decision and to declare \n     Jefferson County's decision ``prohibited and unenforceable''; \n     and\n       Whereas, By Public Notice dated April 10, 2000, the FCC \n     seeks public comment on Lake Cedar Group's petition; and\n       Whereas, In the United States, control over individual land \n     use decisions is firmly vested in local governments, through \n     statutory delegation from state governments; and\n       Whereas, The FCC is barred by the 10th Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution from attempting to preempt \n     decisions made by local governments on individual land use \n     applications because the United States Congress has not \n     directed or authorized the FCC to preempt such local \n     decisions; and\n       Whereas, The FCC lacks not only the authority, but also the \n     expertise and any adopted standards to second-guess and \n     invalidate local government land use decisions; and\n       Whereas, Any attempt by the FCC to preempt local government \n     land use decision-making in this manner would represent an \n     illegal, unauthorized, and unjustified attack on state- and \n     local-government land use authority; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\n     That the General Assembly of the State of Colorado hereby \n     encourages the FCC not to preempt local government land use \n     decision-making and state judicial processes, thus overriding \n     local and state government authority; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives; each member of \n     Colorado's Congressional delegation; each member of the House \n     of Representatives Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade \n     and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Commerce; the \n     Governor of Colorado; and the Commissioners of the Federal \n     Communications Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-562. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to Internet taxation; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, the Internet is a collection of computer networks \n     that enables people to communicate electronically with people \n     in other states and nations around the world and millions of \n     organizations and consumers are taking advantage of this \n     technological innovation to transact electronic interstate \n     commerce; and\n       Whereas, business-to-consumer sales transacted through the \n     Internet have increased the interstate commerce of items \n     which have traditionally been sold in intrastate commerce, \n     increasing competition between traditional ``main street'' \n     family businesses and interstate mail order and electronic \n     commerce businesses; and\n       Whereas, under current federal court decisions, some \n     Internet vendors and other remote sellers cannot be legally \n     compelled to collect sales and use taxes from consumers in \n     other states; and\n       Whereas, the difficulties in requiring sales and use tax \n     collections from remote sellers place local ``main street'' \n     merchants at an unfair competitive disadvantage and the \n     Internet and Internet vendors should not receive preferential \n     tax treatment at the expense of such merchants; and\n       Whereas, state sales and use tax collections comprise a \n     substantial percentage of state revenues; and\n       Whereas, states have the primary responsibility for the \n     delivery of education, public safety, transportation, and \n     health and human services; and\n       Whereas, the projected growth of electronic commerce \n     transactions will have a substantial negative impact on state \n     sales and use tax collections; and\n       Whereas, the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act has \n     temporarily limited the states' ability to design new taxing \n     schemes to keep up with today's rapidly transforming \n     technology-drive economy; and\n       Whereas, prior to the end of the moratorium period imposed \n     by the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the United States Congress \n     will be charged with the responsibility to decide the future \n     course of taxation of the Internet, possibly to the detriment \n     of state and local governments and traditional ``main \n     street'' merchants: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to consider the needs \n     of state and local governments and local ``main street'' \n     retailers when determining a course of action regarding \n     Internet taxation; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-563. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the Migratory Bird \n     Treaty Act; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1972 as amended \n     (16 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) was enacted to protect and manage \n     migratory birds in the United States and includes the \n     regulation of taking, possessing, transporting, shipping, \n     exporting, and importing of migratory birds; and\n       Whereas, the enforcement of those laws and regulations is \n     essential to the goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, \n     enforcement which, in the state of Louisiana, is the \n     responsibility of the enforcement division of the Department \n     of Wildlife and Fisheries; and\n       Whereas, the hunting of migratory birds is a widespread \n     recreational and tourist activity in the state of Louisiana \n     with an economic impact in the state in excess of $131 \n     million, including an annual harvest of over 3.5 million \n     birds by more than 128,000 hunters participating in over 1.7 \n     million hunting trips; and\n       Whereas, with that level of activity in the state of \n     Louisiana, the enforcement division of the Department of \n     Wildlife and Fisheries is confronted with the monumental task \n     of enforcement of the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty \n     Act, violations of which are estimated to have an annual \n     negative impact on the state's economy of nearly $8.2 \n     million; and\n       Whereas, the enforcement division of the Department of \n     Wildlife and Fisheries has performed this responsibility \n     through the years and, in fact, has issued more than eighty-\n     nine percent of the citations issued for violations of the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act, all without the benefit of federal \n     monetary support for its efforts: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the U.S. Congress to authorize and appropriate \n     sufficient funds to the enforcement division of the \n     Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to enable the \n     enforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and to enable \n     efforts for conservation and protection of the migratory \n     birds required by that Act; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     the presiding officers of the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate of the U.S. Congress and to each member of the \n     Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-564. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to highway rest \n     stops; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 103\n\n       Whereas, it is a well-established fact that driver fatigue \n     is a major factor contributing to highway accidents; and\n       Whereas, federal law prescribes limits on the number of \n     continuous hours truckers may drive and the length of time \n     they must rest before driving again; and\n       Whereas, one of the most convenient places where long-haul \n     truckers could break their trip and get the rest they need to \n     operate safely is rest stops along interstate highways; and\n       Whereas, this option is not realistically open to truckers, \n     because the Commonwealth limits vehicle stays at these rest \n     stops to no more than two hours; and\n       Whereas, the cost of motel rooms and the inability of many \n     motel parking lots to accommodate large tractor-trailer \n     combinations make use of motels an impractical option for \n     truckers seeking to get their required rest as prescribed by \n     federal law; and\n       Whereas, construction of additional interstate highway rest \n     stops and expansion of existing facilities would enable \n     truckers to comply with federal hours-of-service requirements \n     safely and inexpensively, resulting in fewer highway \n     accidents and improved safety for the motoring public: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to provide \n     federal funding for expansion of certain highway rest stops \n     and for construction of additional interstate highway rest \n     stops and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-565.

Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2878: A bill to commemorate the centennial of the establishment of \nthe first national wildlife refuge in the United States on March 14, \n1903, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environmental and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n  national wildlife refuge system centennial commemoration act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to come before \nthe Senate today to introduce the ``National Wildlife Refuge System \nCentennial Commemoration Act of 2000''. This landmark bill commemorates \nthe centennial of the first national wildlife refuge in the United \nStates, established on March 14, 1903, by a great man and \nconservationist, President Theodore Roosevelt. By setting aside land at \nIndian River Lagoon on Pelican Island, Florida as a haven for birds, \nPresident Roosevelt began a conservation legacy known as the National \nWildlife Refuge System.\n  Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System has evolved into the most \ncomprehensive system of lands devoted to wildlife protection and \nmanagement in the world--spanning nearly 93 million acres across the \nUnited States and its territories. By placing special emphasis on \nconservation, our nation's network of refuges ensures the continued \nprotection of our wildlife resources, including threatened and \nendangered species, and land areas with significant wildlife-oriented \nrecreational, historical and cultural value.\n  Currently, there are more than 500 refuges in the United States and \nits territories, providing important habitat for 700 bird species, 220 \nmammal species, 250 species of amphibians and reptiles, and over 200 \nfish species. The Refuge System also hosts some of our country's \npremiere fisheries, and serves a vital role in the protection of \nthreatened and endangered species by preserving their critical \nhabitats.\n  Approximately 98 percent of the Refuge System land is open to the \npublic. Each year, the System attracts more than 34 million visitors to \nparticipate in a variety of recreational activities that include \nobserving and photographing wildlife, fishing, hunting and taking part \nin system-sponsored educational programs. By providing the public with \nan opportunity to participate in these activities, refuges promote a \nsense of appreciation for the natural wonders of this nation and \nemphasize our important role as stewards of these lands.\n  The bill that I introduce today marks a milestone in the history of \nconservation and celebrates 100-years of the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem on March 14, 2003. The bill commemorates the Refuge System by \ncreating a Commission that will oversee the Centennial anniversary and \npromote public awareness and understanding of the importance of refuges \nto our nation. Additionally, the bill directs the Fish and Wildlife \nService to prepare a long-term plan for the Refuge System that will \nenable the Service to look ahead and determine the future needs and \npriorities of the system network.\n  This bill celebrates the legacy of our national refuge lands, and \nrecognizes the tireless efforts of numerous dedicated individuals from \nboth the private and public sectors who have worked to preserve this \ninvaluable national heritage. I encourage my colleagues to show your \nsupport for the National Wildlife Refuge System by co-sponsoring this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill in \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Smith and\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\nothers to introduce the ``National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial \nCommemoration Act of 2000.''\n  First established by that great conservation leader, President \nTheodore Roosevelt in 1903, the National Wildlife Refuge System has \ngrown today to be the premier system of reserves for the conservation \nof wildlife habitat and biological diversity in the world.\n  There are more than 500 refuges today, supporting over 1500 \nvertebrate species and thousands of species of plants. Open to the \npublic, these refuges are the focal point of thousands of visitors each \nyear that participate in wildlife viewing, photography, hunting, \nfishing or biking. They are places where families go to introduce \nyoungsters to nature and to teach them the meaning of stewardship.\n  In some cases, refuges provide the last habitats for endangered \nspecies. In all cases, the nearly 93 million acres in the National \nWildlife Refuge system provide special places for wildlife, fish, \nplants and people. These lands provide a buffer against ever-increasing \ndevelopment and are reserved for future generations to enjoy and learn \nfrom.\n  In Montana, we have seven National Wildlife Refuges including the \n2,800 acre Lee Metcalf Refuge, the 15,500 acre Bowdoin National \nWildlife Refuge in the Central Flyway, and the National Bison Range, \noriginally set aside to protect the last of the great bison herds.\n  Mr. President, the bill that we are introducing today will celebrate \nthe last 100 years of the National Wildlife Refuge System on Mary 14, \n2003. In addition, the bill establishes a commission to look ahead and \nplan for the future, including a review of the backlog of maintenance \nneeds at our refuges. It is my hope that this bill will increase public \nawareness and understanding of these national treasures.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Bunning, and Mr. Craig)\n  S. 2879. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nprograms and activities to address diabetes in children and youth, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n             PEDIATRIC DIABETES RESEARCH AND PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself, Senator \nBreaux, and Senator Abraham, I am pleased to introduce the Pediatric \nDiabetes Research and Prevention Act. Both Senator Breaux and Senator \nAbraham have been leaders in the fight against diabetes.\n  Our legislation will help us reduce the tremendous toll that diabetes \ntakes on our Nation's children and young people. Diabetes is a \ndevastating, lifelong condition that affects people of every age, race, \nand nationality.\n  Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes, and about 800,000 new \ncases are diagnosed each year. It is one of our nation's most costly \ndiseases in both human and economic terms. Diabetes is the leading \ncause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations not \nrelated to injury. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and \nstroke and shortens life expectancy up to 15 years. Moreover, diabetes \ncosts our nation more than $105 billion a year in health-related \nexpenditures. More than one out of every ten health care dollars and \nabout one out of four Medicare dollars are spent on people with \ndiabetes.\n  Unfortunately, there is no method to prevent or cure diabetes, and \navailable treatments have only limited success in controlling its \ndevastating consequences. The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy \nfor children and young adults with type I, or insulin dependent \ndiabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes. In type I diabetes, the \nimmune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cell in the pancreas \nand destroys them. As a consequence, the pancreas produces little or no \ninsulin. Juvenile diabetes is the second most common chronic disease \naffecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never outgrow.\n  As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have met many \nchildren with diabetes who face a daily struggle to keep their blood \nglucose levels under control: kids like nine-year-old Nathan Reynolds, \nan active young boy from North Yarmouth who was Maine's delegate to the \nJuvenile Diabetes Foundation's Children's Congress last year. Nathan \nwas diagnosed with diabetes in December of 1997, which forced him to \nchange both his life and his family's life. He has learned how to take \nhis blood--something his four-year-old brother reminds him to do before \nevery meal--check his blood sugar level, and give himself an insulin \nshot on his own, sometimes with the help of his parents or his school \nnurse. Nathan told me that his greatest wish was that, just once, he \ncould take a ``day off'' from his diabetes.\n  The sad fact is that children like Nathan with diabetes can never \ntake a day off from their disease. There is no holiday from dealing \nwith their diabetes. They face a lifetime of multiple daily finger \npricks to check their blood sugar levels and daily insulin shots. \nMoreover, insulin is not a cure for diabetes, and it does not prevent \nthe onset of serious complications. As a consequence, children like \nNathan also face the possibility of lifelong disabling complications, \nsuch as kidney failure and blindness.\n  Reducing the health and human burden of diabetes as well as its \nenormous economic impact depends upon identifying the factors \nresponsible for the disease and developing new methods for prevention, \nbetter treatment, and ultimately a cure. The Pediatric Diabetes \nResearch and Prevention Act, which I am introducing today, will do just \nthat.\n  One of the most important actions we can take is to establish a type \nI diabetes monitoring system. Currently, there is no way to track the \nincidence of type I diabetes across the country. As a consequence, the \nestimates for the number of people with type I diabetes from the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes \nof Health vary enormously--from 123,000 to over 1.5 million, a 13-fold \nvariation.\n  According to noted epidemiologist Alex Languimer, ``Good monitoring \ndoes not necessarily ensure the making of right decisions, but it does \nreduce the risk of wrong ones.'' One of the best ways to define the \nprevalence and incidence of a disease, as well as to characterize and \nstudy populations, is to establish a registry specific to that disease. \nThe bill I am introducing today directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS), acting through the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC), to create a National Registry on Juvenile \nDiabetes so that we can develop a national database on type I diabetes, \nincluding information about incidence and prevalence. The Secretary \nwould also be directed to establish an advisory board of \nepidemiologists, clinicians, ethicists, patients and others to help \nguide this effort.\n  Obesity and inadequate physical activity--both major problems in the \nUnited States today--are important risk factors for type 2, or non-\ninsulin dependent diabetes. Unfortunately, obesity is a significant and \ngrowing problem among children in the United States, which has led to a \ndisturbing increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among young \npeople. This is particularly alarming since type 2 diabetes has long \nbeen considered an ``adult'' disease. Nearly all of the documented \ncases of type 2 diabetes in young people have occurred in obese \nchildren, who are also at increased risk for the complications \nassociated with the disease. Moreover, these complications will likely \ndevelop at an earlier age than if these children had developed type 2 \ndiabetes as adults.\n\n  The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act will direct the \nSecretary of HHS to implement a national public health effort to \naddress type 2 diabetes among children, including: 1) enhanced \nsurveillance systems and expanded research to better assess the \nprevalence of type 2 diabetes in young people and determine the extent \nto which type 2 diabetes is incorrectly diagnosed as type 1 diabetes \namong children; 2) assistance to States to establish coordinated school \nhealth programs and physical activity and nutrition demonstration \nprojects to control\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nweight and to increase physical activity among school children; and 3) \ndevelopment and improvement of laboratory methods to assist in \ndiagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes.\n  In addition, the Collins, Breaux, Abraham legislation calls for long-\nterm studies of persons with type 1 diabetes at the National Institutes \nof Health (NIH) where these individuals will be followed for 10 years \nor more. These long-term studies will examine disease manifestations, \nmedical histories, environmental factors, development of complications, \nand other factors. This long-term analysis of type 1 diabetes will \nprovide an invaluable basis for the identification of potential \nenvironmental triggers thought to precipitate the disease. It will also \nprovide for the delineation of clinical characteristics or lab measures \nassociated with the complications of diabetes as well as help to \nidentify a potential study population for clinical trials.\n  Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease, which results \nwhen the body's system for fighting infection turns against a part of \nthe body. A variety of promising new approaches to treatment and \nprevention of autoimmune responses are currently under development. For \nthe most part, however, these studies are conducted in adult \npopulations. Moreover, at present, there is an insufficient \ninfrastructure to conduct the clinical trials necessary to take \nadvantage of new therapeutic approaches.\n  The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act directs the \nSecretary of HHS, acting through the Director of the NIH, to support \nregional clinical centers for the cure of type 1 diabetes and through \nthese centers, provides for: (1) a population of children appropriate \nfor study; (2) well-trained clinical scientists able to conduct such \ntrials; (3) appropriate clinical settings to house these studies; and \n(4) appropriate statistical capability, data, safety and other \nmonitoring capacity.\n  And finally, the legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to provide \nfor a national effort to develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes. Animal \nstudies suggest great promise for the development of a new vaccine to \nprevent type 1 diabetes in humans. The Pediatric Diabetes Research and \nPrevention Act provides for a combination of increased efforts in \nresearch and development of candidate vaccines, coupled with an \nenhanced ability to conduct large clinical trials in children.\n  The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act will help us to \nbetter understand and ultimately conquer this disease which has had \nsuch a devastating impact on millions of American children and their \nfamilies. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine, and I want \nto recognize her leadership in this area.\n  In the last couple of years, I have begun to focus my attention on \nchildhood type 1 diabetes. What the Senator from Maine is offering \ntoday is clearly moving us well in advance.\n  I ask the Senator to allow me to be a sponsor of her legislation.\n  The Senator's effort struck a particularly loud chord with me, \nbecause it was exactly one year ago today that the Senate and I lost a \nfriend and colleague, Ken Foss, related to his diabetes.\n  This Senate and this Congress should focus on diabetes, as we have \ncancer and other health areas in our country, to move more quickly \ntoward a cure.\n  The Senator is so right in recognizing we have already moved a long \nway and there is a great deal known. My rather limited reading suggests \nthat the great push forward might well break us into those areas of \nremedy, at least for type 1, and there is a great deal of work going \non. My congratulations to the Senator for her leadership in that area. \nI stand to help in any way I can.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the kind, \nsupportive words from my colleague. I am very honored to add him as a \ncosponsor of my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 2880. A bill to provide construction assistance for a project for \na water transmission line from the Missouri River to the city of \nWilliston, North Dakota; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n    construction assistance water project in williston, north dakota\n\n                 the williston water transmission line\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the Army Corps of Engineers to construct a new water \ntransmission line from the Missouri River to the city of Williston. \nThis project is very important to the reliability of the water supply \nfor the residents of Williston and is needed to mitigate long-term \nconsequences from construction of the Garrison Dam.\n  The construction of the Garrison Dam and creation of Lake Sakakawea \nby the Corps forced the city of Williston to relocate its water intake \nand treatment plant to its present location approximately five miles \nupstream of the city. As a requirement of the new location, a large-\ndiameter transmission line was constructed to convey the entire city's \nwater supply from the treatment plant to the city.\n  All of the water for the city's residents and businesses must flow \nthrough this single transmission line. As a result, the existing \ntransmission line is the only link between the water treatment plant \nand the city's water distribution system.\n  The existing transmission line has been in service for nearly 40 \nyears with limited maintenance to date in part because the line runs \nthrough an area near the river that has become super-saturated due to \nthe rising water table behind the dam. As the transmission line \ncontinues to age, it has become susceptible to failures, as \ndemonstrated in April 1998.\n  On April 8, 1998, maintenance crews discovered a major leak in the \ntransmission line near the water treatment plant. City officials \nimmediately alerted residents of the problem and imposed water \nrestrictions to essential water uses only. Through an emergency \ndeclaration, the National Guard was enlisted to install an overland \npipeline to help provide temporary water for the city. The high water \ntable from Lake Sakakawea made repairs difficult with extensive pumping \nand dewatering procedures needed to locate and fix the broken pipeline. \nIt took more than two weeks to make the necessary repairs. If the \nfailure had occurred during the winter, repairs and temporary water \nservice would have been almost impossible to provide. This experience \nsupports the need for Williston to have a second transmission line from \nthe water treatment plant to the city's water distribution system.\n  The bill I am introducing today will authorize the Corps to construct \na new transmission line. The city has identified a new route for the \nline that provides improved access, avoids unstable site conditions, \nprovides potential service for future industrial sites, while \nminimizing the length and cost of the new transmission line.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Federal government has a responsibility \nto assist communities mitigate the adverse consequences resulting from \nthe construction of the Garrison Dam and creation of Lake Sakakawea. \nThe Corps of Engineers built the Garrison Dam which resulted in the \nneed for this project, and in my view the Corps should be responsible \nfor addressing the unintended consequences of building that dam. This \nbill will help the Federal government live up to its responsibility and \nensure that the residents of Williston have a reliable water supply. I \nurge my colleagues to review this legislation quickly so we can pass it \nthis year, before there is another disruption to the city's water \nsupply.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2882. A bill to authorize Bureau of Reclamation to conduct certain \nfeasibility studies to augment water supplies for the Klamath Project, \nOregon and California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the klamath basin water supply enhancement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, cosponsored by my colleague Mr. Wyden, to authorize the \nBureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nthe Interior, to conduct feasibility studies in the Klamath basin.\n  The Klamath Project in Oregon and California is one of the earliest \nfederal reclamation projects. The Secretary of the Interior authorized \ndevelopment of the project on May 15, 1905, under provisions of the \nReclamation Act of 1902. The project irrigates over 200,000 acres of \nfarmland in south-central Oregon and north-central California. The two \nmain sources of water supply for the project are Upper Klamath Lake and \nthe Klamath River, as well as Clear Lake Reservoir, Gerber Reservoir, \nand Lost River, which are located in a closed basin. The total drainage \narea is approximately 5,700 square miles. The Klamath River is subject \nto an interstate compact between the States of Oregon and California.\n  There are also several wildlife refuges in the basin that are an \nimportant part of the western flyway. There are listed suckers in Upper \nKlamath Lake that require the lake to be maintained at certain levels \nthroughout the summer. There are also salmon in the Klamath River for \nwhich federal agencies are seeking additional flow. It is my \nunderstanding that there will be significant additional flow \nrequirements next year.\n  The Upper Basin has not been adjudicated by the State of Oregon, \nwhich is trying to use an alternative process to formal adjudication. \nThe tribes in the basin are also seeking a resolution of their water \nrights claims.\n  In recent years, there has been growing concern about meeting the \ncompeting needs of various water uses in the Basin, including the needs \nof the farmers, the fish, the tribes and the wildlife refuges. There is \na consensus in the basin about the need to increase overall water \nsupplies in order to meet these growing needs and enhance the \nenvironment.\n  The bill I am introducing today is an effort to build on this \nconsensus. I have discussed the concepts in this bill with a number of \nthe stakeholders in the Upper Basin, and I am committed to a \nlegislative process that will consider the views of the various \ninterest groups in the basin. I know that there will be other issues \nthat stakeholders will want considered, and I will endeavor to do so.\n  I believe it is vitally important, however, that we take the first \nstep to enable the Department of the Interior to study ways to improve \nboth the water quality and the water quantity in the Upper Klamath \nbasin. There is significant private irrigation in the Upper Basin as \nwell, and I am committed to a process that includes these water users \nas well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Craig, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Gramm, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S.J. Res. 50. A joint resolution to disapprove a final rule \npromulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency concerning water \npollution; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n disapproving a final rule promulgated by the environmental protection \n                   agency concerning water pollution\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution, co-sponsored by Senators Bob Smith, Hutchinson, Craig, \nShelby, Coverdell, Enzi, Gramm, and Inhofe, revoking the Environmental \nProtection Agency's (EPA) rule on Total Maximum Daily Loads under the \nClean Water Act.\n  I strongly support the EPA's goal of cleaning up our nation's water \nbodies but disagree with its approach. We must accelerate cleanup of \nour rivers, lakes, and streams; unfortunately, the EPA's rule will not \naccomplish that goal. In fact, the EPA's hastily completed rule will \ndivert billions of dollars from programs that are working to an \nunreasonable, prohibitively-expensive, and technically-unworkable \nprogram.\n  Since the EPA's draft TMDL rule was first published in August 1999, \nmany stakeholders including states, industry, environmental \norganizations, the public, and Congress have all raised serious \nconcerns. The EPA received over 34,000 public comments, most \noverwhelmingly in opposition to the rule. Twenty public forums were \nconducted; again, sentiments ran overwhelmingly in opposition to the \nEPA's rule. Twelve congressional hearings were held, revealing that the \nproposal is unreasonable and unworkable. The National Governors' \nAssociation denounced the rule as an inflexible, unfunded mandate that \nwill eliminate opportunities to reduce overall pollution. In a May 19 \nletter, six environmental groups urged the EPA to ``withdraw the \ncurrent version of the proposed rule, which is so fundamentally flawed \nthat it would weaken the existing TMDL program.''\n  When it became clear that the EPA was ignoring concerns and \nproceeding to fast-track its rule, even in the fact of such serious \nopposition, Congress, rightly, exercised its oversight responsibility \nby including specific language in the Fiscal Year 2001 Military \nConstruction Supplemental Appropriations bill to prevent finalization \nof the rule. Similar language was also passed by the House in the FY \n2001 VA-HUM-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. In clear defiance \nof Congress, the EPA promulgated the rule on July 11, 2000.\n  The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801-808 provides for expedited \ncongressional review of agency rulemaking; specially, Section 802 \nprovides a legislative procedure by which Congress can disapprove an \nagency's rule. This congressional review statute was approved in the \n104th Congress for situations just such as this to reserve to Congress \na mechanism for exercising its agency oversight responsibility.\n  It is important that we work to develop a program that will enhance, \nnot hinder, our cleanup efforts. Repeatedly, the EPA was urged to \nrepropose a rule that will accomplish our goal of more clean water more \nquickly; revoking the hurriedly completed rule will allow the EPA to \nfocus its efforts on a program that will actually achieve the goals of \nthe Clean Water Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the \nEPA's efforts to circumvent Congress and encouraging it to develop an \neffective proposal in collaboration with the public.\n\n

            S. Res. 337\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable John O. Pastore, formerly a Senator from the State \n     of Rhode Island.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     deceased Senator.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tonight, as we adjourn, we do so in memory \nof John O. Pastore, who served the people of Rhode Island here in the \nSenate from 1950 to 1976.\n  Senator Pastore's life was in many ways a realization of the American \ndream--characterized by humble beginnings, hard work, opportunity, and \naccomplishment. His father was an immigrant tailor who passed away when \nJohn was a young boy. From that time on, he and his four siblings were \nreared by their mother, who supported the family as a seamstress.\n  Senator Pastore earned his law degree from Northeastern University, \nthrough evening classes the school offered at the Providence YMCA. The \nfamily home was his first law office.\n  Senator Pastore, was initially elected to office in 1934, when he \nbecame a Member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He \nsubsequently served as assistant state attorney general, lieutenant \ngovernor, and in 1945 became governor when his predecessor resigned for \nanother office. Senator Pastore was then elected to two terms in his \nown right.\n  In 1950, he was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill a vacant seat. Two \nyears later, he won the first of four full terms in this institution. \nHe never lost an election.\n  Many individuals have passed through the doors of this great chamber, \nand each has left a unique imprint. Senators for years to come will \nthink of John Pastore whenever the ``Pastore rule'', relating to \ngermaneness of debate, is invoked.\n  Senator Pastore will be remembered in the United States Senate as a \nservant of the people and a man committed to his beliefs.\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\n  Today, the thoughts and prayers of the Senate are with his family and \nhis constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/17/senate-section/article/S7079-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7079-S7081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               BRYAN (AND FITZGERALD) AMENDMENT NO. 3883\n\n  Mr. BRYAN (for himself and Mr. Fitzgerald) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (H.R. 4578) making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2001, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 164, line 19, strike ``$1,233,824,000,'' and insert \n     ``$1,203,824,000,''.\n       On page 164, line 23, strike ``(16 U.S.C. 460l6a(i)):'' and \n     insert ``(16 U.S.C. 460l6a(i)), of which $220,844,000'' shall \n     be available for forest products:''.\n       On page 165, beginning on line 6, strike ``Provided'' and \n     all that follows through ``accomplishment:'' on lines 11 and \n     12.\n       On page 165, line 25, strike ``$618,500,000, to remain \n     available until expended:'' and insert ``$633,500,000, to \n     remain available until expended, of which $419,593,000 shall \n     be available for preparedness and fire use functions:''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       NICKLES AMENDMENT NO. 3884\n\n  Mr. NICKLES proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 4578, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, tonight, as we adjourn, we do so in memory \nof John O. Pastore, who served the people of Rhode Island here in the \nSenate from 1950 to 1976.\n  Senator Pastore's life was in many ways a realization of the American \ndream--characterized by humble beginnings, hard work, opportunity, and \naccomplishment. His father was an immigrant tailor who passed away when \nJohn was a young boy. From that time on, he and his four siblings were \nreared by their mother, who supported the family as a seamstress.\n  Senator Pastore earned his law degree from Northeastern University, \nthrough evening classes the school offered at the Providence YMCA. The \nfamily home was his first law office.\n  Senator Pastore was initially elected to office in 1934, when he \nbecame a Member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He \nsubsequently served as assistant state attorney general, lieutenant \ngovernor, and in 1945 became governor when his predecessor resigned for \nanother office. Senator Pastore was then elected to two terms in his \nown right.\n  in 1950, he was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill a vacant seat. Two \nyears later, he won the first of four full terms in this institution. \nHe never lost an election.\n  Many individuals have passed through the doors of this great chamber, \nand each has left a unique imprint. Senators for years to come will \nthink of John Pastore whenever the ``Pastore rule'', relating to \ngermaneness of debate, is invoked.\n  Senator Pastore will be remembered in the United States Senate as a \nservant of the people and a man committed to his beliefs.\n  Today, the thoughts and prayers of the Senate are with his family and \nhis constituents.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and a statement of explanation appear at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
