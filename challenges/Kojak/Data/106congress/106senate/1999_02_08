The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This afternoon the Senate will resume consideration of the \narticles of impeachment. Pursuant to S. Res. 30, the Senate will \nproceed to final arguments for not to exceed 6 hours, equally divided \nbetween the House managers and the White House counsel.\n  At the conclusion of those arguments today, I expect the Senate to \nadjourn the impeachment trial until tomorrow. We expect tonight, when \nwe go out of the impeachment trial, to have a period for legislative \nbusiness so we can pass a resolution or consider a resolution with \nregard to King Hussein.\n\n\n                  Order for Tuesday, February 9, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At this juncture in the trial, I am compelled to object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to proceed, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Sensenbrenner.\n  Mr. Manager SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel \nfor the President, and Senators, I am Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. I \nrepresent 580,000 people in southeastern Wisconsin in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. During my entire service in Congress, I have served as \na member of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We are nearing the end of a long and difficult process. The Senate \nhas considered for the past several weeks the grave constitutional \nresponsibility to determine whether the actions of President Clinton \nmerit his conviction and removal from office. The Senate has been \npatient, attentive and engaged throughout this unwelcome task, and for \nthis the House managers are grateful. The managers would also like to \nthank the distinguished Chief Justice for his patience and impartial \ndemeanor throughout this trial.\n  At the outset of the managers' closing arguments, it is important to \ndistinguish what has caused only the second Presidential impeachment in \nhistory from extraneous matters that bear no relation to the verdict \nthe Senate will shortly reach. When this trial began 4 long weeks ago, \nwe said that what was on trial was the truth and the rule of law. That \nhas not changed, despite the lengthy legal arguments you have heard. \nThe truth is still the truth and a lie is still a lie. And the rule of \nlaw should apply to everyone no matter what excuses are made by the \nPresident's defenders.\n  The news media characterizes the managers as 13 angry men. They are \nright in that we are angry, but they are dead wrong about what we are \nangry about. We have not spent long hours poring through the evidence, \nsacrificed time with our families and subjected ourselves to intense \npolitical criticism to further a political vendetta. We have done so \nbecause of our love for this country and respect for the Office of the \nPresidency, regardless of who may hold it. We have done so because of \nour devotion to the rule of law and our fear that if the President does \nnot suffer the legal and constitutional consequences of his actions, \nthe impact of allowing the President to stand above the law will be \nfelt for generations to come.\n  The Almanac of American Politics has called me ``a stickler for \nethics.'' To that, I plead guilty as charged because laws not enforced \nare open invitations for more serious and criminal\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\nbehavior. This trial was not caused by Kenneth Starr, who only did his \nduty under a law which President Clinton himself signed. It was not \ncaused by the House Judiciary Committee's review of the independent \ncounsel's mountain of evidence. Nor was it caused by the House of \nRepresentatives approving two articles of impeachment, nor by the \nSenate conducting a trial mandated by the Constitution.\n  Regardless of what some may say, this constitutional crisis was \ncaused by William Jefferson Clinton and by no one else. President \nClinton's actions, and his actions alone, have caused the national \nagenda for the past year to be almost exclusively concentrated on those \nactions and what consequences the President, and the President alone, \nmust suffer for them.\n  This trial is not about the President's affair with Monica Lewinsky. \nIt is about the perjury and obstruction of justice he committed during \nthe course of the civil rights lawsuit filed against him, and the \nsubsequent independent counsel investigation authorized by Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno.\n  The President has repeatedly apologized for his affair, but he has \nnever, never apologized for the consequences of the perjury and \nobstruction of justice he has committed. Perhaps those decisions were \nbased upon a Dick Morris public opinion poll which told the President \nthat the American people would forgive his adultery but not his \nperjury. Perhaps it was for another reason. Whatever the White House's \nmotivations were, the fact remains that the President's apologies and \nthe statements of his surrogate contritionists have been carefully \ncrafted for the President to continue to evade and, yes, avoid \nresponsibility for his deceiving the courts to prevent them from for \nadministering justice.\n\n  Because the President's actions to obstruct justice are so egregious \nand repeated, many have ignored his grand jury perjury, charges before \nyou in article I. I wish to point out four glaring examples of William \nJefferson Clinton's perjurious, false and misleading statements to the \ngrand jury and not at the civil deposition in the Paula Jones case.\n  First, the President lied under oath to the grand jury when he \nfalsely testified about his attorneys' use of a false affidavit at his \ndeposition. Second, he lied under oath to the grand jury about his \nconversations with Betty Currie. Third, he lied under oath to the grand \njury about what he told his aides about his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky, knowing that those aides would be called to testify to the \ngrand jury. Fourth, he lied under oath to the grand jury when he \ntestified about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  An ordinary citizen who lies under oath four times to a grand jury is \nsubject to substantial time in a Federal prison. The decision each \nSenator must make with respect to article I is whether the President is \nto pay a price for his perjury, just like any citizen must. The \nPresident's defenders and spin doctors would have you believe that the \nPresident told all of these lies under oath to protect himself and his \nfamily from personal embarrassment, and even if he did tell a lie, it \nwas not that bad a lie.\n  Senators, please remember that the President's grand jury appearance \nwas over 6 months after the news media broke the story about the \nPresident's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. By August 17, few people doubted \nthat he had an affair with her. There was little left to hide. And he \nlied after practically everyone who was asked--including many of you--\nadvised the President to tell the truth to the grand jury. And still he \nlied.\n  We have heard a litany of excuses, including the President saying he \nwas not paying a great deal of attention and that he was trying to \nfigure out what the facts were, and that he needed to know whether his \nrecollection was right, and that he had not done anything wrong. And on \nand on. The President knew what had happened. If Monica Lewinsky came \non to him and made a sexual demand upon him and he rebuffed her, as he \ntold Sidney Blumenthal, he would have nothing to apologize for.\n  Senators, don't be fooled by the President's excuses and spin \ncontrol. The facts and the evidence clearly show that he knew what he \nwas doing was to deceive everyone, including the grand jury. He and his \ndefenders are still in denial. They will not accept the consequences of \nhis repeated and criminal attempts to defeat the judicial process. His \nlies to the grand jury were not to protect his family or the dignity of \nhis office but to protect himself from criminal liability for his \nperjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones case.\n  Over 9 years ago, the Senate removed Judge Walter Nixon from office \nfor about the same offense--lying under oath to the grand jury. The \nvote in the Senate was 89-8 in favor of Judge Nixon's removal, with 48 \ncurrent Senators and Vice President Gore voting guilty. To boot a \nFederal judge from office while keeping a President in power after the \nPresident committed the same offense sets a double standard and lowers \nthe standard of what the American people should expect from the leader \nof their country. To conclude that the standard of Presidential \ntruthfulness is lower than that of a Federal judge is absurd. To \nconclude that perjury and obstruction of justice are acceptable if \ncommitted by a popular President during times of peace and prosperity \nsets a dangerous precedent which sets America on the road back to an \nimperial Presidency above the law.\n  To justify the President's criminal behavior by demonizing those who \nseek to hold him accountable ignores the fact that President Clinton's \nactions, and those actions alone, precipitated the investigations which \nhave brought us here today. To keep a President in office whose gross \nmisconduct and criminal actions are a well-established fact will weaken \nthe authority of the Presidency, undermine the rule of law, and cheapen \nthose words which have made America different from most other nations \non the Earth: Equal justice under law.\n  For the sake of our country and for future generations, please find \nthe President guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice when you \ncast your votes.\n  Mr. Cannon.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Cannon. If you \nwill wait a moment, Mr. Manager Cannon. If there is no objection, the \nJournal of the proceedings of the trial are approved to date. Please go \nahead.\n  Mr. Manager CANNON. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel to the President, \nMembers of the Senate, my name is Christopher B. Cannon, and I \nrepresent over 600,000 people in the Third District of Utah.\n  I want to begin with a couple of thank-you's. First, I thank you \nSenators for your attention during this series of presentations. I know \nthat you all have deep conflicts over the matter before you. Some of \nyou have made strong and public statements about it. But you have all \npaid extraordinary attention, and for that I thank you.\n  I also thank the other members of the management team. It has been a \nremarkable experience to have been associated with them during the last \n5 months--almost as good, I might say, as it would have been to have \nbeen home with my wife, children, and our new baby.\n  If I might, I want to share with you a recent family experience. I \nhave been home just about a little over a day out of the last 3 weeks. \nIt took my 10-month-old baby a little while to warm up to me when I was \nhome last. Later, as I started packing, she realized I was leaving \nagain and she insisted that I hold her. I think she felt that if she \nheld on, I wouldn't disappear. Unfortunately, she fell asleep during \nthe trip to the airport. I know that the other managers have had \nsimilar disruptions in their families. For instance, Charles Canady's \nwife had a baby during the trial.\n  I, therefore, thank my wife and children, and the wives and children \nof all of the managers for their forbearance and support during this \nprocess. Like us, they believe in the obligation we have to assure good \ngovernment. I might say that, like us, they are grateful that the \nmanagers' role is ending.\n  For the managers, this process is almost done. I hope that history \nwill judge that we have done our duty well. We have been congratulated \nand condemned. But we are done.\n  And while our difficult role is ending, yours is just beginning. \nWhile I'm certain that sitting here silently has been difficult, the \ntruly daunting task before you now is to conclude this trial\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nwith some sense of legitimacy. For America is deeply divided, and the \nend result of an impeachment trial was designed by the founding fathers \nto salve those wounds. Traditionally, after an airing of the facts and \na vote by the Senate, either a President is removed or he is \nvindicated. In this case, it seems, neither of those results may be \nrealized. While the facts are clear that the President committed \nperjury and obstruction of justice, it is equally clear that this body \nmay not remove him from office. And from this perception, you face the \nchallenge of legitimizing the end result. Your vote will end this \nmatter. It is nonjusticiable. Whatever your decision is, it cannot be \nundone. The outcome will be right by definition. But how well you do \nthe work of divining that outcome will affect the way we as a nation \ndeal with the divisions among us.\n  To proceed in a manner that will be trusted, and viewed as legitimate \nby the American people, you must deal with the differences between this \nproceeding and prior impeachment trials. You must do this with an \nobvious commitment to your oath to do justice impartially according to \nthe Constitution and the law. The law includes the rules and precedents \nof the Senate.\n  Senate resolution 16 made this process different from all of the \npreceding 13 Senate trials on impeachment, principally by removing from \nthe managers the right to present our case as we see fit. I suspect \nthat the lewd subject matter and the partisan fight in the House may \nhave influenced your decision.\n  But there is an integrity to the historic rules and reasons for them. \nFor instance, the Senate by nature will be divided in the impeachment \nproceedings while the managers are united. It is therefore easier for \nthe managers to decide on how to present their case than for the \nSenate.\n  There are other differences in this proceeding from historic \nimpeachment practice before the Senate. May I list the changes for you \nwith the intent to help you focus on the goal of a conclusion that we, \nthe people, will feel is legitimate.\n  Senate resolution 16 called for a 24 hour presentation or ``trial,'' \nthat mainly consisted of what the public saw as the yammering of \nlawyers. Time was equally divided rather than sequenced as it is in a \ntrial where opening statements are made and then evidence is put on \nthrough witnesses. In a trial, each side typically takes the time \nnecessary to establish its case or undermine the witness through cross \nexamination. After the moving party has made its case, the responding \nparty makes it case. Time is dictated only by what each side feels it \nneeds. Each witness is subject to whatever cross examination is \nappropriate. The case develops tested piece by tested piece, and \nultimately one side prevails.\n  Here, the managers had to cut very important portions of our limited \ncase. We had a limited number of witnesses, limited to video taped \nappearances, limited to fit an arbitrary three hour rule. That time was \nlessened because we had to reserve time for rebuttal.\n  According to judicial traditions, defendants have to challenge each \nwitness as they appear, not wrap the credibility of all in one wide \nranging response. In these proceedings, the Senate has not had the \nopportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses as the case \ndeveloped. The White House then used its time with long video portions \nand small cutting accusations. Who knows what the White House might \nhave done if it had been able, or found it necessary, to challenge \nwitnesses as they testified?\n  Another diversion from judicial and Senate trial precedent was that \nthe only rebuttal for the managers was what we reserved after our video \npresentation and, awkwardly, in the questioning period where important, \ncomplicated issues were cut off by artificial time limits, while \nperipheral issues got more time than they deserved. This questioning \nperiod had the unfortunate side effect of focusing the public on the \npartisanship of the Senate.\n  The problem of the newness of the presentation format was exacerbated \nby our new media environment. The Internet with its immediate and often \nunvetted content, and cable television with its perpetual talking \nheads, gave equal time and equivalency of weight to the managers and \nthe White House, with no witness testimony to constrain them. The \nprocess gave rise to the perception that the ``fix was in,'' leaving \nsome to gloat at having scammed the situation, and others angry at \nbeing unheard.\n  And that is the context within which the Senate must now find a \nlegitimate outcome. Given the wide-ranging discussions of options, it \nis clear this is no easy task. Will it be:\n  Adjournment with condemnation?\n  Findings of fact about the President's behavior?\n  A bifurcated vote to show agreement with the articles of impeachment \nbut not removing the President?\n  A simple up or down on the articles of impeachment?\n  Or a vote for acquittal followed by censure?\n  I don't know which, if any, of these options really makes sense. And \nI don't know of any other options. I do know that the issue is grave, \nand that your responsibility is great.\n  So I am here today to ask you to set aside some natural inclinations \nfor the good of the country.\n  I would implore you, Senators, both Republican and Democrat, to set \naside partisanship, politics, polls, and personalities and exchange \nthem for loftier inclinations--those of ``procedure,'' ``policy,'' and \n``precedents.'' These are the only guidelines this body should have.\n  As the Senate deliberates this case I would ask that a few key facts \nnever be forgotten:\n  1. That the President committed perjury when he lied under oath.\n  2. The Senate has historically impeached judges for perjury--even \nrecently by some of you assembled here.\n  3. Any American watching these proceedings who commits perjury would \nalso be punished by the law.\n  4. If the Senate follows our Nation's precedents of punishing \nperjurers, and if the Senate follows its own precedents of convicting \nperjurers, then there is only one clear conclusion in this matter: \nconviction.\n  Senators, we as Americans and legislators have never supported a \nlegal system which has one set of laws for the ruler, and another for \nthe ruled. After all, our very own pledge of allegiance binds us \ntogether with the language of ``liberty and justice for all.'' If that \nis the case, if we intend to live up to the oaths and pledges we take, \nthen our very own President must be subject to the precedents our \nNation's judicial system and this Senate body have heretofore set.\n  Because I love this country and its institutions, I pray for \ninspiration for each of you as you seek the proper, legitimate outcome. \nMay God bless you in the process.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Gekas.\n  Mr. Manager GEKAS. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues on each side of the \npodium, Members of the Senate, if I were to take some time to thank the \nChief Justice for his patience in all this, would that be counted \nagainst my time?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes.\n  Mr. Manager GEKAS. Then I will send you a note. (Laughter.)\n  We do offer our thanks to the Chief Justice.\n  I come from Pennsylvania, and the people in my district, in the \nentire State, and the people in their 49 brethren States across the \nNation recognize that there is really only one issue, with all the fury \nand the tumult and the shouting and the invective, the language, and \njust the plain shouting that has occurred across the Halls of Congress \nand every place else in the country.\n  It all swoops down the telescope to one issue: Did the President \nutter falsehoods under oath? Everyone understands that. Everyone comes \nto the conclusion that that is a serious allegation that has been made \nthrough the impeachment, and one which you must judge in the final vote \nthat you will be casting.\n  But why is it important about whether or not the President uttered \nthe falsehoods under oath? It is important not just to constitute the \nbasis of perjury, as is alleged, and/or obstruction of justice, which \nis alleged, but even if those two were not proved in all their elements \nas crimes, you would still have to consider a falsehood under oath as \nconstituting an impeachable offense. I say that advisedly.\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\n  It starts--my contention does--with the assertions of our esteemed \ncolleagues who represent the President. Time after time, and in their \nbriefs and in their statements on and off the floor, they have stated \nyou need not have a criminal offense for it to constitute an \nimpeachable offense. They provided examples of that. They said that all \nyou have to demonstrate is that an impeachable offense is one that \nrocks against the integrity of the system of government. I am \nparaphrasing, of course.\n  I submit--and I feel this so strongly that it bothers me that I can't \nmake it clear--that to violate the oath as a witness in a civil case, \nor a criminal case, in the Jones matter, or in the grand jury, smashes \nagainst the integrity of our system of government. There are sundry \nreasons for that.\n  In this case, if you follow the logic and the extreme intellectual \npresentation made by White House counsel that refutes every item that--\nor attempts to refute, not refutes--attempts to refute every item \nasserted by the managers, if you believe all of that and are confused \nor in doubt about the Jones case and whether lies under oath were \ncommitted, or at the grand jury, you must think about this. This is, to \nme, proof positive that the President uttered falsehoods under oath in \nall of his public stances.\n  On December 23, the President, under oath, answered interrogatories \nthat were sent to him by the court in the Jones case in which he said, \nin answer to the question, Have you ever had sexual relations with \nanyone in a subordinate role while you were Governor of Arkansas, or \nPresident of the United States?--this is important. At that time--and \nthe record will disclose all of this--at that time, there was no \ndefinition in front of him, no gaggle of attorneys trying to dispute \nwhat word meant what, no judge there to interpose the legal standard \nthat should be employed, but rather the boldfaced, naked phrase of \n``sexual relations'' that everyone in the whole world understands to be \nwhat it is--and the President answered under oath ``None.''\n  I submit to the Members of the Senate, if the answer then, December \n23, before ever stepping foot in the deposition of the Paula Jones \ncase, if he never appeared there, or whatever he said there was so \nclouded you can't draw a conclusion, certainly you can refer back to \nDecember 23 and see a starting point of a pattern of conduct on the \npart of the President that proves beyond all doubt that he committed a \npattern and actual falsehoods under oath time and time again.\n  If that is not enough, on January 15, as the record will disclose, he \nanswered under oath requests for documents in which the question is \nasked under oath, to which the President responded, Have you ever \nreceived any gifts or documents from--and it mentioned among others \nMonica Lewinsky--and the President under oath said ``No'' or ``None.'' \nThe record will show for sure exactly what he said. But he denied that \nany gifts were transferred from, or any documents, or any items of \npersonalty, from Lewinsky to the President.\n\n  I submit to you that if you are confused about that, because of the \ngreat presentation made by the counsel for the President about the \nmurkiness and cloudiness of the Jones deposition, the maddening \nconsequences of the President's testimony-- ``maddening,'' they said--\nthen you can refer back to January 15 before the deposition, and \nDecember 23, and find proof positive in the documents already a part of \nthe case that you have to decide that, indeed, a pattern of falsehoods \nunder oath was initiated and conducted by the President of the United \nStates.\n  That is very important. Those allegations, by the way, have gone \ncompletely uncontradicted by the President of the United States.\n  I think they took great delight--these colleagues of mine on behalf \nof the President--great delight in saying--at one point they put the \nmarquee in the sky, that in so many different ways when Monica Lewinsky \nsaid, ``Nobody told me to lie,'' that was the case for them. What a \ncase they made. ``Nobody told me to lie.'' They won the case right then \nand there in their minds, because that was exculpatory and that was \nbrandishing in this case once and for all, Monica said, ``Nobody told \nme to lie.''\n  I am going to take some liberties with the Latin that I learned in \nschool, and we all learned in college and law school, ``falsum in unum \nis falsum in toto,'' meaning if you say something false in one phase of \nyour testimony, more than likely the triors of fact can find that you \nwere false in all of them.\n  Well, I am going to change that. I think I am right when I say that \n``veritas in unum is veritas in toto.'' So when Monica Lewinsky says, \n``Nobody told me to lie,'' and that is the indomitable, indestructible \ntruth that the White House counsel say, that is the case, then it also \nmust be ``veritas in toto,'' because when she said that she gave gifts \nto the President, then you must accept that ``veritas in unum is \nveritas in toto.''\n  That goes on and on and on.\n  Somebody is waving, ``Cut this short.'' (Laughter.)\n  It is very tough for me to do that, but I will comply.\n  I have a witness. I call a witness to bolster my part of this \nsummation. The witness is the American people.\n  Mr. Craig, in his last appearance on this podium, was delighted to be \nable to quote a poll that showed that 75 percent of the people of our \ncountry felt that there was no need to present videotapes to the Senate \nin the trial--75 percent, he said with great gusto, of the American \npeople.\n  Of course the polls of all types were quoted time and time again by \nthe supporters of the President as showing why you should vote to \nacquit. The polls, the polls, the polls.\n  I now call the American people's poll on whether or not they believe \nthat the President committed falsehoods under oath--80 percent of the \nAmerican people--I call them to my side here at the podium to verify to \nyou that the President committed falsehoods under oath.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Chabot.\n  Mr. Manager CHABOT. Thank you. I am Steve Chabot. I represent the \nFirst District of Ohio, which is Cincinnati.\n  This week we will likely finally conclude this trial. Has it been \ndifficult? Yes. Would we all have preferred that none of this ever \nhappened? Of course. But the President has put our Nation through a \nterrible ordeal, and it has been our duty to pursue this case to its \nconclusion.\n  Despite the dire warnings, scare tactics and heavy-handed threats by \nthose who would circumvent the solemn constitutional process that we \nare all engaged in, our great country has survived. We have finished \nthis trial in just a few weeks. The economy continues to be strong, and \nthe Nation's business is getting done.\n  But, Senators, before you turn out the lights and head home, you must \nmake one final decision. It is a decision that should not be influenced \nby party affiliation or by politics or by personal ties. It is a \ndecision that should be guided by our Constitution, by our laws, and by \nyour own moral compass.\n  A few months ago I stood here in your shoes, as did all the \ncolleagues here, and the colleagues in the House, preparing to make \nwhat would likely be the most important vote of our careers. Throughout \nthe process, I did my best to be fair, to keep an open mind. I listened \ncarefully to the views of my constituents, the people who sent me to \nCongress. I reviewed the evidence in excruciating detail. Ultimately, \nfor me, the choice was clear. I came to the conclusion that it was my \nduty to support impeachment. Now it is your turn to cast what could be \nthe most important vote of your political careers. The question is, \nWill moral fortitude or political expediency rule the day?\n\n  This past weekend, I had the opportunity to spend a couple hours at \nmy college alma mater, William and Mary, not too far from here, down in \nWilliamsburg, VA. As I walked around the campus, I could not help but \nthink back to my college days and what motivated me to seek public \noffice in the first place.\n  Back in 1972, I was a 19-year-old college student casting my first \nballot in a Presidential election. Like a majority of Americans that \nyear, I voted for a Republican, Richard Nixon, for President. Four \nyears later, however, I voted for a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. This \ndecision stemmed from my profound disappointment over Watergate and a \nstrong conviction that President Nixon should not have received \nimmunity for his actions.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n  Now, just as in college, I find myself extremely troubled by the \nactions of a President. In fact, as I started to think about what I \nwould say to you today, I wasn't sure how to begin. How exactly do you \nwrap up in 10 minutes or less everything we have witnessed in the last \nyear? We have seen Bill Clinton's finger-waving denial to the American \npeople. We have seen the President lie before a Federal grand jury. We \nhave seen the President obstruct justice. We have seen the President \nhold a public celebration immediately following the House impeachment \nvote. We all know the President's behavior has been reprehensible.\n  President Clinton, however, refuses to admit what all of us know is \ntrue. To this day, he continues to deny and distort; he continues to \ndispute the undeniable facts that are before the Senate and before the \nAmerican people. The President's attorneys have done their best to \ndisguise the truth as well.\n  At the beginning of this trial, I predicted in my presentation that \nthey would use legal smokescreens to mask the law and the facts. To \ntheir credit, they produced smoke so thick that it continues to cloud \nthis debate. But if you look through the smoke and the mirrors employed \nby these very able lawyers, you will see the truth. The truth is that \nPresident Clinton lied to a Federal grand jury. He lied about whether \nor not he had committed perjury in a civil deposition, about the extent \nof his relationship with a subordinate Federal employee, about his \ncoaching of his secretary, Betty Currie, and about the countless other \nmatters.\n  In my opening statement before this body, I outlined the four \nelements of perjury: An oath, intent, falsity, materiality. In this \ncase, all those elements have been met.\n  President Clinton also obstructed justice and encouraged others to \nlie in judicial proceedings. He sought to influence the testimony of a \npotentially adverse witness with job assistance, and he attempted to \nconceal evidence that was under subpoena.\n  These truths cannot be ignored, distorted, or swept under the rug. \nSome of the President's partisan defenders want you to do just that. \nBut it would be wrong. It would be wrong for you to send the message to \nevery American that it is acceptable to lie under oath and obstruct \njustice. It would be wrong for you to tell America's children that some \nlies are all right. It would be wrong to show the rest of the world \nthat some of our laws don't really matter.\n  I must agree with Phyllis and Jack Stanley, constituents of mine who \nlive in my district, who wrote me a letter saying, and I quote:\n\n       We believe that President Bill Clinton should definitely be \n     impeached for the sake of the country. If he is not \n     impeached, will not the rule of law in this country be \n     weakened? We do not feel glee over the prospect of President \n     Clinton's impeachment, however. For the sake of coming \n     generations, acknowledging that integrity, honor and decency \n     matter greatly is very important, especially in the highest \n     office of the land.\n\n  Like most of you, I have spent countless hours at grocery stores, \nshopping malls, in schools, in my church talking to my constituents. I \nhave also read thousands of letters that have been sent to my office, \njust as we all have. What I have heard and read doesn't surprise me. \nPeople in Cincinnati, OH, have a variety of views on what the ultimate \nverdict should be by this body. Many want the President removed from \noffice. Others want a censure. Still others would just like to see the \nprocess end. But regardless of their views, they are honorable people \nwho care about our country and our future.\n  Now, I know that throughout the process some of the President's more \npartisan defenders have harshly criticized the managers, the House of \nRepresentatives, and anyone who would dare believe the President \ncommitted any crimes. These partisan attacks have been unfortunate \nbecause I think we all know that these issues are serious and that they \ndeserve serious consideration. I know it, the American people know it, \nand I think you all know it, too. But despite the partisan rhetoric of \nthe attacks, I believe that once this trial ends, we must work \ntogether.\n  So I would ask everyone here today to make a commitment, a commitment \nto every American, that regardless of the trial's outcome, we will join \ntogether to turn the page on this unfortunate chapter that President \nClinton has written into our Nation's history.\n\n  The question before you now is: How will this chapter end? Will the \nfinal chapter say that the U.S. Senate turned its back on perjury and \nobstruction of justice by a President of the United States, or will it \nsay that the Senate took a principled stand and told the world that no \nperson, not even the President, stands above the law; that all \nAmericans, no matter how rich, how powerful, or how well connected, are \naccountable for their actions, even the President.\n  As the father of two children and a former schoolteacher myself at an \ninner-city school in Cincinnati, I believe it is very important that we \nteach our children that honesty, integrity, and the rule of law do \nmatter.\n  While I am in Cincinnati, I spend a lot of time visiting schools \nthroughout my community. I taught the seventh and eighth grades back in \nCincinnati. When I go there, I go to elementary schools, I go to junior \nhighs, I go to high schools; and I have been doing this for a number of \nyears. Do you know what is inevitably one of the questions that the \nkids will ask me almost every time? It is, ``Have you ever met the \nPresident of the United States?''\n  Now, why do kids ask that question? Because our kids understand how \nimportant the Office of the Presidency is. The person who occupies that \noffice owes it to the children of this Nation to treat the office with \nrespect. In the past, when those kids asked me that question, they \nasked me that question out of pride and respect. They looked up to the \noffice. They looked up to everything the office represents. Bill \nClinton has let our children down, and that is one of the greatest \nthings that bothers me. It is the effect this will have on the children \nof this Nation.\n  Let me conclude with a statement that I received from a student, \nJuliette Asuncion, who is a student at Mother Mercy High School, who \nwrote to me recently:\n\n       I am writing to express my feelings on the scandalous \n     situation that has taken over the White House for the past \n     couple of months. First, I would like to state the qualities \n     that should be found in the President of the United States. \n     Since the President is the official representative of the \n     United States, he should uphold the values and ideals held by \n     the people of this country. The President should be honest \n     and a trustworthy person. He should be a good decision maker, \n     have good morals and have his priorities straight. He should \n     devote his time to the country and set a good example for the \n     people of this Nation. I feel that President Clinton does not \n     measure up to these standards. He's lied to the American \n     people; he's committed perjury. For someone in his position, \n     this is an unforgivable act, and he should not be allowed to \n     just walk away without a punishment. He has shown that he \n     feels he can go above the law, and I strongly believe the \n     President should be impeached.\n\n  I conclude by telling you, when you cast your vote, you remember that \nby your vote you are determining the lesson that Julia, your children \nand grandchildren will learn. So how will this chapter end? The \ndecision is yours.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Robert Barr.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Barr.\n  Mr. Manager BARR. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Distinguished and worthy adversarial counsel for the President, \nincluding my good friend and former Georgetown law professor, Charles \nRuff, gentlemen and ladies of the Senate, my name is Bob Barr. I \nrepresent the Seventh District of Georgia, but in a broader sense I \nrepresent the country because I have been directed, as every one of the \nother 12 managers of the House has been directed by the American \npeople, by a majority vote of the House of Representatives, to urge you \nto review the evidence and issue a verdict of conviction on the two \narticles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Two days ago, all of us celebrated the birthday of former President \nRonald Reagan. During his first year in office, on May 17th, 1981, this \npresident, known for giving voice to America's best and most decent \ninstincts, spoke to the American people from Notre Dame University. \nThough spoken nearly 18 years ago, and clearly not in contemplation of \nan impeachment, the former President's words provide guidance for you \nhere today.\n  It was that date that President Reagan spoke of a certain principle;\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nand in so doing, he quoted another giant of the 20th century, Winston \nChurchill. Specifically, President Reagan spoke of those who derided \nsimple, straight-forward answers to the problems confronting our \ncountry; those who decried clarity and certainty of principle, in favor \nof vagueness and relativism. He said:\n\n       They say the world has become too complex for simple \n     answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there \n     are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what is \n     morally right. Winston Churchill said that, ``the destiny of \n     man is not measured by material computation. When great \n     forces are on the move in the world, we learn we are \n     spirits--not animals.'' And he said, ``there is something \n     going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, \n     whether we like it or not, spells duty.''\n\n  Duty. A clear, simple concept. A foundational principle.\n  Your duty is clearly set forth in your oath; your oath to do \nimpartial justice according to the Constitution and the law.\n  In the past month, you have heard much about the Constitution; and \nabout the law. Probably more than you'd prefer; in a dizzying \nrecitation of the U.S. Criminal Code: 18 U.S.C. 1503. 18 U.S.C. 1505. \n18 U.S.C. 1512. 18 U.S.C. 1621. 18 U.S.C. 1623. Tampering. Perjury. \nObstruction. That is a lot to digest, but these are real laws and they \nare applicable to these proceedings and to this President. Evidence and \nlaw, you have seen it and you have heard it.\n  You've also seen and heard about straw men raised up by the White \nHouse lawyers, and then stricken down mightily. You've heard them \nessentially describe the President alternately as victim or saint. \nYou've heard even his staunchest allies describe his conduct as \n``reprehensible.'' Even some of you, on the President's side of the \naisle, have concluded, ``there's no question about his having given \nfalse testimony under oath and he did that more than once.''\n  There has also been much smoke churned up by the defense.\n  Men and women of the Senate, Monica Lewinsky is not on trial. Her \nconduct and her intentions are not at issue here. Vernon Jordan is not \non trial and his conduct and his intentions are not at issue here. \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton is on trial here. His behavior, his \nintentions, his actions--these and only these are the issues here. When \nthe White House lawyers raise up as a straw man that Vernon Jordan may \nhave had no improper motive in seeking a job for Ms. Lewinsky; or that \nthere was no formal ``conspiracy'' proved between the President and \nVernon Jordan; or that Ms. Lewinsky says she did not draw a direct link \nbetween the President's raising the issue of a false affidavit and the \ncover stories, keep in mind, these are irrelevant issues. When the \nWhite House lawyers strike these theories down, even if you were to \nconclude they did, they are striking down nothing more than irrelevant \nstraw men.\n  What stands today, as it has throughout these proceedings, are \nfacts--a false affidavit that benefits the President, the coaching of \nwitnesses by the President, the secreting of subpoenaed evidence that \nwould have harmed the President, lies under oath by the President. \nThese reflect President Clinton's behavior; President Clinton's \nintentions; President Clinton's actions; and President Clinton's \nbenefit. Not through the eyes of false theories; but by the evidence \nthrough the lens of common sense.\n  You've heard tapes, and read volumes of evidence. Not pursuant to the \nprocess we as House Managers would have preferred, but much evidence \nnonetheless, has been presented.\n  Many are saying, with a degree of certainty that usually comes only \nfrom ignorance, that there's nothing I or any of us can say to you \ntoday, on the eve of your deliberations, to sway your minds. I beg to \ndiffer with them. Moreover, we have been directed by the people of this \ncountry, by a majority vote of the House of Representatives, to fulfill \nand reaffirm a constitutional process, and to present evidence to you, \nand argue to you.\n  There is much, in urging a vote for conviction, that can be gained by \nturning to, and keeping in mind, President Reagan's words to America, \nto do duty: Duty unclouded by relativism, unmarred by artificiality. \nDuty that lives on after your vote--just as America will live on and \nprosper after a vote to convict. Duty untainted by polls. The country's \nfascination with polls has wormed its way even into these proceedings \nwhen, just a few days ago, we heard one of the White House lawyers cite \npolls as a reason not to release the videotapes.\n\n  Polls played no role in the great decisions, decisive decisions that \nmake America a nation and kept it a free and strong nation. Polls \nlikewise played no role in the great trials of our nation's history \nthat opened schools equally to all of America's children, or that \nprovided due process and equal protection of the laws for all \nAmericans, regardless of economic might or political power.\n  Yet, it is in many respects polls that threaten to become the \ncurrency of political discourse and even of judicial process as we near \nto enter the 21st century.\n  Your duty, which I know you recognize today, is and must be based not \non polls or politics, but on law and the Constitution. In other words, \nprinciple.\n  What you decide in this case, the case now before you, will tell \nAmerica and the world what it is we have, as a foundation for our \nNation, not just today, but for ages to come. It will tell us and this \nNation weather these seats here today will continue to be filled by \ntrue statesmen. Whether these seats will continue to echo with the \nbooming principles, eloquence and sense of duty of Daniel Webster, John \nCalhound, Everett Dirksen, Robert Byrd. I would add to that list of \nstatesmen my fellow Georgians and your former colleague, Sam Nunn, \nwhose concern for duty and our Nation's security caused him recently on \nCNN to raise grave concerns over our Nation's security because of the \nreckless conduct of this President. Will the principles embodied in our \nConstitution and our laws be reaffirmed; wrested from the pallid hands \nof pollsters and pundits, and from the swarm of theorists surrounding \nthese proceedings? Will they be taken up by you, and placed squarely \nand firmly back in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, \nJames Madison, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, \nJr., and so many other true statesmen of America's heritage? Principles \nthat have stricken down bigotry, tyrants, and demagogues; principles \nthat, through open and fair trials, have saved the innocent from the \nhangman's noose; and likewise have sent the guilty, clothed in due \nprocess, to then ether regions.\n  It is principle, found and nurtured in our Constitution and our laws, \nthat you are now called on to both use and reaffirm.\n  Not only America is watching, the world is, too. And, for those who \nsay people from foreign lands look down on this process and deride this \nprocess, I say, ``not so.''\n  Let me speak briefly of a man not born in this country, but a man who \nhas made this his country. A man born not in Atlanta, Georgia, though \nAtlanta is now his home. A man born many thousands of miles away, in \nEritrea. A man to who President Reagan surely was in a sense speaking, \nboth in 1981 when he spoke of America's eternal sense of duty, and in \nJanuary 1985, when he spoke of the ``American sound'' that echoes still \nthrough the ages and the continents.\n  The man whose words I quote is a man who watches this process through \nthe eyes of an immigrant, Mr. Seyoum Tesfaye. I have never met Mr. \nTesfaye, but I have read his works. He wrote, in the Atlanta Journal \nand Constitution, just 3 days ago, on February 5th, that this \nimpeachment process ``is an example of America at its best . . . a core \nconstitutional principle that profoundly distinguishes America from \nalmost all other nations.'' He noted without hyperbole, that this \nprocess, far from being the sorry spectacle that many of the \nPresident's defenders have tried to make it, truly ``is a hallmark of \nrepresentative democracy,'' reaffirming the principle that ``no man is \nabove the law--not even the President.''\n  These are not the words of the House Managers; though they echo ours.\n  These are not the words of a partisan.\n  These are the words of an immigrant. A man who came to America to \nstudy, and has stayed to work and pay taxes just as millions of us do \nevery day.\n  Men and women of the United States Senate, you must, by affirming \nyour duty to render impartial justice based\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\non the Constitution and the law, reaffirm those same laws and that very \nsame Constitution, which drew Mr. Tesfaye and countless millions of \nother immigrants to our shores over the ages. This is not a comfortable \ntask for any of us. But, as Martin Luther King, Jr., correctly noted, \nin words that hangs on my office wall, and perhaps on some of yours, it \nis not in ``times of comfort and convenience'' that we find the measure \nof a man's character, but in times of ``conflict and controversy.'' \nThis is such a defining time.\n  Obstruction of justice and perjury must not be allowed to stand. \nPerjury and obstruction cannot stand alongside the law and the \nConstitution.\n  By your oath, you must, like it or not, choose one over the other, up \nor down, guilt or acquittal. I respectfully submit on behalf of the \nHouse of Representatives and on behalf of my constituents in the \nSeventh District of Georgia that the evidence clearly establishes guilt \nand that the Constitution and laws of this land demand it.\n  I thank the Members of the Senate and yield to Mr. Manager Buyer.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Buyer.\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel and Senators, my name is \nSteve Buyer, House manager, from Monticello, IN. I represent 20 \ncounties between South Bend and Indianapolis. I will not try to claim \nthe cornerstone of Hoosier common sense. Mr. Kendall would wrestle me \nfor that cornerstone. But as a former criminal defense attorney, I want \nto take a moment and compliment the White House counsel and Mr. Kendall \nfor doing your best to defend your client in the face of overwhelming \nfacts and compelling evidence. (Laughter.)\n  Your role here--a side comment here--your role here is much easier, \nthough, in a Court of Impeachment as opposed to a criminal court of \nlaw.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor, I compliment Chairman Henry Hyde and \nmy colleagues, the House managers, who have embraced and given life \nmeaning of the rule of law and presented this case to the Senate in a \nprofessional, thorough, and dignified manner.\n  I assure you, the House managers would not have prosecuted the \narticles of impeachment before the bar of the Senate had we not had the \nhighest degree of faith, belief and confidence that, based on the \nevidence, the President committed high crimes and misdemeanors which \nwarrant his removal from office.\n  As you come to judgment, I recommend you square yourself with your \nduty first.\n  On January 7, I witnessed as the Chief Justice administered your oath \nto do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws. You \nshould follow this prescription: Find the truth, define the facts, \napply the law, give reverence to the Senate precedents while defending \nthe Constitution. But I submit, it is the integrity of your oath in \nwhich you must regulate to uphold the principle of equal justice under \nthe law.\n  During the question-and-answer phase with the Chief Justice on \nSaturday, January 23, I stood in the well of the Senate and recommended \nthat you vote on findings of fact. I want to clear the record of my \nintent of the recommendation. It has been grossly distorted.\n  It is not to establish the guilt, as some have alleged. A finding of \nfact is not a finding of fiction. On the contrary, it is to prevent \ndecisions by triers of fact from basing their judgment on fiction or \nchance or politics. The Chief Justice ruled that you are triers of \nfact, and since this constitutional proceeding of impeachment is more \nlike a civil proceeding than a criminal trial, I bring to your \nattention rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that \nprovides, in pertinent part, that when a judge sits alone as a trier of \nfact, he or she is required to set down in precise words the facts as \nhe or she finds them. This requirement is mandatory and cannot be \nwaived by the parties of Federal practice.\n  A memorandum of findings of fact is not a radical concept to American \njurisprudence. It is customary and habitually used in State and Federal \ncourts all across this land. Since you sit collectively as a Court of \nImpeachment, as the triers of fact, I recommended the findings of fact \nto guarantee that you have carefully reviewed the evidence and have a \nrational basis for your final judgment.\n  To claim that findings of fact is unconstitutional is false. The \nSupreme Court has consistently permitted the Senate to shape the \ncontours and the due process of an impeachment trial.\n  The Senate owes the American people and history an accounting of the \nstubborn facts.\n  I would like to comment on some statements.\n  I have heard some Senators state publicly that they are using the \nstandard of beyond a reasonable doubt. But the Senate has held \nconsistently that the criminal standard of proof is inappropriate for \nimpeachment trials. The result of conviction in an impeachment trial is \nremoval from office; it is not meant to punish. You are to be guided by \nyour own conscience, not by the criminal standard of proof of beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\n  I have also heard some Senators from both sides of the aisle state \npublicly, ``I think these offenses rise to the level of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' To state publicly that you believe that high crimes and \nmisdemeanors have occurred, but for some reason you have this desire \nnot to remove the President, that desire, though, does not square with \nthe law, the Constitution, and the Senate's precedents for removing \nFederal judges for similar offenses.\n  So long as William Jefferson Clinton is President, the only mechanism \nto hold him accountable for his high crimes and misdemeanors is the \npower of impeachment and removal. The Constitution is very clear. You \ncannot vindicate the rule of law by stating high crimes and \nmisdemeanors have occurred, but leave the President in office subject \nto future prosecution after his term is expired.\n\n  Without respect for the law, the foundation of our Constitution is \nnot secure. Without respect for the law, our freedom is at risk.\n  The President is answerable for his alleged crimes to the Senate here \nand now.\n  Moreover, if criminal prosecution and not impeachment is the way to \nvindicate the rule of law, then the Senate would never have removed \nother civil officers such as Federal judges, who are not insulated from \ncriminal prosecution while holding office.\n  Thus, in providing for criminal punishment after conviction and \nremoval from office, it was the framers who insured that the rule of \nlaw would be vindicated both in cleansing the office and in punishing \nthe individual for the criminal act.\n  I have asked myself many times how allowing a President to remain in \noffice while having committed perjury and obstruction of justice is \nfair to those across the country who are sitting in jail for having \ncommitted the same crimes. I have had the fairness argument thrown into \nmy face consistently.\n  Fairness is important. Fairness is something that is simple in its \nnature and is powerful in the statement that it makes. A statement \nwhich you send carries us into tomorrow and becomes our future legacy.\n  If you vote to acquit, think for a moment about what you would say to \nthose who have been convicted of the same crimes as the President.\n  What would you say to the 182 Americans who were sentenced in Federal \ncourt in 1997 for committing perjury?\n  What would you say to the 144 Americans who were sentenced in Federal \ncourt in 1997 for obstruction of justice and witness tampering?\n  Would you attempt to trivialize the evidence and say, ``This case was \nonly about lying about sex''?\n  I want to cite the testimony before the House Judiciary Committee of \none woman who experienced the judicial system in the most personal \nsense, and that is the testimony of Dr. Barbara Battalino. I think it \nis compelling.\n  She held degrees in medicine and law, and Manager Rogan showed some \nof the testimony just the other day. You see, she was prosecuted by the \nClinton Justice Department and convicted for obstruction of justice \nbecause of her lie under oath about one act of consensual oral sex with \na patient on VA premises. Her untruthful response was made in a civil \nsuit which was later dismissed. In a legal proceeding, Dr. Battalino \nwas\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nasked under oath: ``Did anything of a sexual nature take place in your \noffice on June 27, 1991?''\n  Her one word reply, ``No,'' convicted her and forever changed her \nlife.\n  Her punishment? She was convicted of a felony, forced to wear an \nelectronic monitoring device, and is presently on probation. She lost \nher license to practice medicine and her ability to practice law.\n  Our prisons hold many who are truly contrite, they are sorry, they \nfeel pain for their criminal offenses, and some whose victims have even \nforgiven them, others who were very popular citizens and had many \nfriends and apologized profusely, but they were still held accountable \nunder the law.\n\n  Just like the President is acclaimed to be doing a good job, many in \nprison today were doing a good job in their chosen professions. None of \nour laws provides for good job performance, contrition, forgiveness, or \npopularity polls as a remedy for criminal conduct.\n  These were the closing lines of Dr. Battalino's opening statement \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee:\n\n       We all make mistakes in life. But, common frailty does not \n     relieve us from our responsibility to uphold the Rule of Law. \n     Regardless, this nation must never let any person or people \n     undermine the Rule of Law. . . . If liberty and justice for \n     all does not reign, we--like great civilizations before us--\n     will surely perish from the face of the earth.\n\n  What you would say to Dr. Battalino and others similarly situated is \nvery important because fairness is important.\n  Alexander Hamilton, writing not long after the Constitution was \nadopted, well expressed the harm that would come to our Republic from \nthose who, by example, undermine respect for the law. In a statement \nthat bears repeating, Hamilton wrote:\n\n       If it were to be asked, What is the most sacred duty and \n     the greatest source of security in a Republic? The answer \n     would be, an inviolable respect for the Constitution and \n     Laws--the first growing out of the last. . . . Those, \n     therefore, who . . . set examples, which undermine or subvert \n     the authority of the laws, lead us from freedom to slavery; \n     they incapacitate us from a government of laws. . . .\n\n  President Clinton, by his persistent and calculated misconduct and \nillegal acts, has set a pernicious example of lawlessness, an example \nwhich, by its very nature, subverts respect for the law. His perverse \nexample inevitably undermines the integrity of both the office of the \nPresident and the judicial process.\n  You see, ladies and gentlemen, without choice we were all born free, \nand we inherited a legacy of liberty at great sacrifice by many who \nhave come before us. We cannot collectively as a free people enjoy the \nliberties without measured personal restraint. And that is the purpose \nof the rule of law. It is the function of the courts to uphold the \ndignity of that prescription and the God-given liberties of all of us. \nThat is how we are able to carry this Nation forward in the future \ngenerations.\n  So in light of the historic principles regarding impeachment, the \noverwhelming evidence to the offenses alleged, and the application of \nthe Senate precedents, I believe it makes it very clear that our \nPresident--who has shown such contempt for the law, the dignity and the \nintegrity of the office of the Presidency that was untrusted to him--\nmust be held to account; and it can only be by his removal from office.\n  The House managers reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.\n  The Chair recognizes the White House counsel.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.\n  I wonder, Mr. Majority Leader, whether we might take a brief break \nbecause there is going to need to be some rearrangement of furniture \nhere.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was hesitant to suggest it too early today, Mr. Chief \nJustice. (Laughter.)\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. But on the request of counsel, I ask unanimous consent we \ntake a 10-minute recess. And please return quickly to the Chamber so we \ncan get back to business.\n  There being no objection, at 2:12 p.m. the Senate recessed until 2:35 \np.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the \nChief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. White House Counsel Ruff.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief Justice, \nmanagers of the House, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I can't \nresist beginning, following the lead of my colleagues across the well \nhere, by telling you that my name is Charles Ruff and I am from the \nDistrict of Columbia, and we don't have a vote in the Congress of the \nUnited States. (Laughter.)\n  I truly did not intend to begin quite this way, but I must. I don't \nthink there is a court in the land where a prosecutor would be able to \nstand up for one-third of his allotted time, speak in general terms \nabout what the people are entitled to and what the rule of law stands \nfor--as important as all of that may be--and sit down and turn to the \ndefense counsel and ask that defense counsel go forward, reserving 2 \nhours for rebuttal. I recognize that procedural niceties have not \nnecessarily characterized the way this trial has gone forward. But I do \nbelieve--and this is the only time today I will say this, I promise--\nthat kind of prosecutorial gambit is symptomatic of what we have seen \nbefore in these last weeks--wanting to win too much.\n  Now, that said, let me begin where I intended to begin. We are taking \nthe last steps along a path that, for most of us, has seemed to be \nunending. Indeed, some of us may have a sense that we have gone well \nbeyond ``Yogi Berra land'' to deja vu all over again and all over again \nand all over again. I thought long and hard as I thought about what I \nwas going to say today, and how I could be of most help to you as you \nmake this momentous decision that will soon be entrusted to you. I \nmomentarily considered whether the answer to that question was simply \nto yield back my time, but I weighed that against the special pleasure \nof stretching out our last hours with you. (Laughter.)\n  Or as Ernie Banks would have said, ``It's such a nice day, let's play \ntwo.'' (Laughter.)\n  But cursed as I am with lawyerly instincts, I decided to compromise. \nI promise you as much brevity as I can manage, even if not much wit, \nwhile making a few final points that I think you need to carry with you \nas you go into your deliberations.\n  Now, you have heard the managers' vision--or at least some part of \nit--of the process we have been engaged in and the lessons we have \nlearned and what it will look like at the end of our journey. I respect \nthem as elected Representatives of their people and as worthy \nadversaries. But I believe their vision could be too dark, a vision too \nlittle attuned to the needs of the people, too little sensitive to the \nneeds of our democracy. I believe it to be a vision more focused on \nretribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends, more uncaring \nabout the future we face together.\n  Our vision, I think, is quite different, but it is not naive. We know \nthe pain the President has caused our society and his family and his \nfriends. But we know, too, how much the President has done for this \ncountry. And more importantly, we know that our primary obligation, the \nduty we all have, is to preserve that which the founders gave us, and \nwe can best fulfill that duty by carefully traveling the path that they \nlaid out for us.\n  Now, you have heard many speeches over the past few weeks about high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. As I look back on the arguments and the \ncounterarguments, it seems to me that really very little can be gained \nby repeating them; for when all is said and done, what they mean is \nthis: The framers chose stability. They made impeachment and removal \nconstitutional recourses of last resort. The question that the managers \nappear to have asked--and I am unable to tell you what they will ask \ntoday--is whether perjury or obstruction of justice in the abstract are \nimpeachable offenses. That is not the question you must answer.\n\n  Nor must you assume, as the managers appear to, that because judges \nare removed for having committed perjury, a President must be removed \nas well. That is not what the rule of law requires. The rule of law and \nevenhanded justice is something more than a simple syllogism. You must \ndecide whether on these facts arising out of these circumstances this \nPresident has\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nso endangered the state that we can no longer countenance his remaining \nin office.\n  I think in their hearts the managers do not truly disagree. Whatever \nthey have been able to glean from the historical record or more modern \nscholarship, they cannot in the end avoid the conclusion that removal \nof the President is not something that the framers took lightly. \nIndeed, two of their own witnesses in the Judiciary Committee, \nProfessor Van Alstyne and Judge Wiggins, tried to make it clear to them \nthat even if they were to find that the offenses described in the \nindependent counsel's referral as being committed, another decision had \nto be made. That decision was whether in the interest of society the \nPresident should be impeached. As Professor Van Alstyne put it, in \nwords, that I admit are unflattering to my client but nonetheless makes \nthe point: ``In my own opinion,'' he said, ``I regard what the \nPresident did, that which the Special Counsel report declared, are \ncrimes of such a low order that it would unduly flatter the President \nby submitting him to trial in the Senate, I would not bother to do \nit.''\n  I read that statement to you, not obviously because the professor and \nI are on the same side of the political divide or have the same view of \nthe President's conduct, but because it is important, I think, to \nunderstand, as I fear the managers do not, that the framers full well \nunderstood what they were doing when they drafted the impeachment \nprovision of the Constitution. They consciously chose not to make all \nmisconduct by the President a basis for removal; they chose instead \nonly that conduct that they viewed as most serious, as most dangerous, \nto our system of government.\n  As I said, I think in their hearts the managers recognize the force \nof it. But they have argued to you that perjury and obstruction really \nshould be treated as the equivalent of treason and bribery and the \ndanger that they pose to our society. They have offered on this much \nrhetoric and a few substantive arguments. And I want to look at just a \nfew of these arguments as they were advanced in the managers' opening \nand not really addressed instead.\n  First, a historical item, that Blackstone in his commentary listed \nbribery and perjury and obstruction of justice under the same heading \nof ``offenses against public justice''; second, a modern statutory \nequivalent of that argument that under the sentencing guidelines we \nactually treat perjury more severely than we do bribery; and, third--\nthis is a theme you have heard throughout these proceedings, what I \nwill call the ``system of justice argument''--that the President's \nconduct, if he is not removed, will somehow subvert enforcement of our \ncivil rights laws.\n  But all of these arguments are mere subterfuge, offered because the \nmanagers knew that to make any plausible case for removal they must \nbring these articles within the very small circle of offenses that the \nframers believed were truly dangerous to the state.\n  First, Blackstone: It is true that the commentaries rate perjury as \namong 21 offenses against public justice. Notably, however, Blackstone \nranks the 21 in order of seriousness, or, as he puts it, ``malignity.'' \nNo. 1 on the list, a most malignant offense, is a felony that I have to \nadmit is unknown to me--that of vacating records. No. 6 is returning \nfrom transportation, also an offense rarely seen in our modern society. \nNos. 10 and 12 are barratry, maintenance and champerty, especially dear \nto me because they involve my profession, but rarely viewed these days, \nI think you will agree. And, at No. 15 is perjury.\n\n  If, as Madison told us, Blackstone was in the hands of every man, \nwhat does that tell us about why the framers chose treason and bribery \nand other high crimes and misdemeanors as the grounds of impeachment? \nIt tells us that they fully understood that comparative gravity of \noffenses against public justice, and, nonetheless, chose only those \nthat truly pose that danger to the state--treason, for obvious reasons, \nand bribery because to them the risk that the executive would sell \nhimself to a foreign country, for example, was much more than mere \nspeculation. And then other high crimes of similar severity.\n  As to the lesson to be learned from the more modern day, the \nsentencing guidelines, Manager McCollum argued to you a few weeks ago \nthat those to whom you have given the responsibility to assess the \ncomparative severity of crimes have concluded that perjury is at least \nas serious a crime as bribery. That decision, he told you, is evidenced \nby the commission's decision to assign perjury an offense level of 12, \nor approximately 1 year in prison, and to bribery an offense level \nslightly below that. But even to the extent that such an argument were \nto be weighed in the constitutional balance, Manager McCollum was \nsimply not being candid with you, for he failed to explain that under \nthese same guidelines a bribe of, let's say, $75,000 taken by an \nelected official, or a judge for that matter, automatically carries an \noffense level of 24, or twice that of perjury, and a prison sentence \nfour to five times longer.\n  The drafters of our guidelines, to the extent that Mr. McCollum asked \nyou to look at them, full well understand the special gravity of bribes \ntaken by the country's leaders, and to distinguish that offense from \nthe offenses, even at best, that are before you now.\n  Lastly is this system of justice argument--the notion that somehow \nPresident Clinton has undermined our civil rights laws. Well, whatever \nI might say could not match the eloquence of my colleague, Ms. Mills, \nand, therefore, I will not attempt fate by venturing further into that \nterritory.\n  I really do not want to become further immersed in the minutia here. \nOn this. I do agree with the managers. We cannot lose sight of the \nconstitutional forest for some of the analytical trees.\n  There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one \nthat is a question of fact, and of law and constitutional theory. Would \nit put at risk the liberty of the people to retain the President in \noffice? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it \nwould not, that those liberties are safely in his hands, then you must \nvote to acquit.\n  Each of you has a sense of this in your mind and your heart better \nthan anything I can convey, or I suspect anything better than my \ncolleagues could convey to you. And I will not undertake to instruct \nyou further on this issue.\n  Just as we ultimately leave that question in your hands, we leave to \nthe conscience of each Member the question of what standard of proof \nyou apply. Despite Congressman Buyer's exhortation to the contrary, \nthis body has never decided for any of you what standard is appropriate \nor what standard is inappropriate. Each Senator is left to his or her \nown best judgment.\n  I suggested to you when I last spoke to you that I believe you must \napply a standard sufficiently stringent to enable you to make this most \nimportant decision with certainty and in a manner that will ensure that \nthe American people understand that it has been made with that \ncertainty.\n  This is not an issue as to which we as a people and we as a Republic \ncan be in doubt.\n  Let me move to the articles. Just as you have listened patiently to \nour debate about the meaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' you \nhave, as well, heard seemingly endless discourse about the specific \ndetails of the various matters that the managers allege constitute \ngrounds for removal. I will strive, therefore, not to be unduly \nrepetitive more than is at least absolutely necessary.\n  My colleagues, last Saturday and in their earlier presentations, have \ndone my work for me, but I want to focus for just a little while on \nthose aspects of the managers' presentation that merit your special \nattention or those that have been particularly elucidated or, for that \nmatter, beclouded by the testimony you heard and watched on Saturday.\n  As we start this discussion, let me offer you a phrase that I hope \nyou will remember as I move through the articles with you. That phrase \nis ``moving targets and empty pots.'' ``Moving targets,'' ever-shifting \ntheories, each one advanced to replace the last as it has fallen, \nfallen victim to the facts. ``Empty pots,'' attractive containers, but \nwhen you take the lid off you find nothing to sustain them.\n  Now, I used the term, ``empty vessels,'' in my opening presentation, \nbut it since struck me that that was much too flattering and might even \nsuggest that they had the capacity to float, which they don't.\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\n  Article I, the first moving target. Now, as we have said repeatedly, \nwe have been more than a little puzzled as to the exact nature of the \ncharges advanced by the managers under the rubric of article I, and our \npuzzlement has only increased, I must tell you, since this trial began.\n  We have argued, I think with indisputable force, that both articles \nare so deficient that they would not survive a motion to dismiss in any \ncourt in the land. Now, we are not insensitive to the claim that we are \nadvancing some lawyer's argument, and we are seeking some technical \nescape, but I urge you not to treat this issue so lightly. As you look \nto article I, for example, ask yourselves whether you can at this late \nmoment in the trial identify for yourselves with any remote sense of \ncertainty the statements that the managers claim were perjurious.\n  I suspect you will hear a lot about that in the 2 hours following my \npresentation, but I will try to look ahead just a bit.\n  Ask yourselves whether you are comfortable in this gravest of \nproceedings that when you retire to your deliberations you could ever \nknow that the constitutionally required two-thirds vote is present on \nany one charge.\n  Now, we have been making this argument for some time and with some \nfrequency, and so you would think that at least once the trial began \nthe managers would have fixed on some definable set of charges. But, \nno. Indeed, it struck me even earlier this afternoon that when Manager \nSensenbrenner rose to speak to you, he was prepared to give you four \nexamples of perjury. We have heard a lot of examples. We haven't heard \nmuch certainty.\n  Now, just to give you an example of how rapidly the target can move, \nyou will recall that in describing the incidents of perjury allegedly \ncommitted by the President, the managers made much of the preliminary \nstatement he read to the grand jury, including the use of the words \n``occasionally,'' and ``on certain occasions'' to describe the \nfrequency of certain conduct and made the general allegation that the \nstatement was itself part of a scheme to deceive the grand jury.\n  Yet, strangely, when Mr. Manager Rogan was asked about these very \ncharges as late as January 20, he quite clearly abandoned them.\n  I direct your attention to the exhibits before you and to the charts. \nAppearing on television on January 20, with Chris Matthews, this is \nwhat transpired:\n       MATTHEWS. . . . now defend these--these elements--one, that \n     the president lied when he said he had had these \n     relationships with her on certain occasions. Is that the \n     language?\n       Rep. ROGAN. That is the . . .\n       MATTHEWS. And--and why is that perjurious--perjurious?\n       Rep. ROGAN. In fact, I'm not--I don't think it's \n     necessarily perjurious. That is--that's one little piece of \n     this answer that he gave at the grand jury. . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       MATTHEWS. Well, another time he used a phrase with regard \n     to this ridiculous thing called phone sex, he referred to it \n     as occasionally or on occasion. Why do you add them in as \n     part of the perjury indictment?\n       Rep. ROGAN. That's not added in as part of the perjury \n     indictment in Article I. I simply raised that issue when I \n     was addressing the Senate.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       MATTHEWS. You better get to those senators because I think \n     they made the mistake I did of thinking that was one of the \n     elements in the perjury charge.\n\n  And similarly over here, although I have reversed the order a bit:\n\n       MATTHEWS. . . . Go through what you think are the main \n     elements in your perjury indictment of the president, \n     impeachment. . . .\n       Rep. ROGAN. One of the things they were focusing on is a \n     point, I think, I made last week when I was presenting the \n     case for perjury dealing with that preliminary statement that \n     the president read that just really gave the grand jury a \n     misperception of what the president's relationship was with \n     Monica Lewinsky. Now I never said that was the basis for the \n     perjury charge. In fact, that's not even one of the four \n     areas that's alleged, but they're trying to pick these little \n     dots out of the matrix and try to hang their hat on that. . . \n     .\n\n  I have to tell you, as did Mr. Matthews, I made the same mistake. I \nheard Manager Rogan say:\n\n       This prepared statement he read to the grand jury on August \n     17th, 1998, was the linchpin in his plan to ``win.''\n\n  I heard him say:\n\n       It is obvious that the reference in the President's \n     prepared statement to the grand jury that this relationship \n     began in 1996 was intentionally false.\n\n  I heard him say:\n\n       The President's statement was intentionally misleading when \n     he described being alone with Ms. Lewinsky only on certain \n     occasions.\n\n  And I heard him say:\n\n       The President's statement was intentionally misleading when \n     he described his telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky \n     as occasional.\n\n  That is what I heard when Manager Rogan spoke to you a few weeks ago.\n  Now, I know it is unusual to be given a bill of particulars on \ntelevision, but maybe that is part of the modern litigation age.\n  And so as to article I's charge, now that this is off the books, that \nthe President perjured himself concerning his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky, we are once again left with the claim that he lied about \ntouching, about his denial that he engaged in conduct that fell within \nhis subjective understanding of the definition used in the Jones \ndeposition--this in the course of testimony, Members of the Senate, in \nwhich the President had already made the single most devastating \nadmission that any of us can conceive of. It defies common sense. And \nas any experienced prosecutor--and five experienced prosecutors said \nthis to the Judiciary Committee--will tell you, it defies real world \nexperience to charge anyone, President or not, with perjury on the \ngrounds that you disbelieve his testimony about his own subjective \nbelief in the definition of a term used in a civil deposition.\n  Nothing in the evidentiary record has changed since the OIC referred \nthis matter to the House 6 months ago. Indeed, it is impossible to \nconceive what could change in the evidentiary record. And the managers \nhave offered this charge and persist in it for reasons not entirely \nclear to me, but some blind faith that they must go forward, facts or \nno.\n  Now, there are three other elements of article I. First, the \nallegation that the President lied when he claimed he did not perjure \nhimself in the Jones deposition. The President, of course, made no such \nrepresentation in the grand jury.\n  And the managers cannot, no matter how they try, resurrect the \ncharges of the article, then, article II, that was so clearly rejected \nby the House of Representatives. Yet, if you listen to their \npresentations over the past weeks, it becomes evident that, whether \nintentionally or unintentionally, they themselves have come to the \npoint where the President's testimony on January 17 in the Jones \ndeposition and August 17 in the grand jury are treated as though they \nwere one and the same.\n  Now, just a few minutes ago you heard Manager Gekas talk to you about \nperjury, and probably 90 percent of what he talked to you about was \nperjury in the Jones case--in the Jones case. It doesn't exist anymore. \nThe House of Representatives determined that that was not an \nimpeachable offense. It appears to make no difference, though, that the \nHouse rejected this charge, for the managers do continue to dwell on it \nas though somehow they could show the House from which they came that \nthey made a mistake.\n  Only last Saturday, Manager Graham could be heard decrying the \nPresident's claim that he had never been alone with Monica Lewinsky, \nsomething that comes not out of the grand jury but out of the Jones \ndeposition, at the same time he was taking him to task for his \ndisquisition on the word ``is,'' something that is in the grand jury \nbut is entirely irrelevant to these perjury charges. You could even see \nit in their videotape presentation last Saturday when snippets from \nJanuary 17, then August 17, were played without any definition and \nwithout any sense that there was any distinction between the two \nevents.\n  There is literally nothing in the President's grand jury testimony \nthat purports to adopt wholesale his testimony in the Jones deposition. \nIf anything, it is evident that he is explaining at length and \nclarifying and adding to his deposition testimony. Indeed, even if the \noriginal article II had survived, the President's belief that he had \n``worked through the minefield of the Jones deposition without \nviolating the law''--which is a quote from his grand jury testimony--\ncould not allow\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nthe managers, somehow, to establish that that statement was \nindependently perjurious, and they surely cannot do so now that the \noriginal article II has disappeared.\n  Now, as to the second and third remaining elements of article I, that \nthe President lied about Mr. Bennett's statement to Judge Wright at the \ntime of the Jones deposition, and that he lied about his own statements \nto his staff, I will deal with them in my discussion of the obstruction \ncharges in article II. Suffice it to say that nothing in the record as \nit came to you in January could support conviction on article I, and \nnothing added to the record since then has changed that result.\n  Let me move to article II. Manager Hutchinson told you in his \noriginal presentation that article II rested on--his words --``seven \npillars of obstruction.'' I had suggested in my opening statement of a \nfew weeks ago that it would be more accurate to call them seven \nshifting sand castles of speculation, but Manager Hutchinson has not \nproved willing to accept my description and so I will accept his. Let's \nremove one pillar right at the start.\n  Article II charges that the President engaged in a scheme to obstruct \nthe Jones case--the Jones case--and alleges as one element of this \nscheme that in the days following January 21 the President lied to his \nstaff about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, conduct that could not \npossibly have had anything to do with the Jones litigation.\n  I will get to the merits of that charge standing alone in a little \nwhile, but I bring up the more--forgive me--technical argument here, to \nhighlight once more the extent to which the House simply ignored the \nmost basic legal principles in bringing these charges to you. I have \nyet to hear from the managers a single plausible explanation for the \ninclusion of this charge as part of a scheme to obstruct the Jones \nlitigation, and I can think of none. I am sure that in the 120 minutes \nremaining to them, some portion of that time will be spent explaining \njust this point. And, so, one pillar gone; a slight list observed.\n  Next: Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit and the first of the empty pots. The \nmanagers charge that the President corruptly encouraged a witness to \nexecute a sworn affidavit that he knew to be perjurious, false, and \nmisleading, and similarly encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie if she were \never called as a witness. In my opening statement, and in Mr. Kendall's \nmore detailed discussion, we made two points: First, that Ms. Lewinsky \nhad repeatedly denied that she had ever been asked or encouraged to \nlie; and, second, that there was simply no direct or circumstantial \nevidence that the President had ever done such a thing.\n  Now, it is not in dispute that the President called Ms. Lewinsky in \nthe early morning of December 17 to tell her about the death of Betty \nCurrie's brother, and in the same call that he told her that she was \nnow listed on the Jones witness list. The managers have from the \nbeginning relied on one fact and on one baseless hypothesis stemming \nfrom this call which, in the managers' minds, was the beginning and the \nmiddle and the end of the scheme to encourage the filing of a false \naffidavit. There is literally no other event or statement on which they \ncan rely.\n  The one fact to which the managers point is Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nthat the President said that if she were actually subpoenaed, she \npossibly could file an affidavit to avoid having to testify, and at \nsome point in the call mentioned one of the so-called cover stories \nthat they had used when she was still working at the White House--that \nis, bringing papers to him. And it is on this shaky foundation, a very \nslim pillar indeed, that the managers build the hypothesis.\n  In the face of the seemingly insurmountable hurdle of Ms. Lewinsky's \nrepeated denials that anyone ever asked or encouraged her to lie, the \nmanagers have persisted in arguing, and continue to do so, that the \nPresident did somehow encourage her to lie, even if she didn't know it. \nNow you have heard that theme sounded really for the first time on \nSaturday, and then a little bit today--even if she didn't know it, \nbecause both really understood that any affidavit Ms. Lewinsky would \nfile would have to be false if it were to result in her avoiding her \ndeposition. But neither the fact on which they rely nor their \nhypothesis was of much help to the managers before Ms. Lewinsky's \ndeposition and neither, surely, has any force after her deposition.\n  After you saw Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, there can be nothing left of \nwhat was, at best, only conjecture. Even before her deposition, Ms. \nLewinsky had testified, as had the President in the grand jury, that \ngiven the claims being made in the Jones case, a truthful albeit \nlimited affidavit might--might--establish that Ms. Lewinsky had nothing \nrelevant to offer in the way of testimony in the Jones case.\n  Faced with this record, the managers asked you to authorize Ms. \nLewinsky's deposition, representing that she would--and I quote, and \nthis is from the managers' proffer--``rebut the following inferences \ndrawn by White House counsel on key issues, among others that President \nClinton did not encourage Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit and \nthat President Clinton did not have an understanding with Ms. Lewinsky \nthat the two would lie under oath.''\n  Unhappily for the managers--and perhaps their unhappiness was best \nreflected in the tone of Manager Bryant's discussion on this subject--\nMs. Lewinsky's testimony, as you saw yourself on Saturday, did just the \nopposite.\n  In an extended colloquy with Mr. Manager Bryant on the subject of the \naffidavit, Ms. Lewinsky made clear, beyond any doubt, first, that the \nPresident had never discussed the contents of the affidavit with her; \nsecond, that there was no connection between the suggestion that she \nmight file an affidavit and the reference to any cover story; third, \nthat she believed it possible to file a truthful affidavit.\n  You saw much of this portion of Ms. Lewinsky's deposition on \nSaturday, and I am not going to impose too much on your patience, but I \ndo want to play just a very few segments of that videotape.\n  First, two segments dealing with the content of the affidavit.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Are you, uh--strike that. Did he make any representation \n     to you about what you could say in that affidavit or--\n       A No.\n       Q What did you understand you would be saying in that \n     affidavit to avoid testifying?\n       A Uh, I believe I've testified to this in the grand jury. \n     To the best of my recollection, it was, uh--to my mind came--\n     it was a range of things. I mean, it could either be, uh, \n     something innocuous or could go as far as having to deny the \n     relationship. Not being a lawyer nor having gone to law \n     school, I thought it could be anything.\n       Q Did he at that point suggest one version or the other \n     version?\n       A No. I didn't even mention that, so there, there wasn't a \n     further discussion--there was no discussion of what would be \n     in an affidavit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has \n     indicated that he thought he had--might have had a way that \n     he could have you--get you to file a--basically a true \n     affidavit, but yet still skirt these issues enough that you \n     wouldn't be called as a witness.\n       Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?\n       A He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at \n     all, ever.\n\n  Next, a couple of brief segments on the issue of the cover stories.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Well, based on prior relations with the President, the \n     concocted stories and those things like that, did this come \n     to mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come \n     to your mind about these stories--the cover stories?\n       A Not in connection with the--not in connection with the \n     affidavit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of--I \n     would draw your attention to the cover stories. I have \n     alluded to that earlier, but, uh, did you talk about cover \n     story that night?\n       A Yes, sir.\n       Q And what was said?\n       A Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something--you \n     can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing me \n     papers.\n       Q I think you've testified that you're sure he said that \n     that night. You are sure he said that that night?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?\n       A I don't believe so, no.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I think your \n     closing comments was that no\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n     one ever asked you to lie, but yet in that very conversation \n     of December the 17th, 1997 when the President told you that \n     you were on the witness list, he also suggested that you \n     could sign an affidavit and use misleading cover stories. \n     Isn't that correct?\n       A Uh--well, I--I guess in my mind, I separate necessarily \n     signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories. So, \n     does--\n       Q Well, those two--\n       A Those three events occurred, but they don't--they weren't \n     linked for me.\n\n  And third, a brief segment on the supposed falsity of any affidavit \nthat might be filed.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could \n     file an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of \n     filing a false affidavit with the court?\n       A I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it \n     would have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't--I \n     don't remember having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I \n     would remember something like that, and I don't, but--\n\n  And last, if we might, a brief segment on the question of whose best \ninterests were being served.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q But you didn't file the affidavit for your best interest, \n     did you?\n       A Uh, actually, I did.\n       Q To avoid testifying.\n       A Yes.\n\n  Brief, put pointed, I think, and I am sure you remember them from \nSaturday, and I am sure you will take those excerpts with you as you \nmove into your deliberations.\n  There was another issue that surfaced early on, although perhaps it \nhas dissipated, and that is whether the President ever saw a draft of \nMs. Lewinsky's affidavit, something that the managers alleged early on \nbut, indeed, as we now know from that testimony, not only did nobody \never see a draft of the affidavit, the President and Ms. Lewinsky never \neven discussed the content of her affidavit. ``Not ever,'' as she put \nit, either on December 17 or on January 5 or on any other date. \nAccording to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her he didn't need to see \na draft because he had seen other affidavits.\n  Early on, Manager McCollum speculated for you--speculated for you--\nthat when the President told Ms. Lewinsky that he didn't need to see \nher affidavit because he had seen other affidavits, he really must have \nmeant that he had seen previous drafts of hers, and this is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I doubt seriously the President was talking about 15 other \n     affidavits of somebody else and didn't like looking at \n     affidavits anymore. I suspect, and I would suggest to you, \n     that he was talking about 15 other drafts of this proposed \n     affidavit, since it had been around the horn a lot of rounds.\n\n  That is what Manager McCollum told you. Now we know that those drafts \ndidn't exist. They never existed. How do we know? Somewhat belatedly, \nthe managers got around to telling us that. In describing the testimony \nthey would expect to receive from Ms. Lewinsky when they moved for the \nright to take her deposition, they wrote in their motion:\n\n       That same day, January 5, she called President Clinton to \n     ask if the President would like to review her affidavit \n     before it was signed. He declined, saying he had already seen \n     about 15 others. She understood that to mean that he had seen \n     15 other affidavits rather than 15 prior drafts of her \n     affidavit (which did not exist).\n\n  In sum, one, the only reference to an affidavit in the December 17 \ncall was the suggestion of the President that filing one might possibly \nenable Ms. Lewinsky to avoid being deposed, itself an entirely \nlegitimate and proper suggestion.\n  Two, the President and Ms. Lewinsky never discussed the content of \nher affidavit on or after December 17.\n  Three, the President never saw or read any draft of the affidavit \nbefore it was signed.\n  Four, the President believed that she could file a true affidavit.\n  Five, Ms. Lewinsky believed that she could file a true affidavit.\n  Six, there is not one single document or piece of testimony that \nsuggests that the President encouraged her to file a false affidavit.\n  If there is no proof the President encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a \nfalse affidavit, surely there must be some proof on the other charge \nthat encouraged her to give perjurious testimony if she were ever \ncalled to testify. Well, there isn't.\n\n  Let's begin by noting something that should help you assess the \nPresident's actions during this period--both the charge that he \nencouraged the filing of a false affidavit and the charge that he \nencouraged Ms. Lewinsky to testify falsely.\n  The conversation that the managers allege gave rise to both offenses \nis that call of the early morning of December 17. The managers suggest \nthat the President, in essence, used the subterfuge of a call to inform \nMs. Lewinsky about the death of Ms. Currie's brother to discuss her \nstatus as a witness in the Jones case. Subterfuge? Come on. A tragedy \nhad befallen a woman who was Ms. Lewinsky's friend and the President's \nsecretary.\n  But let's put this in the managers' own context. On December 6, the \nPresident learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the Jones witness list. \nAccording to the managers, that was a source of grave concern and \nspurred intensified efforts to find her a job--efforts that were still \nfurther intensified when, on December 11, Judge Wright issued her order \nallowing lawyers to inquire into the President's relationships with \nother women. Yet, I have not heard any explanation as to why the \nPresident, now theoretically so distraught that he was urging Mr. \nJordan to keep Ms. Lewinsky happy by finding her a job, as Manager \nHutchinson would have it, waited until December 17--11 days after he \nlearned Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list and 6 days after the \nsupposedly critical events of December 11--to call and launch his \nscheme to suborn perjury.\n  Now, as to the charge of subornation, the managers do concede, as \nthey must, that the President and Ms. Lewinsky did not even discuss her \ndeposition on the 17th, logically, I suppose, since she wasn't actually \nsubpoenaed until 2 days later.\n  Now, one might think that this would dispose of the matter, since \nthey do not identify a single other moment in time when there was any \ndiscussion of Ms. Lewinsky's potential testimony. But once again, \nhaving lifted the lid and seen that their pot was empty, they would ask \nyou to find that the same signal that we now know did not encourage the \nfiling of an affidavit was a signal to Ms. Lewinsky to lie if she was \never called to testify. But of course we have long known that there was \nno such signal. And the grand jury--as was so often the case, one of \nthe jurors took it upon him or herself to ask that which the \nindependent counsel chose not to. And you have this before you. And you \nhave seen it before.\n\n       A JUROR: It is possible that you also had these discussions \n     [about denying the relationship] after you learned that you \n     were a witness in the Paula Jones case?\n       [MS. LEWINSKY]: I don't believe so. No.\n       A JUROR: Can you exclude that possibility?\n       [MS. LEWINSKY]: I pretty much can. I really don't remember \n     it. I mean, it would be very surprising for me to be \n     confronted with something that would show me different, but \n     I--it was 2:30 in the--I mean, the conversation I'm thinking \n     of mainly would have been December 17th, which was--\n       A JUROR: The telephone call.\n       [MS. LEWINSKY]: Right. And it was--you know, 2:00, 2:30 in \n     the morning. I remember the gist of it and I--I really don't \n     think so.\n       A JUROR: Thank you.\n\n  But all of this is not enough to dissuade the managers.\n  Now that they know that the only two participants in the relevant \nconversation denied that there was any discussion of either the \naffidavit or the testimony, they have created still another theory. As \nManager Bryant told you last week--and in essence it was repeated \ntoday--``I don't care what was in Ms. Lewinsky's mind.''\n  Well, that is quite extraordinary. The only witness, the supposed \nvictim of the obstruction, the person whose testimony is being \ninfluenced, says that it didn't happen. And the managers nonetheless \nwant you to conclude, I assume, that some subliminal message was being \nconveyed that resulted in the filing of a false affidavit without the \naffiant knowing that she was being controlled by some unseen and \nunheard force. I won't comment further. Two more pillars lie in the \ndust.\n  Next, the gifts. On this charge, the record is largely, but in \ncritical respects not entirely, as the record has been from the \nbeginning. Here is what it shows.\n  On the morning of December 28, the President gave Ms. Lewinsky \nChristmas presents in token of her impending departure for New York. \nMs. Lewinsky testified that she raised the subject of her subpoena and \nsaid something about getting the gifts out of her apartment, to which \nshe herself has now told you\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nthe President either made no response or said something like, ``Let me \nthink about it.''\n  Betty Currie testified consistently that Ms. Lewinsky called her to \nask her to pick up a box and hold them for her. Ms. Lewinsky has \ntestified equally consistently, and testified again in her deposition, \nthat it was her recollection that Ms. Currie called her and said that \nshe understood she ``had something for her'' or perhaps even the \nPresident said, ``You have something for me.'' The President denies \nthat he ever spoke to Betty Currie about picking up gifts from Monica \nLewinsky. Betty Currie denies that the President ever asked her to pick \nup gifts from Monica Lewinsky.\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky has stated on three occasions before her most \nrecent deposition that Ms. Currie picked up the gifts at 2 o'clock in \nthe afternoon on the 28th. Having been shown the infamous 3:32 cell \nphone call, which had previously been trumpeted by the managers as \nabsolute proof that it was Ms. Currie who called Ms. Lewinsky, who \ninitiated the process, Ms. Lewinsky testified on Monday that Ms. Currie \ncame to pick up the gifts sometime during the afternoon and that there \nhad been other calls earlier in the day.\n  But we learned at least a couple of interesting new things from Ms. \nLewinsky on this subject.\n  First, when she received her subpoena on December 19, 9 days --9 \ndays--before she spoke to the President about them, Ms. Lewinsky was \nfrightened at the prospect that the Jones lawyers would search her \napartment, and she began to think about concealing the gifts that she \ncared most about that would suggest some special relationship with the \nPresident. And as she told you, she herself decided then that she would \nturn over only what she described as the most innocuous gifts, and it \nwas those gifts that she took with her to see her lawyer, Mr. Carter, \non December 22.\n  Thus, when she arrived to pick up her Christmas gifts from the \nPresident on December 28, she had already decided that she would not \nturn over all the gifts called for by the subpoena and had already \nsegregated out the ones she intended to withhold. But she didn't tell \nthe President about that. Instead, as she testified, she broached the \nquestion of what to do with the gifts and the possibility of giving \nthem to Betty Currie, again without describing what had already \noccurred, to which the President either made no reply or said something \nlike, ``I'll think about it.''\n  This testimony sheds light on one of the issues that has troubled \neveryone who has tried to make sense out of what happened on that day. \nWhy would the President, if he were really worried about Ms. Lewinsky's \nturning over gifts pursuant to the subpoena, give her more gifts? From \nour perspective, the answer has always been an easy one. He wouldn't \nhave been concerned. He's testified that he's not concerned about \ngifts, that he gives them all the time to all sorts of people, and he \nwasn't worried about it.\n  Now, we know that from Ms. Lewinsky's perspective, as she explained \nin her deposition, it also made no difference that the President was \ngiving her additional gifts, because she had already decided, having \nhad the subpoena in hand for 9 days, that she would not turn them over.\n  Now, a second ray of light also shines on two aspects of the \nmanagers' case from Ms. Lewinsky's deposition.\n  You may remember that as part of article I in their trial brief, the \nmanagers allege that the President lied to the grand jury--this is one \nof the never-ending list of possible perjuries--that he recalled saying \nto Ms. Lewinsky on December 28 that she would have to ``turn over \nwhatever she had'' when she raised the gift issue with him.\n  Well, the managers sought to obtain from Ms. Lewinsky testimony that \nwould support that charge of perjury as well as the concealment charge \nunder article II, but she turned that world upside down on both the \nperjury charge and the obstruction charge.\n\n  When asked whether the President had ever said to her, ``You will \nhave to give them whatever you have,'' or something like that, Ms. \nLewinsky testified that FBI Agent Fallon of the OIC had interviewed her \nafter the President's grand jury testimony, after they already knew \nwhat the President had said under oath, and asked her whether she \nrecalled the President saying anything like that to her. I am sure \nsomewhat to the surprise of Manager Bryant, she testified that she told \nAgent Fallon, ``That sounds familiar.''\n  Now aside from the not so minor point that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \ncorroborates the President's recollection of his response and \nundermines the charge in both article I and article II, a couple of \nother things are worth noting. As my colleague, Ms. Seligman, pointed \nout to you on Saturday, this was the first time after all Ms. \nLewinsky's recorded versions of the events of December 28, that we had \never heard that the President's version sounded familiar to her. And \nsecond, there is not a single piece of paper--at least that we are \naware of--in the entire universe turned over by the independent \ncounsel, by the House, and thence to us that reflects the FBI's \ninterview of Ms. Lewinsky. If she hadn't been honest enough to tell \nManager Bryant about it, we and you would never have known.\n  Senators, what else is there in the vaults of the independent counsel \nor in the memory of his agents that we don't know about?\n  Another pillar down.\n  The job search. It may have become tiresome to hear it, but any \ndiscussion of the job search must begin with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \noft repeated that no one promised her a job to influence her testimony. \nRemember my two themes: Moving targets, empty pots. They come together \nhere. What the managers have presented to you in a series of different \nspeculative theories, as each one is shown to be what it is, they move \non to the next in the hope they will find one, someday, that actually \nhas a connection to reality. But they cannot find that elusive theory; \nfor the stubborn facts will not budge, nor will the stubborn denials by \nevery participant in their mythical plot.\n  Now we know that Monica Lewinsky's job search began in the summer of \n1997, well in advance of her being involved in the Jones case. In \nOctober, she interviewed with U.N. Ambassador Richardson, was offered a \njob. She had her first meeting with Mr. Jordan early in November, well \nbefore she appeared in the Jones case. The next contact was actually \nbefore Thanksgiving when she made an effort to set up another meeting \nwith Mr. Jordan and was told to call back after the holiday. She did, \non December 8, and set up a meeting on December 11--again, before \neither she or Mr. Jordan knew that she was involved in the Jones case.\n  Now, on that date of December 11 which we have heard so much about, \nMr. Jordan did open doors for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, but there was \nno inappropriate pressure. At American Express and Young and Rubicam \nshe failed on her own, and at Revlon she succeeded on her own. As Mr. \nJordan told the grand jury when asked whether there was any connection \nbetween his assistance to her and the Jones case, his answer was \n``unequivocally, indubitably no.''\n  In search of some evidence that Mr. Jordan's efforts were, indeed, \ntriggering Ms. Lewinsky's status as a witness and therefore \ninappropriate, the managers focused on his January 8 call to Mr. \nPerelman, the CEO of MacAndrews & Forbes, admittedly a date known to \nMs. Lewinsky, to Mr. Jordan, and to the President. Ms. Lewinsky had \nreported that her original interview had not gone well, although we \nknow it actually had, and that her resume had already been sent over \nfrom MacAndrews & Forbes to Revlon where she ultimately was offered a \njob.\n\n  Mr. Jordan was candid stating he went to the top because he wanted to \nget action if action could be had, but the record is clear that the \nwoman involved at Revlon who interviewed Ms. Lewinsky had already made \na decision to hire her. No one put any pressure on her. There was no \nspecial urgency. There was no fix. In fact, if you want it known what \nhappens when Mr. Jordan calls the CEO of a company to get action, look \nat his call to the CEO of Young and Rubicam: No job; no job. They made \nan independent decision whether or not to hire Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Now, other than the managers, there are only two people, as far as I \ncan tell, who ever tried to create a link between the job search and \nthe affidavit: Linda\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nTripp and Kenneth Starr. No one--not Ms. Lewinsky, not Mr. Jordan, not \nthe President, no one--ever said anything to so much as suggest the \nexistence of such a linkage, and the managers can find no proof; which \nis not to say they didn't try.\n  Manager Hutchinson, you will recall, originally asked you to look at \nthe events of January 5 when he said Ms. Lewinsky had met with her \nattorney, Mr. Carter, and then, according to the managers' account, Mr. \nCarter began drafting the affidavit and Ms. Lewinsky was so concerned \nthat she called the President and he returned her call. The problem \nwith that version, as my colleague, Mr. Kendall, showed you, was the \naffidavit wasn't drafted until January 6. Mr. Carter has so testified.\n  Now, the managers would also have you believe that Mr. Jordan was \ninvolved in drafting the affidavit and that he was involved in the \ndeletion of language from the draft that suggested that she had been \nalone with the President. Ms. Lewinsky's and Mr. Jordan's testimony is \nessentially the same. They talked, Mr. Jordan listened--you recall him \nsaying, ``Yes, she was talking, I was doodling,''--he called Mr. \nCarter, he transmitted to Mr. Carter some of her concerns, but he made \nit very clear to Ms. Lewinsky he wasn't her lawyer. And in words that \nwill resonate forever, at least among the legal community, Mr. Jordan \nsaid, ``I don't do affidavits.'' And, of course, Mr. Carter himself \ntestified it was his idea to delete the language about being alone.\n  Now, the very best that the managers can do on this issue is to \nestablish that Ms. Lewinsky talked to Mr. Jordan in the same \nconversation about the job search and about her affidavit. But as Mr. \nJordan told you, Ms. Lewinsky was always talking about the job search, \nand he made it very clear to you that there was no linkage between the \ntwo.\n  If we can play just a very brief section of Mr. Jordan's deposition.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q In your conversation with Ms. Lewinsky prior to the \n     affidavit being signed, did you in fact talk to her about \n     both the job and her concerns about parts of the affidavit?\n       A I have never in any conversation with Ms. Lewinsky talked \n     to her about the job, on one hand, or job being interrelated \n     with the conversation about the affidavit. The affidavit was \n     over here. The job was over here.\n\n  And of course we have already dispensed with the notion to the extent \nthat the managers continue to assert that the President never discussed \nthe contents of the affidavit with Ms. Lewinsky or even ever saw a \ndraft.\n  Now, recognizing that they would never be able to show that the \ninception of the job search was linked in any way to the affidavit, the \nmanagers developed a theory which they have advanced to you that the \nPresident committed obstruction of justice when the job search \nassistance became, in their words, ``totally interconnected, \nintertwined, interrelated,'' with the filing of Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit.\n  The problem the managers have had, however, is that they have not \nbeen able to figure out when this occurred, why it occurred, or how it \noccurred. Think back on how many versions of their theory you have \nheard just in the last few weeks. First, it all started on December 11 \nwhen Judge Wright issued her order permitting Jones lawyers to take \ndepositions to prove that the President had relations with other women. \nThat was what galvanized the President and Mr. Jordan to make real \nefforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job.\n  Woops, didn't quite fit the facts.\n  Mr. Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky and made calls to prospective \nemployers before the order was issued. Let's try this. Second, well, it \nwasn't really the 11th, it was the 5th when the witness list came out. \nBut they had already told you in a trial brief quite explicitly, and in \nthe majority report of the committee to the Congress, that there was \n``no urgency.'' Those were their words; there was ``no urgency'' after \nDecember 5. I am a city boy, but that dog went back to sleep.\n  Third, as Manager Hutchinson told you on Saturday, what really \nhappened was that by December 17 the President had ``got the job search \nmoving'' and thought ``maybe she is now more receptive,'' and that is \nwhy he called Ms. Lewinsky on the 17th and told her she was on the \nwitness list.\n  Nice try. No facts.\n  Now, I don't know whether this chart, which Manager Hutchinson used, \nwas intended to speak for itself or to be elucidated by his own \ncomments, but let's look at it. ``December 5th, witness list--\nLewinsky,'' exclamation point. Her name is on it. ``December 6: \nPresident meets with attorneys on witness list.''\n  True.\n  ``December 7th: President and Jordan meet.''\n  Well, that is also true, but we know they didn't talk about Monica \nLewinsky. I am not quite sure why it is there.\n  ``December 8th: Lewinsky sets up a meeting with Jordan for the \n11th.''\n  True. At that point, she doesn't know she is on the list and Mr. \nJordan doesn't know she is on the list.\n  ``December 11th: Lewinsky job meeting with Jordan.''\n  Yes, true. But as we know, well before Judge Wright's order came out, \nthe two of them still don't know that her name is on the witness list.\n  December 17th was the calls.\n  True. They are on the list.\n  On December 19, the subpoena was served.\n  True.\n  ``December 28: President and Lewinsky meet; evidence (gifts) \nconcealed.''\n  Now, true, but I am not sure what that means in this context.\n  Last, interestingly, was breakfast at the Park Hyatt. ``More evidence \nat risk.''\n  Now, it is clear that if you string all of these events together and \nyou have a theory that will link them all together, you have made some \nprogress. There is only one problem: Other than what we know to be true \non this list, there is nothing other than surmise that links them \ntogether in any fashion that one could consider improper or certainly \nillegal. But that is, in essence, where the managers have brought us in \ntheir theorizing, for their fourth theory is that the pressure did not \nreally begin to build until Ms. Lewinsky was actually subpoenaed and \nbegan to prepare an affidavit.\n  On this theory, a call to Mr. Perelman was the final step--going \nright to the top of MacAndrews & Forbes to make absolutely sure that \nMs. Lewinsky stayed on the team. But here there are other facts to deal \nwith. For example, look what happened--or more importantly, didn't \nhappen--on December 19. On that day, Monica Lewinsky came, weeping, to \nMr. Jordan's office carrying with her the dreaded subpoena. Mr. Jordan \ncalled the President and visited with him that evening. And you will \nrecall that they talked in very candid terms to the President about \ntheir relationship. Wouldn't one think that if the President was, in \nfact, engaged in some scheme to use a job in New York to influence Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony, this would be the critical moment, that some \nimmediate steps would be taken to be absolutely sure that there was a \njob for her? But what do we find? Mr. Jordan takes no further action on \nthe job front until January 8.\n\n  Now, there was never so much as a passing reference concerning any \nconnection between the job search and the affidavit among any of the \nthree participants--any of them--because there was not one conversation \nthat anyone could conclude was designed to implement this nefarious \nscheme that the managers would have you find. So now we have an \nentirely new theory--the ``one-man conspiracy,'' a beast unknown, I \nthink, to Anglo-American jurisprudence.\n  Now, the fact that Ms. Lewinsky--this is on the managers' theory--\ndidn't know she was on the witness list until December 17, and Mr. \nJordan didn't know about it until she was subpoenaed on the 19th, and \nMr. Perelman never knew it, all are ``proof positive'' that the \nPresident himself was the ``mastermind'' pulling on unseen strings and \ninfluencing the participants in this drama, without their even knowing \nthat they were being influenced. Under this theory--the latest in a \nlong line--Ms. Lewinsky's denial that she ever discussed the contents \nof her affidavit with the President, her denial that there was any \nconnection between the job and her testimony, Mr. Jordan's denial that \nthere was ever a connection between his efforts to find her a job and \nthe affidavit, and the fact that Mr. Jordan never discussed any such \nconnection with the President, are simply evidence of the fact that \nthere must have been such a connection; that unbeknownst to Ms.\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nLewinsky, she was being corruptly encouraged to file a false affidavit. \nWith all due respect, somebody has been watching too many reruns of \n``The X-Files.''\n  Confronted with this problem, the managers now offer you one last \ntheory. With ever-increasing directness, they now accuse Mr. Jordan \nhimself of obstructing justice by urging Ms. Lewinsky to destroy her \nnotes. Seemingly, they ask you to find--even in the face of Mr. \nJordan's forceful denials--that one who would forget a breakfast at the \nPark Hyatt until reminded of it by being shown the receipt, and who \nthen admitted his recollection was refreshed and would admit that he \nremembered a discussion of the notes, must have obstructed justice \nhimself. And, of course, he must have been engaged all along with an \neffort to influence Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on behalf of the \nPresident.\n  Nonsense. Nonsense. And so this pillar returns to the dust from which \nit came.\n  Next, the events surrounding Mr. Bennett's statement to Judge Wright \nduring the Jones deposition formed the basis for two charges: First, \nthat the President obstructed justice in the Jones case; second, that \nhe committed perjury by telling the grand jury that he really wasn't \npaying attention at the critical moment.\n  Both charges depend on the managers' ability to prove that, indeed, \nthe President had been paying attention. To do that, they always rely \non the videotape of the deposition in which it can be seen that the \nPresident was looking in the direction of his lawyer while Mr. Bennett \nwas talking.\n  But 2 weeks ago, they came to you and they produced, with a modest \nflourish, a new bit of evidence--an affidavit from Mr. Barry Ward, \nclerk to Judge Wright, trumpeted, in their words, as ``lending even \ngreater credence to their crime.'' Now, in their memorandum in support \nof their request to expand the record by including Mr. Ward's \naffidavit, the managers told you the following, and this is the \nmanagers' own language:\n\n       From his seat at the conference table next to the judge, he \n     saw President Clinton listening attentively to Mr. Bennett's \n     remarks, while the exchange between Mr. Bennett and the judge \n     occurred.\n\n  Then they said:\n\n       Mr. Ward's declaration would lend even greater credence to \n     the argument that President Clinton lied on this point during \n     his grand jury testimony and obstructed justice by allowing \n     his attorney to utilize a false affidavit in order to cut off \n     a legitimate line of questioning. Mr. Ward's declaration \n     proves that Mr. Ward saw President Clinton listening \n     attentively while the exchange between Mr. Bennett and the \n     presiding judge concurred.\n  But this is what Mr. Ward's affidavit actually says. The affidavit \nwas attached to the very motion the language of which I just read to \nyou. I direct your attention only to the last sentence, because this is \nthe only one of any moment: ``From my position at the conference table, \nI observed President Clinton looking directly at Mr. Bennett while this \nstatement was being made.''\n  Search if you will for any evidence relating to whether the President \nwas looking attentively or not. There is not one iota of evidence added \nby the videotape. You were misled. Indeed, Mr. Ward said to the Legal \nTimes on February 1, 1999, ``I have no idea if he was paying attention. \nHe could have been thinking about policy initiatives, for all I know.'' \nYou were misled.\n  The record before the affidavit is the record after the affidavit. \nThe managers ask that you remove the President of the United States on \nthe basis of the videotape showing that he was looking in the direction \nof his lawyer.\n  Well, it was not much of a pillar to start with.\n  There is no dispute of the conversation of January 18 between the \nPresident and Ms. Currie. There is no dispute that President Clinton \ncalled Ms. Currie into the White House on Sunday, January 18, the day \nafter his deposition, and asked her certain questions and made certain \nstatements about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The only dispute \nis whether, in doing so, the President intended to tamper with a \nwitness. The managers contend that he was corruptly attempting to \ninfluence Ms. Currie's testimony. The President denies it.\n  Since we know that Ms. Currie was not on the Jones witness list at \nthe time of the President's deposition, or at the time of either of the \nconversations with Ms. Currie, and we know that discovery was about to \nend, the managers have argued that the President's own references to \nher in the Jones deposition constituted an invitation to the Jones \nlawyers to subpoena her. They argue that proof of that invitation can \nbe found in the witness list signed by the Jones lawyers on January 22, \nwhich listed Ms. Currie and other potential witnesses.\n  When I spoke to you on January 19, I told you that Ms. Currie had \nnever been placed on the witness list. I was wrong. Manager Hutchinson \nhas quite properly taken me to task for it. But I fear that he became \nso caught up in this information that he has lost sight of its true \nsignificance, or rather a lack thereof.\n  In order to convince you that Betty Currie was going to be called by \nthe Jones lawyer when the President spoke to her on January 18, the \nmanagers, somewhat like Diogenes, lit their lantern and sought out the \nmost reliable witness they could find, a witness whose credibility was \nbeyond question, who had no ulterior motive, no bias--Paula Jones' \nlawyer. They brought it to you in a form that they hoped would allow \nhis motive and bias to go untested.\n  Remember how the managers told you that it is important to look a \nwitness in the eye to test his demeanor. I doubt that you need to do \nthat to understand what might color Mr. Holmes' view of the world. \nLet's look at what he had to say. You have in the exhibits before you \nan unredacted witness list attached to Mr. Holmes' affidavit. I have \nput up on the easels the redacted list as it was originally used by the \nmanagers a few weeks ago because I really see no purpose in unduly \nexposing the names of the people who are on that witness list. But let \nme direct you to these words just to highlight it: ``Under Seal.''\n  You will remember that the President has been criticized for \nviolating a gag order when he spoke to his own secretary about his \ndeposition. What then do we say when the managers produce a document \nfrom a lawyer for one of the parties that is still under seal, not yet \nreleased by the court, and reveals the names of individuals who are no \npart of these proceedings? Surely the managers could have made their \npoint just as well without such a revelation.\n  Mr. Holmes states that the Jones lawyers had two reasons for putting \nMs. Currie's name on the witness list: One, because of President \nClinton's deposition testimony; and, two, because they had ``received \nwhat they considered to be reliable information that Ms. Currie was \ninstrumental in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with Mr. \nClinton and that Ms. Currie was central to the cover story Mr. Clinton \nand Ms. Lewinsky had developed to use in the event their affair was \ndiscovered.'' They don't tell us where he got this reliable \ninformation. But of course we know.\n  Let's figure out whether in fact Betty Currie really made it on the \nlist because of the President's testimony. If you look at the number of \ntimes she is mentioned in the deposition, it becomes conventional \nwisdom that the President inserted her name into his testimony so \nfrequently and so gratuitously that he did in fact invite the Jones \nlawyers to call her and, thus, must have known that she was going to be \na witness when he spoke to her on January 18. But if you look at the \ndeposition, you will find that the first time her name is mentioned, \nthe President is simply responding to a question about his earlier \nmeetings with Ms. Lewinsky and stated that Betty was present.\n  The lawyers for the plaintiff then asked 13 questions, give or take a \nfew, about Ms. Currie. And we know there is no secret here. They got \ntheir information from Linda Tripp. And Linda Tripp surely told them \nabout Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with Ms. Currie. It was only in \nresponse to a couple of their questions about whether letters had ever \nbeen delivered to Ms. Currie and whether she stated at some \nextraordinarily late hour that the President said, ``You'll have to ask \nher.'' He didn't invite. He did not suggest to them that they call Ms. \nCurrie. They knew whatever they needed to\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nknow about Ms. Currie to put her on their witness list.\n\n  To judge further whether Ms. Currie made it on the list because of \nthe President's invitation, or because they already knew about \nwitnesses from Ms. Tripp, let me direct your attention--if you look at \nthe exhibit in front of you rather than the redacted version here, the \nfirst listed on the witness list is No. 165. Her name does not come up \nat all in the deposition. But we know that she was in fact the subject \nof conversation surreptitiously recorded between Ms. Tripp and Ms. \nLewinsky. And note that the name of Vernon Jordan is not on the list. \nThey are the ones, the Jones lawyers are the ones, who first bring them \nup. And we know, of course, that they knew from Ms. Tripp that he was \nalready involved in this scenario.\n  Thus, neither the January 22 witness list nor Mr. Holmes' affidavit \nsupported the managers' theory. The President did not know that Ms. \nCurrie would be a witness when he spoke to her after her deposition, \nand he could not, therefore, have tampered with the witness.\n  Well beyond their statement about how they got this information, Mr. \nHolmes volunteers that they didn't get it from the Washington Post, or \nperhaps not. But it is clear that in the days after the Post article, \nwe know that some of the names on the list came from the press reports, \nwe know that Jones lawyers began tracking the newly public activities \nof the independent counsel, which was issuing its own subpoenas in the \nhours and days following the lawyers' release. And for some insight \ninto what they believe the independent counsel thought was going on, \nlook at the pleading they filed with Judge Wright on Wednesday, January \n28, to prevent the Jones lawyers from continuing to use their \ninvestigation as an aid--that is, the independent counsel's \ninvestigation--as an aid to civil discovery.\n  The pleading said, ``As recently as this afternoon, plaintiff's \ncounsel caused process to be served on Betty Currie who appeared before \nthe grand jury in Washington yesterday. Such deliberate and calculated \nshadowing of the grand jury's investigation will necessarily pierce the \nveil of grand jury secrecy.''\n  The managers have criticized us for ignoring the second conversation \nbetween the President and Ms. Currie, suggesting that I suppose it \ntakes on an even more sinister cast than the first. But there is simply \nnothing of any substance to take from this second conversation that \nadds to the events of January 18. It is clear that the conversation \noccurred on Tuesday, January 20, before the Starr investigation became \npublic. The managers disingenuously have suggested in their exhibit, \nthe one they distributed on Saturday, that this conversation occurred \nafter the Post story appeared. If you look at the exhibit that was used \non Saturday, you will see: January 20, Post story is known. Of course, \nthat's late at night. January 21, Post story was on the Internet. The \nPresident calls Betty for 20 minutes. And then sort of sneaking it in \ndown here, January 20 or 21, President coaches Currie for the second \ntime.\n\n  But the record shows this: Ms. Currie has said that the conversation \noccurred ``whenever the President was next in the White House.'' That \nis after the Sunday conversation. And that was Tuesday, the 20th, the \nday after the Martin Luther King holiday. Thus, the second conversation \nis of no greater legal significance than the first since the President \nknew no more about Ms. Currie's status as a witness on Tuesday than he \ndid on Sunday.\n  In sum, the managers have tried to convince you that the President \nknew or must have known that Betty Currie would be a witness in the \nJones case. If anything, we now know that the reason she was put on the \nJanuary 22 list, along with many others, had more to do with Linda \nTripp than anything else.\n  But putting this aside for the moment; that is, putting aside the \nquestion whether the President could have had any reason to believe \nthat Ms. Currie would be a witness, look at whether Ms. Currie herself \nbelieved that she was being corruptly influenced on January 18. In \nresponse to continuing efforts by the prosecutors to get her to admit \nthat she felt some untoward pressure from the President, she \ntestified--and you have seen this before as well:\n\n       . . . did you feel pressured when he told you those \n     statements?\n       A. None whatsoever.\n       Q. What did you think, or what was going through your mind \n     about what he was doing?\n       A. At the time I felt that he was--I want to use the word \n     shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just \n     talking.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. That was your impression, that he wanted you to say--\n     because he would end each of the statements with ``Rights?,'' \n     with a question.\n       A. I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.'' He \n     would say, ``Right?'' and I could have said, ``Wrong.''\n       Q. But he would end each of those questions with a \n     ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or \n     not true.\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?\n       A. None.\n\n  And so on a human level, a human level, we have the President, who \nhas just seen his worst nightmare come true, and who knows that he is \nabout to face a press tidal wave that will wash over him and his family \nand the country, and we have his secretary who knows of, indeed, has \nbeen a part of, his relationship with Monica Lewinsky but knows nothing \nabout the long-since ended improper aspects of that relationship--we \nhave a conversation that was the product of the emotions that were \nchurning through the President's very soul on that day. What we do not \nhave is an attempt to corruptly influence the testimony of the witness.\n  Only one pillar left. The managers ask the Senate to find that the \nPresident's conversations with Mr. Blumenthal and other aides was an \neffort to influence their testimony before the grand jury. Their \ntheory, much as was true of some of their other theories, flounders on \nshoals that they don't account for. As they would have it, in the days \nimmediately following the Lewinsky story, the President spoke with a \nfew members of his senior staff, as they would allege, knowing that \nthey would probably be grand jury witnesses and misled them about his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky, so that they would convey that \nmisinformation to the grand jury when they were called.\n  Now, just so that you can see for yourself what the President \ntestified to in the grand jury on the subject, I want to play about 3 \nor 4 minutes of that testimony for you.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. If they testified that you denied sexual relations or \n     relationship with Monica Lewinsky, or if they told us that \n     you denied that, do you have any reason to doubt them, in the \n     days after the story broke; do you have any reason to doubt \n     them?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. No. The--let me say this. It's no secret \n     to anybody that I hoped that this relationship would never \n     become public. It's a matter of fact that it had been many, \n     many months since there had been anything improper about it, \n     in terms of improper contact. I--\n       Q. Did you deny it to them or not, Mr. President?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. Let me finish. So, what--I did not want \n     to misled my friends, but I wanted find language where I \n     could say that. I also, frankly, did not want to turn any of \n     them into witnesses, because I--and, sure enough, they all \n     became witnesses.\n       Q. Well, you knew they might be----\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. And so----\n       Q.--witnesses, didn't you?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. And so I said to them things that were \n     true about this relationship. That I used--in the language I \n     used, I said, there's nothing going on between us. That was \n     true. I said, I have not had sex with her as I defined it. \n     That was true. And did I hope that I would never have to be \n     here on this day giving this testimony? Of course, But I also \n     didn't want to do anything to complicate this matter further. \n     So, I said things that were true. They may have been \n     misleading, and if they were I have to take responsibility \n     for it and I'm sorry.\n       Q. It may have been misleading, sir, and you knew though, \n     after January 21st when the Post article broke and said that \n     Judge Starr was looking into this, you knew that they might \n     be witnesses. You knew that they might be called into a grand \n     jury, didn't you?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. That's right. I think I was quite \n     careful what I said after that. I may have said something to \n     all these people to that effect, but I'll also--whenever \n     anybody asked me any details, I said, look, I don't want you \n     to be a witness or I turn you into a witness or give you \n     information that could get you in trouble. I just wouldn't \n     talk. I, by and large, didn't talk to people about this.\n       Q. If all of these people--let's leave out Mrs. Currie for \n     a minute. Vernon Jordan, Sid Blumenthal, John Podesta, Harold \n     Ickes, Erskine Bowles, Harry Thomasson, after the story \n     broke, after Judge Starr's involvement\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\n     was known on January 21st, have said that you denied a sexual \n     relationship with them. Are you denying that?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. No.\n       Q. And you've told us that you----\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. I'm just telling you what I meant by it. \n     I told you what I meant by it when they started this \n     deposition.\n       Q. You've told us now that you were being careful, but that \n     it might have been misleading. Is that correct?\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON. It might have been. Since we have seen \n     this four-year, $40-million-investigation come own to parsing \n     the definition of sex, I think it might have been. I don't \n     think at the time that I thought that's what this was going \n     to be about. In fact, if you remember the headlines at the \n     time, even you mentioned the Post story. All the headlines \n     were--and all the talking, people who talked about this, \n     including a lot who have been quite sympathetic to your \n     operation, said, well, this is not really a story about sex, \n     or this is a story about subornation of perjury and these \n     talking points, and all this other stuff. So, what I was \n     trying to do was to give them something they could--that \n     would be true, even if misleading in the context of this \n     deposition, and keep them out of trouble, and let's deal--and \n     deal with what I thought was the almost ludicrous suggestion \n     that I had urged someone to lie or tried to suborn perjury, \n     in other words.\n\n  Now, it is clear from that excerpt, I think, that in the hours and \ndays immediately following the release of the Post story, the President \nwas struggling with two competing concerns: How to give some \nexplanation to the men and women he worked with every day, and worked \nwith most closely, without putting them in a position of being grand \njury witnesses. But he was not in any sense seeking to tamper with them \nor to obstruct the grand jury's investigation.\n  Putting aside for the moment our strenuous disagreement both with the \nfactual underpinning of and the legal conclusions that flow from the \nmanagers' analysis of these events, I find it difficult to figure out \nhow it is that they believe the President intended that his statement \nto Mr. Blumenthal or his statement to Mr. Podesta would involve their \nconveying false information to the grand jury, or that he sought in \nsome fashion to send that message to the grand jury when, at the very \nmoment that those aides were first subpoenaed, he asserted executive \nprivilege to prevent them from testifying before the grand jury. For \nsomeone who wanted Mr. Blumenthal to serve, as the managers would have \nit, as his messenger of lies, that is strange behavior indeed.\n  Now, there is an issue here that I don't really want to get into at \nlength, and I, not having heard the last 2 hours of the managers' \npresentation, don't know whether they are going to get into, and that \nis Manager Graham's favorite issue, the question of whether there was \nsome scheme to smear Monica Lewinsky--early, middle, or late. Other \nthan to say that no such plan ever existed, I just want to ask the \nmanagers this. Although I must admit that for the first time in my life \nI have heard Marlene Dietrich's name used as a pejorative--what was \nManager Bryant saying about Ms. Lewinsky? That she was lying? That she \nmisled the managers? That because her testimony helped the President, \nthey were now going to attack her character and her integrity? I don't \nknow how many of you have seen ``Witness For The Prosecution,'' either \nbefore or after Mr. Bryant used that example, but ask yourselves: What \nwas he saying? What was he doing?\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I don't know whether there is a \nmarket for used pillars, but they are all lying in the dust.\n  It is difficult for me as a lawyer, as an advocate for my client, to \nspeak to this body about lofty constitutional principles without \nseeming merely to engage in empty rhetoric. But I would like to think, \nI guess, that if there were ever a forum in which I could venture into \nthat realm, be excused for doing so, could be heard without the \nintervening filter of skepticism that I fear too often lies between \nlawyer and listener, this is the time and this is the moment. Only once \nbefore in our Nation's history has any lawyer had the opportunity to \nmake a closing argument on behalf of the President of the United States \nand only once before has the Senate ever had to sit in judgment on the \nhead of the executive branch.\n  We all must cast an eye to the past, looking over our shoulders to be \nsure that we have learned the right lessons from those who have sat in \nthis Chamber before us. But we also must look to the future, to be sure \nthat we leave the right lessons to those who come after us. We hope \nthat no one will ever have need of them, but if they should, we owe \nthem not only the proper judgment for today but the proper judgment for \nall time.\n  Now, you have heard the managers tell you very early on in these \nmeetings that we have advanced a, quote, ``so what'' defense; that we \nare saying that the President's conduct is really nothing to be \nconcerned about; that we should all simply go home and ignore what he \nhas done. And that, of course, to choose a word that would have been \nfamiliar to the framers themselves, is balderdash.\n  If you want to see ``so what'' in action, look elsewhere. ``So what'' \nif the framers reserved impeachment and removal for only those offenses \nthat threaten the state? ``So what'' if the House Judiciary Committee \ndidn't quite do their constitutional job, if they took the independent \ncounsel's referral and added a few frills and then washed their hands \nof it? ``So what'' if the House approved articles that wouldn't pass \nmuster in any court in the land? ``So what'' if the managers have been \ncreating their own theories of impeachment as they go long? And ``so \nwhat,'' and ``so what,'' and ``so what?''\n  By contrast, what we offer is not ``so what,'' but this: Ask what the \nframers handed down to us as the standard for removing a President. Ask \nwhat impeachment and removal would mean to our system of government in \nyears to come. Ask what you always ask in this Chamber: What is best \nfor the country? No, the President wouldn't allow any of us to say ``so \nwhat,'' to so much as suggest that what he has done can simply be \nforgotten. He has asked for forgiveness from his family and from the \nAmerican people, and he has asked for the opportunity to earn back \ntheir trust.\n  In his opening remarks, Manager Hyde questioned whether this \nPresident can represent the interests of our country in the world. Go \nto Ireland and ask that question. Go to Israel and Gaza and ask that \nquestion. If you doubt whether he should, here at home, continue in \noffice, ask the parent whose child walks safer streets or the men and \nwomen who go off to work in the morning to good jobs.\n  We are together, I think, weavers of a constitutional fabric in which \nall of us now are clothed and generations will be clothed for millennia \nto come. We cannot leave even the smallest flaw in that fabric, for if \nwe do, one day someone will come along and pull a thread and the flaw \nwill grow and it will eat away at the fabric around it and soon the \nentire cloth will begin to unravel. We must be as close to perfect in \nwhat we do here today as women and men are capable of being. If there \nis doubt about our course, surely we must take special care, as we hold \nthe fabric of democracy in our hands, to leave it as we found it, \ntightly woven and strong.\n  Now, before today I wrote down the following: ``The rules say that \nthe managers will have the last word.'' Well, the rules today say the \nmanagers will have the last paragraphs. But that truly isn't so, \nbecause even when they are finished, theirs will not be the last voices \nyou hear. Yes, one or more of them will now rise and come to the podium \nand tell you that they have the right of it and we the wrong, that our \nsense of what the Constitution demands is not theirs and should not be \nyours. That is their privilege.\n  But as each of them does come before you for the final time, and as \nyou listen to them, I know that you will hear not their eloquence, as \ngrand as it may be; not the pointed jibes of Manager Hutchinson nor the \nstentorian tones of Manager Rogan nor the homespun homilies of Manager \nGraham nor the grave exhortations of Manager Hyde, but voices of \ngreater eloquence than any of us can muster, the voices of Madison and \nHamilton and the others who met in Philadelphia 212 years ago, and the \nvoices of the generations since, and the voices of the American people \nnow, and the voices of generations to come. These, not the voices of \nmere advocates, must be your guide.\n  It has been an honor for all of us to appear before you in these last \nweeks on behalf of the President. And now our last words to you, which \nare the\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nwords I began with: William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the \ncharges that have been brought against him. He did not commit perjury. \nHe did not commit obstruction of justice. He must not be removed from \noffice.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we take a 15-minute \nrecess.\n  There being no objection, at 4:19 p.m. the Senate recessed until 4:41 \np.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the \nChief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will be in order. The Chair recognizes \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe now we are ready to proceed \nwith the managers from the House. I understand that they do have a 2-\nhour presentation. I will look for guidance from the Chief Justice \nabout whether we should take a break for the last 45 minutes-- that \nwould be after Mr. Manager Rogan--if at all.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.\n  The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager McCollum.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the \nSenate.\n  At the outset of my closing remarks, I would like to lay the record \nstraight on a couple of matters. With all due deference to White House \ncounsel, the suggestion that Mr. Ruff made at the beginning of his \nclosing, that we were somehow being unfair to him on the timing today \nof the rebuttal, seems to me to be a little strained. ``Methinks thou \ndoth protest too much,'' was a remark I used earlier, a quote from \nShakespeare, and I think it is appropriate here, too, because if you \nrecall, we had no rebuttal at all as you normally would have in the end \nof our case, to begin with. Secondly, we thought we ought to have live \nwitnesses here. We haven't had those. The list could go on. I really \ndon't think we are being unfair.\n  Secondly, I would like to make one correction and make a clear point. \nI am sure it was not intended, but in your remarks, I believe, Mr. \nRuff, you indicated there was no history with regard to ``beyond a \nreasonable doubt'' standard. Maybe I misunderstood that, but I want the \nrecord to be clear that in the Claiborne case there was, in fact, a \nvote that took place here in the case of Judge Claiborne, 75-17, saying \nthat that standard did not apply to impeachment cases.\n  Now, having said that, I would like to move on to my own thoughts. \nNotwithstanding the clever and resourceful arguments that White House \ncounsel have made to you today, and in the past few weeks, I suspect \nthat most of you--probably more than two-thirds--believe that the \nPresident did, indeed, commit most, if not all, of the crimes he is \ncharged with under these articles of impeachment. I suspect that a \ngreat many of you share my view that these are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  But nonetheless, it is my understanding that some of you who share \nthese views are not prepared to vote to convict the President and \nremove him from office. That instead, you are of the mind at the \nmoment--subject to our persuading you otherwise --in your own debate, \nto acquit him.\n  Ultimately, the choice is yours, not ours. But a few moments I would \nlike to spend with you reviewing just a few of the facts--not many--and \nsuggesting to you what I believe we managers would believe would be \nsome very significant negative consequences of failing to remove this \nPresident.\n  Having heard all of the evidence over the past few days and weeks, \nthere should be little doubt that beginning in December 1997 William \nJefferson Clinton set out on a course of conduct designed to keep from \nthe Jones court the true nature of his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky. Once he knew he would have to testify, he knew he was going \nto lie in his deposition. And he knew he was going to have to lie, not \nonly himself but get Monica Lewinsky to lie--if he was going to be \nsuccessful--and he was going to have to get his personal secretary to \nlie about his relationship, and have his aides and others help \ncover them up if he would be successful in lying in the Jones court \ndeposition.\n\n  He did all of these things. And then he chose to lie to the grand \njury again, because if he did not, he would have not been able to \nprotect himself from the crimes he had already committed.\n  No amount of arguments by White House counsel can erase one simple \nfact: If you believe Monica Lewinsky, you cannot believe the President. \nIf you believe Monica Lewinsky, the President committed most of the \ncrimes with which he is charged in these arguments today.\n  For example, while the President did not directly tell her to lie, he \nnever advised her what to put in her affidavit, she knew from the \nDecember 17 telephone conversation with the President that he meant for \nher to lie about the relationship and file a false affidavit, and he \nwould lie as well.\n  I want to refresh your recollection. These charts we put up some time \nbefore--you have them in front of you. This is a direct quote from her. \nWe showed this on television Saturday, where she was reading from her \ngrand jury deposition and confirming, this is, indeed, what she said \nand what she--her interpretation of that affidavit, phone conversation, \ndespite everything else you heard.\n  She said:\n\n       For me, the best way to explain how I feel what happened \n     was, you know, no one asked me or encouraged me to lie, but \n     no one discouraged me either. . . .\n     . . . It wasn't as if the President called me and said, ``You \n     know, Monica you're on the witness list, this is going to be \n     really hard for us, we're going to have to tell the truth and \n     be humiliated in front of the entire world about what we've \n     done,'' which I would have fought him on probably. That was \n     different. And by him not calling me and saying that, you \n     know, I knew what that meant. . . .\n\n  ``I knew what that meant.''\n  She lied in that affidavit. The President, clearly, intended to \ninfluence her by suggesting the affidavit and all the other things that \nwent on in that conversation, and all of the circumstances that were \nthere.\n  Monica Lewinsky was equally clear in her testimony to you Saturday \nthat Betty Currie called her about the gifts, not the other way around. \nAnd surely nobody believes that Betty Currie would have called Monica \nLewinsky about the gifts on December 28 unless the President had asked \nher to do so.\n  And then the day after the President's deposition in the Jones case, \nthe President clearly committed the crimes of witness tampering and \nobstruction of justice when, in logical anticipation of Betty Currie \nbeing called as a witness, he said to Betty Currie, ``You were always \nthere when she was there, right? We were never really alone. You could \nsee and hear everything. Monica came on to me and I never touched her, \nright? She wanted to have sex with me and I can't do that.''\n  I am not going to rehash all of the evidence in this case again, but \nit is my understanding that some of you may be prepared to vote to \nconvict the President on obstruction of justice and not on perjury. I \ndon't know how you can do that. I honestly don't know how anybody can \ndo that. If you believe Sidney Blumenthal's testimony that the \nPresident told him that Monica Lewinsky came at him and made a sexual \ndemand and that he rebuffed her and that she threatened him and said \nshe would tell people they had had an affair, and that she was known as \na stalker among her peers, surely you must conclude that the President \ncommitted perjury when he told the grand jury that he told his aides, \nincluding Blumenthal, nothing but the truth, even if misleading.\n  The exact quotes, people are worried about the exact quotes. What are \nthe words?\n\n       And so I said to them things that were true about this \n     relationship . . . so, I said things that were true. They may \n     have been misleading . . . so, what I was trying to do was to \n     give them something that could--that would be true, even if \n     misleading. . . .\n\n  That was played on television in the White House presentation a few \nminutes ago. That was perjury. What he told Sidney Blumenthal was not \ntrue. It wasn't just misleading, it was not true. And he knew it was \nnot true and it was perjury in front of the grand jury.\n  If you believe the President committed the crimes of witness \ntampering and obstruction of justice when he called Betty Currie to his \noffice the\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nday after his deposition and told her, ``You were always there when she \nwas, right''--the ones I just read to you, and the other statements to \ncoach her--surely you must also conclude that the President committed \nperjury before the grand jury when he told the grand jurors his purpose \nin making these statements.\n  These are his exact words to the grand jurors:\n\n       I was trying to figure out what the facts were. I was \n     trying to remember. I was trying to remember every time I had \n     seen Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n  That is not true. He knew that was not true. That is not what he was \ndoing. No one can rationally reason that that is what he was trying to \ndo when he made the coaching statements to Ms. Currie. That was perjury \nin front of the grand jury.\n  And then we have heard a lot of talk about the civil deposition. \nNobody is trying to prove up that deposition or is lying in here today. \nNobody is trying to use that as a duplication or anything else of the \nsort. But the President said before the grand jurors:\n\n       My goal--\n\n  Talking about the Jones case deposition--\n\n     in this deposition was to be truthful . . . .\n\n  That is the lie. That is the perjury. That is as simple as the second \ncount of the perjury article is. Does anybody believe, after hearing \nall of this, that the goal of the President in the Jones deposition was \nto be truthful? He lied to the grand jury and committed perjury.\n  Last but not least, if you believe Monica Lewinsky about the acts of \na sexual nature that they engaged in, how can you not conclude the \nPresident committed perjury when he specifically denied those acts? \nThose were very explicit. Mr. Ruff suggested that maybe this is a \nsubjective question. Maybe about the interpretation of the definition \nyou might call it subjective. We are not going to go over it again \ntoday, but he used specific words that he confirmed were in that \ndefinition and said, ``I did not do those things. I did not touch those \nparts.'' Monica Lewinsky, if you believe her, testified that he did do \nthose things--many times.\n  He committed perjury when he said he didn't do those things, if you \nbelieve Monica Lewinsky. If you are going to vote to convict the \nPresident on the articles of impeachment regarding obstruction of \njustice, I urge you in the strongest way to also vote to convict him on \nthe perjury article as well. I think you would be doing a disservice \nnot to do that, and it would be sending a terrible message about \nperjury and the seriousness of it for history and to the American \npeople.\n  As you have seen in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which Mr. Ruff \ntalked about a while ago, perjury and obstruction of justice do have, \nunder the baseline guidelines, a higher amount of sentencing than \nsimple, plain ``vanilla'' bribery does. That is where they start. He is \nright, you can get enhancements for aggravating circumstances for \nbribery in certain cases, and you can get a greater sentence. But so \ncan you get a greater sentence for perjury if there was a significant \neffort to wrongfully influence the administration of justice, for \nexample; and you can get a significantly enhanced sentence for perjury \nif you committed perjury, and so on.\n  We didn't choose to bring up a litany and show all the enhancements. \nOf course, you can do that. But for the pure base, there is no question \nabout it.\n  The other significant thing that you will recall I brought up--some \nof us did--a couple of weeks ago is witness bribery. Bribing a witness \nis treated more severely under sentencing guidelines for base \nsentencing than ordinary bribery is. Clearly, all three are high crimes \nand misdemeanors.\n  What are the consequences of failing to remove this President from \noffice if you believe he committed the crimes of perjury and \nobstruction of justice? What are the consequences of failing to do \nthat? What is the downside?\n\n  First, at the very least, you will leave a precedent of doubt as to \nwhether perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors in impeaching the President. In fact, your vote to acquit \nunder these circumstances may well mean that no President in the future \nwill ever be impeached or removed for perjury or obstruction of \njustice. Is that the record that you want?\n  Second, you will be establishing the precedent that the standard for \nimpeachment and removal of a President is different from that of \nimpeaching or removing a judge or any other official while, arguably--\nalthough it never happened--a Federal judge could be removed for the \nlesser standard under the good behavior clause of the Constitution. \nSuch a removal would have to be by a separate tribunal, by a procedure \nset by statute, because under the impeachment provisions of the \nConstitution which all judges have been removed under previously, the \nsame single standard exists for removing the President as for removing \na judge. That standard is that you have to have treason, bribery, or \nother high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  So while the Constitution on its face does not make a distinction for \nremoving a President or removing a judge, if you vote to acquit, \nbelieving that the President committed perjury and obstruction of \njustice, for all times you are going to set a precedent that there is \nsuch a distinction.\n  Third, if you believe the President committed the crimes of perjury \nand obstruction of justice and that they are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, but you do not believe a President should be removed when \neconomic times are good and it is strongly against the popular will to \ndo so, by voting to acquit you will be setting a precedent for future \nimpeachment trials.\n  Can you imagine how damaging that could be to our constitutional form \nof government, to set the precedent that no President will be removed \nfrom office for high crimes and misdemeanors unless the polls show that \nthe public wants that to happen? Would our Founding Fathers have ever \nenvisioned that? Of course not. Our Constitution was structured to \navoid this very situation.\n  Fourth: Then there is what happens to the rule of law if you vote to \nacquit. What damage is done for future generations by a vote to acquit? \nWill more witnesses be inclined to commit perjury in trials? Will more \njurors decide that perjury and obstruction of justice should not be \ncrimes for which they convict? No military officer, no Cabinet \nofficial, no judge, no CEO of a major corporation, no president of a \nuniversity, no principal of a public school in this Nation would remain \nin office, no matter how popular they were, if they committed perjury \nand obstruction of justice as charged here.\n  To vote to acquit puts the President on a pedestal which says that, \nas long as he is popular, we are going to treat him differently with \nregard to keeping his job than any other person in any other position \nof public trust in the United States of America. The President is the \nCommander in Chief; he is the chief law enforcement officer; he is the \nman who appoints the Cabinet; he appoints the judges.\n  Are you going to put on the record books the precedent that all who \nserve under the President and whom he has appointed will be held to a \nhigher standard than the President? What legacy to history is this? \nWhat mischief have you wrought to our Constitution, to our system of \ngovernment, to the values and principles cherished by future \ngenerations of Americans? All this because--I guess this is the \nargument--Clinton was elected and is popular with the people? All this, \nwhen it is clear that a vote to convict would amount to nothing more \nthan the peaceful, orderly, and immediate transition of government of \nthe Presidency to the Vice President?\n\n  William Jefferson Clinton is not a king; he is our President. You \nhave the power and the duty to remove him from office for high crimes \nand misdemeanors. I implore you to muster the courage of your \nconvictions, to muster the courage the Founding Fathers believed that \nthe Senate would always have in times like these. William Jefferson \nClinton has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Convict him and \nremove him.\n  I yield to Mr. Canady.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Canady.\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Members of the Senate, during the next few minutes I would like to \naddress the constitutional issue you are\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\ncalled on to decide in this case: Are the crimes charged against the \nPresident offenses for which he may be removed from office? Are these \ncrimes high crimes and misdemeanors? Are these crimes that proceed, as \nAlexander Hamilton said, ``from the abuse or violation of some public \ntrust''?\n  The President's lawyers have argued vigorously that even if all the \ncharges against the President are true, the Constitution forbids the \nremoval of this President. They contend that this isn't even a close \ncase, that the crimes charged against the President are far removed \nfrom the constitutional category of high crimes and misdemeanors--a \ncategory of offenses they have sought to restrict narrowly to \nmisconduct causing ruinous harm to the system of government.\n  While the President's lawyers have been consistent in urging a narrow \nand restricted understanding of the impeachment and removal power, they \nhave not been--and I repeat--they have not been consistent in \ndescribing the standard used to determine if high crimes and \nmisdemeanors have been committed.\n  In their submission to the House of Representatives they stated \nunequivocally that ``the Constitution requires proof of official \nmisconduct for impeachment.'' Those are their words. I quote them \nagain. ``The Constitution requires proof of official misconduct for \nimpeachment.'' Indeed, that statement was the primary heading for their \nwhole argument on constitutional standards. And likewise, in their \ntrial memorandum submitted to the Senate, they argue that impeachment \nshould not be used to punish private misconduct.\n  Subsequently they have apparently abandoned this position, \nrecognizing that it would lead to the absurd result of maintaining in \noffice Presidents who were undoubtedly unfit to serve. They now \nbegrudgingly concede that a President is not necessarily impeached and \nremoved simply because these crimes did not involve the abuse of powers \nof his office. They have been driven to concede there are at least some \ncircumstances in which a President may be removed for crimes not \ninvolving what they call ``official misconduct.'' But, of course, they \ncontend that the circumstances in this case don't even justify \nconsideration of removal.\n  In the proceedings in the House and in their trial memorandum \nsubmitted to the Senate, the President's lawyers made much of the \nargument that tax fraud by a President of the United States would not \nbe sufficiently serious to justify impeachment and removal. I had \nmentioned this before in these proceedings. And I mention it again now \nbecause it vividly demonstrates the low standard of integrity, the \npathetically low standard of integrity that would be established for \nthe Presidency if the arguments of the President's lawyers are accepted \nby the Senate.\n  Perhaps I missed something. But I do not recall any mention of the \ntax fraud issue by the President's lawyers in the course of their \nvarious presentations to the Senate. Could it be that the President's \nlawyers have come to understand that the argument that tax fraud is not \nan impeachable offense does not strengthen their case, but on the \ncontrary highlights the weakness of their case? Tax fraud by a \nPresident, like lying under oath and obstruction of justice by a \nPresident in this case, would of course be wrong. It would be shameful, \nindefensible, unforgivable, but--this is the big ``but''--it would not \nbe impeachable, they say; not even a close case. Bad? Yes. But clearly \nnot impeachable. And why that? Why would it not be impeachable? Why is \nit clearly, unquestionably unimpeachable? This is the answer. This is \nthe heart and soul of the President's defense. Tax fraud and a host of \nundefined other crimes, like lying under oath and obstruction of \njustice in this case, are just not serious enough for impeachment and \nremoval. That is the answer. That is the defense. It is just not \nserious enough. All the grand legal argument, all the fine legal \ndistinctions come down to the simple, this marvelously simple \nproposition. It is just not serious enough.\n  Let me refer you once again to a statement from the 1974 Report on \nConstitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment prepared by the \nstaff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry. I want to cite a portion of \nthat report that I have previously cited to you. The President's \nlawyers have also cited this very same statement in both their trial \nmemorandum and their argument during these proceedings.\n  This is what the report says:\n\n       Because impeachment of a President is a grave step for the \n     Nation it is to be predicated only upon conduct \n     seriously incompatible with either constitutional form and \n     principles of our government or the proper performance of \n     constitutional duties of the Presidential office. For our \n     purposes now, impeachment is to be predicated only upon \n     conduct seriously incompatible, or the proper performance \n     of constitutional duties of the Presidential office.\n\n  That is a standard the managers accept. That is a standard the \nPresident's lawyers apparently also accept, and that is a standard I \nhope all 100 Members of the U.S. Senate could accept. I believe we can \nreach agreement on this standard. The problem comes, of course, in \napplying the standard. There is the rub. A wide gulf separates us on \nhow this standard should be applied. The President's lawyers say that \nunder this standard the case against the President isn't even worth \nconsidering. The managers argue on the contrary, that a conscientious \napplication of the standard leads to the firm conclusion that the \nPresident should be convicted and removed.\n  Our fundamental difference goes to the issue of seriousness. It all \ngoes back to the claim of the President's lawyers that his offenses \njust are not serious enough to justify removal.\n  I think we have agreement that obstruction of justice and lying under \noath are incompatible with the proper performance of the constitutional \nduties of the Presidential office. A President who has lied under oath \nand obstructed justice has by definition breached his constitutional \nduty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Such conduct is directly and unambiguously at odds with the duties of \nthis office. So far so good. But here is the real question. Is that \nconduct seriously incompatible with the President's constitutional \nduties?\n  That is the question you all must answer. If you say yes, it is \nseriously incompatible, you must vote to convict and remove the \nPresident. If you say no, you must vote to acquit.\n  The President's defenders have not offered a clear guide to \ndetermining what is serious enough to justify removal. Instead, they \nhave simply sought to minimize the significance of the particular \noffenses charged against the President.\n  Today we heard and attempt to minimize the significance of perjury. I \nwas somewhat amazed to hear that. There was no mention made of what the \nfirst Chief Justice of the United States, Justice Jay, had to say about \nperjury, being of all crimes the most pernicious to society. That was \nomitted from the President's analysis.\n  But let me say this: I believe that we should focus on any mitigating \ncircumstances. We should also focus on the aggravating circumstances \nthat relate to the particular facts of a given case. I would like to \nbriefly review the factors advanced at mitigating the seriousness of \nthe President's crimes.\n  We all know what the leading mitigating factor is. We have all heard \nthis 1,000 times. It goes like this: The offenses are not sufficiently \nserious because it is all about sex. This is directly linked to the \nclaim that the President was simply trying to avoid personal \nembarrassment in committing these crimes. The problem with this \nargument is that it proves too much.\n  It is very common for people to lie under oath and obstruct justice \nto do so at least in part to avoid personal embarrassment. People \nengage in such conduct in their efforts to extricate themselves from \ndifficulty and embarrassing situations. To a large extent, the offenses \nof President Nixon could be attributed to his desire to avoid \nembarrassing revelations. Did that reduce his culpability? Did that \nlessen the seriousness of his misconduct? The answer is obvious. It did \nnot.\n\n  The desire to avoid embarrassment is not a mitigating factor. \nLikewise, the nature of the precipitating misconduct of a sexual affair \ndoes not mitigate the seriousness of the President's crimes. If you \naccept the argument that it is just about sex, you will render the law \nof sexual harassment virtually meaningless. Any defendant guilty of \nsexual harassment would obviously have an incentive to lie about any \nsexual misconduct that may have occurred. But\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nno one--no one--has the license to lie under oath about sex in a sexual \nharassment case or a divorce case or any other case.\n  I would suggest to you that an objective review of all the \ncircumstances of this case--and you need to look at all of the \ncircumstances, all of the facts in context--if you do that, you will be \npointed not to mitigating factors, but to aggravating factors.\n  The conduct of the President was calculated and sustained. His subtle \nand determined purpose was corrupt. It was corrupt from start to \nfinish. He knew exactly what he was doing. He knew that it was in \nviolation of the criminal law. He knew that people could go to prison \nfor doing such things. He knew that it was contrary to his oath of \noffice. He knew that it was incompatible with his constitutional duty \nas President. And he most certainly knew that it was a very serious \nmatter. I am sure he believed he could get away with it, but I am \nequally sure that he knew just how serious it would be if the truth \nwere known and understood.\n  He knew all these things. In the midst of it all, he showed not the \nslightest concern for the honor, the dignity, and the integrity of his \nhigh office. When he called Ms. Lewinsky at 2:30 in the morning, he was \nup to no good, just as my colleague, Mr. Graham, noted. He knew exactly \nwhat he was doing. When he called Ms. Currie into his office twice and \ntold her lies about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he knew exactly \nwhat he was doing.\n  When he sent Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky--and \nthat is the only way it happened--he knew exactly what he was doing. He \nwas tampering with witnesses and obstructing justice. He was doing \neverything he could to make sure that Paula Jones did not get the \nevidence that a Federal district judge had determined and ordered that \nshe was entitled to receive. He was doing everything he could to avoid \nadverse legal consequences in the Jones case. That is what he planned \nto do, and that is what he did. And to cap it all off, he went before \nthe Federal grand jury and lied.\n  Whatever you may think about the President's testimony to the grand \njury, one thing is clear. He didn't lie to the grand jury to avoid \npersonal embarrassment. The DNA on the dress had ensured his personal \nembarrassment. There was no avoiding that. There was no way to explain \naway the DNA. The stakes were higher before the Federal grand jury. \nThis wasn't about avoiding personal embarrassment. This wasn't about \navoiding liability in a sexual harassment case. This was a Federal \ncriminal investigation concerning crimes against the system of justice. \nThis was about lying under oath and obstructing justice in the Jones \ncase.\n  And what did he do when he testified to the grand jury? He said \nanything he thought he needed to say to avoid responsibility for his \nprior crimes. The prosecutors went down to the White House, and William \nJefferson Clinton sat there as President of the United States in the \nWhite House and he lied to a Federal grand jury. He sat there in the \nWhite House and he put on his most sincere face. He swore to God to \ntell the truth, and then he lied. He planned to lie, and he executed \nhis plan because he believed it was in his personal and political \ninterests to lie. Never mind the oath of office. Never mind the \nconstitutional duty. Never mind that he solemnly swore to God to tell \nthe truth.\n  Now, ask yourself this simple question: Was this course of conduct \nseriously incompatible with the President's duty as President? If this \ndoesn't fall within the meaning of the offenses Alexander Hamilton \ndescribed as ``proceeding from the abuse or violation of some public \ntrust,'' tell me what would. I would respectfully suggest to you that \nthis is exactly the sort of conduct that the framers had in mind when \nthey provided a remedy for the removal of the Chief Executive who is \nguilty of misconduct. I believe that they would have rejected the \nargument that this deliberate, willful, stubborn, corrupt course of \ncriminal conduct just isn't serious enough for the constitutional \nremedy the framers established, a remedy that they designed to protect \nthe health and integrity of our institutions.\n\n  Those who established our Constitution would have understood the \nseriousness of the misconduct of William Jefferson Clinton. They would \nhave understood that it was the President who has shown contempt for \nthe Constitution, not the managers from the House of Representatives. \nThey would have understood the seriousness of the example of \nlawlessness he has set. They would have understood the seriousness of \nthe contempt for the law the President's conduct has caused. They would \nhave understood the seriousness of the damage the President has done to \nthe integrity of his high office. Those wise statesmen who established \nour form of government would have understood the seriousness of the \nharm President Clinton has done to the cause of justice and \nconstitutional government. They would have understood that a President \nwho does such things should not remain in office with his crimes.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, for the sake of justice and for \nthe sake of the Constitution, this President should be convicted and \nremoved.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Members of the Senate, the distinguished colleagues of the bar \nrepresenting the President, I want to commend them for an outstanding \neffort that they have made throughout these proceedings and tell them \nthat I just read a poll from a couple days ago, that something over 80 \npercent of the American people believe the President is guilty of \nsomething here. But I think that moots our entire debate. I don't think \nthere is any need to even talk about the facts any longer because of \nthe poll.\n  I use that tongue in cheek because that seems to beg the question \nthat we are also going to talk about today, and that is whether the \nPresident ought to be removed for his conduct. And one of the arguments \nI have heard put forward since we have been here is the fact that the \npolls support this President and that the stability issue would be in \nplay. And that is simply not the case because we all clearly understand \nthat it is this body's function to determine not only the facts of this \ncase, but also apply to it the law, as well as the constitutional law \nas to the removal and conviction process.\n  I still remain concerned with opposing counsels' continued reference \nthat the House managers want to win too much. I know I am not that \neloquent, but I did try to make that point the other day, and I will \nmake it again. If I have to take an oath to tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth, I will do that and tell you we are \nnot trying to win at all costs. This has been a process that I think \nhas been healthy for this country, and regardless of the outcome--it is \ngoing to be in your hands very shortly. Regardless of the outcome, this \ncountry will benefit not only in the short term but in the long term \nfrom this debate.\n  There are many, many other issues at stake here, and I tried to tell \nyou a few the other day, without this concept that all we want to do is \nwin, as if it is a simple game. We have been over the last 4 weeks, as \nmen and women, as ordinary men and women I might say, involved in an \nextraordinary process. It is uniquely thorough. And we have tried to \nblend the facts of this case with the law of the charges, together with \nthe politics and the polls and the media, and we have had to make some \ntough decisions. We have had to make some difficult decisions--I know \nwe have on our side--as to what witnesses to call, how to treat these \nwitnesses in depositions. I know on this side they have had to make \ndifficult calls, I am sure. There has been some talk about having the \nPresident come down or not coming down. And what has in large part made \nthis process distinct from past impeachments--and I am talking about \nthe one last century of the President--and the subsequent judicial \nimpeachments has been just, it seems, the media and the daily grind on \nall of us, the critiques. It is almost as if we are performing, we are \nin a play, and every day we get a review. We have been good, bad or \nindifferent.\n\n  What concerns me most about that is that as you move to the very \nserious issue of deciding whether or not this President should be \nconvicted based on the facts, and whether this President should be \nremoved, I am concerned that people are stretching the trees. And if \nthat is what you see on TV and\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nthat is what you read in the paper, you are going to see the trees and \nnot the forest here and miss the big picture.\n  That is so important. It is not about the personalities of these \npeople or the personalities here or the politics involved or the polls, \nbut it is about the facts. And ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, \nthere are conclusive facts here that support a conviction. The \nPresident and his attorneys, as I said the other day, have made a good \ndefense and have tried to paint a picture to the facts I think that \nsimply does not match with logic or common sense.\n  Take, for instance, the affidavit. Now, we continue to see Ms. \nLewinsky testifying on video that she never talked with the President \nthat night or never made--about linking the false story, the concocted \nstory with the affidavit. And Mr. Ruff, I think, challenged people to \nsay, well, what do you think the President meant to do that night when \nhe called her at 2:30 in the morning?\n  Well, what do you think he intended to do in that call at 2:30 in the \nmorning? Do you think he called her to tell her he had a Christmas \npresent for her, or do you think his intent was to tell her, which he \ndid, that you have been listed on the witness list and you could be \nsubpoenaed. And, you know, you might give an affidavit to avoid \ntestifying. He suggested the affidavit, and then he said in that same \nconversation, well, you know, you can always use that cover story.\n  Why would he suggest using a cover story that night? Were they even \nseeing each other then? It belittles all reasonable judgment to accept \nthis type of defense of this conduct, that it was an innocent phone \nconversation, the President really meant nothing by it, and the fact \nthat Ms. Lewinsky said, well, I didn't connect the two. But look at \nwhat she did. She went to her lawyer and used that concocted story in \nan affidavit that she filed in the case.\n  Now, it was in the draft affidavit. They took that out later for \nother reasons. But she did tell her lawyer that, and they attempted to \nuse it. But, again, it is the President's state of mind that matters \nand what his intent was on the false affidavit.\n  And then that same false affidavit was later used in the court, and \nthe President knew it was false. He knew it was false--used in the \ndeposition. And we have seen the deposition testimony, with the \nPresident sitting, listening to his lawyer talk about that affidavit \nwhen he submitted it. And he obstructed justice by not objecting at \nthat point, not instructing his own lawyer: Don't put that false \nevidence into this testimony.\n  People stand up and laugh and say, you know, he was not paying any \nattention, and they got this silly affidavit from this guy who was \nthere and said he was looking at his lawyer but he couldn't tell what \nhe was thinking. Of course he couldn't tell what he was thinking. \nNobody is a mind reader. But this was a critical affidavit at that time \nwhich was going to cut off critical testimony in that case, and you can \njust about guarantee, I would say 100 percent, that the President was \nindeed listening very carefully, knew that his lawyer was submitting a \nfalse affidavit, and did nothing to stop it. That is another count of \nobstruction of justice.\n  Tampering with Betty Currie--two occasions. And they say, well, \nnothing happened between the first time and the second time. I am not \nso sure legally that matters. It was 2 or 3 days after it happened, 2 \nor 3--the day following his deposition and 2 or 3 days after that. \nInitially, remember his defense was: I was simply trying to recall what \nhappened. And then we brought up the fact: Why did you go the second \ntime? Did you have a short memory? Didn't you get it right the first \ntime? And now we hear the defense today that nothing really changed and \nit is really one issue there, one big tampering rather than two \nattempts to tamper--still obstruction of justice.\n  The job situation Mr. Hutchinson will talk about later. Mr. \nBlumenthal, the same thing; I am sure Mr. Rogan will talk about him in \na minute.\n  But if you will look carefully, you will see that the President is \nthe only thread that goes from each one of these, from the very \nbeginning, from the point when he met Monica Lewinsky and from that \npoint when he looked at that pink pass and said: You know, that's going \nto be a problem. And you know why that was going to be a problem. \nBecause that limited her access to this President and what he was going \nto do. But from that point until they terminated the relationship, this \nPresident is involved in each one of these issues of the obstruction of \njustice.\n  It is always him, by himself, testifying falsely, sitting there \nletting his lawyers submit a false affidavit, or it is him and one \nother person--he and Monica Lewinsky talking about filing a false \naffidavit; he and Monica Lewinsky talking about a concocted story to \ntestify. He and Betty Currie on two occasions: Betty, you remember the \ntestimony was like this.\n  He and John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal, the many aides--talking to \nthem individually, giving them a false story. As Mr. Hutchinson pointed \nout so well in his argument the other day, it is always a private issue \nin terms of no one else knows what is going on. Vernon Jordan didn't \nknow what was happening with the affidavit, necessarily. Betty Currie \ndidn't understand what was happening with the affidavit, or the job \nsearch, to the point that they knew what was going on. Look at and \nanalyze each one of these and you will see that there is a \ncompartmentalization going on with this President. And he is at the \ncenter of it each time.\n\n  Now, what do we do with it? What do you do with it? It is going to be \nin your hands very shortly, and I want to address just a couple of \npoints on the constitutional issue of the conviction and the removal, \nbecause White House counsel very, very well argued the issue of \nproportionality. And, again, proportionality simply means that the \nlegacy of this Senate and this Congress will be that we have destroyed \nsexual harassment laws because what we are going to say--when you argue \nthat proportionality, think about what it is.\n  We have heard this issue about, ``Well, back in my hometown, 80 \npercent of the people who get divorces lie about this issue.'' \nCertainly we don't want that to be the legacy of this Congress, that we \nlegitimate lying in divorce cases; nor would we want to have the \nlegitimacy of this Congress being that we did not support the sexual \nharassment laws, because you know and I know that this is an important \npart. Going back and getting accurate, truthful testimony is absolutely \nessential in these types of cases. And if we send a message out on the \nproportionality theory that it is just about sex and you can lie about \nit, it will be the wrong thing to do.\n  The laws, like the facts, are a very stubborn thing. And the fact \nthat the economy is good and people are doing well--if the law has been \nbroken, if perjury has been committed, if obstruction of justice has \nbeen committed by this President, it is my belief that the fact that \nthe economy is good should not prevent this Senate from acting and \nremoving the President. Just as if the economy were bad, you wouldn't \nwant to be able to go in there and impeach the President because it is \nbad, you don't want to not impeach him simply because the economy is \ngood.\n  It is a difficult task. We have had a difficult task bringing this \ncase over to you. And I thank you. You have been here the 4 weeks in \nattendance. You paid attention. When it was your turn to ask questions, \nyou asked very good questions. You have been ready to listen and I \nthank you for that.\n  You have a difficult task ahead of you. I know when I voted on this I \nthought, ``If this were a Republican President, what would I do?'' It \nis a tough choice. And I said, ``But I really think I would have voted \nthe same way I voted even if it were a Republican President.'' I know. \nLike Mr. Chabot, I voted for Mr. Carter in 1976. I voted for Mr. Reagan \nin 1980, I might add, but I voted for Mr. Carter in 1976 after the 1974 \nincident.\n  It is tough. And what has made it awfully hard is that you all have \nalso taken an oath to do impartial justice. I simply ask you, as you \nconsider these facts and do impartial justice, that you set a standard \nthat, if you believe the President indeed did commit either perjury or \nobstruction of justice or both of those, that you set that standard \nhigh for the President, for the next President, for the next \ngenerations; you set that standard high for our courts that have to \ndeal with perjury and obstruction every day, with people\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nwho are less than the President but yet who are watching, watching very \nclosely what we do up here. But set that standard high for the \nPresident. Don't lower our expectation in what we expect of \nthe President. And I think if you do that, if you look high, if you set \nthe standard high, that the right thing will be done.\n\n  I have confidence and have trust, and have just been so pleased with \nthe way we have been received here. I know you will do the right thing.\n  I apologize to you, as I will be talking to you probably for my last \ntime, if I have come across being up here preaching to you. It is not \nmy intent to lecture you. You do not need any lectures from me or \nanyone else to preach to you. I hope I have had that opportunity to \nrebut some of the area--the proof in the area that I am in charge of. \nBut I will just simply sit down by telling you there is conclusive \nproof here, particularly in terms of the obstruction of justice \ncharges, of the hiding of the evidence, of the filing of false \naffidavit.\n  I think I did skip over the hiding of the evidence. Let me just \nquickly say, I am not sure a lot new can be added to what was said in \nthe past. But if Monica is telling the truth, as her lawyers or as the \nPresident's lawyers seem to tell you, that is a no-brainer there, \nbecause she says, ``I know for a fact that Ms. Currie called me, that \nshe initiated the call.'' And as I told you the other day, from that \npoint forward it seems to me a moot issue, because the initiation of \nthe phone call by Betty Currie began a process to hide that evidence. \nAnd the only way that Betty Currie would have known to make that call, \nto begin that process of hiding evidence, would be to have had a \nconversation with the President, to have been instructed that way.\n  For the President, whose intent was to conceal the relationship, it \nwould have been totally inconsistent for him to suggest that she turn \nthe evidence over. It would have been totally consistent for him to ask \nBetty Currie to go out and hide the evidence, get it from Ms. Lewinsky \nand hide the evidence.\n  As I close, let me just tell you, too--on the heels of Mr. Canady--\nthat there are law professors who testified in our hearing who have the \ncontrary view to the view that was expressed by other law professors \nthat Mr. Ruff referred to, that it is constitutional to impeach a \nPresident for conduct that is not clearly official, that might be \ndescribed as personal, particularly conduct of perjury or obstruction \nof justice.\n  Professor Turley says:\n\n       In my view, serious crimes in office, such as lying under \n     oath before a federal grand jury, have always been ``malum in \n     se'' conduct for a president and sufficient for impeachment.\n  Professor John McGinnis of Benjamin Cardozo Law School says that \nobstruction of justice is clearly within the ambit of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  If there is any question of this private conduct versus personal \nconduct, that view is out there. Given the right type of personal \nmisconduct, it is clearly an impeachable offense. With that, I call Mr. \nManager Hutchinson to follow me.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, when I was appointed as a \nmanager, I hoped to present the case before the Senate with my \ncolleagues in a manner that was consistent with the dignity of this \ngreat body and also respectful of the constitutional independence of \nthe Senate. I hope that you agree and believe that we have done that as \nwe have come over here.\n  During the months of this trial process, I have grown to appreciate \nthe institution of the Senate to a greater degree than ever before, but \nI think of even more importance to me, I have grown to respect the \nindividuals that comprise this body more than ever. Let me say, it has \nbeen a privilege to appear before you.\n  As we come to the close of this case, let's go to the key questions \nthat should be on your mind. First of all, has the obstruction of \njustice and perjury cases been proven? Have the allegations been \nproven? My colleagues have touched upon the perjury. Let me talk about \narticle II on the obstruction of justice.\n  The White House defense team, composed of extraordinarily \ndistinguished and talented attorneys, has tried to diminish the \nsignificance of the overwhelming facts on obstruction by using certain \nphrases such as, ``It's all circumstantial,'' or ``The managers ignore \nthose stubborn facts,'' or ``They want to win too badly,'' or ``It's a \nshell with no shell.'' And today the latest catch phrase, ``moving \ntargets, empty pots.''\n  Those are certainly quotable phrases designed to diminish the factual \npresentation with dripping sarcasm, but I believe that they ignore the \nunderlying facts, testimony, and evidence that has been presented.\n  Let me just address a couple of arguments that Mr. Ruff has presented \nduring his presentation.\n  The first argument that he presented as he described it was a \ntechnical argument, that the article II obstruction of justice charge \nin the articles of impeachment on the lying to the aides was not really \nin reference to the Federal civil rights case, and that is a true \nstatement. But if you read article II, paragraph 7, it refers to this \nand says:\n\n       . . .The false and misleading statements made by William \n     Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to the grand \n     jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and misleading \n     information.\n\n  The article is appropriately drafted, is well stated, and gives them \ntotal notice as to what that charge is about.\n  Some of the other arguments have been handled by my colleagues, but \nMr. Ruff also said, Why have the managers never, never explained, if \nthis is such an urgent matter for the President, why did he wait until \nDecember 17 to tell Ms. Lewinsky that she was on the list?\n  I am afraid Mr. Ruff failed to listen to my opening presentation when \nI went through that timeframe. In that timeframe, the witness list came \nout on December 5, it continued to accelerate, December 11 was Judge \nWright's order. Then it was December 17 that the call was made at 2 \na.m. in the morning to let Ms. Lewinsky know she was on the list. Why \nwas it December 17? This is in the President's mind. No one knows why \nhe picked that particular date, but perhaps it was that the job search \nwas well underway then. He felt like she could handle this distressing \ninformation and, in fact, on the day after that call, she already had \ntwo interviews lined up on that same day, December 18, set up by Mr. \nJordan. So perhaps it was an appropriate time to let her know she was \non the witness list.\n\n  They raised the question about the Christmas gifts. You have the \ntestimony of Betty Currie, you have the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, and \nthe issue is simply: Do you believe Monica Lewinsky? If you accept her \nreluctant testimony, yet forceful and clear testimony, that the call \ncame from Betty Currie, then you have no choice but to conclude that \nthe retention of the gifts, the retrieval of the gifts was initiated by \nthe President of the United States.\n  When you go to the job search, and they point to the testimony, they \nplayed the video of Mr. Jordan who said that there was never a \nconversation in which both the job and the false affidavit were \ndiscussed together, they cut it off at that point. You remember I had a \n``but'' in there. If you had heard further beyond that, you would have \nheard me cross-examining Mr. Jordan, as I did, and reminding him of his \nprevious testimony in which he acknowledged that in every conversation \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, they talked about the job. So he acknowledged that \nthey talked about the job and the affidavit all in the same \nconversation together.\n  Mr. Ruff makes the point that the managers got close enough to accuse \nMr. Jordan of telling Ms. Lewinsky to destroy the notes, implying that \nwe are making up this. But is this evidence that is coming from the \nmanagers? It is my recollection that it is testimony coming from Ms. \nMonica Lewinsky. We are not concocting this. It is testimony from \nwitnesses that have been brought before this body, whose sworn \ntestimony you have received, whose sworn testimony they defended and \nrely upon, but when it comes to this, they say, ``No, it's the \nmanagers.''\n  Then they come to another pillar of obstruction, the one that they \navoid at every opportunity, but finally addressed today, and that is \nthe coaching\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\nof Betty Currie. I was interested that they finally talked about this, \nthe first coaching incident and then the second one. Mr. Ruff tried to \ngo into that it is clear that it occurred on January 20 rather than 21. \nIn fact, it is her testimony that it occurred on one of those days. But \nthey miss the point.\n  The legal significance of the second coaching episode is that it \ntotally goes against the defense of the President--that it was there, \nhe was doing this to acquire information, to get facts, to help in \nmedia inquiries.\n  If that is the case, there is absolutely no reason for it to be done \non the second occasion and, clearly, she was known to be a witness at \nthat time, and that is the legal significance.\n  It goes to his intent, his motive, what he is trying to do to a \nsubordinate employee. The fact of this matter is that this is not a \ncase that is based upon circumstantial evidence. On each element of \nobstruction, there is direct testimony linking the President to a \nconsistent pattern of conduct designed to withhold information, conceal \nevidence and tamper with witnesses to avoid obedience and directives of \na Federal court.\n\n  Let's look at the direct proof, not circumstantial evidence, but \ndirect testimony.\n  What did Vernon Jordan testify as to the President's involvement in \nthe job search?\n  Question to Mr. Jordan:\n\n       You're acting in behalf of the President when you're trying \n     to get Ms. Lewinsky a job and you were in control of the job \n     search?\n\n  His answer:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  He was acting at the direction of the President and he was in \ncontrol.\n  What did Vernon Jordan testify he told the President when a job was \nsecured for a key witness and the false affidavit was signed?\n\n       Mr. President, she signed the affidavit, she signed the \n     affidavit.\n\n  Then the next day, the job is secured and the report to Betty Currie, \nthe report to the President, ``Mission accomplished.''\n  Is this circumstantial evidence? This is direct testimony by a friend \nand confidante of the President, Vernon Jordan.\n  Who is the one person who clearly knew all of the ingredients to make \nthe job search an obstruction of justice? It was the President who knew \nhe had a dangerous relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He knew his friend \nwas securing a job at his direction, and he knew that a false affidavit \nwas being procured at his suggestion. He was the one person who knew \nall the facts.\n  Fourthly, Ms. Lewinsky, is this circumstantial evidence or direct \ntestimony when she talked about what the President told her on December \n17? She was a witness, and immediately following the fact she was a \nwitness, the suggestion that she could use the cover stories, the \nsuggestion that she could use an affidavit.\n  Direct testimony, was it direct proof about the President's tampering \nwith the testimony of Betty Currie? It was Betty Currie herself who \nacknowledged this and testified to it. No, this is not circumstantial \nevidence, it is direct testimony.\n  The same with Sidney Blumenthal. Direct testimony after direct \ntestimony painting a picture, setting up the pillars of obstruction.\n  They want you to believe Monica Lewinsky sometimes, but they don't \nwant you to believe her other times, and you have to weigh her \ntestimony.\n  I could go on with the facts, but the truth is that our case on \nobstruction of justice has been established. Some of you might \nconclude, ``Well, I accept five or six of those pillars of obstruction, \nbut there is one I have a reservation about.'' If you look at the \narticle, if there is one element of obstruction that you accept and \nbelieve and you agree upon, then that is sufficient for conviction and, \nsurely, it is sufficient to convict the President, if there was even \none element of obstruction.\n  I remind you that a typical jury instruction on conspiracy for \nobstruction would be that it takes only one overt act to satisfy the \nrequirements for conviction. The Government doesn't have to prove all \nthe overt acts, just one that was carried out.\n  Another question some of you might be thinking about is, Is this \nserious enough to warrant conviction and removal? One of the \nfoundations of our judicial system is that any citizen, regardless of \nposition or power, has access to the court. Can you imagine the shock \nand outrage of this body if a corporation, in an effort to protect \nitself from liability, concealed evidence and provided benefits to \nthose witnesses who are cooperative? Outrage; injustice. And those are \nthe allegations against the tobacco companies. Those are the \nallegations last night on CBS, ``60 Minutes,'' about a major \ncorporation. And there should be outrage by this body. We would \nrightfully be outraged about that. And we should also be outraged if it \nhappened by the President. It should be no less when it is conducted by \nthe President.\n  The next argument is: ``Well, yes, the President should be held \naccountable, but he can always be prosecuted later. In fact, I \nunderstand a censure resolution is being circulated emphasizing that \nthe President can be held criminally responsible for his actions when \nhe leaves office. This is not too subtle of a suggestion that the \nindependent counsel go ahead and file criminal charges against the \nPresident.''\n  I appreciate Judge Starr, but I do not believe that is what the \ncountry has in mind when they say they want to get this matter over. I \ndo not believe your vote on the articles of impeachment should be a \nsignal to the independent counsel to initiate criminal proceedings. It \nappears to me that that is the implication of this censure resolution \nbeing discussed.\n  I would emphasize that it is this body that the founding fathers \nentrusted with the responsibility to determine whether a President's \nconduct has breached the public trust. And your decision in this body \nshould conclude this matter. It should not be the initiation of another \nnational drama that will be carried over the next 3 years.\n  And finally, there are some who consider the politics of this matter. \nWe have proven our case. I entered this body thinking that this was a \nlegal, judicial proceeding and not political. And I have been reminded \nthere are political aspects under the Constitution to a Senate trial. \nSo I concede the point.\n  We are all familiar with ``Profiles in Courage'' written by John F. \nKennedy. He reminds us of the courageous act of Senator Edmund G. Ross \nin voting for the acquittal of President Andrew Johnson in his \nimpeachment trial. Senator Ross was a profile in courage because he \nknew the case against President Johnson was not legally sufficient, \neven though the politically expedient vote was to vote for conviction. \nSenator Ross followed the facts and he followed the law, and he voted \nhis conscience. It was to his political detriment, but it reflected his \npolitical courage.\n  Today we have a different circumstance. The question is, Will the \nSenators of this body have the political courage to follow the facts \nand the law as did Senator Ross, despite enormous political pressure to \nignore the facts and the law and the Constitution? You will make that \ndecision.\n  I appear before this body as an advocate. I am not paid for this \nspecial responsibility. But I am here because I believe the \nConstitution requires me to make this case. The facts prove \noverwhelmingly that the President committed obstruction of justice and \nperjury. Despite this belief, whatever conclusion you reach will not be \ncriticized by me. And I will respect this institution regardless of the \noutcome.\n\n  As the late Federal Judge Orin Harris of Arkansas always said from \nthe bench to the jury when I was trying cases--and I hated his \ninstruction because I was the prosecutor--but he would tell the jury, \n``Remember, the government never wins or loses a case. The government \nalways wins when justice is done.'' Well, this is the Congress and this \nis the Senate. And it is your responsibility to determine the facts and \nto let justice roll down like mighty waters.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Rogan.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel for the \nPresident, Members of the U.S. Senate, for me the most poignant part of \nthis entire proceeding was the day, a few weeks ago, when we were \naddressed by the distinguished former Senator from Arkansas, Dale \nBumpers. And probably the thing that touched me most about\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nhis presentation is when he talked about the human element of what this \nimpeachment proceeding has meant and how difficult that has been.\n  It touched me because it made me remember that that difficulty is not \nlimited solely for Democrats in this Chamber. I am one of the House \nmanagers. I am a Republican today. But that was not always the case. I \nused to be a Democrat. And being a House manager in the impeachment of \nPresident Clinton has been especially difficult for me. And I would \nlike to tell you why.\n  Twenty years ago, in December 1978, I was finishing my last semester \nof college and had just applied to law school. I was waiting for my \napplication to be accepted someplace. And in December of 1978, I was a \ndelegate in Memphis, TN, to the Democratic Midterm Convention.\n  Now, at that time President Carter was halfway through his term of \noffice. He was not particularly popular among the party faithful. There \nwas a great deal of sentiment that a Member of this body today should \nchallenge him for the nomination. That decision had not yet been made, \nbut among the delegates to that convention there was an overwhelming \ndesire to see Senator Ted Kennedy appear.\n  The Carter White House froze Senator Kennedy out of the proceedings. \nHe was not invited to address the convention. His name appeared nowhere \nin the program. So the delegates did something on their own. There were \nworkshops being held during the day, and a workshop on health care was \ncalled. And Senator Kennedy was invited to fly out that day and address \nthat workshop. He did that in the afternoon, and he left after he \naddressed it. I had gone to a workshop that morning where President \nCarter personally appeared, and my recollection is about 200 or 300 \npeople came to that. Senator Kennedy's workshop had to be transferred \nto a large auditorium because about 2,000 people appeared to hear him.\n  The Senator came, he spoke, and he left. I stayed even though most \npeople left with him, because I was fascinated by the young fellow who \nwas moderating the program that day. He was bright, he was in control, \nhe was articulate. He didn't look that much older than me. And I was \nstunned that this young man was not only the attorney general of his \nState, but he was the Governor-elect of the State.\n  Sometime after that workshop I walked up to him and introduced \nmyself. I told him who I was, and he spent about 15 minutes encouraging \nme to go to law school, to stay active in politics. His name was Bill \nClinton. I have never forgotten that day 20 years ago when then-\nAttorney General Clinton took the time for a young fellow who had an \ninterest in the law and politics. And I have never forgotten in recent \ndays the graciousness he has shown to me, to my wife, and to my \nchildren when we have encountered him.\n\n  This has been a very difficult proceeding for me and for my \ncolleagues, the House managers. But our presence here isn't out of \npersonal animosity toward our President. It is because we believe that, \nafter reviewing all the evidence, the President of the United States \nhad committed obstruction of justice and perjury, he had violated his \noath of office; and in so doing he had sacrificed the principle that no \nperson is above the law. And friendship and personal affection could \nnot control under those circumstances.\n  Up until now, the idea that no person is above the law has been \nunquestioned. And yet this standard is not our inheritance \nautomatically. Each generation of Americans ultimately has to make that \nchoice for themselves. Once again, it is a time for choosing. How will \nwe respond? By impeaching the President, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives made that choice. It went on record as saying that our \nbody would not tolerate the most powerful man in the world trampling \nthe constitutional rights of a lone woman, no matter how obscure or \nhumble she might be.\n  We refused to ignore Presidential misconduct despite its minimization \nby spin doctors, pundits, and, yes, even the polls. The personal \npopularity of any President pales when weighed against the fundamental \nconcept that forever distinguishes us from every nation on the planet: \nNo person is above the law.\n  The House of Representatives jettisoned the spin and the propaganda. \nWe sought, and we have now presented, the unvarnished truth. Now it is \nyour unhappy task to make the final determination, face the truth, and \npolish the Constitution, or allow this Presidency, in the words of \nChairman Henry Hyde, to take one more chip out of the marble.\n  The Constitution solemnly required President Clinton, as a condition \nof his becoming President, to swear an oath to preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution, and to take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\n  That oath of obligation required the President to defend our laws \nthat protect women in the workplace, just as it also required him to \nprotect the legal system from perjury, abuse of power, and obstruction \nof justice. Fidelity to the Presidential oath is not dependent upon any \nPresident's personal threshold of comfort or embarrassment. Neither \nmust it be a slave to the latest poll.\n  How important was this oath to our founders? Did they intend the oath \nto have primacy over the shifting winds of political opinion? Or did \nthey bequeath to us an ambiguous Constitution that was meant to roll \nwith the punches of the latest polling data and focus groups? The \nConstitution gives us that answer in article II, section 1. It says:\n\n       Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall \n     take . . . [an] oath.\n\n  And the oath is then prescribed.\n  The mere fact that a person is elected President does not give him \nthe right to become President, no matter how overwhelming his vote \nmargin. Votes alone do not make a person President of the United \nStates. There is a requirement that precedes obtaining the power and \nauthority of obtaining the Presidency. It is the oath of office. It is \nswearing to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. It is \naccepting the obligation that the laws are to be faithfully executed.\n  No oath, no Presidency. It is the oath of office, and not public \nopinion polls, that gives life and legitimacy to a Presidency. This is \ntrue no matter how popular an elected President may be, or how broad \nhis margin of victory.\n  The founders did not intend the oath to be an afterthought or a \ntechnicality. They viewed it as an absolute requirement before the \nhighest office in the land was entrusted to any person. The evidence \nshows the President repeatedly violated his oath of office. Now the \nfocus shifts to your oath of office. The President hopes that in this \nChamber the polls will govern. On behalf of the House of \nRepresentatives, we entreat you to require the Constitution reign \nsupreme. For if polls matter more than the oath to uphold the law, then \nyet another chip out of the marble has been struck.\n  The cry has also been raised that to remove the President is to \ncreate a constitutional crisis by undoing an election. There is no \nconstitutional crisis when the simple process of the Constitution comes \ninto play. Listen to the words of Dr. Larry Arnn of the Claremont \nInstitute:\n\n       [E]lections have no higher standing under our Constitution \n     than the impeachment process. Both stem from provisions of \n     the Constitution. The people elect a president to do a \n     constitutional job. They act under the Constitution when they \n     do it. At the same time they elect a Congress to do a \n     different constitutional job. The president swears an oath to \n     uphold the Constitution, both in elections and in the \n     impeachment process.\n       If the president is guilty of acts justifying impeachment, \n     then he, not the Congress, will have ``overturned the \n     election.'' He will have acted in ways that betray the \n     purpose of his election. He will have acted not as a \n     constitutional representative, but as a monarch, subversive \n     of, or above, the law.\n       If the great powers given the president are abused, then to \n     impeach him defends not only the results of elections, but \n     that higher thing which elections are in service, namely, the \n     preeminence of the Constitution[.]\n\n  The evidence clearly shows that the President engaged in a repeated \nand lengthy pattern of felonious conduct--conduct for which ordinary \ncitizens can be and have been jailed and lost their liberty. This \nsimply cannot be wished or censured away.\n  With his conduct aggravated by a motivation of personal and monetary \nleverage in the Paula Jones lawsuit, the solemnity of our sacred oath \nobliges us to do what the President regretfully has failed to do: \ndefend the rule of law, defend the concept that no person is above the \nlaw.\n  On the day the House impeached President Clinton, I said that when\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nthey are old enough to appreciate the solemnity of that action, I \nwanted my little girls to know that when the roll was called, their \nfather served with colleagues who counted it a privilege to risk \npolitical fortunes in defense of the Constitution.\n  Today, I am more resolute in that opinion. From the time I was a \nlittle boy, it was my dream to one day serve in the Congress of the \nUnited States. My dream was fulfilled 2 years ago. Today, I am a \nRepublican in a district that is heavily Democratic. The pundits keep \ntelling me that my stand on this issue puts my political fortunes in \njeopardy. So be it. That revelation produces from me no flinching. \nThere is a simple reason why: I know that in life dreams come and \ndreams go. But conscience is forever. I can live with the concept of \nnot serving in Congress. I cannot live with the idea of remaining in \nCongress at the expense of doing what I believe to be right.\n  I was about 12 years old when a distinguished Member of this body, \nthe late Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas, gave me this sage advice \nabout elective office:\n\n       Always put principle above politics; put honor above \n     incumbency.\n\n  I now return that sentiment to the body from which it came. Hold fast \nto it, Senators, and in doing so, you will be faithful both to our \nfounders and to our heirs.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Graham. The \nmanagers have 45 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. I promise not to take the whole 45 minutes. I \nhave been told that my voice fades, and I will try not to let that \nhappen here.\n  As we bring the trial to a conclusion, I think it needs to be said \nfrom our side of the aisle that our staff has been terrific. You don't \nknow how many hours of sleep have been lost by the young men and women \nworking to put this case together under the procedures that the Senate \ndeveloped. They have done an absolutely magnificent job. If there is \nanybody to blame on our side, blame us, because our staff has done a \nterrific job. That just needs to be said.\n  Now, let's talk about Mr. Rogan's district. True, if there is anybody \non our side of the aisle that has been at risk it has been Jim. I have \nmade some lifelong friends in this situation, really on both sides of \nthe aisle. This has been tough, tough, tough for our country, but \nsometimes some good comes from tough situations, and I think some good \nwill come from this before it is all said and done, ladies and \ngentlemen of the Senate. I know it doesn't look to be so, but it will \nbe so later on.\n  I come from a district where I am the first Republican in 120 years. \nThey told me they hung the other guy, so I know I am doing better. I am \n4 years into this thing. This is my third term.\n  You can take the national polls and turn them upside down in my \ndistrict, but I have on occasion said that if the President would \nreconcile himself to the law, I would be willing to consider something \nless than impeachment. I can assure you that did not go over well with \nsome people in my district. But I thought that would be good for the \ncountry.\n  The elections come and go and we can get through just about anything \nand everything in this country, but it does take leadership, and \ncharacter does still count. Having said that, I am a sinner like the \nrest of us, and part of the problem with this case is we have to \nconfront our own sins, because who are we to judge others when the \nthings get to be private and personal? I am not asking you to use that \nstandard. I am standing before you as a sinner, and I would never want \nmy President or your President removed because of private sins. Only \nwhen it gets to be constitutionally out of bounds. Only when it gets to \nbe so egregious that you can't look your children in the eye and \nexplain what happened here in terms of the law. We can all explain \nhuman failings, but we have a real mixed message going on, and it needs \nto be straightened out for them.\n  If you could bring the Founding Fathers back, as everybody has \nsuggested, the first debate would be, could we call them as a witness? \nThere would be some people objecting to that. Live or dead, it's been \nhard to get a witness. [Laughter.]\n  I guarantee you, I think they would say to us: ``What's a poll?'' \nThey would be instructive, but we can't summon them back. Do you know \nwhat I really think they would tell us? They would tell us that we \nstarted this thing, and it's up to you all to carry it on. And it is. \nThey would be right. It is not their job to tell us what to do. It's \nour job to take the spirit of what they did and build on it.\n  If you have kept an open mind, you have fulfilled your job. If you \nhave listened to the facts and you vote your conscience, you will have \nfulfilled your job. I will not trample on your conscience; I have said \nthat before. I started this process with great concern and I leave with \na lot of contentment because I believe the facts have withstood the \ntest of every type of scrutiny and demagoguery that have been thrown at \nthem. They stand firm. Do you know what they are going to stand? \nThey're going to stand the test of history. Some people suggest that \nhistory may judge you badly if you vote to convict this President. I \nsuggest that that will be the least of your problems.\n  Our past and this present moment becomes our Nation's future. What \nare we going to leave to the future generations? What do we do when the \nnext Federal judge is brought before this body having been impeached by \nthe House for cheating on their taxes? Are we going to self-righteously \nthrow that Federal judge out after having listened to this massive case \nof obstruction of justice and perjury before a grand jury? We may throw \nthat Federal judge out, but we will have to walk out the door backward; \nwe will not walk out boldly. What happens when the next Federal judge \nis acquitted by a jury of his peers, and you know the result would be \njust to remove that judge? You did the right thing by not being bound \nby the acquittal in the case of Judge Hastings. You did the right thing \nto get to the truth and act accordingly, because for people who sit in \njudgment of others there needs to be no reasonable doubt about who they \nare and what they are able to do in that role. The President of the \nUnited States is at the top of the legal pyramid. If there is \nreasonable doubt about his ability to faithfully execute the laws of \nthe land, our future will be better off if that individual is removed.\n  Let me tell you what it all comes down to for me. If you can go back \nand explain to your children and your constituents how you can be \ntruthful and misleading at the same time, good luck. That is the legacy \nthat Bill Clinton has left all of us if we keep him in office--the idea \nthat ``I was truthful but misleading.'' That scenario focuses around \nwhether or not one type of sex occurred versus the other type of sex. \nHe is wanting you to buy into this definition that was allowed to exist \nbecause the wording wasn't quite right. That is the essence of it--``I \nwas truthful, but I was misleading.''\n  Mr. Podesta asked a little more questions than the other people did \nand the President denied any type of sexual relationship to him. Was he \ntruthful there? Was he truthful in his grand jury testimony? How can \nyou be both? It is just absolutely impossible.\n  I want to play two clips for you now.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Now, you've stated, I think, very honestly, and I \n     appreciate, that you were lied to by the President. Is it a \n     fair statement, given your previous testimony concerning your \n     30-minute conversation, that the President was trying to \n     portray himself as a victim of a relationship with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A. I think that's the import of his whole story.\n\n  Before you put the other tape in, every Member of this body should \nneed to answer this question: Is that a truthful statement? If you \nbelieve that the President of the United States is a victim of Ms. \nLewinsky, we all owe him an apology. He is not. He is not.\n  You ask me why I want this President removed? Not only are they high \ncrimes, not only do they rise to the level of constitutional out-of-\nbounds behavior, not only are they worse than what you remove judges \nfor, they show a tremendous willingness of a national leader to put \nhimself above anything decent and good. I hope that still matters in \nAmerica.\n  The next clip:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Would it be fair to say that you were sitting there \n     during this conversation and that you had previously been \n     told by the President that he was in essence a victim of\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n     Ms. Lewinsky's sexual demands, and you said nothing to \n     anyone?\n\n       MR. McDANIEL: Is the question, ``You said''----\n       THE WITNESS: I don't----\n       MR. McDANIEL: Is the question, ``You said nothing to anyone \n     about what the President told you?''----\n       MR. GRAHAM: Right.\n       THE WITNESS: I never told any of my colleagues about what \n     the President told me.\n       BY MR. GRAHAM:\n       Q. And this is after the President recants his story--\n     recounts his story--to you, where he's visibly upset, feels \n     like he's a victim, that he associates himself with a \n     character who's being lied about, and you at no time \n     suggested to your colleagues that there is something going on \n     here with the President and Ms. Lewinsky you need to know \n     about. Is that your testimony?\n       A. I never mentioned my conversation. I regarded that \n     conversation as a private conversation in confidence, and I \n     didn't mention it to my colleagues, I didn't mention it to my \n     friends, I didn't mention it to my family, bedsides my wife.\n       Q. Did you mention it to any White House lawyers?\n       A. I mentioned it many months later to Lanny Breuer in \n     preparation for one of my grand jury appearances, when I knew \n     I would be questioned about it. And I certainly never \n     mentioned it to any reporter.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I have asked you several times to \nvote your conscience, and I will not step on it if you disagree with \nme; but I have always said let us tell the story about what happened \nhere. I am saying it again. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to get to the \ntruth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth, and let the chips fall \nwhere they may.\n  Let me say this about being truthful but misleading. Can you sit back \nas the President, after you told a lie to a key aide, where you \nportrayed yourself as a victim, and watch the press stories role out \nalong the lines that ``she wears her dresses too tight''; ``she comes \nfrom a broken home''; ``she's a stalker''; ``she's sex obsessed''; can \nyou sit back and watch all that happen and still be truthful but \nmisleading?\n  We have laws against that in this country. We have laws in this \ncountry that even high Government officials cannot tell a lie to \nsomebody knowing that lie will be repeated to a grand jury. That is \nexactly what happened here. He portrayed himself as a victim, which is \nnot a misleading statement; it is a lie because if you knew the truth, \nyou wouldn't consider him a victim. And that lie went to the Federal \ngrand jury. And those citizens were trying very hard to get it right, \nand he was trying very hard to mislead them. At every turn when they \ntried to get to the truth, he ran the other way, and he took the aura \nof the White House with him.\n\n  If you believe he is a victim, then you ought to acquit him. If you \nbelieve he has lied, then he ought not to be our President.\n  There are two things in this case that are crimes, two aspects of \nit--before the Paula Jones deposition and after the Paula Jones \ndeposition. I am going to leave this with you for the very last time. \nThe affidavit was an attempt to have a cover story where both of them \ncould lie and go on about their lives. The job search was to take \nsomebody who had been friendly and get them a job so they could go on \nabout their lives someplace else, and get this matter behind them and \nconceal from a court the truth. Those things are crimes.\n  These gifts being under the bed of Betty Currie, the President's \nsecretary, is no accident. They didn't walk over there by themselves. \nThey got conveyed by a secretary after she picked them up from his \nconsensual lover. People have figured that part out. It is no accident \nthat happened. That is a crime--when you are subpoenaed to give those \ngifts.\n  But it is still about getting her a job and having a cover story so \nshe could go on with her life. But when the article came out on January \n21, the whole flavor of this case changed. And I don't know how you are \ngoing to explain it to yourself or others. But I want to lay out to you \nwhat I think happened based on the evidence.\n  That January 21 when the story broke that she may have been telling \nwhat went on, and the President was faced with the idea that the \nknowledge of their relationship was out in the public forum, what did \nhe do then? There were no more nice jobs using a good friend. There was \nno more ``Let's see if we can hide the gifts and play hide the ball.'' \nDo you know what happened then? He turned on her. Not my favorite part \nof the case--it is the most disgusting part of the case. It is part of \nthe case that history will judge. The crimes change. They become more \nominous, because the character traits became more ominous. The young \nlady who was the stalker, who was sex-obsessed, who wore her skirts too \ntight, that young lady was being talked about openly in the public. \nThat young lady was being lied about to the Federal grand jury. And the \ntruth is that young lady fell in love with him. And probably to this \nday a 24- or 25-year-old young girl doesn't want to believe what was \ngoing to come her way. But you all are adults. You all are leaders of \nthis Nation. For you to look at these facts and conclude anything else \nwould be an injustice, because without that threat, ladies and \ngentlemen, the stories were going to grow in number, and we would have \nno admissions of ``misleading'' and ``truthful.''\n  The White House is the bully pulpit. But it should never be occupied \nby a bully. The White House will always be occupied by sinners, \nincluding our Founding Fathers, and future occupants.\n  What we do today will put a burden on the White House and the burden \non our future, one way or the other. Is it too much of a burden to say \nto future Presidents, Don't fabricate stories in front of a grand jury, \ndon't parse words, don't mislead, don't lie when you are begged not to? \nIs it too much to say to a President, If you are ever sued, play it \nstraight; don't hide the gifts under the bed, don't give people false \ntestimony, don't try to trash people who are witnesses against you? If \nthat is too much of a burden to put on the White House, this Nation is \nin hopeless decline. It is not too much of a burden, ladies and \ngentlemen. It is only common decency being applied to the occupant of \nthe White House.\n\n  To acquit under these facts will place the burden on the \nconstitutional process of impeachment and how we deal with others, \nFederal judges and other high public officials. That, I suggest to you, \nwill be almost irreconcilable.\n  I want my country to go boldly into the next century. I don't want us \nto limp into the next century. I don't want us to crawl into the next \ncentury regardless of rule of law. No matter what you do, we will make \nit. But the difference between how you vote here, I think, determines \nwhether we go boldly with the rule of law intact, or whether we have to \nexplain it for generations to come.\n  I leave with you an example that I think says much. General MacArthur \nwas removed by President Truman, a very popular fellow at the time. The \nreaction to the MacArthur dismissal was even more violent than Truman \nhad expected. And for an entire year the majority of public opinion \nranked itself ferociously against him. He said characteristically, as \nhe felt that hostile poll, ``I wonder where Moses would have gone if \nthey had taken a poll in Egypt. And what would Jesus Christ have \npreached if they had taken a poll in the land of Israel? It isn't polls \nthat count. It is right and wrong and leadership of men with fortitude, \nhonesty, and the belief in the right that make epics in the history of \nthe world.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, thank you for listening. If you \nhave any doubts about whether this President has committed high crimes, \nwe need to make sure the Senate itself has told the truth. Don't leave \nany doubts lingering, because the evidence is overwhelming that these \noffenses occurred. The crime of perjury and obstruction of justice have \ntraditionally been high crimes under our Constitution. For God's sake, \nlet it remain so. And let it be said that no President can take the \nPresidency and the bully pulpit of the Presidency and hurt average \ncitizens from it.\n  Thank you very much. I yield now to our chairman.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hyde.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, learned counsel, and the Senate, \nwe are blessedly coming to the end of this melancholy procedure. But \nbefore we gather up our papers and return to the obscurity from whence \nwe came--\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n  (Laughter.)\n  Permit, please, a few final remarks.\n  First of all, I thank the Chief Justice not only for his patience and \nhis perseverance but for the aura of dignity that he has lent to these \nproceedings. And it has been a great thrill for me to be here in his \ncompany, as well as in the company of you, distinguished Senators.\n  Secondly, I want to compliment the President's counsel. They have \nconducted themselves in the most professional way. They have made the \nmost of a poor case, in my opinion. There is an old Italian saying--and \nit has nothing to do with the lawyers, but to your case--that ``you may \ndress the shepherd in the silk, he will still smell of the goat.'' \n(Laughter.)\n  But all of you are great lawyers. And it has been an adventure being \nwith you.\n  You know, the legal profession, like politics, is ridiculed pretty \nmuch. And every lawyer feels that and understands the importance of the \nrule of law, to establish justice, to maintain the rights of mankind, \nto defend the helpless and the oppressed, to protect innocents, to \npunish guilt. These are duties which challenge the best powers of man's \nintellect and the noblest qualities of the human heart. We are here to \ndefend the bulwark of our liberty, the rule of law.\n  As to the House managers, I want to tell you and our extraordinary \nstaff how proud I am of your service. For myself, I cannot find the \nwords to adequately express how I feel. I must use the inaudible \nlanguage of the heart. I have gone through it all by your side--the \nmedia condemnation, the patronizing editorials, the hate mail, the \ninsults hurled in public, the attempts at intimidation, the death \nthreats, and even the disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the \nworst.\n  You know, all a Congressman ever gets to take with him when he leaves \nthis building is the esteem of his colleagues and his constituents--and \nwe have risked even that for a principle, for our duty, as we have seen \nit.\n  In speaking to my managers, of whom I am interminably proud, I can \nborrow the words of Shakespeare, ``Henry V,'' as he addressed his \nlittle army of longbowmen before the Battle of Agincourt. And he said:\n\n       We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\n       For he that sheds his blood with me\n       Shall be my brother\n       And gentlemen in England, now abed\n       shall think themselves accursed they\n       were not here\n       And hold their manhood cheap\n       while any speaks\n       That fought with us upon St. Chrispen's day\n  As for the juror judges, you distinguished Senators, it is always a \nvictory for democracy when its elected representatives do their duty, \nno matter how difficult and unpleasant, and we thank you for it. Please \ndon't misconstrue our fervor for our cause to any lack of respect or \nappreciation for your high office. But our most formidable opponent has \nnot been opposing counsel nor any political party; it has been the \ncynicism, the widespread conviction that all politics and all \npoliticians are, by definition, corrupt and venal.\n  That cynicism is an acid eating away at the vital organs of American \npublic life. It is a clear and present danger, because it blinds us to \nthe nobility and the fragility of being a self-governing people.\n  One of the several questions that needs answered is whether your vote \non conviction lessens or enlarges that cynicism. Nothing begets \ncynicism like the double standard--one rule for the popular and the \npowerful and another for the rest of us.\n  One of the most interesting things in this trial was the testimony of \nthe President's good friend, the former Senator from Arkansas. He did \nhis persuasive best to maintain the confusion that this is all about \nsex. Of course, it is useful for the defense to misdirect our focus to \nwhat everyone concedes are private acts and none of our business. But \nif you care to read the articles of impeachment, you won't find any \ncomplaints about private sexual misconduct. You will find charges of \nperjury and obstruction of justice which are public acts and Federal \ncrimes, especially when committed by the one person duty bound to \nfaithfully execute the laws. Infidelity is private and noncriminal. \nPerjury and obstruction are public and criminal. The deliberate focus \non what is not at issue here is a defense lawyer's tactic and nothing \nmore. This entire saga has been a theater of distraction and \nmisdirection, time-honored defense tactics when the law and the facts \nget in the way.\n  One phrase you have not heard the defense pronounce is the ``sanctity \nof the oath.'' But this case deeply involves the efficacy, the meaning, \nand the enforceability of the oath. The President's defenders stay away \nfrom the word ``lie,'' preferring ``mislead'' or ``deceive.'' But they \nshrink from the phrase ``sanctity of the oath,'' fearing it as one \nmight a rattlesnake.\n  There is a visibility factor in the President's public acts and those \nwhich betray a trust or reveal contempt for the law are hard to sweep \nunder the rug, or under the bed, for that matter. They reverberate, \nthey ricochet all over the land, and provide the worst possible example \nfor our young people. As that third-grader from Chicago wrote to me, \n``If you can't believe the President, who can you believe?\"\n  Speaking of young people, in 1946 a British playwright, Terrance \nRattigan, wrote a play based on a true experience that happened in \nEngland in 1910. The play was called ``The Winslow Boy.'' And the \nstory--as I say, a true story--involved a young 13-year-old lad who was \nkicked out of the Royal Naval College for having forged somebody else's \nsignature on a postal money order. Of course, he claimed he was \ninnocent, but he was summarily dismissed and his family, of very modest \nmeans, could not afford legal counsel, and it was a very desperate \nsituation. Sir Edward Carson, the best lawyer of his time--barrister, I \nsuppose--got interested in the case and took it on pro bono and lost \nall the way through the courts.\n  Finally, he had no other place to go, but he dug up an ancient remedy \nin England called ``petition of right.'' You ask the King for relief. \nAnd so Carson wrote out five pages of reasons why a petition of right \nshould be granted and, lo and behold, it got past the Attorney General, \nit got to the King. The King read it, agreed with it, and wrote across \nthe front of the petition, ``Let right be done. Edward VII.''\n\n  I have always been moved by that phrase. I saw the movie; I saw the \nplay; and I have the book. And I am still moved by that phrase, ``Let \nright be done.'' I hope when you finally vote that will move you, too.\n  There are some interesting parallels to our cause here today. This \nSenate Chamber is our version of the House of Lords, and while we \nmanagers cannot claim to represent that 13-year-old Winslow boy, we \nspeak for a lot of young people who look to us to set an example.\n  Ms. Seligman last Saturday said we want to win too badly. This \nsurprised me because none of the managers has committed perjury nor \nobstructed justice and claimed false privileges, none has hidden \nevidence under anyone's bed nor encouraged false testimony before the \ngrand jury. That is what you do if you want to win too badly.\n  I believe it was Saul Bellow who once said, ``A great deal of \nintelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is \ngreat.'' And those words characterize the defense in this case. ``The \nneed for illusion'' is very great.\n  I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the President \nhas repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed justice. The defense \nspent a lot of time picking lint. There is a saying in the courts, I \nbelieve, that equity will not stoop to pick up pins. But that was their \ncase. So the real issue doesn't concern the facts, the stubborn facts, \nas the defense is fond of saying, but what to do about them.\n  I am still dumbfounded about the drafts of the censures that are \ncirculating. We aren't half as tough on the President in our \nimpeachment articles as this draft is that was printed in the New York \nTimes:\n\n       An inappropriate relationship with a subordinate employee \n     in the White House which was shameless, reckless and \n     indefensible.\n\n  I have a problem with that. It seems they are talking about private \nacts of consensual sexual misconduct which are really none of our \nbusiness. But that is the leadoff.\n  Then they say:\n\n       The President deliberately misled and deceived the American \n     people and officials in all branches of the U.S. Government.\n\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\n\n  This is not a Republican document. This is coming from here.\n\n       The President gave false or misleading testimony and \n     impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.\n\n  Isn't that another way of saying obstruction of justice and perjury?\n\n       The President's conduct demeans the Office of the President \n     as well as the President himself and creates disrespect for \n     the laws of the land. Future generations of Americans must \n     know that such behavior is not only unacceptable but bears \n     grave consequences including loss of integrity, trust and \n     respect.\n\n  But not loss of job.\n\n       Whereas, William Jefferson Clinton's conduct has brought \n     shame and dishonor to himself and to the Office of the \n     President; whereas, he has violated the trust of the American \n     people--\n\n  See Hamilton Federalist No. 65--\n\n     he should be condemned in the strongest terms.\n\n  Well, the next to the strongest terms. The strongest terms would \nremove him from office.\n  Well, do you really cleanse the office as provided in the \nConstitution or do you use the Airwick of a censure resolution? Because \nany censure resolution, to be meaningful, has to punish the President, \nif only his reputation. And how do you deal with the laws of bill of \nattainder? How do you deal with the separation of powers? What kind of \na precedent are you setting?\n  We all claim to revere the Constitution, but a censure is something \nthat is a device, a way of avoiding the harsh constitutional option, \nand it is the only one we have up or down on impeachment. That, of \ncourse, is your judgment, and I am offering my views, for what they are \nworth.\n  Once in a while I do worry about the future. I wonder if, after this \nculture war is over, this one we are engaged in, an America will \nsurvive that is worth fighting for to defend.\n  People won't risk their lives for the U.N., or over the Dow Jones \naverages. But I wonder, in future generations, whether there will be \nenough vitality left in duty, honor and country to excite our children \nand grandchildren to defend America.\n  There is no denying the fact that what you decide will have a \nprofound effect on our culture, as well as on our politics. A failure \nto convict will make a statement that lying under oath, while \nunpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious. Perhaps we can \nexplain this to those currently in prison for perjury. We have reduced \nlying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the \nPresident.\n  Wherever and whenever you avert your eyes from a wrong, from an \ninjustice, you become a part of the problem.\n  On the subject of civil rights, it is my belief this issue doesn't \nbelong to anyone; it belongs to everyone. It certainly belongs to those \nwho have suffered invidious discrimination, and one would have to be \ncatatonic not to know that the struggle to keep alive equal protection \nof the law never ends. The mortal enemy of equal justice is the double \nstandard, and if we permit a double standard, even for the President, \nwe do no favor to the cause of human rights. It has been said that \nAmerica has nothing to fear from this President on the subject of civil \nrights. I doubt Paula Jones would subscribe to that endorsement.\n  If you agree that perjury and obstruction of justice have been \ncommitted, and yet you vote down the conviction, you are extending and \nexpanding the boundaries of permissible Presidential conduct. You are \nsaying a perjurer and obstructer of justice can be President, in the \nface of no less than three precedents for conviction of Federal judges \nfor perjury. You shred those precedents and you raise the most serious \nquestions of whether the President is in fact subject to the law or \nwhether we are beginning a restoration of the divine right of kings. \nThe issues we are concerned with have consequences far into the future \nbecause the real damage is not to the individuals involved, but to the \nAmerican system of justice and especially the principle that no one is \nabove the law.\n  Edward Gibbon wrote his magisterial ``Decline and Fall of the Roman \nEmpire'' in the late 18th century--in fact the first volume was issued \nin 1776. In his work, he discusses an emperor named Septimius Severus, \nwho died in 211 A.D. after ruling 18 years. And here is what Gibbon \nwrote about the emperor:\n\n       Severus promised, only to betray; he flattered only to \n     ruin; and however he might occasionally bind himself by oaths \n     and treaties, his conscience, obsequious to his interest, \n     always released him from the inconvenient obligation.\n\n  I guess those who believe history repeats itself are really onto \nsomething. Horace Mann said:\n\n       You should be ashamed to die unless you have achieved some \n     victory for humanity.\n\n  To the House managers, I say your devotion to duty and the \nConstitution has set an example that is a victory for humanity. Charles \nde Gaulle once said that France would not be true to herself unless she \nwas engaged in some great enterprise. That is true of us all. Do we \nspend our short lives as consumers, space occupiers, clock watchers, as \nspectators, or in the service of some great enterprise?\n  I believe, being a Senator, being a Congressman, and struggling with \nall our might for equal justice for all, is a great enterprise. It is \nour great enterprise. And to my House managers, your great enterprise \nwas not to speak truth to power, but to shout it. And now let us all \ntake our place in history on the side of honor and, oh, yes: Let right \nbe done.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that concludes the closing \narguments.

This Strategy renews \nand advances our efforts to counter the threat of drugs--a threat that \ncontinues to cost our Nation over 14,000 lives and billions of dollars \neach year.\n  There is some encouraging progress in the struggle against drugs. The \n1998 Monitoring the Future study found that youth drug use has leveled \noff and in many instances is on the decline--the second straight year \nof progress after years of steady increases. The study also found a \nsignificant strengthening of youth attitudes toward drugs: young people \nincreasingly perceive drug use as a risky and unacceptable behavior. \nThe rate of drug-related murders continues to decline, down from 1,302 \nin 1992 to 786 in 1997. Overseas, we have witnessed a decline in \ncocaine production by 325 metric tons in Bolivia and Peru over the last \n4 years. Coca cultivation in Peru plunged 56 percent since 1995.\n  Nevertheless, drugs still exact a tremendous toll on this Nation. In \na 10-year period, over 100,000 Americans will die from drug use. The \nsocial costs of drug use continue to climb, reaching $110 billion in \n1995, a 64 percent increase since 1990. Much of the economic burden of \ndrug abuse falls on those who do not abuse drugs--American families and \ntheir communities. Although we have made progress, much remains to be \ndone.\n  The 1999 National Drug Control Strategy provides a comprehensive \nbalanced approach to move us closer to a drug-free America. This \nStrategy presents a long-term plan to change American attitudes and \nbehavior with regard to illegal drugs. Among the efforts this Strategy \nfocuses on are:\n  --Educating children: studies demonstrate that when our children \n    understand the dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use drop. \n    Through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools Program and other efforts, we will continue to focus \non helping our youth reject drugs.\n\n  --Decreasing the addicted population: the addicted make up roughly a \n    quarter of all drug users, but consume two-thirds of all drugs in \n    America. Our strategy for reducing the number of addicts focuses on \n    closing the ``treatment gap.''\n  --Breaking the cycle of drugs and crime: numerous studies confirm \n    that the vast majority of prisoners commit their crimes to buy \n    drugs or while under the influence of drugs. To help break this \n    link between crime and drugs, we must promote the Zero Tolerance \n    Drug Supervision initiative to better keep offenders drug- and \n    crime-free. We can do this by helping States and localities to \n    implement tough new systems to drug test, treat, and punish \n    prisoners, parolees, and probationers.\n  --Securing our borders: the vast majority of drugs consumed in the \n    United States enter this Nation through the Southwest border, \n    Florida, the Gulf States, and other border areas and air and sea \n    ports of entry. The flow of drugs into this Nation violates our \n    sovereignty and brings crime and suffering to our streets and \n    communities. We remain committed to, and will expand, efforts to \n    safeguard our borders from drugs.\n  --Reducing the supply of drugs: we must reduce the availability of \n    drugs and the ease with which they can be obtained. Our efforts to \n    reduce the supply of drugs must target both domestic and overseas \n    production of these deadly substances.\n  Our ability to attain these objectives is dependent upon the \ncollective will of the American people and the strength of our \nleadership. The progress we have made to date is a credit to Americans \nof all walks of life--State and local leaders, parents, teachers, \ncoaches, doctors, police officers, and clergy. Many have taken a stand \nagainst drugs. These gains also result from the leadership and hard \nwork of many, including Attorney General Reno, Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services Shalala, Secretary of Education Riley, Treasury \nSecretary Rubin, and Drug Policy Director McCaffrey. I also thank the \nCongress for their past and future support. If we are to make further \nprogress, we must maintain a bipartisan commitment to the goals of the \nStrategy.\n  As we enter the new millennium, we are reminded of our common \nobligation to build and leave for coming generations a stronger Nation. \nOur National Drug Control Strategy will help create a safer, healthier \nfuture for all Americans.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exclusion from gross income for distributions from qualified State \ntuition programs which are used to pay education expenses; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    educational savings legislation\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce legislation that addresses an important issue facing American \nfamilies today--the education of their children. It is my long-held \nbelief that we need to make a college education more affordable, and \nthe legislation I am introducing today, the College Savings Act, will \ndo just that by providing tax incentives to families who save for \ncollege.\n\n  This legislation is a serious effort to reward long-term saving by \nmaking savings for education tax-free. It is important that we not \nforget that compounded interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants \ncan keep pace, or even ahead of, tuition increases while putting a \nlittle away at a time. By borrowing, students bear added interest costs \nthat add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings will have a \npositive impact, by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of \nthousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based \ngrants, which target low-income families, go much further.\n  Mr. President, anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the \nexpense of higher education. Throughout the 1990's, education costs \nhave continually outstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have \nnow become the greatest obstacle students face in attending college. In \nfact, the astronomical increase in college costs has been well \ndocumented. According to a study conducted by the College Board, \ntuition and fees for a four-year public university rose 107 percent \nfrom 1980-1997, while median household income rose only 12 percent.\n  Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come \nto rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of \nall college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. In \n1997-98, $60 billion in financial aid was available to students and \ntheir families from federal, state, and institutional sources. This was \n$3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase \nin aid was in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion \nof the total federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade \nago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. \nThis shift toward loans further burdens students and families with \nadditional interest costs.\n  We must reverse the dependence on federal assistance and encourage \nfamilies to save. My legislation would reward savings and allow \nstudents and families that are participating in these state-sponsored \nplans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for \nqualified educational purposes. This legislation also recognizes the \nleadership that states have provided in helping families save for \ncollege. In the mid-1980s, states identified the difficulty families \nhad in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like \nKentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were the first to start programs \nin order to help families save for college. Nationwide more than 30 \nstates have established savings programs, and over a dozen states are \npreparing to implement plans in the near future. Today, there are \nnearly one million savers who have contributed over $3 billion in \neducation savings. The provision which I authored, which allows tax-\nfree education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education \npurposes, provides nearly a $1.5 billion tax break for middle-class \nsavers nationwide. In Kentucky, over 3,720 families have established \naccounts, which amount to about $7.5 million in savings.\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with the state plan \nadministrators over the years seeking both their advice and support. \nAgain this year, I am pleased to have the National Association of State \nTreasurers and the College Savings Plans Network endorse this \nlegislation. They have worked tirelessly in support of this legislation \nbecause they know it is in the best interest of plan participants--the \nfamilies who care about their children's education.\n  Mr. President, many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it \noffers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the \naverage monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52. It is also \nimportant to note that 60 percent of the participants earn under \n$60,000 per year. By exempting all interest earnings from state taxes, \nmy legislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's \nfuture and who are committed over the long-term to the education of \ntheir children by providing a significant tax break for middle-class \nsavers nationwide. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families.\n  In 1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings exempt \nfrom taxation. Since then I have won a couple of battles, but still \nhaven't won the war. To win the war, Congress needs to make education \nsavings tax free--from start to finish. The bill I am introducing today \nwill achieve that goal.\n  In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to \nfamilies investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that \nclarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the \nparticipants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax \nuncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-\nsponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their \nchildren's education. Also in 1996, Virginia started its plan and was \noverwhelmed by the positive response. In its first year, the plan sold \n16,111 contracts raising $260 million. This success exceeded all goals \nfor this program.\n  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide maximized \nflexibility to families saving for their children's college education. \nThe most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified \neducation costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount \nfamilies could save tax-free. In Kentucky, room and board at a public \ninstitution make up half of all college costs. This important \nlegislation also expanded the definition of eligible institutions to \ninclude all schools, including certain proprietary schools, and defined \nthe term ``member of family'' to allow rollover eligibility for cousins \nand step-siblings in the event that the original beneficiary does not \nattend college.\n  Last year, the Senate passed legislation, sponsored by Senator \nCoverdell and Senator Torricelli, which would have allowed parents to \nplace as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in an education savings \naccount for kindergarten through high school education. Included in \nthis legislation was my proposal to make savings in state-sponsored \ntuition plans tax-free. Unfortunately, the bill was vetoed by President \nClinton.\n  As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more \nstate plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for \ntheir residents. It is projected that there will be 43 states with \ntuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real \nopportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to \nAmerican families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a \nquality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this \nlegislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. \nThis will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily \nburden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and \nletters endorsing my legislation from the Kentucky Higher Education \nAssistance Authority and the National Association of State Treasurers \nbe printed in the\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nRecord, along with an article from Time magazine that discusses the \npopularity of state tuition saving programs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As you think about year-end tax moves, \n     consider dropping some cash into a state-sponsored plan where \n     money for college grows tax-deferred and may garner a fat \n     state income tax exemption as well. This plan is relatively \n     new and often gets confused with more common prepaid-tuition \n     plans, in which you pay today and attend later--removing \n     worries about higher tuition in the future. Savings plans are \n     vastly different and in most cases superior because they are \n     more flexible.\n       Prepaid plans offer tax advantages, and some are portable, \n     but many still apply only to public colleges within the \n     taxpayer's state. What if Junior gets accepted to Harvard? \n     You can get your contributions back. But some states refund \n     only principal, beating you out of years' worth of investment \n     gains. And state prepaid plans make it tougher to get student \n     aid because the money is held in the student's name. With \n     savings plans the money is in a parent's name, where it \n     counts less heavily in student-aid formulas--and you can set \n     aside as much as $100,000 for expenses at any U.S. college.\n       Both the prepaid and the college-savings plans vary from \n     state to state. Check out the website ``collegesaving.org'' \n     for details. It's a fast-moving area. In the next few months, \n     eight states will join the 15 that already have state \n     college-savings programs. Those are mostly in addition to the \n     19 that have prepaid-tuition plans. Only Massachusetts will \n     probably offer both.\n       Most of the newer savings plans make contributions \n     deductible against state taxes. New York, for example, \n     launched its plan two months ago. It permits couples to set \n     aside up to $10,000 a year per student and lets New York \n     residents deduct the full amount from their income on their \n     state return. Missouri will approve a tax-deductible savings \n     plan in December. Minnesota is expected to adopt a plan in \n     which the state matches 5% of your contributions. These \n     college-savings plans are open to everyone, regardless of \n     income--in contract to the Roth IRA and other federal savings \n     plans, in which eligibility begins to phase out for couples \n     earning more than $100,000.\n       If your state doesn't offer a college-savings plan, you can \n     still participate through an out-of-state plan. You won't get \n     the state tax deduction, but you will get tax-deferred \n     investment growth; and when the money is tapped, it will be \n     taxed at the student's rate (usually 15%). Fidelity \n     Investments (800-544-1722), which runs the New Hampshire \n     savings plan, and TIAA-CREF (877-697-2337; www.nysaves.org), \n     which runs the New York plan, make it easy. If your state \n     later offers a savings plan with a tax deduction, you can \n     transfer your account penalty free.\n       Both plans invest mostly in stocks in the early years and \n     slowly shift into bonds and money markets as your student \n     nears college age. You get no say in this allocation. The \n     impact of tax deferral is big. TIAA-CREF estimates that \n     someone in the 28% tax bracket saving $5,000 a year and \n     mimicking its investments in a taxable account could expect \n     to accumulate $167,000 in 18 years.\n       Deferring taxes and then paying them at 15% brings the \n     total to $190,000. The state deduction, for those who \n     qualify, pushes the nest egg to $202,000.\n       Plan benefits:\n       Taxes are deferred and then paid at the child's lower rate;\n       Families are eligible regardless of income or state of \n     residence; and\n       Tax deductions are increasingly available on state \n     returns.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator \nMcConnell and other colleagues in launching an initiative to increase \nAmericans' access to college education. Today we are introducing the \nCollege Savings Act of 1999. This bill would allow states to offer \nprepaid college tuition and savings programs on a tax exempt basis.\n  These programs have flourished in the face of spiraling college \ncosts. According to the College Board, between 1980 and 1997, tuition \nat public colleges increased 107 percent, while the median income \nincreased just 12 percent. The cause of this dramatic increase in \ntuition is the subject of significant debate. But whether these \nincreases are attributable to increased costs to the universities, \nreductions in state funding for public universities, or the increased \nvalue of a college degree, the fact remains that financing a college \neducation has become increasingly difficult.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n  Although the federal government has increased its aid to college \nstudents over the years, it is the states who have engineered \ninnovative ways to help its families afford college. Michigan \nimplemented the first prepaid tuition plan in 1986. Florida followed in \n1988. Today 43 states have either implemented or are in the process of \nimplementing prepaid tuition plans or state savings plans.\n  Mr. President, prepaid college tuition plans allow parents to pay \nprospectively for their children's higher education at participating \nuniversities. States pool these funds and invest them in a manner that \nwill match or exceed the pace of educational inflation. This ``locks \nin'' current tuition prices and guarantees financial access to a future \ncollege education.\n  Prior to 1996, the IRS had indicated that it would treat the state \nentity that held and invested the funds as a taxable corporation. In \naddition, the IRS stated its intent to tax families annually on \nearnings on amounts transferred to a state program. In the Small \nBusiness Jobs protection Act, The 104th Congress did two things: (1) it \nsaid that provided the program met certain standards, the state program \nwould be tax exempt. (2) Congress also said that families could not be \ntaxed on earnings on an account until a distribution is made from the \nstate plan to the family or the applicable college. At that point, \nstudent beneficiary could be taxed on the earnings.\n  The following year, in the Taxpayer Relief Act, The 105th Congress \nclarified that this deferral of taxation applied not only to prepaid \ntuition but also to prospective payments for room and board.\n  Senator McConnell and I believe that The 106th Congress must go one \nstep further. Distributions from these accounts should be 100 percent \ntax free. Students should be able to enroll in college without fear of \nthem having to pay taxes on the money accrued.\n  We believe that these programs should be tax free for numerous \nreasons. First, for most families, they have in essence purchased a \nservice to be provided in the future. The accounts are not liquid. The \nfunds are transferred from the state directly to the college or \nuniversity. Under current policy, the student is required to find other \nmeans of generating the funds to pay the tax. Second, Congress should \nmake these programs tax free in order to encourage savings and college \nattendance. No longer is a student's question ``Will I be able to go to \ncollege?'' but instead ``Where will I go to college?'' Third, making \nthese accounts tax free is good education fiscal policy. For states \nthat do set up programs where they guarantee a tuition price by selling \ncontracts, the existence of these programs puts downward pressure on \neducation inflation.\n  Perhaps most importantly, prepaid tuition and savings programs help \nmiddle income families afford a college education. Florida's experience \nshows that it is not higher income families who take most advantage of \nthese plans. It is middle income families who want the discipline of \nmonthly payments. They know that they would have a difficult time \ncoming up with the funds necessary to pay for college if they waited \nuntil their child enrolled. In Florida, more than 70 percent of \nparticipants in the state tuition program have family incomes of less \nthan $50,000.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to join my colleagues in \nsupport of good tax policies which enhance our higher education goals. \nPrepaid tuition plans deserve our support through enactment of \nlegislation that would make them tax-free for American families and \nstudents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 388. A bill to authorize the establishment of a disaster \nmitigation pilot program in the Small Business Administration; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n\n\n             disaster mitigation pilot program legislation\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow original \ncosponsors, I am proud to introduce legislation which will provide a \nvaluable protection for America's small businesses.\n  This initiative would permit the Small Business Administration to use \nup to $15 million of existing disaster funds to establish a pilot \nprogram to provide small businesses with low-interest, long-term \ndisaster loans to finance preventive measures before a disaster hits.\n  Across the nation, increasing costs and personal devastation \nassociated with disasters continually plague communities. While it may \nbe impossible to prevent disasters, we believe that this legislation \nmakes it possible to limit the number of disaster victims.\n  In response to the financial and human toll caused by disasters, the \nadministration launched an approach to emergency management that moves \naway from the current reliance on response and recovery to one that \nemphasizes preparedness and prevention. The Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency established its Project Impact Program to assist \ndisaster-prone communities in developing strategies to avoid the \ncrippling effects of natural disasters.\n  Our legislation supports this approach by allowing the SBA to begin a \npilot program that would be limited to small businesses within those \ncommunities that are eligible to receive disaster loans after a \ndisaster has been declared.\n  Currently, SBA disaster loans may only be used to repair or replace \nexisting protective devices that are destroyed or damaged by a \ndisaster. The pilot program authorized by our proposal would allow \nfunds to also be used to install new mitigation devices that will \nprevent future damage. We believe that such a program would address two \nareas of need for small business--reducing the costs of recovery from a \ndisaster and reducing the costs of future disasters. Furthermore, by \ncutting those future costs, the program presents an excellent \ninvestment for taxpayers by decreasing the Federal and State funding \nrequired to meet future disaster relief needs. The ability of a small \nbusiness to borrow money through the Disaster Loan Program to help make \ntheir facility disaster resistant could mean the difference as to \nwhether that small business owner is able to reopen or forced to go out \nof business altogether after a disaster hits.\n  On behalf of my fellow cosponsors, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis effort to facilitate disaster prevention measures. Upon passage of \nthis legislation, the costs in terms of property, taxpayer dollars, and \nlives will be reduced when nature strikes in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISASTER MITIGATION PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7(b)(1) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) during fiscal years 2000 through 2004, to establish a \n     predisaster mitigation program to make such loans (either \n     directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending \n     institutions through agreements to participate on an \n     immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis), as the \n     Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate, \n     to enable small businesses to use mitigation techniques in \n     support of a formal mitigation program established by the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency, except that no loan or \n     guarantee may be extended to a small business under this \n     subparagraph unless the Administration finds that the small \n     business is otherwise unable to obtain credit for the \n     purposes described in this subparagraph;''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 20 of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 note) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Disaster Mitigation Pilot Program.--The following \n     program levels are authorized for loans under section \n     7(b)(1)(C):\n       ``(1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000.\n       ``(2) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2001.\n       ``(3) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       ``(4) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2003.\n       ``(5) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.''.\n       (c) Evaluation.--On January 31, 2003, the Administrator of \n     the Small Business Administration shall submit to the \n     Committees on Small Business of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate a report on the effectiveness of the pilot \n     program authorized by section 7(b)(1)(C) of the Small \n     Business Act\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\n     (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(C)), as added by subsection (a) of this \n     section, which report shall include--\n       (1) information relating to--\n       (A) the areas served under the pilot program;\n       (B) the number and dollar value of loans made under the \n     pilot program; and\n       (C) the estimated savings to the Federal Government \n     resulting from the pilot program; and\n       (2) such other information as the Administrator determines \n     to be appropriate for evaluating the pilot program.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Max \nCleland, in introducing the Disaster Mitigation Coordination Act of \n1999, a bill that helps our nation's small businesses save money and \nprepare for natural disasters.\n  We can't prevent disasters, but we can take measures to lessen and \nprevent the destruction that often hurts, and sometimes destroys, small \nbusinesses. Aside from avoiding inconveniences and disruptions, we know \nthat there are cost-benefits to making meaningful improvements and \nchanges to facilities before a disaster. According to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which has a disaster mitigation program \nfor communities, rather than businesses, we know that we save two \ndollars of disaster relief money for each dollar spent on disaster \nmitigation.\n  I see a great need for this type of assistance in the small business \ncommunity. This bill establishes a five-year pilot program that would \nmake low-interest, long-term loans available to small business owners \nfinancing preventive measures to protect their businesses against, and \nlessen the extent of, future disaster damage. This pilot program is \ndesigned to help those small businesses that can't get credit elsewhere \nand that are located in disaster-prone areas.\n  The small business pre-disaster mitigation loan pilot program would \nbe run as part of the Small Business Administration's regular disaster \nloan program, testing the pros and cons of preparedness versus \nreaction. Up to $15 million will be set aside for this pilot if \nenacted.\n  Only a portion of SBA's regular disaster loans, up to 20 percent, are \navailable for mitigation after a recent natural disaster. In contrast, \nthis legislation would allow 100 percent of an SBA disaster loan to be \nused for mitigation purposes within any area that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency has designated as disaster-prone. In Massachusetts, \nthat includes Marshfield and Quincy, two coastal communities that are \nprone to flooding, rainstorms and Nor'easters.\n  Nationwide, whether you're a business in Missouri or Massachusetts, \nthis pilot would allow you to take out a loan to make the improvements \nto your building or office to protect against disasters. For floods it \ncan mean elevating the foundation or relocating. For tornados it can \nmean installing storm windows and building a stronger roof. For \nhurricanes it can mean reinforcing walls. And for fires it can mean \nadding sprinklers and flame-retardant building materials.\n  The Administration supports this pilot program and included it in \nClinton's budget request this fiscal year, and again for fiscal year \n2000. The President requests that up to $15 million of the total $358 \nmillion proposed for disaster loans be used for disaster mitigation \nloans.\n  Senator Cleland and I introduced this same legislation in the last \nCongress. And although it passed committee and the full Senate without \nopposition, the House did not have time to vote on its merits before \nthe 105th Congress ended. I thank my colleagues, Senators Hollings, \nConrad, Boxer, Daschle and Harkin for sharing our concern to meet the \nneeds of our small business owners while also working to find solutions \nthat are smarter, more pro-active and more cost-effective. Mr. \nPresident, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and am hopeful it \nwill again receive the full support it deserves when it comes before \nthe Senate this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Allard, and Mr. \n        Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 389. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve and \ntransfer the jurisdiction over the troops-to-teachers program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n               troops to teachers improvement act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nTroops to Teachers Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation would help \nprovide high-quality teachers to our nation's classrooms by assisting \nand counseling retired military personnel who are interested in \nbeginning a new career as a teacher. I have worked hard with my \ncolleagues, Senators Robb and Lieberman to develop a bill which \nstrengthens, reforms and reauthorizes the current Troops to Teachers \nprogram in a manner which effectively addresses the educational needs \nof our nation's students.\n  One of the most important issues facing our nation is the education \nof our children. Providing a solid, quality education for each and \nevery child in our nation is a critical component in their quest for \npersonal success and fulfillment. A solid education for our children \nalso plays a pivotal role in the success of our nation, economically, \nintellectually, civically and morally.\n  Unfortunately, our current education system is failing to provide \nmany students with the academic skills they need. The Third \nInternational Math and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked U.S. high school \nseniors last among 16 countries in physics and next to last in math. \nThese disappointing results underscore the challenge we face in \nimproving our public schools and providing our children with a \ncompetitive, world-class education.\n  A big part of that challenge will be funding, recruiting and \nretaining quality teachers to make America's children ready for \ntomorrow, particularly in the area of math and science. The Department \nof Education estimates that the nation's local school districts will \nneed to hire more than two million teachers over the next decade to \nmeet growing enrollment demands.\n  It is essential that we work together to develop and support \ninnovative programs which help address this growing need for school \nteachers. Fortunately, an effective and innovative program for \naddressing this shortfall already exists, the Troops to Teachers \nprogram.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Troops to Teachers program was \ninitially created in 1993 to assist military personnel affected by \ndefense downsizing but were interested in utilizing their knowledge, \nprofessional skills and expertise by becoming a teacher. Unfortunately, \nthe authorization for this program is set to expire at the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  Senators Robb, Lieberman and I were disconcerted to learn that this \nsuccessful program would soon be terminated. We joined together to \ndevelop a bipartisan bill which not only reauthorizes this program but \nstrengthens and reforms it so that it more effectively meets the \nacademic needs of our students and schools.\n  Our bill reforms this program so that it operates more efficiently \nand effectively targets the educational needs of our students. First, \nour bill transfers responsibility and funding for this program from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Department of Education. I and many other \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee believe that this is \nappropriate since it targets an educational need, rather than a \nmilitary issue in our country and the Defense Department needs to use \ntheir limited resources to address a litany of problems impairing the \nreadiness of our armed forces.\n  Another important concern we address in our bill is eligibility. \nUnder the current program, military personnel are eligible for \nparticipation after serving only six years in the military. This \neligibility policy is outdated and no longer appropriate while our \nmilitary is facing a personnel retention crisis. Therefore, we have \nlimited eligibility to military personnel who retire after at least \ntwenty years of service, physically disabled personnel or individuals \nwho have served a minimum of six years and can provide documentation \nthey were affected by military downsizing.\n  Based on academic scores, particularly the TIMSS report it is evident\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nthat a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on the academic preparation \nof our children in the areas of math and science. This is why we have \nmade math, science, and special education teachers a priority for the \nTroops to Teachers program.\n  We also recognize the difficulties which face many of our schools, \nparticularly those with a large proportion of at-risk students who pose \na greater challenge to educators. Many schools are confronted with the \ndifficult task of educating children who face a litany of personal \nobstacles, including poverty, broken homes, language barriers, learning \ndisabilities and physical disabilities. We have attempted to help \nschools conquer these challenges by providing incentives for \nindividuals who commit to teaching for a minimum of four years at a \nschool with a large proportion of at-risk students and a significant \nshortage of teachers.\n  Finally, we have limited the cost of this program to the federal \ngovernment by eliminating excessive, duplicative or unnecessary \nexpenses. We have also limited administrative costs to operate this \nprogram to five percent, to ensure that federal funds being spent on \nthis program are actually benefitting our children and education \nsystem, rather than being absorbed by Washington bureaucrats.\n  ``A teacher affects eternity; they can never tell where their \ninfluence stops.'' I share this sentiment of Henry Adams, and hope that \neach of my colleagues will work with us to continue providing high \nquality, experienced and effective teachers to our children through the \nTroops to Teachers program. It is important for our children, for our \nnation and for our future.\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to be joined today by \nseveral colleagues in introducing legislation that will help with one \nof the nation's most pressing challenges for the twenty first century--\nrecruiting teachers for our public schools.\n  The deterioration of our schools is evident. The Third International \nMath and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked U.S. high school seniors last \namong 16 countries in physics and next to last in math. We are failing \nto provide the quality of education that will not only ensure each \nindividual student the skills needed for personal success and \nfulfillment, but also that the nation can maintain its economic--and \nintellectual--leadership into the next century.\n  Clearly there are many measures that must be taken to address this \nnational dilemma. Our school infrastructure is literally crumbling. I \nwas joined recently by Senator Lautenberg in introducing the Public \nSchool Modernization Act of 1999, which will support building new \nschools and repair and modernization of old schools to accommodate a \ngrowing school population and reduce class size.\n  Many schools have been left out of the information revolution. I have \nworked hard to help Virginia schools get ``wired'' to the Internet--\nindeed I've helped physically wire several schools across the \nCommonwealth.\n  But ultimately, nothing matters more for the education of our youth \nthan quality teachers. The Department of Education estimates that the \nnation's local school districts must hire more than two million \nteachers over the next decade to meet growing enrollment demands.\n  This legislation builds on an existing program--the Troops-to-\nTeachers program established originally in 1993--to help bring \nexperienced, well-disciplined role models with proven leadership skills \ninto the public school system. Since its authorization, the Troops-to-\nTeachers program has assisted thousands of military personnel who leave \nthe military to become public school teachers. Troops-to-Teachers \noffers counseling and assistance to help participants identify \nemployment opportunities and receive teacher certification. It has been \na great success, filling school vacancies in 48 states.\n  These professionals are providing what educators say they need the \nmost: mature role models, most of them male and many minorities, often \ntrained in math and science, highly motivated, and comfortable in tough \nworking environments. In fact, over three quarters are men, compared \nwith about 25 percent in the overall public school system. About half \nelect to teach in inner city or rural schools. A disproportionate share \nhave science, engineering or technical backgrounds. Retention is much \nhigher than the national average.\n  The authority for Troops-to-Teachers expires at the end of this \nfiscal year. The legislation we are introducing here today reauthorizes \nthe program and makes many refinements to encourage even more of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines to enter the noble profession of \nteaching America's youth. The legislation focuses more resources toward \ndirect financial assistance to cover teacher certification costs for \napplicants, and creates a bonus for those opting to teach in certain \nhigh need schools. Fewer resources are made available for \nadministrative and other overhead costs. The bonus, I believe, will be \nparticularly effective in attracting larger numbers of applicants. A \nrecent offering of a sign-up bonus of $20,000 in Massachusetts public \nschools led to an explosion in applications from around the country.\n  Mr. President, I urge other Senators to support this important \nlegislation and I look forward to it being brought forward for final \npassage this year.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenators McCain and Robb today in introducing legislation to extend and \nexpand the Defense Department's successful Troops to Teachers \ninitiative, which helps to steer former military personnel into \nclassroom teaching jobs.\n  To date Troops to Teachers has placed more than 3,000 retired or \ndownsized service members in public schools in 48 different states, \nproviding participants with assistance in obtaining the proper \ncertification or licensing and matching them up with prospective \nemployers. In return, these new teachers bring to the classroom what \neducators say our schools need most: mature and disciplined role \nmodels, most of them male and many of them minorities, well-trained in \nmath and science and high tech fields, highly motivated, and highly \ncapable of working in challenging environments.\n  Our bill, the Troops to Teachers Improvement Act, aims to build on \nthis success by encouraging more military retirees to move into \nteaching. It would do so by offering those departing troops new \nincentives to enter the teaching profession, particularly for those who \nare willing to serve in areas with large concentrations of at-risk \nchildren and severe shortages of qualified teaching candidates.\n  The reality is, Mr. President, that the nation as a whole is facing a \nserious teacher shortage. The Department of Education is projecting \nthat local school districts will have to hire more than two million new \nteachers over the next decade due to surging enrollments and the aging \nof America's teaching force. We were reminded again of this problem \njust this past Sunday by a front-page in the Washington Post, which \ndescribed in some detail the challenge facing school systems across the \ncountry.\n  As the Post article pointed out, this is a critical challenge for the \nnation, because our hopes of raising academic standards and student \nachievement will hinge in large part on the capabilities and talents of \nthe men and women who fill those two million places in the classroom. \nStudies show conclusively, and not surprisingly, that teacher quality \nis one of the greatest determinants of student achievement, and that \nlow-performing students make dramatic gains when they study with the \nmost knowledgeable teachers. The American public is very aware of this \ncrucial link, as evidenced in a survey done last November, in which \nnine out of 10 people listed raising teacher quality as one of our top \neducational priorities.\n  The President began to address this critical challenge with his \nproposal to hire 100,000 new teachers, a plan I was proud to cosponsor. \nThe Congress gave preliminary approval to this plan last fall through \nthe Omnibus Appropriations bill we passed, which included funding for \nthe first year of the program. I hope we will fully authorized this \nprogram this year to give local school districts full confidence that \nthe funding for their efforts will be forthcoming.\n  But the question remains who is going to fill those new positions, \nand it is this question that most concerns me. Over the last few years, \nwe have seen some troubling indications about the quality of teaching \ncandidates being\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nproduced by the nation's education schools. Most Americans would \nprobably be surprised to learn that college students who choose to go \ninto teaching today tend to fall near the bottom of their peer group \nacademically--a survey of students in 21 different fields of study \nfound that education majors ranked 17th in their performance on the \nSAT.\n  And most Americans would probably also be surprised to know that many \nof those would-be teachers are struggling to pass basic skills tests \nafter graduating from their training programs. In Massachusetts, for \nexample, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state's first-\never certification exam flunked a literacy exam that the state board of \neducation chairman rated as at ``about the eight-grade level,'' In Long \nIsland, to cite another example, only one in four teaching candidates \nin a pool of 758 could pass an English test normally given to 11th-\ngraders.\n\n  These indicators are troubling in their own right, but they are even \nmore so when we consider the pressures local school districts are under \nto fill holes in their teaching staffs. Many school systems around the \ncountry are already feeling the effects of the teacher shortage, and as \na result administrators are being forced to grant large numbers of \nemergency waivers to certification or licensure rules. This is a \ntroubling trend, because while certification is not a guarantee of \nquality, the fact that so many schools are lowering their standards to \nfill vacancies only heightens the chance that children in those schools \nwill be struck with an unqualified instructor.\n  In light of all of these developments, I think it is imperative that \nwe search for new ways to attract more of the nation's best and \nbrightest to the classroom, and we look beyond our education schools to \ntap new pools of talent. That is why I am so enthusiastic about the \ncreative approach taken by the Troops to Teachers program. I can't \nthink of a better source of teaching candidates than the smart, \ndisciplined and dedicated men and women who leave the military every \nyear, or a better return on the investment we as taxpayers have made in \ntheir training.\n  A recent evaluation done by the non-partisan National Center for \nEducation Information reveals that the troops who have participated so \nfar have excelled in their new careers.\n\n       Our research shows that military people transition \n     extremely well into teaching,'' said NCEI President Emily \n     Feistritzers. ``They are a rich source of teachers in all the \n     areas where we need teachers--geographically and by subject \n     area. There are more males among them than in normal \n     recruiting, and they are very committed; they are going into \n     teaching for all the right reasons.\n\n  The NCEI study found that 90 percent of program participants were \nmale, in comparison to the current teaching force, which is three-\nquarters female; that more than 75 percent of the troops were teaching \nin inner cities or in small towns and rural areas, often where \nshortages are most acute and where strong male role models are most \nneeded; and that 85 percent of the troops who started teaching over he \nlast four years are still on the job, a retention rate far higher than \nfor other new educators.\n  One of the most important needs these troops are filling is in math \nand science classes. Several surveys have shown that a startling number \nof the men and women who are teaching math and science in middle and \nhigh schools today are not trained in these fields. This problem is \nespecially severe in inner city school districts, where approximately \nhalf of all math and science teachers lack a major or minor in their \nfield. The soldiers who are participating in Troops to Teachers often \nhave advanced training in engineering and technology, and are well-\nequipped to prepare our children for the demands of the Information Age \neconomy.\n  It there is one place where Troops to Teachers is falling short, it \nis in the number of participants. According to the Defense Department, \nless than 2 percent of the military personnel who have been eligible \nfor the program have participated in the past five years. This is due \nin part, we believe, to the fact that Congress has not appropriated any \nmoney for the program in the last four years, and thereby stopped \nproviding any financial support to troops who often incur thousands of \ndollars in costs for certification and relocations.\n  The central goal of our legislation--beyond renewing the program's \nauthorization, which expires at the end of this fiscal--is to boost \nthat participation rate, to persuade more troops to embrace a new way \nto serve their nation. Our bill would authorize $25 million for each of \nthe next five years, the bulk of which would go toward funding stipends \nof $5,000 to participants who commit to teach four years, and a special \n``bonus'' stipend of $10,000 to troops who commit to teach in high-\nneeds areas, which we hope will spur more former service members to \nconsider teaching.\n\n  I particularly hope our legislation will increase participation in my \nstate of Connecticut. According to the Defense Department, only six \ntroops have been placed in teaching jobs in Connecticut to date, which \nis disappointing given the significant number of military personnel \nlocated in the state. The Connecticut Department of Education believes \nlocal school districts could substantially benefit from this untapped \nresource, and for that reason the department has strongly voiced its \nsupport for our legislation.\n  Even with the new incentives we are creating, which we hope will \nrecruit as many as 3,000 new teachers each year, we recognize that \nTroops to Teachers will still only make a modest dent in solving the \nnational shortage. But we will, with an extremely modest investment, \nmake a substantial contribution to our common goals of raising teaching \nstandards and helping our children realize their potential. And we may \nwell galvanize support for a recruitment method that, as Education \nSecretary Richard Riley has suggested, could serve as a model for \nbringing many more bright, talented people from different professions \nto serve in our public schools and raise teaching standards there.\n  The President has already expressed his strong support for our \nefforts to renew and revitalize Troops to Teachers, including new \nfunding for it in his FY 2000 budget request. I hope my colleagues will \njoin the impressive bipartisan coalition of cosponsors we have already \nassembled in supporting our legislation. We have a great opportunity \nhere to harness a unique national resource to meet a pressing national \nneed, and I hope we will seize it this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 1999]\n\n          Teacher Shortage Stymies Efforts To Cut Class Sizes\n\n                          (By Amy Argetsinger)\n\n       In 1996, California enacted perhaps the most ambitious \n     education initiative of the decade--a $1 billion program to \n     reduce the size of elementary school classes by hiring 20,000 \n     extra teachers.\n       Parents cheered the plan, and other states--including \n     Maryland and Virginia--have rushed to imitate it. President \n     Clinton joined in, too, promising a national plan to help \n     hire 100,000 teachers in the next several years.\n       But California's effort instantly posed a question that is \n     likely to be echoed across the country as many schools embark \n     on a historic hiring binge:\n       Where are all these new teachers supposed to come from?\n       California found enough teachers--but only by draining its \n     substitute pools, raiding private schools, recruiting from \n     other states and Mexico and hiring thousands without state \n     teaching licenses. Today, about 10 percent of the state's \n     teachers are working with ``emergency'' credentials.\n       It's a problem that could appear in many other school \n     districts that are bracing for their worst teacher shortages \n     in years, at the same time they are trying to fulfill the \n     popular education reform goals of raising teacher standards \n     and reducing class sizes.\n       Already, in Prince George's County, an early collision of \n     these goals suggests that sometimes something has to give. \n     When Gov. Parris N. Glendening (D) promised to hire 1,100 new \n     teachers, he also warned that school districts must have at \n     least 98 percent of their teachers with full state \n     certification by 2002 or risk losing the new funds. But in \n     counties such as Prince George's, which offers mid-range \n     salaries and where only 87 percent of teachers are fully \n     certified, officials complain they cannot possibly improve \n     their numbers that fast.\n       This week, aides said the governor may consider giving some \n     districts more time to reach the goal.\n       ``It's a very delicate balancing act,'' warned Lawrence E. \n     Leak, Maryland's assistant superintendent of schools. ``Each \n     one of those issues''--shortages, standards and class\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\n     sizes--``are compelling with respect to wanting quality \n     teachers in the classroom.''\n       Last fall, public school officials throughout the \n     Washington area and across the country found themselves \n     scrambling to fill last-minute teaching vacancies. Most were \n     in science and math classes, where instructors can command \n     much higher salaries in booming high-tech private industries. \n     Many districts also reported shortages of special education \n     teachers.\n       Yet a more serious and widespread shortage is looming. In \n     the next decade, rising student enrollments and a wave of \n     baby-boomer retirements will require 2 million new teachers, \n     according to the U.S. Department of Education. Meanwhile, \n     teacher colleges in many parts of the country are turning out \n     fewer graduates--a phenomenon attributed to both the low \n     birth rates of the mid-1970s and that generation's reluctance \n     to enter such a demanding but low-paying field.\n       School districts have responded by cranking up recruitment \n     efforts, setting off early across the country in search of \n     top teacher candidates, forging ties with education schools, \n     and piling on the incentives. Baltimore schools last year \n     started offering job prospects $5,000 toward closing costs on \n     a new home in the city. Some North Carolina districts promise \n     6.5 percent annual raises. Massachusetts caused a sensation \n     this month by offering top teaching-school graduates the \n     chance to apply for competitive $20,000 signing bonuses.\n       At the University of Virginia last week, a record 210 \n     recruiters showed up at a job fair to woo a graduating class \n     of only 150 teaching majors--20 of whom were already spoken \n     for.\n       ``It's unheard of,'' said Gigi Davis-White, a career-\n     planning director at the university's Curry School of \n     Education. ``I had recruiters complaining. . . . They'd never \n     really had to work that fast.''\n       The demand is not limited to students with an education \n     degree, she said. ``If you have a math, science or foreign \n     language background, they'll provisionally certify you and \n     get you in the classroom.''\n       Deeply concerned about the looming shortages, Maryland \n     legislators are weighing a passel of measures to lure more \n     people into teaching.\n       Glendening is promoting full scholarships for students who \n     promise to teach in Maryland schools. And although a pitch by \n     state Superintendent of Schools Nancy S. Grasmick to give \n     teachers tax breaks found no sponsor, proposals now before \n     the state General Assembly include $3,000 signing bonuses for \n     top graduates, tax credits to reward graduate studies, \n     stipends for high-performing teachers, and pension \n     protections to encourage retired teachers to return to the \n     classroom. Sen. Gloria G. Lawlah (D-Prince George's) is \n     proposing scholarships for students who promise to teach in \n     Prince George's and property tax breaks for county teachers.\n       Yet some say such efforts fall short. Karl Pence, president \n     of the Maryland State Teachers Association, said state \n     officials need to focus less on quick fixes and cash bonuses \n     than on making teaching a more desirable and respected \n     profession.\n       ``There are lots of teachers who would accept challenges of \n     working in at-risk schools if they could have reasonable \n     class size, the materials they need, clean and safe \n     buildings, and technology right there in the classroom,'' \n     he said.\n       But the best attempts to fight the teacher shortage may be \n     complicated by efforts to reduce class size--which require \n     hiring even more teachers.\n       It's one of the most politically popular issues of the day: \n     Many parents and politicians insist that with fewer students \n     in a room, a teacher can provide more individual attention to \n     each and thus enrich the learning experience. Clinton's \n     proposal won funding for a first-stage hire of 30,000 \n     teachers who will join the nation's classrooms this fall.\n       Meanwhile, both Glendening and Virginia Gov. James S. \n     Gilmore III (R) are touting their own class-size reduction \n     plans, now under consideration in their state legislatures. \n     And individual school districts--including Montgomery and \n     Howard counties and Alexandria--are pouring money into \n     similar programs. (D.C. officials have no plan to reduce \n     their relatively small class sizes, although they agree that \n     teachers are always at a premium.)\n       Most of the class-size reduction plans are aimed at \n     kindergarten through third grade, where researchers believe \n     children are best served by the extra attention. Some plans \n     also would add more teachers in seventh- or ninth-grade math, \n     another critical juncture for students.\n       Some analysts argue that smaller classes--though increasing \n     the demand for teachers--may help solve the shortages by \n     making teaching more appealing. In California, schools had \n     little trouble finding teachers for the new first- and \n     second-grade slots, which promised no more than 20 students a \n     class.\n       The catch, however, was that many of them deserted posts in \n     crowded middle school classrooms to take the new jobs--\n     leaving a void in the upper-grade teaching ranks.\n       At the same time, politicians have increasingly made an \n     issue about the quality of public school teachers. Virginia \n     last year set the highest cutoff score in the nation on the \n     standardized test for aspiring teachers. Maryland, meanwhile, \n     has set several new hurdles for teachers, requiring them to \n     take several more reading courses for certification and \n     linking their license renewal to regular evaluations.\n       Lately in Maryland, state officials also have raised \n     concerns about the large number of teachers lacking full \n     certification, especially in Prince George's County and \n     Baltimore. Fully certified teachers generally must pass a set \n     of approved education courses, have some student teaching \n     experience and pass a national teacher's exam.\n       Officials in these districts maintain that just because a \n     teacher is uncertified doesn't mean he or she is a bad \n     teacher--many of the ``provisionally'' certified teachers are \n     close to completing the requirements for licensure.\n       But they also complain that their smaller budgets and \n     larger enrollments make it hard to vie for the dwindling pool \n     of qualified applicants. ``The competition is intense,'' said \n     Louise F. Waynant, Prince George's deputy superintendent of \n     schools. ``And we do find that school districts with \n     higher teacher salaries have a bit of an advantage.''\n       Gordon Ambach, the executive director of the Council of \n     Chief State School Officers, argues that the teacher shortage \n     will have little effect on affluent suburbs but will hit hard \n     in school systems such as Prince George's and the District, \n     which have greater pockets of poor and immigrant students.\n       But some education analysts--especially advocates for \n     teaching--see opportunity in the teacher crunch. Linda \n     Darling-Hammond, executive director of the National \n     Commission on Teaching and America's Future, notes that some \n     parts of the country produce more than enough teachers, but \n     that those instructors cannot easily get licensed in other \n     states. She said states should offer more reciprocity in \n     teacher licensing.\n       She also said the real shortage problem stems from high \n     rates of attrition--almost 30 percent of teachers drop out \n     within five years. ``We waste a lot of money and time and \n     effort with the revolving door,'' Darling-Hammond said, \n     ``trying to recruit people, then treating them badly and \n     watching them leave.''\n       David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers Inc., \n     said school systems need to offer mentoring programs for \n     struggling new teachers--such a plan has been proposed in the \n     Maryland General Assembly. And he said he hopes the crunch \n     will inspire local officials to consider raising salaries and \n     otherwise improve teachers' working conditions.\n       ``The opportunity is to use this moment in time--when we \n     are going to be doing a substantial amount of hiring--to \n     rethink significantly how we prepare and support teachers for \n     the 21st century.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 390. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to allow \nworkers who attain age 65 after 1981 and before 1992 to choose either \nlump sum payments over four years totaling $5,000 or an improved \nbenefit computation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the \ntransition to the changes in benefit computation rules enacted in the \nSocial Security Amendments of 1977, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would correct a problem that plagues a special group of older \nAmericans. I am speaking on behalf of those affected by the Social \nSecurity notch.\n  For my colleagues who may not be aware, the Social Security notch \ncauses 11 million Americans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive \nless in Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch \nyears due to changes made in the 1977 Social Security benefit formula.\n  I have felt compelled over the years to speak out about this issue \nand the injustice it imposes on millions of Americans. The notch issue \nhas been debated and debated, studied and studied, yet to date, no \nsolution to it has been found. Because of this, many older Americans \nborn during this period must scrimp to afford the most basic of \nnecessities.\n  Mr. President, I am the first to acknowledge that with any projected \nbudget surplus we must save Social Security. In many ways, my \nlegislation does just this. It restores confidence to the many notch \nvictims around the country and will show them that we in Congress will \naccept responsibility for any error that was made. We should not ask \nthem to accept less as a result of our mistake. While we must save \nSocial Security for the future, we have an obligation to those, who \nthrough no fault of their own, receive less than those that were \nfortunate enough to be born just days before or after the notch period.\n  I believe we owe a debt to notch babies. Like any American family, we \nmust first pay the bills before we invest in the future. We have the \nresources to make good on our debt to notch babies. We should come \nforward and honor our commitment.\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n  Mr. President, the ``notch'' situation had its origins in 1972, when \nCongress decided to create automatic cost-of-living adjustments to help \nSocial Security benefits keep pace with inflation. Previously, each \nadjustment had to await legislation, causing beneficiaries' monthly \npayments to lag behind inflation. When Congress took this action, it \nwas acting under the best of intentions.\n  Unfortuately, this new benefit adjustment method was flawed. To \nfunction properly, it required that the economy behave in much the same \nfashion that it had in the 1950s and 1960s, with annual wage increases \noutpacing prices, and inflation remaining relatively low. As we all \nknow, that did not happen. The rapid inflation and high unemployment of \nthe 1970s generated increases in benefits. In an effort to end this \nproblem, in 1977 Congress revised the way that benefits were computed. \nIn making its revisions, Congress decided that it was not proper to \nreduce benefits for persons already receiving them; it did, however, \ndecide that benefits for all future retirees should be reduced. As a \nresult, those born after January 1, 1917 would, by design, receive \nbenefits that were, in many cases, far less. In an attempt to ease the \ntransition to the new, lower benefit levels, Congress designed a \nspecial `transitional computation method' for use by beneficiaries born \nbetween 1917 and 1921.\n\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to convey to our constituents \nthat Social Security is a fair system. In town hall meetings back home \nin Nevada, I have a hard time trying to tell that to a notch victim. \nThey feel slighted by their government and if I were in their \nsituation, I would too. Through no fault of their own, they receive \nless, sometimes as much as $200 less, than their neighbors.\n  The legislation I am offering today is my proposal to right the \nwrong. I propose using any projected budget surplus to pay the lump sum \nbenefit to notch babies. While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch \nproblem once and for all and restore the confidence of the ten million \nnotch babies across this land.\n  Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been \nin the case of notch babies. My support of notch babies is \nlongstanding. I introduced the only notch amendment in April 1991 that \never passed in Congress as part of the fiscal year 1992 Budget \nResolution. Unfortunately, it did not become the law of the land as it \nwas dropped in Conference with the House of Representatives. I have \ncosponsored numerous pieces of legislation over the years to address \nthis issue. With this legislation, my effort continues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for payments to children's hospitals that \noperate graduate medical education programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n        CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nproposal to provide critical support to teaching programs at free-\nstanding children's hospitals. I am also honored to be joined by \nSenators Bond, Kennedy, Durbin, DeWine, Moynihan, Graham, Gorton, \nInouye, Mack, and Murray as original cosponsors. And I am gratified to \nnote that the President's budget submission for FY 2000 also includes \nfunding for teaching programs at these hospitals.\n  Children's hospitals play an important role in our nation's health \ncare system. They combine high-quality clinical care, a vibrant \nteaching mission and leading pediatric biomedical research within their \nwalls. They provide specialized regional services, including complex \ncare to chronically ill children, and serve as safety-net providers to \nlow-income children.\n  Teaching is an inherent component of these hospitals' day-to-day \noperations. These hospitals train twenty-nine percent of the nation's \npediatricians, and the majority of America's pediatric specialists. \nPediatric residents develop the skills they need to care for our \nnation's children at these institutions.\n  In addition, these hospitals effectively combine the joint missions \nof teaching and research. Scientific discovery depends on the strong \nacademic focus of teaching hospitals. The teaching environment attracts \nacademics devoted to research. It attracts the volume and spectrum of \ncomplex cases needed for clinical research. And the teaching mission \ncreates the intellectual environment necessary to test the conventional \nwisdom of day-to-day health care and foster the questioning that leads \nto breakthroughs in research. Because these hospitals combine research \nand teaching in a clinical setting, these breakthroughs can be rapidly \ntranslated into patient care.\n  Children's hospitals have contributed to advances in virtually every \naspect of pediatric medicine. Thanks to research efforts at these \nhospitals, children can survive once-fatal diseases such as polio, grow \nand thrive with disabilities such as cerebral palsy, and overcome \njuvenile diabetes to become self-supporting adults.\n  Through patient care, teaching and research, these hospitals \ncontribute to our communities in many ways. However, their training \nprograms--and their ability to fulfill their critical role in America's \nhealth care system--are being gradually undermined by dwindling \nfinancial support. Maintaining a vibrant teaching and research program \nis more expensive than simply providing patient care. The nation's \nteaching hospitals have historically relied on additional support--\nsupport beyond the cost of clinical care itself--in order to finance \ntheir teaching programs. Today, competitive market pressures provide \nlittle incentive for private payers to contribute towards teaching \ncosts. At the same time, the increased use of managed care plans within \nthe Medicaid program has decreased the availability of teaching dollars \nthrough Medicaid. Therefore, Medicare's support for graduate medical \neducation is more important than ever.\n  Independent children's hospitals, however, serve an extremely small \nnumber of Medicare patients. Therefore, they do not receive Medicare \ngraduate medical education payments to support their teaching \nactivities. The most significant source of graduate medical education \nfinancing is, in large part, not available to these hospitals.\n  This proposal will address, for the short-term, this unintended \nconsequence of current public policy. It will provide time-limited \nsupport to help children's hospitals train tomorrow's pediatricians, \ninvestigate new treatments and pursue pediatric biomedical research. It \nwill establish a four-year fund, which will provide children's \nhospitals with Federal teaching payments that are based on their per \nresident costs and the complexity of their patient population. Total \nspending over four years will be less than a billion dollars.\n  This proposal does not solve the fundamental dilemma of how to cover \nthe cost of training our nation's doctors. Congress has charged the \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare with developing \nrecommendations on this important question--and Congress has directed \nthe Commission to examine teaching support for children's hospitals \nwithin these recommendations. I believe the Commission's recommendation \nwill recognize the need to include children's hospitals within the \nframework of graduate medical education. But in the meantime, this \nproposal provides the support these hospitals need until these broader \nquestions are answered and addressed.\n  All American families have great dreams for their children. These \nhopes include healthy, active, happy childhoods, so they seek the best \npossible health care for their children. And when these dreams are \nthreatened by a critical illness, they seek the expertise of highly-\ntrained pediatricians and pediatric specialists, and rely on the \nresearch discoveries fostered by children's hospitals. All families \ndeserve a chance at the American dream. Through this legislation, we \nwill help children's hospitals--hospitals such as Children's Hospital \nin Omaha, Boys' Town, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Children's \nHospital in Boston, Children's Hospital in Seattle+ and others--train \nthe doctors and do the research necessary to fulfill this dream. \nThrough this legislation, Congress will be doing its part to help \nAmerican families work towards a successful future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (B) the number of full-time equivalent residents in the \n     hospital's approved medical residency training programs (as \n     determined under section 1886(h)(4) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(4))) for the cost reporting period.\n       (2) Updated per resident amount for direct medical \n     education.--The updated per resident amount for direct \n     medical education for a hospital for a cost reporting period \n     ending in a fiscal year is an amount equal to the per \n     resident amount for cost reporting periods ending during \n     fiscal year 1999 for the hospital involved (as determined by \n     the Secretary using the methodology described in section \n     1886(h)(2)(E)) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(2)(E))) \n     increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price \n     Index for All Urban Consumers (United States city average) \n     from fiscal year 1999 through the fiscal year involved.\n       (c) Amount of Payment for Indirect Medical Education.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount determined under this \n     subsection for payments to a children's hospital for indirect \n     expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill \n     patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of \n     residents for a cost reporting period beginning in or after \n     fiscal year 2000 and before fiscal year 2004 is equal to an \n     amount determined appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (2) Factors.--In determining the amount under paragraph \n     (1), the Secretary shall--\n       (A) take into account variations in case mix among \n     children's hospitals and the number of full-time equivalent \n     residents in the hospitals' approved medical residency \n     training programs for the cost reporting period; and\n       (B) assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect \n     expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill \n     patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of \n     residents under this section in a fiscal year are equal to \n     the amount appropriated for such expenses in such year under \n     subsection (e)(2).\n       (d) Making of Payments.--\n       (1) Interim payments.--The Secretary shall estimate, before \n     the beginning of each cost reporting period for a hospital \n     for which the payments may be made under this section, the \n     amounts of the payments for such period and shall (subject to \n     paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in 26 equal \n     interim installments during such period.\n       (2) Withholding.--The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 \n     percent from each interim installment paid under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reconciliation.--At the end of each such period, the \n     hospital shall submit to the Secretary such information as \n     the Secretary determines to be necessary to determine the \n     percent (if any) of the total amount withheld under paragraph \n     (2) that is due under this section for the hospital for the \n     period. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall \n     recoup any overpayments made, or pay any balance due. The \n     amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary \n     determination for purposes of applying section 1878 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395oo) and shall be subject \n     to review under that section in the same manner as the amount \n     of payment under section 1886(d) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(d)) is subject to review under such section.\n       (e) Limitation on Expenditures.--\n       (1) Direct medical education.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), there are \n     hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not \n     otherwise appropriated, for payments under this section for \n     direct expenses relating to approved medical residency \n     training programs for cost reporting periods beginning in--\n       (i) fiscal year 2000, $35,000,000;\n       (ii) fiscal year 2001, $95,000,000;\n       (iii) fiscal year 2002, $95,000,000; and\n       (iv) fiscal year 2003, $95,000,000.\n       (B) Carryover of excess.--If the amount of payments under \n     this section for cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal \n     year 2000, 2001, or 2002 is less than the amount provided \n     under this paragraph for such payments for such periods, then \n     the amount available under this paragraph for cost reporting \n     periods beginning in the following fiscal year shall be \n     increased by the amount of such difference.\n       (2) Indirect medical education.--There are hereby \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, for payments under this section for indirect \n     expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill \n     patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of \n     residents for cost reporting periods beginning in--\n       (A) fiscal year 2000, $65,000,000;\n       (B) fiscal year 2001, $190,000,000;\n       (C) fiscal year 2002, $190,000,000; and\n       (D) fiscal year 2003, $190,000,000.\n       (f) Relation to Medicare and Medicaid Payments.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, payments under \n     this section to a hospital for a cost reporting period--\n       (1) are in lieu of any amounts otherwise payable to the \n     hospital under section 1886(h) or 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h); 1395ww(d)(5)B)) to the \n     hospital for such cost reporting period, but\n       (2) shall not affect the amounts otherwise payable to such \n     hospitals under a State medicaid plan under title XIX of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n       (g) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Approved medical residency training program.--The term \n     ``approved medical residency training program'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 1886(h)(5)(A) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(5)(A)).\n       (2) Children's hospital.--The term ``children's hospital'' \n     means a hospital described in section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iii) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(1)(B)(iii)).\n       (3) Direct graduate medical education costs.--The term \n     ``direct graduate medical education costs'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 1886(h)(5)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(5)(C)).\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America's children--from the \nsmallest premature baby to the tallest teenager--deserve access to \ndoctors trained specifically in meeting their health needs. I commend \nSenator Kerrey's leadership in this bipartisan legislation introduced \ntoday to provide greater support to children's hospitals, so that they \ncan continue to train the kinds of doctors that children need.\n  In the United States, there are 53 freestanding pediatric hospitals--\nless than 1% of all the hospitals in the country. Yet they train more \nthan a quarter of all pediatricians and more than half of all pediatric \nspecialists. These hospitals also help train other doctors who need \nexperience in taking care of children--including family doctors, \nneurologists, and surgeons.\n  Children's hospitals typically provide care for the sickest \nchildren--those whose medical needs are not easily met in the local and \ncommunity hospitals. Patients in children's hospitals include a higher \npercentage of our nation's uninsured children and low-income children. \nThese hospitals are the source of many new lifesaving strategies, such \nas treating childhood cancer and helping premature babies to breathe.\n  But the ability of children's hospitals to train doctors is in \nincreasing jeopardy. Funds for training residents are declining as \nchanges take place in the ways we pay for our health care. For most \nhospitals, support for graduate medical education is funded through \nMedicare. But since freestanding children's hospitals treat almost no \nMedicare patients, they receive almost no federal support or other \nsupport for training their residents.\n  Democrats and Republicans recognize that qualified children's \nphysicians are needed as much as other types of physicians. Under this \nbill, the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to \nprovide support to freestanding children's hospitals for such training. \nIt means that children's hospitals will receive the same level of \nsupport that this country gives to other teaching hospitals. Under this \nlegislation funds will be distributed fairly, by using a formula that \nconsiders variations across the country in the cost of such training. \nSafeguards are included to guarantee that the dollars are spent only \nwhen residents are actually trained.\n  President Clinton's budget recognizes this high priority. It includes \na $40 million downpayment until this legislation is enacted.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto assure early passage of this needed legislation. I commend both the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nand the First Lady for their strong commitment to children and for \ntheir indispensable leadership on this important issue. Action by \nCongress is needed now. We must work together to make a long-term \ncommitment to enable children's hospitals to train the physicians of \nthe future to care for children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 392. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at West 920 Riverside Avenue in Spokane, Washington, \nas the ``Thomas S. Foley Federal Building and United States \nCourthouse,'' and the plaza at the south entrance of that building and \ncourthouse as the ``Walter F. Horan Plaza''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n     THOMAS S. FOLEY FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation \ndesignating the federal building located at West 920 Riverside Avenue, \nSpokane, Washington, as the ``Thomas S. Foley Federal Building and \nUnited States Courthouse.'' The bill also designates the plaza located \nimmediately in front of the building as the ``Walter F. Horan Plaza.''\n  Speaker Tom Foley had a long and distinguished career in the United \nStates House of Representatives. He served for 30 years, concluding his \nservice as Speaker of the House in the 103rd Congress. He was also \nSpeaker in the 102nd Congress, and held positions as Majority Leader, \nMajority Whip, and Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Speaker \nFoley now serves as our nation's Ambassador to Japan.\n  Tom Foley is a native of Spokane, Washington, and earned his \nundergraduate and law degree from the University of Washington. His \nparents were highly respected citizens of Spokane.\n  Mr. Foley personified the high ideal to which all of us aspire as \npublic servants and Members of Congress. First and foremost he was a \ngentleman who sought consensus, recognizing the value of maintaining a \ngood working relationship among colleagues. He loved Congress, and \nbelieved it to be the best forum for democracy in the world.\n  Speaker Foley worked tirelessly to promote and strengthen the \nNorthwest's economy. During my first two years as a Senator, I enjoyed \nworking with him and I am proud of our joint efforts to help our \nconstituents, especially in the successful promotion of Washington \nwheat and apples on both domestic and international markets. Without \nMr. Foley, we would likely not be exporting our agricultural products \nto as many destinations across the globe as we do. Today, he continues \nto see that our goods are sold in places, such as Japan, that \nhistorically have had tightly controlled markets.\n  Today I also honor another Washington native, Walter F. Horan. He \nserved 22 years, from 1943 to 1965, as the Congressman from eastern \nWashington. Representative Horan was raised in Wenatchee, served in the \nNavy during the First World War, graduated from Washington State \nUniversity in Pullman, and raised apples on his family farm.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Representative Horan was \nan excellent advocate for western interests, especially those of his \nconstituents in eastern Washington. As a farmer himself, he knew the \nneeds of the people he served and urged the Congress to pass laws to \nensure their economic prosperity. He died in 1966 and is buried in his \nbeloved hometown of Wenatchee.\n  It is my honor to sponsor legislation that permanently recognizes the \ncontributions these two Washingtonians have made to my state and our \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THOMAS S. FOLEY FEDERAL BUILDING \n                   AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal building and United States \n     courthouse located at West 920 Riverside Avenue in Spokane, \n     Washington, shall be known and designated as the ``Thomas S. \n     Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Thomas S. Foley Federal Building and United States \n     Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF WALTER F. HORAN PLAZA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The plaza located at the south entrance of \n     the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to \n     in section 1(a) shall be known and designated as the ``Walter \n     F. Horan Plaza''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     plaza referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Walter F. Horan Plaza''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect on March 6, 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas King Hussein ibn Talal al-Hashem was born in Amman \n     on November 14, 1935;\n       Whereas he was proclaimed king of Jordan in August of 1952 \n     at the age of 17 following the assassination of his \n     grandfather, King Abdullah and the abdication of his father, \n     Talal;\n       Whereas King Hussein became the longest serving head of \n     state in the Middle East, working with every U.S. President \n     since Dwight D. Eisenhower;\n       Whereas under King Hussein, Jordan has instituted wide-\n     ranging democratic reforms;\n       Whereas throughout his life, King Hussein survived multiple \n     assassination attempts, plots to overthrow his government and \n     attacks on Jordan, invariably meeting such attacks with \n     fierce courage and devotion to his Kingdom and its people;\n       Whereas despite decades of conflict with the State of \n     Israel, King Hussein invariably maintained a dialogue with \n     the Jewish state, and ultimately signed a full-fledged peace \n     treaty with Israel on October 26, 1994;\n       Whereas King Hussein has established a model for Arab-\n     Israeli coexistence in Jordan's ties with the State of \n     Israel, including deepening political and cultural relations, \n     growing trade and economic ties and other major \n     accomplishments;\n       Whereas King Hussein contributed to the cause of peace in \n     the Middle East with tireless energy, rising from his sick \n     bed at the last to assist in the Wye Plantation talks between \n     the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas King Hussein fought cancer with the same courage he \n     displayed in tirelessly promoting and making invaluable \n     contributions to peace in the Middle East;\n       Whereas on February 7, 1999, King Hussein succumbed to \n     cancer in Amman, Jordan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, (The House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     family of King Hussein and to all the people of Jordan in \n     this difficult time;\n       (2) expresses admiration for King Hussein's enlightened \n     leadership and gratitude for his support for peace throughout \n     the Middle East;\n       (3) expresses its support and best wishes for the new \n     government of Jordan under King Abdullah;\n       (4) reaffirms the United States commitment to strengthening \n     the vital relationship between our two governments and \n     peoples;\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, last Saturday, together with my \ncolleagues Senators Kerry, Jeffords, Hollings, Thurmond, Harkin, \nMurray, Smith of Oregon, Johnson, and Wyden. I introduced ``The Bond \nFairness and Protection Act of 1999.'' This is a bi-partisan compromise \napproach to legislation addressing the tax consequences of electricity \nrestructuring on tax-exempt bonds that are issued by municipally-owned \nor state-owned utilities (often referred to as ``publicly-owned'' \nutilities) for the generation, transmission, and distribution of \nelectricity.\n  As my colleagues may recall, last Congress I introduced a \nsubstantially similar bill, S. 2182, with eleven cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress did not have an \nopportunity to address this or other proposals on electricity \nrestructuring. This year we have worked to simplify and refine last \nyear's legislation in response to thoughtful comments we received last \nyear, and in an effort to facilitate timely consideration of the \nlegislation in this Congress.\n  Despite the lack of Federal legislation in this policy area, 18 \nstates have already gone forward and begun to allow retail market \nchoice for electricity consumers at the state and local level. The era \nof retail competition has already started both for publicly-owned and \ninvestor-owned utilities operating in these states.\n  Until recently, publicly-owned utilities have been able to operate \nunder a strict regime of Federal tax rules governing their ability to \nissue tax-exempt bonds. These rules were enacted in an era when \ndecision makers did not contemplate retail or wholesale electricity \ncompetition. These so-called ``private use'' rules limit the amount of \nelectricity that publicly-owned utilities may sell to private entities \nthrough facilities that are financed with tax-exempt bonds. For years, \nthe private use rules were cumbersome but manageable. As states move to \nrestructure the electricity industry however, the private use rules \nwere threatening many public power communities with significant \nfinancial penalties as they adjust to the changing marketplace. In \neffect, the rules are forcing publicly-owned utilities to face the \nprospects of violating the private use rules, or walling off their \ncustomers from competition. In either case, this will raise rates for \nconsumers--the precise opposite of what restructuring is intended to \nachieve. The consumer can only lose when the marketplace operates in \nthis inefficient manner.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would protect all \nconsumers by grandfathering outstanding tax-exempt bonds, but only if \nthe issuing municipality or state utility elects to terminate \npermanently its ability to issue tax-exempt debt to build new \ngenerating facilities. Such an election would not affect transmission \nand distributions facilities, which generally would still be regulated \nunder most restructuring proposals or frameworks. Publicly-owned \nutilities that do not make this irrevocable election would continue to \noperate under a clarified version of exiting law, thus remaining \nsubject to the private use rules.\n  This legislation attempts to balance and be fair to the interests of \nall stakeholders in electricity restructuring while keeping the \ninterest of the consumer paramount. It strikes a compromise between \npublicly-owned utilities and investor-owned utilities by providing an \noption for publicly-owned utilities to address the problem of how to \ncomply with private use restriction in a restructured marketplace, an \noption that involves significant trade-offs for the publicly-owned \nutilities that seek to utilize it. For investor-owned utilities, \nrequiring publicly-owned utilities to forego the ability to issue tax-\nexempt debt for new generation facilities should mitigate any potential \nor perceived competitive advantage in the new competitive world. At the \nsame time, it honors promises made to bondholders under contract and \nexisting tax law, thereby avoiding the inequitable consequence of \napplying old rules to the newly-emerging competitive world of \nelectricity.\n  In addition, for those concerned about the environment, it provides \nincentives to deliver electricity efficiently through open access and \nretail\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\n competition. Most importantly, for consumers the legislation allows \ncompetition to thrive while providing additional local options.\n  Mr. President, we plan to work with all interested parties, and most \nimportantly American consumers, to ensure that we develop the fairest \nand most reasonable solution to this complex problem. We want \nelectricity restructuring to be a good deal for everyone involved, \nespecially the American consumer who deserves the lower electric bills \nthat a competitive marketplace should provide. I believe this \nlegislation addresses all of these concerns and promotes fair \ncompetition in the electricity industry. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in co-sponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill, and an explanatory \nmemorandum be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

One exception to \n     this general rule relates to bonds that finance output \n     facilities used in a private business. In the case of such \n     facilities, if the contractual arrangements for sale of the \n     output transfer the benefits and burdens of ownership of the \n     facility to private parties, the use is treated as a private \n     business use and the bonds issued to finance the facility may \n     not be tax-exempt. If at the time of issuance the issuer \n     reasonably expected that the private business use rules would \n     be violated or the issuer thereafter on the bonds is \n     retroactively taxable to date of issuance.\n       There has been significant uncertainty as to how these \n     private business use rules apply to public power systems in \n     the emerging competitive wholesale and retail electricity \n     markets. In particular, questions have been raised as to \n     whether such systems may (1) provide open access transmission \n     services, (2) contractually commit their transmission systems \n     to an Independent System Operator (ISO), (3) open their \n     distribution facilities to retail competition, or (4) lower \n     prices to particular customers to meet competition.\n\n\n                          proposed amendments\n\n       This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to make two modifications to the private business use \n     rules as they apply to electric facilities: (1) to clarify \n     the application of the existing private business use rules in \n     the new competitive environment, and (2) to make the private \n     business use rules inapplicable to existing tax-\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\n     exempt debt issued by any public power system that elects not \n     to issue new tax-exempt debt for electric generation and \n     certain other facilities.\n       1. Clarification of Existing Private Business Use Rules.--\n     Subsection (a) of section 2 of the bill amends section 141 \n     (b)(6) of the Code to make it clear that the following \n     activities (referred to as ``permitted open access \n     transactions'') do not result in a private business use and \n     will not make otherwise tax-exempt bonds taxable:\n       (a) Providing open access transmission service consistent \n     with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. \n     888 or with State open transmission access rules.\n       (b) Joining a FERC approved ISO, regional transmission \n     group (RTG), power exchange, or providing service in \n     accordance with an ISO, RTG, or power exchange tariff.\n       (c) Providing open access distribution services to \n     competing retail sellers of electricity.\n       (d) If open access transmission or distribution services \n     are offered, contracting for sale or power at non-tariff \n     rates with on-system purchasers or existing off-system \n     purchasers.\n       Treasury by regulation could add to the list of permitted \n     open access transactions.\n       2. Election to Terminate Issuing Future Tax-Exempt Debt.--\n     Subsection (b) of section 2 amends section 141 of the Code to \n     permit a public power system to elect to terminate issuing \n     new tax-exempt bonds.\n       (a) Termination Election--Under new Code section 141(f)(1), \n     if a public power system elects to terminate issuance of new \n     tax-exempt bonds, it may then undertake transactions that are \n     not otherwise permissible under the private business use \n     rules (as amended above) without endangering the tax-exempt \n     status of its existing bonds. Specifically, if the issuer \n     makes an irrevocable termination election under this \n     provision, then (subject to the exceptions discussed below) \n     no tax-exempt bond may be issued on or after the date of such \n     election with respect to an electric output facility, and no \n     tax-exempt bond that was issued before the date of enactment \n     will be treated as a private activity bond. This treatment \n     continues for so long as such facility continues to be owned \n     by a governmental unit.\n       Essentially, making this termination election will \n     eliminate the possibility of a private business use challenge \n     to existing tax-exempt debt. If a utility does not make the \n     election, its existing tax-exempt debt for electric \n     generation facilities would continue to be subject to \n     applicable private business use rules and the marketing \n     constraints thereunder.\n       (B) Exceptions to Termination.--Under section 141(f)(2) \n     even if a public power system made the suspension or \n     termination election, it could continue to issue tax-exempt \n     bonds for the following purposes: for transmission and \n     distribution facilities used to provide open access \n     transmission and distribution services; for ``qualified \n     bonds'' as defined in section 141 (e) of the Code (which \n     are not currently subject to private business use \n     restrictions); for eligible refunding bonds (bonds that \n     refinance existing bonds but do not extend their average \n     maturity); and for bonds issued to finance repairs of, or \n     environmentally-related equipment for, electrical output \n     facilities, so long as the capacity of the facility is not \n     increased over a de minimis amount.\n       3. Effective Dates.--Subsection (c) makes the provisions of \n     the bill effective on date of enactment, but an issuer may \n     elect to make the private business use rules as clarified by \n     the bill applicable retroactively to 1996 (when FERC issued \n     its Order No. 888). Paragraph (2) of subsection (c) makes it \n     clear that the provisions of the bill apply to bonds issued \n     under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as well as the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This subsection also makes \n     clear that any activity that was not a private business use \n     prior to the enactment of the bill will not be deemed to be a \n     private business use by reason of the bill's enactment. In \n     addition, an issuer making the election under the bill will \n     not be liable under any contract in effect on the date of \n     enactment of the bill for any contract claim arising from \n     having made the election.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/08/senate-section/article/S1380-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 99\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Con. Res. 7, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the concurrent resolution \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) honoring the life \n     and legacy of King Hussein ibn Talal al-Hashem.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to offer, together with the \ndistinguished Minority Leader Senator Daschle, a resolution recognizing \nthe significant and lasting contributions to peace and security by His \nMajesty King Hussein of Jordan, who passed away just hours ago.\n  I was deeply saddened by the news of the death of King Hussein--a \ntrue patriot and long-time friend of the United States. His bold \nleadership and personal courage serve as a model to all of us. I know I \nspeak for my colleagues when I say, our thoughts and prayers are with \nhis family and with the people of Jordan during this difficult time.\n  It is worth noting that the long-standing ties between our two \ngovernments are built upon a solid bedrock of respect and shared \nvalues. Even as we consider the profound contribution King Hussein made \nto peace and security the Middle East, it is vitally important for both \nour nations to take concrete steps to strengthen those relations, for \nthe benefit of all our peoples. That is just as King Hussein would have \nwanted it.\n  In this regard, I am pleased to not that the resolution before us \nexpresses support and best wishes for the new government in Jordan \nunder King Abdullah. The King has signaled his desire to maintain a \nhigh degree of continuity for Jordan, for Middle east peace, for the \nregion, and for U.S.-Jordanian relations. This includes a strong \ncommitment to the Jordan-Israel peace treaty.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution, \nas it represents a modest but important signal of the degree to which \nwe honor the courageous life and lasting legacy of King Hussein. I \nthank my colleague from South Dakota for joining me in offering this \nresolution and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution \nhonoring one of the towering figures of our time.\n  Peace-loving people throughout the world feel a deep sadness over the \ndeath of Jordan's King Hussein. By the sheer force of his personal and \npolitical courage, he changed the world for the better.\n  None of us will ever forget how he rose from his sickbed at the Mayo \nClinic last fall and came to the Wye River peace talks when those talks \nseemed in danger of collapse. Those who were there say he restored to \nthose talks a sense that peace was not only possible, but worth making \ngreat sacrifices for, and taking extraordinary risks for.\n  His was a clear voice for moderation, tolerance and accommodation as \nhe urged the two sides to work for peace. His admonition that there had \nbeen ``enough destruction, enough death, enough waste'' helped bridge \nthe gap and forge an agreement.\n  King Hussein himself took a risk for peace in 1994, when he forged \nthe historic peace agreement between Jordan and Israel.\n  Another image we will perhaps always remember is the picture of King \nHussein kneeling not long ago at the feet of an Israeli father whose \nchild had been killed by Jordanian border guards, and apologizing to \nthe man for his loss. He was a noble man and, at the same time, a \nhumble man.\n  He was also a man of great vision and skill. When he became the King, \nthe Hashemite kingdom enjoyed little of what it has now.\n  In just a generation and a half, he created in Jordan a system of \nschools and roads and all the other infrastructure of a modern state.\n  King Hussein was a true friend of the United States. And, like all \nfriends, we did not always see eye-to-eye on every matter.\n  In the end, however, it is not our differences with him that we \nremember. It is how he inspired people to come together despite their \ndifferences.\n  A man small in physical stature, he walked among us like a giant.\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\n  The world is diminished by his passing.\n  We will miss him greatly.\n  Today, as King Hussein is buried, we offer our prayers and sympathy \nto his family--especially Queen Noor and each of his children--and to \nall the people of his beloved Jordan.\n  We also pledge to work closely with King Abdullah and the Jordanian \npeople to protect King Hussein's legacy. We must continue our efforts \nto promote peace in the Middle East, including implementing the Wye \nRiver Peace Accord, which would not have been possible without his \ncourage.\n  Finally, I hope we will work expeditiously to approve the aid to \nJordan that was agreed to at Wye as a tangible demonstration of our \nsupport for King Abdullah and our ongoing commitment to peace in the \nMiddle East.\n  Our friend is gone, but his spirit lives on in the fragile Middle \nEast peace. Let us nurture it and help it grow, in his name and in his \nmemory.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, among the steady stream of foreign heads of \nstate visiting the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, King Hussein \nwas always given a special welcome. He was instinctively a friend \npossessing a unique combination of grace and good humor. I therefore \nview his death as a personal loss.\n  I recall one occasion when members of our committee were gathered \naround the large oval table enjoying the King's jovial good humor. \nQueen Noor was present on that occasion. As His Majesty traded comments \nwith the senators around him, it occurred to me that Queen Noor had \nperhaps not been properly welcomed. So I asked the King if he could \nidentify the most significant 20th century export to his country. He \nobviously pondered the question with uncertainty, so we identified the \n``export''--Queen Noor.\n  He laughed heartily and replied: ``I'm not about to disagree with \nthat!''\n  This great man, great leader, and faithful friend of the United \nStates presided over his country at a time fraught with peril, beset \nwith almost constant threats both internal and external. Yet throughout \nhis long reign he met the challenges of leadership with grace and \ncourage. Without King Hussein, there would not today be even the \nlimited peace the Middle East now enjoys.\n  He will be sorely missed, certainly by me. I wish godspeed to his son \nand successor, Abdullah bin Hussein.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the resolution \noffered by the Majority and Minority Leaders in honor of the life and \nlegacy of King Hussein.\n  With King Hussein's death, the United States has lost a close, steady \nfriend in a troubled part of the world. My deepest condolences go out \nto the King's family and the Jordanian people. My best wishes go to \nKing Hussein's designated heir, King Abdullah.\n  In all of my encounters with King Hussein I was impressed above all \nelse by his optimism and determination in the cause of peace. He never \ngave up, and in his memory, we must now press forward on the road to \npeace.\n  I was also touched by his humanity and personal warmth. He was always \ngentle and polite, never aloof or imperious.\n  Though his life ended too soon, his legacy will survive. His rare \ngift of vision helped guide Jordan through many dark periods. The \nheroic steps he took to help promote peace and reconciliation between \nArabs and Israelis will continue to bear fruit.\n  His efforts to establish the foundations of democratic government in \nJordan remain a worthy example for the region, where democracy is in \nshort supply.\n  Finally, the partnership between Jordan and the United States, \ncultivated so carefully by King Hussein over 46 years and nine American \nAdministrations will continue well into the future.\n  President Clinton has asked us to demonstrate our support for Jordan \nin a very tangible way--by promptly approving his request for \nsupplemental assistance to Jordan. I hope that we can act on that \nrequest quickly to show the Jordanian people that we honor the memory \nand great achievements of their late King, and that our friendship with \ntheir country is enduring.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the death of \nKing Hussein this past weekend. I have had the honor of meeting King \nHussein several times, and have always been impressed by his dignity \nand grace. He was a true statesman.\n  Mr. President, through almost half a century of war and hope, tragedy \nand peace, King Hussein shepherded his country through its transition \nto a stable modern nation and a close U.S. ally. More than the words he \nhas spoken, it is the actions he has taken that have earned him the \nrespect of Israelis, and the trust of the Arab world. Throughout it \nall, King Hussein never lost sight of our common goal of a just and \ncomprehensive Middle East peace, nor of what that peace would mean. He \nunderstood, even when no one else did, that true peace ``resides \nultimately not in the hands of governments, but in the hands of \npeople.''\n  On a personal note, I remember being moved by the words he shared \nduring the funeral of another great leader, Yitzhak Rabin. There, on \nthe hill above the troubled city of Jerusalem, a city where as a young \nboy the King had witnessed the assassination of his own grandfather, \nand in sight of the grave of Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, \nKing Hussein bore witness to his never-ending commitment to peace ``for \nall times to come,'' and pledged to do his ``utmost to ensure that we \nleave a similar legacy.'' And he mourned the loss of Rabin as a brother \nand a friend.\n  I also recall with deep admiration being in the company of the King \nas he looked out at the Old City from the King David Hotel at the time \nof that funeral. It was perhaps the first time in many decades he had \nvisited that place, and it was a moving moment.\n  King Hussein understood well that the religious and cultural roots of \nthe Jewish and Muslim people are forever intertwined in the fertile and \nhistoric soil of the Middle East. His country was created along the \nJordan River, after which it is named, following the First World War. \nIts original borders on the east bank of the river, created by colonial \nrulers, have been altered by annexation, war, and peace agreement. Two \nyears after Jordan gained its independence from Great Britain, the \nfledgling State of Israel emerged on the other side of the Jordan \nRiver, and many of the Palestinians living in the new state migrated to \nJordan.\n  King Hussein's grandfather, King Abdullah, was the first ruler of an \nindependent Jordan. His decision to annex the Palestinian-held West \nBank in 1950, when his grandson was 15 years old, initiated a series of \nevents that would profoundly affect the balance of power in the Middle \nEast and the life of the young prince.\n  In 1951, King Abdullah was assassinated by a Palestinian nationalist \nangered by the annexation of the West Bank. The then-Prince Hussein was \nstanding just a few steps away as his grandfather fell. Illness \nprevented King Abdullah's son, Talal, from ruling, and he abdicated in \nfavor of his own son, Prince Hussein, who formally assumed the throne \nin May 1953, at the age of 17. King Hussein would go on to rule Jordan \nfor nearly half a century, and was the longest serving ruler in the \nMiddle East at the time of his death.\n  King Hussein was the only ruler that most Jordanians have known. On a \nmore personal note, he was the King of his country for just about as \nlong as I have been alive. I was about two months old when he formally \nbecame King. Over the course of my life and his rule, my views about \nhim and his country have changed dramatically.\n  I remember the deep animosity that existed between Jews and \nJordanians when I was growing up in the 1960s, culminating in the Six \nDay War in 1967 during which Jordan lost control of the West Bank and \nEast Jerusalem. While I was horrified by the religiously-motivated \nattacks perpetrated by many Jordanians during this time, I understand \nand appreciate the religious ties the Arab people feel toward \nJerusalem. Two of the holiest sites in Islam, the Dome of the Rock and \nthe Al Aqsa Mosque, where King Hussein's grandfather was assassinated, \nare located there.\n  Throughout these last few decades, I have developed an immense \nrespect for King Hussein and for the Jordanian people. As is true for \nmost people, when I was younger it took me some time to realize that \nthe actions of one person or a group of people are not always an \naccurate representation of the\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\ntrue feelings of a country or a political leader. The ethnic and \nreligious violence that has occurred in the Middle East, and indeed \naround the world, is largely carried out by fringe groups who believe \nthat violence is the only way to send a message, protest an action, or \nachieve a political goal.\n  Even though it was a violent act that propelled him into power at \nsuch a young age, King Hussein chose to reject violence and embrace \npeace. As a result of his moderate views, in 1974 an Arab summit \ndeclared that he was no longer the spokesman for the Palestinian \npeople, and proclaimed that the Palestinian Liberation Organization, \nand its leader, Yasser Arafat, would assume that role. When the PLO \nbegan its ``intifada'' against Israel in 1988, King Hussein formally \ncut Jordan's ties to the West Bank, but retained a supervisory role \nover Muslim holy places in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n  In 1994, Jordan became only the second Arab country to sign a peace \nagreement with Israel. The two countries established diplomatic \nrelations, Israel returned some territory to Jordan, and the countries \nhave begun to work together on common issues such as shared \ninfrastructure and access to potable water. Unfortunately, these \ncourageous moves have sometimes been met with violent acts, \nparticularly from those who felt that peace between Israel and Jordan \nwas premature. The 1997 murder of seven Israeli school girls by a \nJordanian soldier was a sobering reminder that not all Jordanians \nshared their King's support for peace. But, in a testament to his \ncommitment to peace, King Hussein not only condemned this cowardly \naction, but he also made the effort to travel to Israel to visit with \nthe families of the young victims.\n  One of the King's biggest strengths was his ability to lead quietly \nby example. His decision to visit the families of the children murdered \nby one of his army's soldiers is but one instance of this.\n  Even as the King was undergoing treatment for cancer at the Mayo \nClinic, the welfare of his people and the status of the Middle East \npeace process was not far from his mind. He displayed a quiet courage \nand admirable strength by leaving the hospital and traveling to the Wye \nRiver peace negotiations last fall in order to encourage a settlement \nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians. Even as his health was \ndeteriorating, King Hussein's commitment to peace never waned. Selfless \nacts such as that earned him the respect of people around the world and \nmade him one of the linchpins of the negotiations for peace in the \nMiddle East.\n  Mr. President, this week's Torah portion speaks of the Revelation at \nSinai. Moses had been commanded by God to prepare the people for God's \ndescent and visit, and in the wake of dark clouds, thunder and \nlightning, the sounds of the Shofar, and the trembling of the earth, \nGod spoke to the Israelites and made his commandments known. It is a \npowerful passage that speaks to the hearts of all of us who believe in \nGod.\n  Despite a history fraught with pain, violence and death, King Hussein \nunderstood the universal meaning of the commandments, which instruct us \nnot to covet the land and property of our neighbors, and, above all, \nnot to kill. Throughout his life, King Hussein maintained a vision of a \nMiddle East free from pain, violence and death, and he hoped he would \nsee that day during his lifetime.\n  Alas, although significant progress has been made, including the \nwarming of relations between Jordan and Israel, true peace in the \nMiddle East still escapes us. But there is no doubt in my mind that \namong the many legacies of King Hussein is a true commitment to a just \nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  In his honor and in his memory, let us join him in committing \nourselves to the same goal.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the resolution appear in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Eisenhower;\n       Whereas under King Hussein, Jordan has instituted wide-\n     ranging democratic reforms;\n       Whereas throughout his life, King Hussein survived multiple \n     assassination attempts, plots to overthrow his government and \n     attacks on Jordan, invariably meeting such attacks with \n     fierce courage and devotion to his Kingdom and its people;\n       Whereas despite decades of conflict with the State of \n     Israel, King Hussein invariably maintained a dialogue with \n     the Jewish state, and ultimately signed a full-fledged peace \n     treaty with Israel on October 26, 1994;\n       Whereas King Hussein has established a model for Arab-\n     Israeli coexistence in Jordan's ties with the State of \n     Israel, including deepening political and cultural relations, \n     growing trade and economic ties and other major \n     accomplishments;\n       Whereas, King Hussein contributed to the cause of peace in \n     the Middle East with tireless energy, rising from his sick \n     bed at the last to assist in the Wye Plantation talks between \n     the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas King Hussein fought cancer with the same courage he \n     displayed in tirelessly promoting and making invaluable \n     contributions to peace in the Middle East;\n       Whereas on February 7, 1999, King Hussein succumbed to \n     cancer in Amman, Jordan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, (The House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     family of King Hussein and to all the people of Jordan in \n     this difficult time;\n       (2) expresses admiration for King Hussein's enlightened \n     leadership and gratitude for his support for peace throughout \n     the Middle East;\n       (3) expresses its support and best wishes for the new \n     government of Jordan under King Abdullah;\n       (4) reaffirms the United States commitment to strengthening \n     the vital relationship between our two governments and \n     peoples;\n       Sec. 2.
