The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my friend from Minnesota for purposes of \nmaking a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nfollow the Senator from Montana in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as we begin the debate about whether to \ngrant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR, we need to \nremind ourselves what the Senate vote is all about and what it is not \nabout.\n  We are voting on whether American companies, American farmers, \nAmerican workers, and American consumers will be able to take advantage \nof the new market opportunities afforded by changes that China will \nmake over the next 5 years once it becomes a member of the World Trade \nOrganization, the WTO. If we grant PNTR, China will have to give \nAmericans all the benefits that we, and other WTO members, successfully \nnegotiated after an arduous 13 years. If we fail to grant China PNTR \nstatus, then our Japanese and European competitors will be able to do \nbusiness in China in ways that will be unavailable to us and at the \nexpense of our exporters, our farmers, our manufacturers, our financial \nservice companies, our Internet companies.\n  During the Senate debate this month, we will hear a lot about other \nissues, with Senators offering a plethora of amendments. The list will \nprobably include human rights, worker rights, religious freedom, prison \nlabor, Taiwan security, arms proliferation, and export of American \njobs, among others.\n  Most, if not all, of these subjects are important. They should be of \nconcern to the United States Senate, and to all Americans. A number of \nissues that go beyond the strict granting of PNTR to China, such as \nhuman rights, monitoring and enforcement of Chinese\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\ncommitments at the WTO, promotion of the rule of law, and Taiwan's \naccession to the WTO, are included in the bill we are considering. \nOther issues, such as proliferation and Taiwan security, are best dealt \nwith apart from this legislation.\n  I share many of the concerns that some of my Senate colleagues will \nexpress over the coming days. But we are not voting on whether China is \nour friend. We are not voting about whether China should be an ally of \nthe United States. And we are not voting about whether China should be \na democracy or not.\n  To repeat, we are voting about whether American workers, farmers, and \nbusinesses will benefit from a decade-long negotiation, or whether we \nwill allow our competitors in Japan and Europe to benefit while \nAmericans do not.\n  That said, there are also broader implications involved in the Senate \nvote on PNTR. Let me mention a few.\n  First, a rejection of PNTR will be seen by China as an American \npolicy decision to isolate them, to impair their growth and \ndevelopment, and to prevent China from emerging as a great regional \npower. That is how they will see it. Our intention should be to \nincorporate China into the global trading system, to get them to follow \nthe same rules that we all use in international trade, and to make them \naccountable to an international institution for their trade policies \nand trade actions. The more China is integrated into the global system, \nthe more responsibly they will act. It is that simple.\n  Second, a rejection of PNTR will likely lead to an indefinite delay \nin Taiwan's accession to the WTO. On the other hand, passage of PNTR \nwill result in Taiwan's accession. What will happen after both China \nand Taiwan accede to--that is, are members of--the WTO?\n  They will participate together, along with all other WTO members, in \nmeetings ranging from detailed technical sessions to Ministerials. \nThere will be countless opportunities for interaction. Under the WTO's \nmost-favored-nation rule, they will have to provide each other the same \nbenefits that they grant to other members.\n  Taiwan's current policy limiting direct transportation, \ncommunication, and investment with the mainland will likely be found to \nviolate WTO rules. Both will be able to use the WTO dispute settlement \nmechanism against the other. And WTO-induced liberalization, in both \nTaiwan and the PRC, will increase and deepen ties between them in \ntrade, investment, technology, transportation, information, \ncommunications, and travel. It will promote stability across the Taiwan \nStrait.\n  Third, consider Chinese behavior once it joins the WTO. We should not \nexpect to see changes overnight; nobody does. Those people in business \nand government fighting to maintain their vested interests in the \nstatus quo will not disappear. The reformers will be strengthened, but \nthey will still be under constant attack as the battle between the \nforces of reform and the forces of reaction continues. But it is \ncertainly a vital interest of the United States to do everything we can \nto support those who favor reform over totalitarianism, to support \nthose who favor private enterprise over state-owned enterprises, to \nsupport those who favor incorporating China into the global trading \ncommunity over autarky.\n\n  We need to engage China to promote responsible behavior internally \nand externally, to encourage them to play by international rules, to \nintegrate the Chinese economy into the market-driven, middle-class-\nparticipatory economies of the West. China's entry into the WTO will \nhelp anchor and sustain these economic reform efforts and empower \neconomic reformers. China will not become a market-driven economy \novernight, but it is in our interest that they move in this direction, \nand WTO will help.\n  I look forward to a vigorous debate in the best tradition of the \nSenate. I urge all my colleagues to support this PNTR legislation \nwithout amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana for his remarks. We \nare not in agreement on this question, but I have a tremendous amount \nof respect for his work in the Senate.\n  Let me, first of all, state at the beginning of this debate that it \nis commonly assumed the Senate is going to pass PNTR. For most, this is \na foregone conclusion, but I think this is an extremely important \ndebate and, as a matter of fact, one of the reasons I am very proud to \nbe a Senator from Minnesota is that, unlike the House of \nRepresentatives where it was really difficult to have an extensive \ndebate, we will have that debate in the Senate. I will have a number of \namendments I will bring to the floor. They will be substantive. I think \nmy colleagues will believe they are thoughtful, and we will have up-or-\ndown votes.\n  I also echo the remarks of my colleague from Montana when he says we \nshould be very clear about what this debate is about and what it is not \nabout. This debate is not about whether or not we have trade with \nChina. We do have trade with China. We will have trade with China. It \nis not about whether or not we communicate with China. We most \ndefinitely will. It is not about whether we isolate China. We are not \ngoing to do that. It is not about whether we should have an embargo of \nChina, as we do with Cuba. That is not even on the radar screen.\n  Nobody is talking about any of that. The question before us is \nwhether or not we in the Congress give up our right to have annual \nreview of normal trade relations with China--we used to call it most-\nfavored-nation status--whether or not we give up what has been our only \nleverage to promote noncommercial values--I emphasize that, I say to my \ncolleagues--noncommercial values in our trading relationships, such as \nhuman rights, labor rights, and environmental protection. Do we put \nhuman rights, labor rights, environmental protection, religious rights, \nthe right not to be persecuted for practicing one's religious beliefs \nor exercising one's religious beliefs in parentheses, of no interest or \nconcern to us, or do we maintain some leverage as a country to speak \nout on this?\n\n  The larger question is not whether China is integrated into the world \neconomy. China is a part of the world economy. The questions are: Under \nwhat terms will China be integrated? what will the rules be? who will \ndecide those rules? who will benefit from these decisions? and who will \nbe harmed by them?\n  The trade agreement negotiated by the United States and China last \nNovember and the PNTR legislation currently before the Senate provide \nvery discouraging answers to these questions as to who will decide, who \nwill benefit, and exactly who is going to be asked to sacrifice.\n  Our bilateral agreement contains page after page of protections for \nU.S. investors. It is a virtual wish list for multinational \ncorporations operating in China and for those who wish to relocate \ntheir production there, but it contains not a word about human rights, \nnothing about religious freedom, nothing on labor rights, and nothing \non the environment.\n  It has been said that the United States could not demand such things \nbecause we have conceded nothing in our deal with China. That is far \nfrom the truth. With PNTR, the United States gives up our annual review \nof China most-favored-nation trading privileges, as well as our \nbilateral trade remedies.\n  MFN review has not been used as effectively as it should be, I grant \nthat, but it is about the only leverage we have left to speak up for \nhuman rights, and when we as a nation do not speak up for human rights \nin other countries, we diminish ourselves. Just ask Wei Jingsheng, who \nI hope will receive the Nobel Prize for his courageous speaking out for \ndemocracy in China. Ask him the difference it made when every year \nnormal trade relations with China came up for review here while he was \nin prison. The treatment was better. The Government was worried about \nwhat we would do. Now we give up that leverage.\n  It is also true that our bilateral trade remedies have not been used \nas effectively as they should, but section 301 remains our only \nexplicit remedy against China's violation of core labor standards.\n  The United States right now absorbs 40 percent of China's exports. \nThe argument that we could not have done better by way of some \nconcessions on\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nthese basic issues falls on its face. In exchange for the concessions \nwe have made to China, could we not have at least exacted some \nconcessions with regard to human rights? We did not. Yet this year's \nannual report by the State Department says China's human rights \nperformance continued to worsen in 1999.\n  Today in the New York Times there is another State Department report \nwhich we called for, we required, on the whole question of religious \nfreedom or lack of religious freedom. I quote from just the first two \nparagraphs of today's New York Times:\n\n       As more and more Chinese seek to practice faiths including \n     Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, government \n     officials have increasingly responded with \n     harassment, extortion, detention, and even torture, the \n     State Department said today.\n       As a result, a ``marked deterioration'' in religious \n     freedom has occurred in China during the last year, enabled \n     by a new law granting state and local officials broad \n     authority to suppress 14 minority religions, including the \n     Falun Gong movement, the State Department said in its second \n     annual report on religious freedom around the world.\n\n  We have had more relations, more trade, and this vote is coming up \nthis year, and when it comes to the question of whether people can \nexercise the right to practice their own religion, there is more \npersecution.\n  I will have an amendment that will deal with the whole question of \nreligious freedom. It will mirror the conclusions of a commission we \nset up to look at religious freedom throughout the world, to look at \nreligious freedom in China, a commission which recommended to the \nCongress that we not grant automatic trade relations with China unless \nthe Chinese Government meets essential minimum decency requirements \nwhen it comes to not persecuting people because of their religious \npractice.\n  According to the State Department's report:\n\n       The government's poor human rights record deteriorated \n     markedly throughout the year as the government intensified \n     efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent. \n     Abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, \n     mistreatment of prisoners, and denial of due process.\n\n  We are talking about hundreds, maybe thousands, of people in China \nsentenced to long prison terms where they have been beaten, tortured, \nand denied medical care.\n  According to Amnesty International, throughout China, mass summary \nexecutions continue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences \nand 3,500 executions were officially recorded last year. The real \nfigures are believed to be much higher. Nor did we obtain any \nconcessions on religious freedom in our negotiations with China. Scores \nof Roman Catholics and Protestants--I speak as a Jew--have been \narrested. A crackdown on Tibet was carried out during the ``strike \nhard'' campaign. Authorities ordered the closure of monasteries in \nTibet and banned the Dalai Lama's image. At one monastery which was \nclosed, over 90 monks and novices were detained or ``disappeared.'' \nThat is why the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \nrecommended delaying PNTR until China makes ``substantial improvement \nin allowing people the freedom to worship.'' I say to my colleagues, do \nyou just want to turn your gaze away from this question?\n\n  We obtained no concessions from China on complying with their \nexisting commitments on forced prison labor which they have not lived \nup to. Harry Wu, a man of extraordinary courage and character, has \ndocumented China's extensive forced labor system. His research has \nidentified more than 1,100 labor camps across China, many of which \nproduce products for export to dozens of countries around the world, \nincluding the United States.\n  We demanded no concessions from the Chinese on their persecution of \nlabor organizers. If you try to form an independent union, if you \nshould want to make more than 3 cents an hour, or 14 cents an hour, if \nyou should not want to work 16 and 18 hours a day, if you should want \nto be treated with some dignity, and you try to organize a union, then \nyou are faced with 3 to 8 years in a hard labor camp. We pay no \nattention to this question at all, I say to Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike.\n  Absent any minimum standards for human rights, for labor, or for the \nenvironment, the most likely scenario is for China to become an export \nplatform, attracting foreign manufacturers, with lax regulations, and \nwages as low as 3 cents an hour.\n  Unfortunately, many of the concessions that we chose to demand from \nChina will only make it easier for the United States, for multinational \ncorporations to relocate there, paying people 10 cents an hour, 3 cents \nan hour, 13 cents an hour--I am going to give examples in my opening \nstatement in just a few minutes--in competition with American workers \nand ordinary people in our country, who, by the way, if they oppose our \ntrade agreements, are accused of being backward, are accused of not \nbeing sophisticated, are accused of not understanding this new global \neconomy in which we live.\n  Please forgive ordinary citizens and wage earners for their \nskepticism that without some basic standards, what you are going to see \nis China becoming a magnet for more and more companies to go there and \npay people deplorable wages, with deplorable working conditions, while \nwe lose our jobs.\n  I believe the time has come for a different approach in negotiating \nour trade agreements and for reforming the rules of the global economy. \nI want to make it very clear at the beginning of my opening statement, \nI say to my colleagues, I am an internationalist. I am a fierce \ninternationalist. I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled \npersecution from the Ukraine, who was born in the Ukraine, and then \nlived in Russia, who spoke 10 languages fluently. I am not an \nisolationist.\n  But I will say today on the floor of the Senate that we should be \nlooking forward, and we should be looking to how we participate in this \nnew global economy, and how we can have some rules, some edifice, some \nkind of framework so this new global economy works for working people \nand the environment and human rights. Too many of my colleagues want to \nput all of these concerns in parenthesis.\n  I think we need to be clear about what is at stake. My colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, said that as well. That is why so many people \nin this country are concerned about passage of this legislation.\n  The PNTR is being sold as an agreement to increase U.S. exports. I \nhave heard this said a million times: If we pass PNTR, we will \ndramatically increase U.S. exports to China, and it will be a win-win--\na win-win for agriculture, a win-win for business, a win-win for labor.\n\n  This legislation and trade deal with China is much more about \ninvestment than it is about exports. It is much more about making it \neasier for U.S. firms to relocate jobs in China than it is about \nexports.\n  First of all, the argument that this debate is all about exports and \nreducing our trade deficit falls on its face. I say to my colleagues, \nlast August the U.S. International Trade Commission, the ITC, completed \na study on the effects of the China deal on our trade balance. The ITC \nfound that the China deal will increase our trade deficit with China, \nnot lower it.\n  Second of all, it is not at all true that we need PNTR to be able to \nhave trade with China. China is already obligated, under the 1979 \nbilateral trade agreement, according to our own General Accounting \nOffice, the GAO, to give us all of the benefits by way of tariff \nreductions that it gives any of the other WTO countries. Even the \nadministration concedes this point.\n  Third of all, PNTR will lead to more imports from China by \nencouraging multinationals to invest in China manufacturing to export \nto the U.S. market. That is what this is all about. Big companies could \ngo to China--I will give many examples--they would not have to worry \nany longer about annual reviews, about normal trade relations. They \ncould go there.\n  People can't organize a union. They are thrown in prison. There is no \nrespect for human rights. There is no respect for people to practice \ntheir religion. As a result, they could go there and pay people \ndeplorable wages, under deplorable conditions, and then export back to \nour country.\n  Let me just be real clear about it. Before the House vote on PNTR--\nand I hope colleagues will listen--few noticed that the ITC had \npredicted that the trade deal with China would significantly increase \ninvestment of multinational corporations in China. But\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nafter the House vote, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the \nWall Street Journal all carried articles laying out what this \nlegislation is really about.\n  Now, as it is in the Senate, and we have the benefit of a little bit \nmore wisdom and knowledge, let me just quote, first of all, an article \nentitled, ``Playing the China Card,'' from the New York Times:\n\n       Although the Clinton Administration often listed exports as \n     the headline benefit of broadening trade with China, the real \n     advantage for U.S. companies is probably enhanced rights of \n     investment and ownership there. . . . Most companies try to \n     crack the difficult China market by setting up local \n     operations, often using those plants as export production \n     bases as well.\n\n  Here is what the Wall Street Journal had to say the day after PNTR \npassed the House in an article entitled, ``House Vote Primes U.S. Firms \nto Boost Investments in China'':\n\n       While the debate in Washington focused mainly on the \n     probable lift for U.S. exports to China, many U.S. \n     multinationals have something different in mind. ``This deal \n     is about investment, not exports,'' says Joseph Quinlan, an \n     economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. . . .\n       In the tense weeks leading up to last night's vote, \n     business lobbyists emphasized the beneficial effect the \n     agreement would have on U.S. exports to China. They played \n     down its likely impact on investment, leery of sounding \n     supportive of labor union arguments that the deal would \n     prompt companies to move U.S. production to China. But many \n     businessmen concede that investment in China is the prize. . \n     . .\n\n  Then finally, after the House vote, the U.S. Business and Industrial \nCouncil surveyed the web sites of dozens of U.S. multinationals who \nhave been lobbying for PNTR, and they reached similar conclusions:\n\n       In contrast to the focus in their congressional lobbying \n     and their advertisements, American multinationals say almost \n     nothing about exports when they describe their China business \n     on their web sites. There, the overwhelming emphasis is on \n     supplying the China market--and often other markets, like the \n     U.S. market--from factories they build or acquire or work \n     with in China. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this should come as no surprise to colleagues. \nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, U.S. investment in Chinese \nmanufacturing--I am talking about before this vote--shot up from $123 \nmillion in 1988 to $4 billion in 1998.\n  The number of U.S. affiliates manufacturing in China rose from 64 in \n1989 to 350 in 1997, and the value of their sales rose from $121 \nmillion in 1989 to $8 billion in 1997. That is before we pass normal \ntrade relations with China. U.S. agribusiness conglomerates that have \nbeen promoting U.S. exports to China as much as anyone are also \ninvesting in production facilities there in China. As the Wall Street \nJournal noted the day after the House vote:\n\n       Even agriculture companies are getting in on the act. \n     Poultry giant Purdue Farms, Inc. is ratcheting up its \n     investment in China with a joint venture for a processing \n     plant and hatchery near Shanghai.\n\n  Purdue isn't the only one. Cargill operates a fertilizer blending \nplant and a malt plant and two feed mills in different areas of China \nand boasted in a press release last year that it is a ``major exporter \nof Chinese corn and steel.''\n  I urge farmers in Minnesota to listen to that. Cargill says: We set \nup operations in China; we are a major exporter of corn. Steel workers \nin the Iron Range, listen to that. They don't have to worry about \nenvironmental rules and regulations. They don't have to worry about \nfair labor standards. They don't have to worry about human rights \nstandards that the Chinese Government will impose. They can produce \ncorn well below the cost of production of corn growers in Minnesota, \nand they themselves brag about the fact that they are a major exporter \nof Chinese corn.\n  Cargill, Archer-Daniels-Midland, and ConAgra, which have operated in \nChina for years, lobbied hard for a provision in the China trade deal \nthat will let them set up distribution networks that can be used for \nexports as well as imports. And John Deere has a joint venture with one \nof China's state-owned companies that sells tractors.\n  If we look at our trade deficit with China, it tells the story. Our \ntrade deficit with China rose 256 percent from 1992 to 1999. Imports \nfrom China more than tripled in real terms, while exports grew only 69 \npercent. Our trade deficit with China jumped $11 billion last year to \n$68 billion. In 1999, we had a 6-to-1 ratio of imports to exports.\n  We do trade with China. There is a huge trade imbalance. And as U.S. \ninvestment in China goes up, that is what is going to happen. As our \ntrade deficit gets worse, China is developing into an export platform \nfor foreign firms that seek the world's cheapest labor and access to \nthe world's largest consumer market--not China but ours. People in \nChina are, by and large, very poor. The market is not China. The market \nis in this country. The U.S. today absorbs about 40 percent of China's \nexports, and about 40 percent of China's exports, more than $200 \nbillion in 1998, came from multinational firms operating in China.\n  If this debate is really about investment and not exports, then the \nquestion is, Why are so many U.S. corporations so eager to invest in \nChina? The answer that many of these corporations will give is that \nthey want access to China's huge internal market. But as we have seen, \nmost of the production they are investing in is for export to the \nUnited States and other foreign markets. There is a good reason for \nthat. This was the same argument made about NAFTA--we want to have this \nmarket in Mexico. But the problem is, the wages are so low in these \ncountries, the poverty is so great, we don't have the market.\n  So why are U.S. corporations so interested in relocating production \nin China? Why are they so interested that we no longer reserve for \nourselves the right to annually review normal trade relations with \nChina? The most important reason is they are interested in low cost, \nand that is a euphemism. What I really mean to say is, they are \ninterested in low wages and the repression of worker rights. That is \nwhat is so attractive about investment in China.\n\n  The year 1994 is the last data we have. I am trying to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate in this debate as much empirical data as I can. \nChinese production workers who worked in the factories of the U.S. \nmultinationals earned on average of 83 cents an hour. That is the last \nyear for which the data is available. By way of comparison, the average \nmanufacturing worker today in our country makes $16.87.\n  The State Department human rights report last year confirms the \nappalling state of labor rights in China. I will quote a few sections.\n\n       Independent trade unions are illegal. . . The government \n     has not approved the establishment of any independent unions \n     to date.\n       The government continues its effort to stamp out union \n     activity, including through detention or arrest of labor \n     activists.\n\n  The State Department then goes on to list a number of labor activists \nwho have been imprisoned because they did nothing more than demand the \nright to be able to form a union so they could bargain collectively and \nget better wages. They are in prison, and we pay no attention to that.\n  I cite a recent report by the National Labor Committee which should \ndispel any doubts whether there are irresponsible U.S. corporations \ntaking advantage of these appalling labor conditions. By the way, there \nare responsible U.S. corporations as well. However, the shame of it is, \nwithout any kind of standards, it is what the irresponsible U.S. \ncorporations get away with.\n  The conclusion of the NLC:\n\n       Recent in-depth investigations of 16 factories in China \n     producing car-stereos, brakes, shoes, sneakers, clothing, \n     TVs, hats, and bags for some of the largest U.S. companies \n     clearly demonstrate that [these corporations] and their \n     contractors in China continue to systematically violate the \n     most fundamental human and worker rights while paying below \n     subsistence wages. The U.S. companies and their contractors \n     operate with impunity in China, often in collaboration with \n     repressive and corrupt local government authorities.\n\n  NLC investigators found brand name--Kathie Lee/Wal-Mart--handbags \nbeing made in a factory ``where 1,000 workers were held under \nconditions of indentured servitude, forced to work 12 to 14 hours a \nday, seven days a week, with only one day off a month, while earning an \naverage of 3 cents an hour.''\n  I hope my colleagues are not going to vote against an amendment that \nI am going to bring to the floor that is going to deal with basic human \nrights and another amendment I will bring to the floor dealing with the \nproblem of religious persecution.\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\n   Continuing from the NLC report:\n\n       However, after months of work, 46 percent of the workers \n     surveyed earned nothing at all--\n\n  They didn't even make 3 cents an hour.\n\n       in fact, they owed money to the company. The workers were \n     allowed out of the factory for just an hour and a half a day. \n     The workers were fed two dismal meals a day and housed 16 \n     people to one small, crammed dorm room. Many of the workers \n     did not even have enough money to pay for bus fare to leave \n     the factory to look for other work. When the workers \n     protested being forced to work from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. \n     seven days a week, for literally pennies an hour, 800 workers \n     were fired.\n\n  Do Members not think in this trade agreement we might not want to \nhave some conditions calling on the Chinese Government to live up to \nbasic standards of decency?\n  One factory producing brand name sneakers for the U.S. market hires \nonly females between the ages of 18 and 25--another U.S. company in \nChina.\n\n       The base wage at the factory is 18 cents an hour, and \n     workers need permission to leave the factory grounds. Factory \n     and dorms--where 20 women share one small dorm room, sleeping \n     on triple-level bunk beds--are locked down at 9:00 p.m. every \n     night. When workers in the polishing section could no longer \n     stand the grueling overtime hours and low pay and went on \n     strike, they were all fired. Factory management then lectured \n     the remaining workers that they would not tolerate unions, \n     strikes, bad behavior, or the raising of grievances.\n\n  I will have an amendment that will say we should condition automatic \nnormal trade relations with China on their living up to the basic \nstandard that people should be able to form an independent union if \nthat is what they believe they should do without being imprisoned.\n  At a plant making brand name--Nike--clothing for American consumers, \nyoung workers worked from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., 7 days a week. They \nmade 22 cents an hour. Wal-Mart, by the way, is in China. I think they \nare paying 14 cents an hour. And another factory manufacturing for \nexport to the U.S. market does not hire anyone older than 25; workers \nare paid 20 cents an hour and work 11- to 12-hour shifts.\n  I have no doubt that some of our companies--I hope many--want to be \nresponsible employers. But when we don't have any standards and we sign \nonto trade agreements without any standards whatsoever, we create \neconomic incentives that push in the wrong direction, where the \ncompanies wanting to do well by workers are at a competitive \ndisadvantage and it becomes a race to the bottom.\n  In our country--I am proud to say as a former college teacher--among \nyoung people is the best organizing of justice, idealism, and activism \nI have seen in many years. But how can you support the anti-sweatshop \ncampaign, denounce the rapid proliferation of sweatshops all over the \nworld, and denounce the resurgence of sweatshops here in the U.S. and \nthen turn around and promote unregulated investment in China without \nany conditions whatsoever?\n  I simply say that I seriously question, on the basis of some pretty \nsolid empirical evidence, whether this China deal is going to lift \nliving standards overseas to our levels or whether this China deal and \nsome of our other trade policy is going to lower living standards down \nto theirs. It is not very hard to figure out what this deal is about. \nIt is going to encourage more investment in China under the conditions \nI have described.\n  I wish to give two case studies. On July 7, the New York Times ran a \nstory about Zebco Corporation, world-famous makers of fishing reel, \nwhich moved most of its production to China in June. Most of Zebco's \n240 workers will eventually lose their jobs. They said:\n\n       With most of Zebco's competitors having already set up \n     fishing tackle plants in China, allowing them to undercut \n     Zebco's prices at Wal-Marts everywhere, Zebco began a year \n     ago to explore the possibility of moving its own lines to \n     China. The company found that it could commission Chinese \n     factories to produce and deliver reels to the United States \n     for one-third less than it could make them at home, company \n     officials said.\n       As assembly-line factory jobs go, Zebco offers ordinary pay \n     but solid benefits, including Christmas gifts of stock \n     certificates. Workers returned the loyalty. Turnover was low.\n\n  This is what it was all about.\n\n       Then, earlier this year, the company pushed assembly-line \n     workers to raise their output by at least 10 percent a month, \n     and China became a cattle prod.\n\n  That is in the New York Times piece.\n\n       Still, the shop floor fell into stunned silence one Monday \n     afternoon when the president of the company read a brief \n     statement as first-shift workers finished their day. Zebco \n     was moving some production to China. Many of those listening \n     would lose their jobs. Zebco reels no longer commanded an \n     ``adequate profit,'' the statement said.\n       Many leading United States companies are like Zebco. They \n     face competitive pressure to save money by producing in \n     China--often exporting back to the United States--rather than \n     making goods here to sell in China.\n\n  The workers as Zebco are not alone. Warren Davis is a courageous, \noutspoken United Auto Workers leader. He is their regional director for \nOhio and Pennsylvania. In a recent letter, he told me about 90 workers \nat a plant he represents who are all going to lose their jobs because \nof the conditions that I have described. He writes:\n\n       Nestaway Corporation has been under contract with the \n     Rubbermaid Corporation of Wooster, Ohio. It is losing its \n     critical contract because Rubbermaid claims it can no longer \n     afford to buy Nestaway's sink strainers. . . .\n       The victims are the workers at Nestaway Corporation in \n     Garfield Heights, Ohio. They are mainly single parents with \n     poor prospects for finding any other job that pay a wage \n     comparable to the $9 an hour they had been paid. . . .\n\n  Basically, it is the same thing. They can't compete. I continue to \nquote from him:\n\n       My question to you is, for whom does the bell toll? Because \n     this is not just about the jobs of Region 2 members of the \n     United Auto Workers. This is about all of American \n     manufacturing. And it is about the debate in the Senate.\n\n  The stories of workers at Zebco and Nestaway tell a larger story. We \nhave an exploding trade deficit with China, and it is only going to get \nworse because without any kind of conditions, without any kind of human \nrights standards, without any kind of fair labor standards, without any \nkind of minimal standards for human rights, what we are going to see is \nmore and more companies not exporting but investing in China, going to \nChina, paying low wages. This becomes the export platform, and then the \nproducts are exported back to our country. According to the EPI, our \nexploding trade deficit with China cost over 683,000 jobs between 1992 \nand 1999. This trade deal with China will cost even more--over 870,000 \njobs, just looking into the immediate future.\n  Well, let me now make two final points in my opening statement. It is \ncommonly argued that everybody benefits, that it is exports, and I have \ntried to take that on. We get the arguments of the trade agreement, and \nI have tried to take that on. It is argued that, in fact, this is a \npolicy that will help people in China. I have tried to take that \nargument on. Let me simply talk about the inequality in our country. \nEven free trade economists have now concluded that existing trade \npolicy is the single largest cause of growing inequality since 1979. We \nhave a booming economy, but we have the widest gap between the rich and \nthe poor of any industrialized nation in the world. Inequality, both \nwithin countries and between countries, has dramatically increased.\n  When we went through the debate on NAFTA, the argument was there will \nbe winners and losers, but we will be better off as a country, and we \ncertainly will be there to compensate the losers; we will have job \ntraining and education programs and all of the rest. But do you know \nwhat? That was fine sentiment expressed on the floor of the Senate, but \nafter NAFTA was passed and we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nsupport for the training and assistance suddenly dried up. All of the \nSenators and all of the Representatives who I hear say, ``Yes, there \nwill be losers and we are certainly going to have to do better''--I \nwould like to hear those Senators and Representatives talk about health \nsecurity for people in this country, affordable child care, good \neducation for their children, increasing the minimum wage. But quite \noften you find just the opposite.\n  I wish to talk about an amendment I am going to bring to the floor of \nthe Senate, which I think is terribly important. Part of what is going \non, unfortunately, with our trade policy--and given the size of China, \nthis will sharply widen the inequality. This will exacerbate this, I \nthink, most serious question of all.\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\n  The message is, if you organize, we are gone; we will go to these \nother countries. The message is that if you want to work for more than \n3 cents an hour, you don't get our investment.\n  But if this is all about workers, and if this is all about coming \nthrough for working people in our country--making sure that the jobs we \nhave in our country are good jobs, and there are decent health care \nbenefits for people, and they can support their families--I think we \nwill have to look at the very strong correlation between unionization \nand good jobs and good working benefits--and that is a well established \ncorrelation--and, therefore, the need to give people the right to \norganize.\n  Right now in the country during an organizing drive, in 91 percent of \nthe cases employers require employees to listen to the companies but \ndeny the employees any opportunity to listen to both sides. I am going \nto introduce a right-to-organize amendment. That should no longer be \nthe case. Employees should be allowed to hear from both sides.\n  In 31 percent of all the organizing campaigns, employers illegally \nfire union sympathizers with virtual impunity. Ten thousand workers are \nfired illegally every year. It is profitable to do so. In this \namendment, I say if a company breaks the law and illegally fires that \nworker, that company is going to be faced with stiff financial \npenalties.\n  In one-third of the cases, even after the employees say they want to \njoin a union so they can make better wages, the companies refuse to \nnegotiate. This amendment will call, therefore, for mediation to be \nfollowed by binding arbitration.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this right-to-organize amendment.\n  I think the way our country is going is that people and families are \nmore concerned about the right to be able to organize and bargain \ncollectively, earn a decent living, and support their families.\n  I say especially to the Democrats that you ought to support this \namendment. You ought to support this amendment because this is all \nabout the basic right of people to be able to organize and to do better \nfor themselves and their families. This is all about being on the side \nof working people. Do I not hear that the Democratic Party is on the \nside of working people? I have an amendment that will give Democrats, \nand I hope Republicans, an opportunity to be on the side of working \npeople.\n  In conclusion, we have a choice. I think the choice is really clear. \nWe are in a global economy. We are in an international economy. The \nquestion is, Are there going to be any new rules?\n  We live in a democracy. My father taught me more than anything else \nto love my country, and I love my country because we live in a \ndemocracy. I get to speak on the floor of the Senate. Citizens get to \nspeak up. We have a voice.\n  On the one hand, we have the current model of a business trade policy \ndesigned to serve mainly the interests of multinational corporations, \nWall Street financial institutions, and global business conglomerates. \nThis is the model of globalization that has generated such outrage and \ncertainly skepticism on the part of most ordinary citizens in the \ncountry. Good for them.\n  I think there is a 2-to-1 margin--as I remember the recent polling \ndata--of people who say they don't believe these trading agreements are \ngoing to lead to good job prospects but are going to more likely take \naway good jobs for Americans.\n\n  Just think about it for a moment. We passed not too long ago the CBI \ninitiative. That is all about, as my colleague said, helping poor \nworking people in the Caribbean countries. How do you help poor working \npeople in the Caribbean countries where they don't even have the right \nto work? They can't join a union. The Caribbean countries with the \nfastest growing exports have experienced--are you ready for this?--the \nsteepest decline in wages.\n  So often I hear from my colleagues: Well, Paul, we know you support \nworking people but do not seem to be supporting the poor in these \ndeveloping nations. I say to my colleagues that every time I go to a \ntrade conference, I look for the poor. I never see the poor at these \ntrade conferences. I see the elites from these countries. I don't see \nthe poor represented.\n  In any case, with the Caribbean countries, let me cite one very \ninteresting correlation. Those countries with the fastest growing \nexports and that have the lowest wages have seen the steepest decline \nin wages.\n  The question is, Who benefits from expanding trade benefits without \nany enforceable labor standards? Who benefits from trade and investment \npolicies that discourage rather than encourage the right to organize? \nNot American workers; not workers in the other countries; not the poor \nin other countries. This is not win-win; this is lose-lose.\n  I will not cite a lot of statistics about the global economy, but for \na moment I want to cite a few to point out to colleagues that many \nforeign countries have not fared so well under this ``Washington \nconsensus trade and investment policy'' of recent decades.\n  More than 80 countries have per capita income lower than they did in \n1970, lower in 1999 than in 1978 by 200 million poor people living in \nabject poverty.\n  Only 33 countries have achieved and sustained 3-percent growth \nbetween 1980 and 1996, and in 59 countries the per capita GNP actually \ndeclined.\n  The number of poor continues to grow throughout the world.\n  There are 100 million people in industrialized countries living below \nthe poverty line, and 35 million of them are unemployed.\n  There are 1.3 billion people in the developing world earning less \nthan $1 per day and who have no access to clean water for themselves or \ntheir children.\n  You are coming out here on the floor of the Senate and trying to \nargue that trade policy has been a great benefit for the poor in the \nworld. I don't think the empirical data support that.\n  Let me conclude where I started.\n  I am an internationalist. I hear all this discussion about how this \ndebate and this vote is all about whether or not you believe we live \nand work in a global economy. I take seriously those words that we live \nand work in a global economy. It certainly is true. But may I point out \nto my colleagues the implications of this point of view.\n  If we live in a global economy and if we are truly concerned about \nhuman rights, then we can no longer concern ourselves only with human \nrights at home.\n  If we live in a global economy and we truly care about religious \nfreedom, then we can no longer concern ourselves only with religious \nfreedom at home.\n  If we live in a global economy and work in a global economy and we \ncare about the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively \nand earn a better standard of living for themselves and their children, \nthen we can no longer concern ourselves with labor rates only at home.\n  If we truly care about the environment and we live in a global \neconomy, then we can no longer concern ourselves with environmental \nprotection only at home.\n  Raising living standards is not only the right thing to do, it is \nnecessary if we are to maintain our own living standard. We need to \nensure that prosperity is shared more broadly so that the world economy \nis stabilized and that healthy and sustainable products are created for \nour exporters. When people make 3 cents an hour and are poor, they \ncannot buy what we produce in our country.\n  I am proud to associate myself with those who have been engaged in \nhuman rights work. I think I care more about human rights issues than \nalmost any other set of issues in my family background. They have \nunderstood a basic truth; it is this: That Americans can never be \nindifferent to the circumstances of exploited and abused people in the \nfar reaches of the globe. When the most basic human rights and freedoms \nof others are infringed upon or endangered, we are diminished by our \nfailure to speak out for human rights.\n  When we embrace the cause of human rights, we reaffirm one of the \ngreatest traditions of American democracy, but we are not embracing the \ncause of human rights with this trade bill.\n  There is another truth, and it is reaching a larger and larger \npublic. The well-being of our families, the well-being of ordinary wage \nearners in the United States of America, depends to a considerable \ndegree on the welfare of people who we have never met, people who live \nhalfway across the planet. Our fates are intertwined.\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n  Some of my colleagues say the global markets will take care of \nthemselves; they cannot be tamed; there is nothing we should do; this \nis laissez faire economics at its best.\n  I point my colleagues to the lessons of our own economic history. As \nwe debate this piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate--and I \nwill have an amendment that will deal with religious freedom, an \namendment that deals with human rights; I will have an amendment that \ndeals with exports from China from forced prison labor; I will have an \namendment that deals with a right to organize in China; and I will have \nan amendment that deals with the right to organize in our own country--\nlet Members for a moment think about this debate in an historic \ncontext. I heard my colleague, Senator Baucus, for whom I have great \nrespect, say this is a very important debate. Senator Moynihan, who \nwill retire--and the Senate and our country will miss him--believes \nthis is one of the most important votes we will cast. I agree. I think \nthis is one of the most important debates that has taken place in the \nSenate.\n  I deal with a sense of history. One-hundred years ago, our country \nmoved from an economy of local economic units to an industrialized \neconomy. It was a wrenching economic transformation, a major seismic \nchange in our economy. We were moving toward a national, industrialized \neconomy 100 years ago, at the beginning of the last century.\n\n  As that happened, there was a coalition--some of them were \nevangelical, some were populist, some were farmers, some were women, \nsome were working people--that made a set of demands. The farmers said: \nWe want antitrust action because these big conglomerates are pushing us \noff the land or they were exploiting the consumers. They want a 40-hour \nworkweek. We want the right to organize. We want some protections \nagainst exploiting children, child labor. Women said: We want the right \nto vote. We want direct election of the U.S. Senators. They made those \ndemands, and nobody thought they had a chance.\n  The Pinkertons killed anyone trying to organize a union. All too \noften that happened. The media was hostile to this set of demands, by \nand large. Journalists followed this debate. I am not bashing all \njournalists, but in general the media was not supportive. And believe \nit or not, money probably dominated politics even more than it does \ntoday.\n  However, those women and men felt, as citizens of a democracy, they \nhad the right to demand for themselves and their families all they \nthought was right and all they had the courage to demand. They didn't \nwin everything, but a lot of their demands became the law of the land \nand their collective efforts made our country better. Their efforts \namounted to an effort to civilize a new national economy.\n  So it is today, 100 years later. These amendments I will bring to the \nfloor of the Senate reflect an effort on the part of people in the \nUnited States of America and others throughout the world to say, yes, \nwe live in a new global economy, but just as 100 years ago men and \nwomen organized and had the courage to make that new national economy \nwork for them, we make a set of demands. We bring a set of issues \nbefore the Senate. We call for votes on amendments which basically say \nthat we need to make sure that this new global economy works for \nworking people, works for family farmers, works for the environment, \nworks for human rights.\n  Mr. President, we want to make sure we can civilize this new global \neconomy so that it works for most of the people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next two Democratic speakers be \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Torricelli, and that Senator Torricelli's \nstatement be considered a morning business statement, after Senator \nGorton speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8041-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8041-S8042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, after a refreshing though strenuous August \nrecess, we are now in the home stretch not only of this session of \nCongress but of this Congress.\n  The previous speaker discussed one of the great national and \ninternational priorities, normal trade relations with China on a \npermanent basis. I have several other priorities, both national and \nregional, that I will discuss, each of which I think is vitally \nimportant for the successful conclusion of this Congress of the United \nStates.\n  At the very top of my list is pipeline safety. More than a year ago, \na tragic accident in Bellingham, WA, occurred with a liquid pipeline. A \nhuge explosion snuffed out the lives of three bright young people and \ndestroyed a magnificent and beautiful park. Ever since the date of that \naccident, my colleague from the State of Washington and I have focused \na great deal of attention on the renewal and the strengthening of the \nPipeline Safety Act and of the Office of Pipeline Safety, designed to \nenforce its restrictions.\n  We have succeeded in passing a relatively strong Pipeline Act \nreauthorization through the Senate Commerce Committee with certain \nobjections, with a number of amendments that were seriously contested \nand closely divided in that committee. We have now worked diligently \nwith all concerned and I believe we are on the verge of a bill that can \ncome before this Senate and can be passed enthusiastically, and I \nbelieve unanimously, by the Senate of the United States. It is \nimperative that we do so quite promptly because while the House has \nbegun to focus attention on the issue, time is very short before the \nend of this Congress to actually accomplish the goals we seek in \nincreasing pipeline safety.\n  A dramatic and equally tragic incident during the course of the last \nmonth with a national gas pipeline in New Mexico has illustrated most \nregrettably, once again, the essential nature of our improving pipeline \nsafety standards all across the United States. I am focused \nparticularly on giving a more significant voice in pipeline safety \nmatters to the people who live in the vicinity of these pipelines and \nwhose lives regrettably seem to be very much at risk with respect to \neither negligence or oversight on the part of those who own and operate \nthese pipelines.\n  Pipelines, both for natural gas and for the transmission of liquid \npetroleum products, are a vitally important part of our economy. In \nsome respects, they are safer than other forms of transportation for \nthese commodities. However, accidents are all too frequent, and all too \nfrequently those accidents are devastating and fatal in nature.\n  The importance of passing this legislation cannot be overemphasized. \nI am highly optimistic on this subject. I had an extensive discussion \nlast evening with the majority leader and have his encouragement. I \nbelieve in the course of the next few days we will be able to take up \nthis bill.\n  Regrettably, on another high national priority, I find myself \nfrustrated that we have not made a sufficient degree of progress. A \nnumber of days, over a period of weeks and months, have been devoted in \nthis body to a debate on education policy and a renewal of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. For all practical purposes, \nthat bill is being frustrated by extended discussion, led by the \nunalterable opposition to providing more trust and confidence in our \nlocal school authorities on the part of the Democratic leadership and \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  An integral part of the bill, which is still before this body and \nwhich has majority support, is Straight A's. Straight A's gives State \nschool authorities several options: One, to continue under the present \nsystem. Two, for a dozen or so States to combine a dozen or more \npresent categorical aid programs into one system that comes to the \nState, is passed through with at least 95 percent of the money to \nindividual school districts on one undertaking and one undertaking \nonly, and that undertaking is that each State that would get this \nauthority will sign a contract pursuant to which there will be an \nimprovement in the skills of the students over a 5-year period; that is \nto say, by any objective measure that the State uses, our kids will be \nbetter educated.\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\n  It is a dramatic change. It is a change from process accountability, \nthe form of accountability we have at the present time--that is to say: \nDid you fill out the forms correctly?--to results accountability: Are \nour children better educated? I am convinced and a majority of this \nbody is convinced that by providing more trust and confidence in \nparents and teachers and principals and school board members--the \npeople who know our children's names--that the students' education will \nimprove. There is still time to pass such a bill. I regret the \nopposition even to a test, optional to each State, is so great it seems \nunlikely that this vitally important education reform will be passed.\n  Just last week I spoke to the junior and senior classes at Bridgeport \nHigh School, a rural school in Washington State, a very small school, \nnot more than 100 students and faculty combined. They do not need more \nFederal rules and regulations. They don't need to be told they should \nuse the newest Federal program to hire roughly half a teacher, which is \nwhat they get under that program. They need our trust and confidence in \nthe dedicated nature of those teachers and administrators and parents \nin that community, who know better than we do here in Washington, DC, \nwhat the students of Bridgeport, WA, need. The same thing is true of \n17,000 other school districts across the United States.\n  I also note present on the floor today my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota. He and I are joined in at least two other \npriorities with which we are dealing this year. One is the opportunity \nto end unilateral boycotts against the export of food and medicines \nfrom the United States. We represent, I am convinced, a substantial \nmajority of the Members of the Senate, as well as the House of \nRepresentatives. We have a termination to those boycotts in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill that is now before our conference \ncommittee. I know he joins with me in believing that it is absolutely \nessential, and long overdue, that we end those agricultural boycotts at \nthe present time and provide additional markets to American farmers and \nagricultural producers as at least one modest step toward returning \nprosperity to the agricultural sector of our economy.\n\n  We are also joined in believing that Americans are overcharged for \nprescription drugs, that we have a system under which American \npharmaceutical companies--who benefit from very large subsidies, both \nindirectly from the National Institutes of Health, and directly through \ntax credits for the development of prescription drugs--that when those \ncompanies charge Americans twice as much or more than twice as much for \nthose drugs as they charge, for all practical purposes, almost anyone \noutside the United States, that something is absolutely wrong. Again, \nwe have passed in this body at least a significant step in the \ndirection of correcting that injustice. I think it is very important \nthat the appropriations bill to which that important matter is attached \nbe passed and we make at least a significant step, a genuine step \nforward toward fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of all Americans in \nthe cost of the prescription drugs that are so important to their \nhealth.\n  On two other subjects, this body has passed a bill attempting to \nensure the reliability of our electrical transmission system and the \nsupply of electricity to all the people of the United States. We have \nhad unwarranted price hikes. We have had both the existence and threat \nof brownouts in various parts of this country this year. That situation \nis only going to get worse until we do something about it. A \nnoncontroversial but vitally important electricity reliability bill has \npassed this body. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives \nto do the same.\n  Finally, on a regional issue, the great issue in the Pacific \nNorthwest is the future of our hydroelectric dam system on the Columbia \nand Snake Rivers, and particularly the four dams on the lower Snake \nRiver. Many in this administration have pursued the foolish goal of \nremoving those dams in order, the administration asserts, to save \nsalmon. Nothing could be less cost effective as against the many \nabsolutely first rate programs that are going on in the Pacific \nNorthwest directly to that end, programs that not at all incidentally \nhave been remarkably successful if we measure them by this year's \nreturn of spring chinook salmon to the Columbia River system.\n  The administration and the Vice President have blinked in this \nconnection, knowing the proposal is as unpopular as it is absurd in the \nPacific Northwest. One group in the administration said it would be off \nthe table for 8 years. However, the chairman of the White House Council \non Environmental Quality was cited in the course of the last month \nsaying that moratorium will only be for 3 years, and the Vice President \nis not guaranteeing 3 years but just, ``as long as it [the present \nsystem] works.'' My own view is that that is until after the November \nelection.\n  So to the best of my ability to do so, the administration will be \ngiven the opportunity to put its money where its mouth is with a \nprohibition against its using any money in the appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2001, not only for removing the dams but for any step or \npurpose on the road to removing those dams. The debate over salmon \nrecovery, a universal goal in the Pacific Northwest, will be far more \nconstructive and far more productive when that particular view is taken \noff of the agenda in its entirety.\n  Finally, as the Senator responsible for the management of the \nInterior appropriations bill, we must, of course, deal with the \nremaining fires across the United States in our forests and on our \nrangelands, and particularly again in the Northwest part of the United \nStates from which my State has not been entirely free but with which it \nhas not been afflicted to the extent that Montana, Idaho, and certain \nother States have been. Whatever our concerns about the causes of those \nfires, the expenditures that have been made and are to be made in \nconnection with their suppression are a genuine emergency and will be \nincluded in the conference committee report on the Interior Department \nbill as an emergency. At the same time, due to the very hard work of my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, there are dramatic \nchanges in fire prevention policies which will also be included in that \nbill that are vitally important to see to it that we do not soon have a \nrepetition of the disastrous fires that have consumed so many hundreds \nof thousands, even millions of acres of our public and private lands \nduring the course of this summer.\n  Mr. President, that is an ambitious agenda, but I believe it to be a \nvitally important agenda, not only for my own constituents but for the \npeople of the United States as a whole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is to be recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey be recognized for 10 minutes, following which I will be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, I want to address the Senate today on \nthe question of the national elections and the rising interest by the \nAmerican people in campaign finance reform. There is no better time to \ndebate the intricacies of how we are financing and conducting national \nelections than in the midst of the very contests themselves.\n  Over the next 8 weeks, candidates for Federal office will spend more \nmoney than at anytime in American history to attempt to persuade the \nAmerican people in the casting of their votes. There is one simple, \ncompelling reason for this spiraling increase in campaign expenditures, \nand that is the cost of televised political advertising, the cost of \nbeing on the national television networks.\n  This Congress has tangentially dealt with some of the campaign \nfinance problems. It is obviously positive that Congress tightened \nregulations for the disclosure of contributions for section 527 \norganizations. It was a small victory.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n  We have, through the years, increased the number of votes in this \ninstitution, of which I am one, for comprehensive reform as envisioned \nby Mr. Feingold and Mr. McCain. But indeed, even if both of these \nprovisions were enacted, the pressure for increased expenditures would \nnot abate. With all of these reforms in place, the pressure to raise \nmore money and spend more money would still dominate the system, which \nleads to the proposition that to deal with the costs of advertising on \ntelevision, either this Congress must go beyond the current debate on \ncampaign finance reform or others outside of the Congress must become \npart of the solution.\n  Ironically, the principal critique of the campaign finance system is \ncoming from the very people who are driving its costs--the television \nnetworks. A 30-second prime time advertisement in the New York City \nmarket now costs $50,000. In Chicago, the same advertisement can cost \nmore than $20,000. This is the heart of the problem.\n  The New York Times estimates the 2000 elections will cost $3 billion. \nThis is a 50-percent increase over the 1996 elections. And $600 \nmillion, or 20 percent of those expenditures, will be on political \nadvertisements on television. This represents a 40-percent increase in \nonly 4 years.\n  During the Presidential primaries, both Gore and Bush spent 46 \npercent of all of their campaign expenditures just on television ads, \ntwice as much as any other category of expenditures. The evidence is \noverwhelming. What is driving this increase in expenditures, hence \nrequiring the raising of these exorbitant, even obscene, amounts of \nmoney, is the cost of television advertising. It could not be clearer.\n  Potentially the most expensive Senate race in American history is \ngoing to be the current Senate race in New Jersey. A study by the \nAlliance for Better Campaigns focused on last June's primary in my \nState. It came to the following conclusions:\n  Local television stations in New York and Philadelphia took in a \nrecord $21 million from New Jersey Senate candidates, but these same \ntelevision affiliates of the networks devoted an average of only 13 \nseconds per night in the final 2 weeks of the Senate campaign to actual \nnews.\n  This chart illustrates what was available to the people of my State \nin choosing a Senator. In New York, a CBS affiliate--this is in the \nfinal 2 weeks of the campaign, only the last 14 days--devoted 10 \nseconds to coverage of news on the campaign. In Philadelphia, one \nnetwork gave an average of 1 second per night to actual news about the \ncampaign.\n  It is, therefore, not unpredictable that this would lead to \ncandidates unable to communicate with voters through the news spending \nexorbitant amounts of money in advertisements. Indeed, during the final \n2 weeks of the New Jersey Senate primary, viewers in Philadelphia and \nNew York markets were 10 times more likely to receive a communication \nfrom a candidate through a paid advertisement than they were through an \nactual news story. They were 10 times more likely, if they were \nwatching the news, to see an ad rather than actually seeing a report \nfrom a reporter on the campaign.\n  Paid advertisements have come to dominate sources of information over \nactual news reports in American political campaigns.\n  During the last Presidential primary season, it was much the same. \nThe typical local television station aired less than 1 minute of \ncandidates discussing issues each night. During the month before the \nSuper Tuesday primary on March 7, the national networks aired a nightly \naverage of 36 seconds. The people of the United States were choosing \ntheir two nominees in the major national primary, and for the preceding \nmonth the television networks devoted 36 seconds to discussing issues. \nOf the 22 televised Presidential debates held during this year's \nprimary season, 2 were aired on network television. ABC, CBS, and NBC \nreduced by two-thirds the amount of time that was then devoted to the \nnational political conventions.\n  This is the source of some obvious changes in the American political \nculture. Not only is this collapse of news coverage leading candidates \nto raise more money and buy more advertisements, it is obviously \nchanging how the American people make their judgments.\n  On average, since 1952, 22 percent of voters have said they decided \nhow to vote based on their observation of political conventions. This \nis also in a state of collapse. People made judgments on hard news, \nthey made judgments on political conventions, they watched for sources \nof news that were unbiased or professional, and that is being replaced \nby political advertisements, not by choice but because there is no \nchoice.\n  It is extraordinary, given this state of affairs, that the principal \nforce driving allegedly for campaign finance reform has been in the \nmedia.\n  The networks reduced the amount of news coverage, radically increased \nthe cost of advertising, and then complained about campaign financing. \nIt is an extraordinary state of affairs.\n  Indeed, at this point, the television networks have political \nadvertising as the third most lucrative source of their revenues--only \nbehind the automobile companies and retail advertisers.\n  Indeed, buying air time for political ads is now 10 percent of the \nrevenues of the television networks. Hence, it will become clear why \nthey may complain about the cost of political campaigns, \nappropriately--because we all want reform in this institution more than \nthey--but one can see why they are leading by complaint, not by \nexample, in doing anything about the costs. They are themselves living \noff of and profiting by the system. And it is accelerating.\n  In the last decade, the percentage of political ads as a portion of \ntotal revenue of the television networks has gone from 3 percent of all \nrevenue in political ads in 1992 to 9.2 percent this year and rising.\n  During the last cycle, network broadcasters accepted $531 million in \npolitical advertising. This is a 33-percent increase since 1996 and \nover a 110-percent increase since a decade ago. It isn't just that they \nare charging exorbitant money; it is rising in multiples every year. \nThey are driving the cost of American political campaigns.\n  Candidates have been living, for the last 25 years, with the same \n$1,000 limit in raising hard Federal dollars--$1,000 per American per \nelection. But the networks are up 110 percent in how much they are \ntaking in, meaning that candidates are spending more and more time, \ngoing to more and more people, raising more and more money to \ncommunicate with the same voters.\n  I do not know how we get this Congress to enact campaign finance \nreform. I trust at some point it will happen. I do not know what else \nthe Democratic Party can do. We have had 45 seats in the Senate for the \nlast 2 years, and every single Democrat has voted for campaign finance \nreform.\n  But even if we were to have succeeded in those votes, it would not \nhave solved this problem. We would limit how much would be raised, \nperhaps, but we would not deal with these expenditures. Ultimately, it \nis these expenditures that must be addressed.\n  As my friend, Senator McConnell, stated many times on the floor of \nthis Senate, the Nation does not suffer from too much political debate. \nIt probably suffers from too little. If we lower the amount that can be \nraised, and the networks keep raising the amount that is required to be \nspent, all we are going to accomplish is less discussion of issues. If \nthe networks were devoting more time to the impartial discussion of \nissues, debates, news coverage, conventions, it would be a good \nsubstitute for political advertising. But the amount of news coverage \nis collapsing while the costs go up.\n  If we control the expenditures, the net result will simply be this: \nThe American people, making vital decisions about the Nation's future, \nwith less and less and less information.\n  The hypocrisy of this gets worse. It is not just that networks charge \nmore money and have less news coverage. For those of us who believe \nthere should be a requirement for free or reduced-rate air time over \nthe public airwaves, to reduce the need to raise this money, guess who \nis working against us. The very people who employ Mr. Brokaw, Mr. \nRather, and Mr. Jennings, who, every night, are complaining about the \ncost of political advertising. Their employers are lobbying to stop the \nreforms. The National Association of Broadcasters, the lobbying arm of\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\nthe television networks, spent $2.8 million lobbying Congress in 1998.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. In the year 2000, they have already spent $1.4 \nmillion.\n  As the Washington Post reported on May 2, when it comes to helping \nsolve the political fundraising problem, the broadcasting industry \n``doesn't see beyond its own bottom line.'' Exactly.\n  They are for campaign finance reform, unless they have to make a \ncontribution. They are the principal component of this problem. Every \nperson in this institution is spending time raising money when they \nshould be working on legislation--compromising public confidence in the \nCongress by raising exorbitant amounts of money to feed the television \nnetworks that do not meet their own responsibility in reporting the \nnews, no less in reducing the costs.\n  This is everybody's problem. The principal burden of solving it is in \nthis Senate. I do not excuse that. The principal burden is here. We \nshould be requiring free or low-cost television. But it is not our \nproblem alone. Everyone in America can make a contribution to this. And \nit begins with the networks. You have a public license. The airwaves of \nthe United States belong to the American people. In no other democracy \nin the world does the cost approach what we require for political \ncandidates to raise money to use the public airwaves to communicate \nwith our own constituents--sold at a profit.\n  I believe this Senate should require the FCC to have the networks \noffer a reasonable amount of free or reduced-rate advertising to \ncandidates for Federal office as a matter of law. But until we do, the \nnetworks, as a matter of public responsibility, need to evaluate how \nmuch time they are devoting to political news so the American people \nare informed, recognizing that is the only way for democracy to reach \nsound judgments, and to unilaterally meet their responsibility and \nreduce these costs unless or until this Congress takes action. I \nbelieve this is the heart of the campaign finance problem.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, once again, for \nallowing me the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, am I recognized for 30 minutes by previous \nconsent in postcloture debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some long while ago I was at a meeting in \nNorth Dakota, and I was talking about senior citizen issues and health \ncare, and a range of things, and I used a statistic. I told the senior \ncitizens who were at the meeting that there are two men for every woman \nover the age of 80 in the United States. And an older fellow rose from \nhis chair and leaned forward on his cane and said to me: Young man, \nthat is one of the most useless statistics I have ever heard.\n  I thought about that for a while. There are a lot of useless \nstatistics used in all kinds of different venues. In this discussion \nabout trade, there will certainly be plenty of statistics used. Perhaps \nplenty of them will be useless. But I do want to talk about some trade \nstatistics today because we are now debating the motion to proceed to \nthe bill that would make normal trade relations with China permanent.\n  I think there are a lot of wonderful things going on in this country. \nAll of us should count our blessings that we live in a country that is \ndoing so well. The economy is growing, growing rapidly; we have \nunprecedented economic growth and opportunity. It is a great time. \nUnemployment is down, way down. Inflation is down, way down. Crime is \ndown. Home ownership is up.\n  You could look at all of the data. Productivity is up, up, way up. \nAll of the data shows that this country is doing very well. All of us \nneed to be thankful for that.\n  But there are some storm clouds on the horizon in one area, and that \nis in the area of international trade. And we should not ignore them.\n  This is not about Republicans and Democrats. It is about a public \npolicy area this country must address. If we don't address it in a \nthoughtful way, we will not continue this kind of economic opportunity \nand growth.\n  Here is a chart that describes what is happening in trade. This is \nthe merchandise trade deficit for this country; that is, the trade in \ngoods. I have not included the trade in services, only the trade in \nmerchandise goods. This is essentially manufacturing. We eliminated the \nred ink in the budget. The budget deficits are gone. But the trade \ndeficits are going up, way up. This year especially. In June, the \nmonthly merchandise trade deficit increased to $36.8 billion. The \ndeficit for the first half of this year was $216 billion. That means \nthat at the end of this year we will probably have a $430 billion \nmerchandise trade deficit. We are buying from abroad $1.2 billion a day \nin goods more than we are selling abroad, and that can't continue \nforever.\n  With whom are these deficits? Well, for the first half of the year \n2000, the merchandise deficit that we have with Mexico is nearly $12 \nbillion; with Canada, $22.6 billion and increasing dramatically. With \nthe European Union, it is a dramatic increase from $16 billion for the \nfirst half of last year to $26 billion this year. With China, it has \nincreased from $29 billion to $36 billion.\n  These are not yearly figures. These are 6-month figures, January \nthrough June. So this is equal to a $72 billion annual trade deficit \nwith the country of China. With Japan, this is almost unforgivable, \nyear after year, forever, we have had these huge budget deficits with \nJapan. Now they are totaling nearly $80 billion a year.\n  What is happening is wrong. I am not a classic ``protectionist,'' as \nthe press would describe some of those involved in this debate. I \nbelieve we need to expand international trade. I believe we ought to be \nopen for competition and be required to compete. But I also believe the \ntrade ought to be fair; the rules of trade ought to be fair. \nGlobalization attends to it some requirement that we have global rules, \nnot only global markets.\n  What is happening here, with Japan and China and, yes, others, is \nthey are selling into our marketplace at a record pace in a whole range \nof areas, yet we are not able to access opportunities in their \nmarketplace. I wonder how many Americans know what the tariff would be \non a pound of U.S. beef that is shipped to Japan today? Do you want to \nship a T-bone steak that comes from a ranch in North Dakota to Tokyo? \nWhat do you think the tariff would be on a T-bone steak going to Tokyo? \nI will tell you what it is. It is over 40 percent, a tariff of over 40 \npercent on American beef going into Japan. That is after we have \nnegotiated an agreement with Japan. That shows the failure of our \nnegotiations. A country that has an $80 billion trade surplus with us \nis allowed to have a greater than 40-percent tariff on American beef \ngoing to them. Obviously, there is something fundamentally wrong with \nthe way we negotiate trade agreements.\n  We recently negotiated a trade agreement with China, a big, old \ncountry with 1.2 billion people. One can't help but stand on the Great \nWall of China and look at those mountains, at the country, and express \nwonder at who they are and where they have been, their rich history, \nand what they will be tomorrow. What an interesting country. But we \nhave a $72 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. We just \nnegotiated an agreement that is a bad agreement. Let's take automobiles \nas one example: China has 1.2 billion potential drivers, as soon as \nthey all reach driving age, and we want to sell American cars to some \nof them. So here is what we said when we negotiated the agreement: This \nis what we will do. You have a $72 billion trade surplus with us, or we \nhave a big deficit with you. So we will negotiate a bilateral agreement \nwith you where we will have a 2.5-percent tariff on any \nChinese automobiles you want to send to us, and we will have a 25-\npercent tariff on any automobiles we send into China. In other words, \nafter the negotiation is done, we will agree that we\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\nwill accept a tariff imposed by China that is 10 times higher on U.S. \nautomobiles than will be imposed by the United States on vehicles from \nChina.\n\n  Ask somebody, how on Earth can that happen? Was somebody drinking \nheavily while they negotiated? How can one possibly agree to something \nthat is that unfair? I could go on and on. It will serve no purpose, \nexcept to say that these numbers ought to demonstrate that while things \nare doing well in this country and while we are blessed with a \nwonderful economy, these storm clouds with respect to the trade \nimbalance need to be attended to. We need better trade agreements, and \nwe need more attention to trade agreements that require elements of \nfair trade between our country and Japan, between us and the Chinese, \nbetween us and Europe, and between us and Canada.\n  Last month, The Wall Street Journal had a piece ``Will the Trade Gap \nLower the Boom?'' It notes that our trade gap is now about 4.2 percent \nof our overall economy, and it goes on to say that:\n\n       A percentage that high would scare the green eyeshades \n     right off the analysts in many industrialized nations.\n\n  We don't hear a whisper about it--not here, not around the country, \nvery seldom in the press. This is a very unusual story. It also says:\n\n       But there is a disaster scenario that . . . gets more \n     likely with each breath that fills the trade deficit balloon. \n     . . . On average, the current account gap hits its limit at \n     4.2 percent of GDP, exactly where the U.S. finds itself \n     today. . . . Confidence in our economy could collapse before \n     the rest of the world is firmly back on its feet.\n\n  The point is there is something wrong here, and Congress cannot \nignore it. That is why Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and I created in \nlegislation a trade deficit review commission. It has finished its \nmeetings and is now developing recommendations to policymakers both in \nthe administration and Congress, on how to deal with this issue.\n  I have supported normal trade relations with China in the past. But, \nthe issue for me isn't shall we make it permanent or not. Shall we have \nNTR with China? Of course, we should. The issue is: Are we going to do \nsomething about these deficits? Does anybody think having a $72 billion \ndeficit with China is normal? Is that a normal trade relationship? Of \ncourse, it is not. It is abnormal. It is a perversion. How about Japan? \nIs this a normal trade relationship, having an $80 billion deficit with \nthe country of Japan? That is not normal. It is abnormal. We, as a \ncountry, need to understand and say to China and Japan and others, the \nEuropean Union, that we are all for expanded trade. We have been the \nleader in expanding trade. But we are also going to be the leader in \nstanding up for our economic interests and demanding that the rules of \ntrade be fair rules.\n  The first 25 years after the Second World War we could compete with \nanybody around the world with one hand tied behind our back. It was no \nproblem at all. That was when our trade policy was just flat out \nforeign policy. The second 25 years, we have seen tougher economic \ncompetitors. Countries have developed with strong economies. They have \nbecome shrewd economic competitors. Every one of these countries have a \nmanaged trade economy in which they say: We will not allow what the \nUnited States allows. We will not ever allow the kind of run up of a \ntrade deficit that the United States will allow.\n  We do it because we don't pay attention to it. We have this \nphilosophy that somehow it will all right itself at some point in the \nfuture. It will not right itself without action by the Congress and the \nadministration to say we are the leaders in free, expanded and fair \ntrade, and we insist the rules of trade be fair.\n  I come to the floor during this discussion about China PNTR to say \nthat there are other elements, in many ways bigger issues, to this \ntrade debate that we must be attentive to and we must do so soon.\n  While there is a lot of good news--and we will hear a great deal of \nit during the campaigns by Republicans and Democrats, claiming credit \nfor this, that, and the other thing--but I hope we will all claim \ncredit for the responsibility to begin solving these problems. During \ngood times, it seems to me, is the opportunity to look down the road \nand see where the storm clouds develop and figure out how to respond to \nthem. We must, it seems to me, decide that it is a significant issue \nand it is in the interest of all citizens in this country that Congress \nbegin to tackle this issue in a way that reduces these trade deficits, \ncontinues to expand our trade opportunities, but puts us on a better \nfooting with our trading partners.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke briefly about the agenda \nthat confronts this Congress in the next 5 weeks. This is literally a \nsprint to the finish. Much of what we will discuss and debate are the \nmost important issues people worry about and are talking about around \nthe supper table. They talk about the issues that affect them every \nday: Are our kids going to good schools? Are we proud of the schools we \nsend our kids to? Do I have a good job? Does it provide retirement \nbenefits, insurance, security? Will grandma and grandpa have adequate \nhealth care when they have serious health problems? Is our neighborhood \na safe one in which to live? Can we afford the prescription drugs that \nthe doctor prescribes and says we need to maintain a healthy lifestyle \nand to control a disease we may have?\n  All of these things are the things that interest families who discuss \nwhat their lives are like these days and how they can be improved.\n  I want to talk about the agenda and the issues with which we have to \ndeal before this Congress adjourns. Before I do, as a way of \nintroducing that, let me tell you about a television story that \nappeared on KFYR Television in Bismarck, ND, about 2 to 3 weeks ago. \nKFYR Television News did a piece about my Uncle Harold. My Uncle \nHarold, from Dickinson, ND, is now 80 years old, and he is a runner. \nThere are not very many 80-year-old runners, so the television news did \na story about him. The story showed him running down the street, with \nthe gold medals he has won, and doing various things.\n  Here is the story about my uncle. About 6 or 7 years ago, he and my \naunt went to the Prairie Rose Games in Fargo, ND, where they have \nevents for everybody in different age brackets. They decided to enter \nthe bowling event because they bowl. Harold also saw that they had \nraces for people who are 70 and above, so he decided to enter one at \nabout age 71. He had never run before, but he decided to enter three \nraces at the Prairie Rose Games, and he won all three easily. He said, \n``You know, I never knew I could run like that.'' So he started \nrunning. He went to Minnesota to run, and then to South Dakota, and \nArizona.\n  Pretty soon, Uncle Harold started specializing. Now he runs in the \n400 meter and 800 meter events. So I have this uncle who just turned 80 \nrunning in races all over the country. He now has 45 gold medals. My \naunt thinks he has had a stroke. She thinks it is as goofy as the devil \nthat this 80-year-old man is running. Yet he discovered he is the \nfastest around in his age bracket. He is going to try out for the \nSenior Olympics and go one more time. He took fifth out of 200-some \nrunners the last time. Now that he is 80 and at the bottom of a new age \nbracket, he thinks he will get a gold medal in the Olympics. My uncle \nis a fisherman, so I don't know whether this is true, but he said he \nruns the 400 meter race in 79 seconds. I run a little as well. One of \nthese days I will figure out whether I can run it in 79 seconds.\n  I should mention one other thing about Uncle Harold. He also golfs, \nand he is the strangest golfer I have ever golfed with. I went golfing \nwith my uncle a couple of years ago. He takes a bag and only takes four \nor five clubs. He hits the ball and, because he is always in training \nfor the Senior Olympics, he sprints on a dead run to the ball. It is a \nstrange looking thing to see a guy who was 78 years old at the time hit \na ball and go on a dead run to find out where it rested and then hit it \nagain. In the meantime, my wife and I were driving a cart, and this 78-\nyear-old man is sprinting on the golf course. I have since decided I \nshould never\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\ndrive a cart when golfing with my uncle.\n  The point is, here is this 80-year-old guy jogging 3 miles a day, \ngetting ready to try to qualify to go again to the National Senior \nOlympics. That is pretty remarkable when you think about it. Thirty \nyears ago, that would not have happened. Usually, when you are 80, you \nfind a chair someplace and relax. But these days people are living \nlonger, healthier lives. My uncle, for example, is training for the \nOlympics. That is the result of a lot of things: lifestyle changes, \nnutrition changes, cultural changes, better health care, Medicare. A \nwhole series of things are happening in this country that are pretty \nremarkable. That really all relates to the agenda that we have in the \nnext 5 weeks in this Congress.\n  Americans are living longer, living better, at a time when we are so \nblessed in this country. We have an agenda in the Congress that will \nhave an impact on people's lives. Yes, for my uncle, but for \neverybody's aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters--the agenda of health \ncare and education and other things that mean so much to people's \nlives.\n  Let me talk for a minute about what we need to do and why. First of \nall, one of the advancements that allows people to live longer and \nhealthier lives is the increase in the use of prescription drugs. There \nare so many illnesses and diseases for which, 35 years ago when \nMedicare was developed by this Congress, there were no medicines. But \nnow there are miracle drugs, prescription medicines. We have decided \nthat it is important to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. Why? Because being able to afford the right prescription drugs \ncan allow people to lead healthier lives and treat illnesses and stay \nout of a hospital, which is horribly expensive. It is, in the long run, \na bargain for the American people to say let's have a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program.\n  Now, some say, well, we cannot afford it. The fact is that it will \ncost a lot more if we don't have it. People will get sick and go to \nhospitals and it will cost more. The issue of affordability applies \nmore to senior citizens than to the Government. The reason we need this \nbenefit is that too many senior citizens know they need a medicine, but \nthey can't afford to buy it.\n  A doctor in Dickinson, ND, testified at a hearing I held in \nDickinson. He said he prescribed a drug to a senior citizen who had a \nmastectomy in order to treat her breast cancer. The doctor said to his \npatient: This is the drug I am going to prescribe for you because it \nwill reduce the chances of a recurrence of your cancer. She said: What \ndoes it cost? He told her and she said: Doctor, I can't afford to take \nthat drug. I will just have to take my chances.\n  At every hearing I have held, I have heard testimony from people who \nsay: We go to the back of the grocery store where the pharmacy is first \nbecause we have to buy our prescription drugs first; only then, will we \nknow how much money we have left over to buy food.\n  Spending on prescription drugs increased 16 percent last year in this \ncountry. Sixteen percent. Some of that is increased utilization and \nsome is increased prices. But too many senior citizens know they need a \nprescription drug, and they can't afford it. We need to do two things: \nput on pressure to bring drug prices down and, No. 2, add an \naffordable, universal, voluntary prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare program.\n  Mr. President, with your permission, I want to show a couple of pill \nbottles. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will speak about the prices charged for prescription \ndrugs in this country versus the prices charged elsewhere in the world \nfor the identical medicine.\n  These two bottles are slightly different but they contain the same \npill. Both bottles are for a wonderful drug called Zocor, which is used \nto lower cholesterol in patients. It is a medication that a lot of \npeople use. I commend all those who did the research to create these \nkind of drugs. But to those who decided the prices that ought to be \ncharged for these medications to various citizens around the world, I \ndon't say good job.\n  Let me describe what has happened.\n  In both bottles are the same pill, in the same dosage, made by the \nsame company, perhaps made in the same manufacturing plant, approved by \nthe FDA. Once the medicine is approved by the FDA, the FDA approves the \nmanufacturing plants, and the company produces the drug for sale. This \nbottle they sent to Canada. They say to the Canadians: Do you want to \nbuy some Zocor? It will lower your cholesterol. It is $1.82 per tablet.\n  This other bottle they sent to Grand Forks or Minot, ND, or anywhere \nelse in the U.S. To Americans they say: Do you want to buy some Zocor? \nWell, you will have to pay $3.82 per tablet. $1.82 and $3.82, why the \ndifference? That is something we ought to ask the drug companies.\n  I have taken a group of senior citizens to Canada to a little \ndrugstore in Emerson, Manitoba. I stood in that one-room pharmacy, and \nI saw the prices charged there. I have seen the prices charged for the \nsame medications in North Dakota. I know the drugstores on Main Streets \nin North Dakota are not charging higher prices because they want to \novercharge. They are simply having to pay the drug companies an \ninflated price far above that which is charged in Canada, England, \nGermany, Italy, France, and in virtually every other country in the \nworld because the pharmaceutical manufacturers impose that charge on \nthem. This is not the fault of Main Street drugstores.\n  Again, I ask the question--I have asked this many times--is there \nanyone in the Senate who wants to stand up and say: Count me in on \nsupporting these prices; I really believe it is fair and right to \ncharge the American consumer $3.82 for the exact same pill for which a \nCanadian is charged $1.82? Is there one Senator willing to say this? \nThere hasn't been one in the last six weeks that I have asked this \nquestion. If there is not any Senator willing to stand up and say this, \nthen will all of them join us to try to change this situation so that \nthe American consumer who needs to purchase prescription drugs receives \na fair price?\n  The amendment that we passed in the Senate is now in conference. I am \none of the conferees. What we are saying with this legislation is that \npharmacists and drug wholesalers have the same right to reimport \nprescription drugs into this country that the drug companies already \nhave, provided that the imported medications are FDA-approved and made \nin FDA-approved plants. It is very simple. We need to do that before \nthis session of Congress ends.\n  The prescription drug companies are working overtime, of course, to \nkill this provision. They say the issue is safety. It is not. It is \nprofits. That is what the issue is--profits, not safety. These are \npills made in FDA-approved plants. These are medicines approved by the \nFDA with a chain of custody that can be traced from the manufacturing \nplant to the drugstores. There is no safety issue at all.\n  Adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program and \nenacting legislation that we passed on the floor with the bipartisan \nsupport of Senator Jeffords, Senator Gorton, myself, and many others \nwho have worked on this are two things Congress must do before \nadjourning this year.\n  The other thing we need to do is pass a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I want to talk a few minutes about that today because we have \nPatients' Bill of Rights legislation that is in conference.\n  What is the Patients' Bill of Rights? This legislation says let's \neven up the odds a little bit between people who are sick and their \ninsurance companies. Let's even up the odds a little bit.\n  In some cases what has been happening is that a person's medical care \nhas become a function of their insurance company's profit. All too \noften doctors are not the ones making the decision about what kind of \ncare is provided to a patient. It is an accountant in some insurance \noffice thousands of miles away.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned a young boy in Nevada. I want to mention him \nagain because it seems to me that he illustrates, as with so many \nothers, the problem. A young man named Christopher Roe died October 12 \nlast year. His mother came to a hearing that\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\nSenator Reid and I co-chaired in Nevada. He died on October 12, 1999, \non his 16th birthday. The official cause of his death was leukemia. But \nhis mother tells us that the real reason he died was that his health \ncare plan denied him the investigational chemotherapy drug that he \nneeded. He needed a shot, a chance, and the bureaucracy of the managed \ncare organization never gave him that chance. They just took forever to \nget to that point.\n  Christopher Roe died, and Christopher Roe's mother came to our \nhearing. She held up a large picture of Christopher. She wept as she \ntold us about her son who from his sickbed looked up at her, and said, \n``Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid?'' Good \nquestion? Christopher died.\n  Or let me share another example. A woman fell off a cliff in the \nShenandoah mountains. She was hauled into an emergency room unconscious \nwith broken bones. She was treated. After a difficult period, she \nsurvived, and was then told by her managed care organization that they \nwouldn't cover her emergency room treatment because she didn't get \nprior approval. She was hauled in on a gurney unconscious, but the \nmanaged care organization said: You did not get prior approval for \nemergency room treatment.\n  That is the kind of thing that is happening all too often in this \ncountry.\n  Or, perhaps a better way to describe it is with the story of Ethan \nBedrick, a young boy born with cerebral palsy resulting from a \ncomplicated delivery who was told that he had only a 50-percent chance \nof being able to walk by age 5. The managed care organization denied \nhim the therapy he needed because they said a 50-percent chance of a \nyoung boy being able to walk by age 5 was insignificant. They \nconsidered it insignificant that a young boy had a 50-percent chance of \nbeing able to walk with the right kind of therapy.\n  Is there a reason to question those who are making health care \ndecisions in the sterile offices of managed care organizations 1,000 \nmiles away from where the doctor is seeing the patient and describing \nthe medical treatment that is necessary for the patient's care? Yes. \nThat is why I wanted to make this point.\n  We had a debate on patients' care in the Senate a while back. We lost \nby one vote, effectively, because there were some Members missing. We \nmay have turned the tide in the Senate based on that vote, in which \ncase the Presiding Officer may very well have broken the tie. But a \nsubstitute Patients' Bill of Rights was offered by our colleague, \nSenator Nickles, when we offered the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican Member of the U.S. House, wrote a \nletter to all of us about that substitute. In fact, the local papers \ndescribed the substitute that the Senate passed as the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. It was not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It was a ``patients' \nbill of goods.'' But the Senate passed it, and the papers wrote exactly \nwhat those who supported it had hoped they would: The Senate passed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  Dr. Ganske, a Republican Member of Congress, said this Senate \nlegislation virtually eliminates any meaningful remedy for most working \nAmericans and their families against death and injury caused by HMOs.\n  That is not a Democrat speaking. That is a Republican Member of the \nU.S. House, Dr. Ganske.\n  Let me describe the legal analysis he sent around to every Member of \nthe Senate:\n\n       . . . The measure would appear to undo State law remedies \n     for medical injuries caused by managed care companies \n     treatment decisions and delays.\n       . . . In the name of patient protection the Senate \n     legislation appears to eliminate virtually any meaningful \n     remedy for most working Americans and their families.\n       . . . A vehicle for protecting managed care companies from \n     various forms of legal liability under current law.\n       Viewed in this light, the congressional passage of the \n     Senate bill would be worse than were Congress to enact no \n     measure at all.\n\n  I raise this because this is not a Democrat being critical of a \nRepublican proposal. It is a Republican Member of Congress saying that \nthe proposal passed by the Senate was worthless, just worthless.\n  This is not partisan criticism, it is Dr. Ganske, a Republican Member \nof Congress, saying what the majority of the Senate claimed was a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights was worthless.\n  Now we could, and should, and I hope will pass a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights. There is a commercial being run in a northeastern State on \nbehalf of a Member of the Senate who voted for our Patients' Bill of \nRights, the Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights that was passed on \na bipartisan basis by the House. A Member of the Senate who voted for \nthat--a Republican; there were only a very few--is running a commercial \npaid for by the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee that says this \nSenator voted for a real Patients' Bill of Rights--meaning ours.\n  It is fascinating to me that we now have a circumstance where the \nRepublican Campaign Committee is saying that the Patients' Bill of \nRights we proposed was the ``real one.'' We will have more to say about \nthat and have a more aggressive debate about that in the days ahead.\n  My expectation is that there will be a tie vote when another vote \noccurs--and it will happen again; we fully intend it to happen again. \nFortunately, we will have a Vice President to break that tie. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights issue is very important.\n  Let me mention a couple of other issues, and then I will conclude.\n  We also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we \nhave not done so very well. We have a farm bill that doesn't work. The \nFreedom to Farm bill does not work. It has been a failure since it was \nenacted in 1996. The promise was: Produce what you want; we will sell \nit overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better \noff.\n  Since that time, prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an \nawful time trying to make ends meet. In most cases, they are receiving \nfar less now in real terms than they received during the Great \nDepression for their product. These are not people who are slothful. \nThese are not people who aren't being productive. They are economic \nall-stars. They produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs \nso desperately. Yet the market says: By the way, your food has no \nvalue.\n  While people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around \nthe world where there is not enough food, family farmers driving a 2-\nton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader: Your food \nhas no value.\n  Something is wrong with that. What really has no value is the current \nfarm program. It doesn't work. It is long past time to fix it. We are \nwithin three or four votes of doing that. I encourage help from the \nother side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that \nprovides real assistance for family farmers.\n  While we are on the subject of freedom, those who wrote the Freedom \nto Farm bill--I didn't, and I voted against it--should understand there \nis something called the freedom to sell. The freedom to sell means if \nyou want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever, let's \nalso give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as \nIran, Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, and others that have been off limits to \nthem because this country has imposed economic sanctions against \ncountries whose behavior we don't like. I am fine with economic \nsanctions. Slap them with sanctions. But don't ever include food as a \npart of those sanctions. Using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this \ncountry. A country as big and as good and as powerful and as important \nas this country ought never use food as a weapon.\n\n  The freedom to sell is a pretty important principle which we ought to \ncare a bit about. There is an amendment that I put in the \nappropriations bill now in conference, and I know there are a couple of \nHouse leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to \nconference. I am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the \nSenate that we will prevail on this issue.\n  Finally, one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this \nCongress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system \nin our country. We have the opportunity to do that. It is just that we \nhave all of this bickering back and forth. We have things that we know \nneed to be done. Everybody here understands that if you are in a \nclassroom of 15 people, there is more learning going on than if there \nis a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids. Class size matters. We have\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\nproposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve \neducation.\n  We also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional \ndisrepair. No wonder there is disrepair in the schools. They were built \n50 or 60 years ago, after World War II, when we had soldiers coming \nback, having families, and building schools for their children all \nacross the country. Many of these schools are still in use today and \nare in desperate need of repair and remodeling. If anyone doubts that, \ntake a trip to the Ojibwa school on the Turtle Mountain Indian \nReservation or the Cannon Ball Elementary School, south of Bismarck, \nND. Take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools \nneed help.\n  The third grader who walks through the classroom door in the Cannon \nBall School ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good \neducation as all kids in this country. Yet these children don't have \nthe same opportunity. We know that. Yet legislation to improve and \nmodernize our schools languish in this Senate because some people don't \nbelieve it is important, or some people believe they cannot do it \nbecause if they did, somebody would declare victory for a public policy \nthat makes sense.\n  Let's declare victory for a little common sense in all of these \nareas: Education, health care, agriculture. There are so many areas. \nThe agenda in this Congress is the agenda we establish. If we are a \nCongress of underachievers, that is our fault, not something we blame \non anybody else.\n  I wish I were in the majority here, but I am not. The majority \nestablishes a schedule; we don't. I accept that. We have a right, and \ninsist on the right, between now and the 5 weeks when this Congress \nwraps up its business, to try to bring to the floor of the Senate once \nagain a real Patients' Bill of Rights and have another vote. We have a \nright to try to push these policies to get them done. We have a right \nto try to push education policies that we think will enhance and \nimprove education in this country. We have a right to try to push \npolicies that say we want to add a prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare program. We have a right to insist that the American consumer \npay prices for prescription drugs that are fair--not the highest prices \nof anyone in the entire world.\n  We have a right to address all of those issues, and we should. There \nis time. It is just a matter of will. Will the Members of the Senate \nwho do the scheduling, who plan the agenda, exhibit the will to do what \nis right in the final 5 weeks and pass this kind of legislation?\n  As I said when I started, when people sit down at the dinner table \nand talk about their lives, they are talking about things that matter \nto them. All of the things I have talked about are things that matter \nto them: Are our kids going to good schools? Do grandpa and grandma \nhave the opportunity to get decent health care when they are sick? Are \nthe neighborhoods safe? Do I have a decent job? Does it pay well? Does \nit have security? All of those are things that are important to the \nAmerican people. All of those are things they should expect this \nCongress to address in the coming 5 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, what is the order of business pending \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is debating the motion to proceed \non the permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to talk about my support for \nH.R. 4444, but I just want to respond briefly to one comment of the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. I think he was bragging a little \nbit, maybe, about his uncle who is 80 years old and running in a \nmarathon. I just congratulate him. How great that our senior citizens, \nbecause of the advances of medicine, can do that. I have a friend \nretiring at the age of 65. He wanted to retire to spend more time \nplaying golf with his dad. Another is an uncle who was 85 last year who \ngot his first hole-in-one, Ray Sandey. I just wanted to put that into \nthe Record and congratulate them on their achievements.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the comments of my \ntwo colleagues who have spoken about the important issues facing our \naging populations in this Nation. They both commented on the 83-year-\nolds and the 84-year-olds. I think I have them beat. My husband's \ngrandmother will turn 103 on the last day of this month.\n  So the issues for the elderly in Arkansas are extremely important to \nus, a No. 1 priority, and something I hope we will address in the \ncontext of a prescription drug piece for the elderly, as well as \nreauthorizing the Older Americans Act, not to mention the importance of \nsolidifying and preserving Social Security and Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8048-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8048-S8066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n            REPUBLIC OF CHINA--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444, \nwhich grants permanent normal trade relations--PNTR--to China. We \nshould have passed this in early June, and I deeply regret the delay \nand hope we can expedite the House bill without amendments.\n  I believe this is a no brainer. China negotiated a WTO accession \nagreement with the United States--an agreement in which China has \ncommitted to improve market access for most U.S. products and services \nto China. In exchange, the one thing we are required to grant them is \nPNTR--the same treatment all WTO members afford each other.\n  The U.S.-China WTO agreement is a good one. China has made \ncommitments in nearly every sector of our economy--agriculture, goods \nand services. Strong enforcement measures were included which allow us \nto not only continue use of our strong trade remedy laws, but China has \nagreed to allow us to use a tougher safeguard standard than our current \n``201'' law and continued use of tougher antidumping laws. This will \nhelp us enforce the agreement and generally allow us to use very tough \ntrade remedy laws to address dumping and import surges.\n  U.S. competitiveness will also be protected since China has dropped \nits requirement that U.S. companies transfer technology in order to \nexport or invest in China. Exports to China will no longer require \nChinese components or performance requirements. China will allow \ncompetition through imports for the first time. U.S. exporters can sell \ndirectly rather than using a government distribution system. It has \nmade commitments on intellectual property enforcement as well.\n  For the first time, China will be subject to the multilateral trade \ndisciplines of the WTO. Any WTO member can enter into the dispute \nsettlement process with China if China does not live up to any of its \nbilateral commitments. We can still use our trade remedy laws against \nChina if necessary, and the Administration has tripled resources to \nmonitor and enforce the U.S.-China WTO accession agreement.\n\n  Some may say this week that we can continue our annual Jackson-Vanik \nreview of China and still receive the benefits of the U.S.-China \nagreement--or they will say the 1979 U.S.-China Bilateral Agreement \nwill provide the same benefits as the 1999 agreement. They will claim \nwe need the annual review to achieve progress on human rights, nuclear \nproliferation and other areas of differences we have with China. \nHowever, virtually none of the concessions achieved in the 1999 \nagreement are covered in the 1979 agreement. And we will not receive \nthe benefits under the 1999 agreement if we do not grant China PNTR. \nThe annual review is not responsible for the progress we have made in \nChina--so it is time to end it.\n  Let's examine what PNTR will mean to U.S. farmers and workers. A \nGoldman Sachs estimate indicates U.S. exports to China will increase by \n$14 billion per year by 2005. In 1998, U.S. exports to China exceeded \n$14 billion, which supported over 200,000 high-wage American jobs. \nTherefore, exports will more than quadruple by 2005--and the potential \nis enormous as China continues to grow in the future. USDA projects \nChina will account for over one-third of the growth in U.S. ag exports \nin the next ten years. It will spend over $750 billion for new \ninfrastructure projects.\n  Since the benefits for Minnesota my home state are particularly \nimportant to me, I want to use that as a reference, but I think it \nrepresents other States and their opportunities as well. Minnesota's \nexports to China in 1998\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\ntripled the 1996 volume. China is now Minnesota's 12th largest export \ndestination, up from 22nd in 1993. We are now exporting 25 product \ngroups compared to 21 in 1993. There are many farmers and workers who \nwill benefit from the projected growth in agriculture and \ninfrastructure project sales in China.\n\n  Overall, America's farmers will prosper with an end to corn export \nsubsidies, increased corn and wheat quotas, reduced tariffs from an \naverage of 31 percent to 14 percent with greater decreases on soybeans, \nbeef, pork, poultry, cheese, and ice cream. For example, my home State \nof Minnesota is the third largest soybean producer in the courtry, and \nChina is the largest growth market for soybean products. Minnesota is \nthe fourth largest feed corn producer, and the tariff-rate quota for \ncorn will expand by 2004. China consumes more pork than any other \ncountry and will lower its pork tariffs and accept USDA certification. \nThis is a huge boon for Minnesota pork producers. Cheese tariffs will \nbe reduced from 50 percent to 12 percent, which will benefit Minnesota \ndairy farmers. Potato product tariffs will also be cut in half \nbenefiting Minnesota's potato farmers and processors. Vegetable \nproducers will see their tariffs drop up to 60 percent by 2004. And \nfertilizer and all ag products can now be distributed without going \nthrough a Chinese middleman.\n  Tariff reductions will help other Minnesota workers export more in \nthe areas of ag equipment, forest products, medical equipment, \nscientific, and measuring instruments, computers, pumps, machinery of \nall kinds and environmental technology equipment. PNTR will open \nmarkets for our banking, insurance, telecommunications and software \nservices. In fact, the Coalition of Service Industries states:\n\n       It will enable U.S. service industries to begin to operate \n     in one of the world's most important--and until now, most \n     restricted--markets in the world.\n\n  Minnesota's largest exports to China now are industrial machinery, \ncomputers, and food products. And exports from small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses will expand. Right now Minnesota exports 55 percent of its \ntotal exports to China from small and medium businesses. Crystal Fresh, \nAmerican Medical Systems, Inc., Image Sensing Systems, Inc., Minnesota \nWire & Cable, ADC Telecommunications, Brustuen International, and Auto \nTech International are among Minnesota's smaller companies with success \nstories to tell. Their China markets are expanding, and the 1999 \nagreement will only increase their potential. Of course we have long-\ntime exporters such as Honeywell, 3M, Cargill, Pillsbury, Land O'Lakes, \nand many others who will be able to expand their exports to China as \nwell.\n\n  You have heard that the 1999 agreement will not produce overnight \nresults, but I believe it will produce some short-term positive \nresults. And the best benefit will be the longer term prospects. It is \nimportant to continue building commercial relationships for the future \nin order to reap those longer-term benefits. If we are not there early \non, we may miss out on important future gains. As China develops and \nmore of its citizens improve their earning power, they will demand more \nfood products, goods and services. PNTR will allow U.S. firms the \nopportunity to compete for their business.\n  I would now like to address some of the concerns of our labor union \nfriends who believe PNTR will result in huge job losses in the U.S. \nThat is curious to me since the U.S.-China WTO accession agreement is \none sided. Union leaders cite an Economic Policy Institute--EPI--study \nalleging at least 872,091 jobs will be lost between 1999 and 2010, but \nthe EPI study assumes every Chinese import displaces domestic \nproduction. However, a CATO analysis shows most of our imports from \nChina substitute for imports from other countries or are inputs used in \nthe U.S. to produce final U.S. products. If a rising trade deficit \ncauses job losses, why are our unemployment rates the lowest they have \nbeen in 30 years?\n\n  The Institute for International Economics also indicates that most of \nthe growth of the U.S.-China trade imbalance is due to China taking \nmarket share from other East Asian economies rather than from U.S. \nproducers.\n  The bilateral agreement includes greater protections against unfair \nimports than we currently have and it will eliminate many Chinese \npractices that have helped it stimulate its own exports as well as \nforcing many U.S. companies to invest in China. Any ``giant sucking \nsound'' we may have seen in the past will be reversed under the U.S.-\nChina WTO agreement. China will be forced to abandon many of its \npolicies which did force or encourage U.S. companies to invest there. \nThe agreement will grow U.S. jobs by allowing us to export more of our \nproducts from the U.S. rather than selling through U.S. investments in \nChina.\n  Union leaders also speculate that U.S. companies want to shift \nproduction to China to take advantage of labor rates ``as low as 13 \ncents an hour.'' The average production worker wage at U.S. companies \nin China is $4 an hour and $9.25 for higher skilled workers. The World \nBank indicates average Chinese wages grew by 343 percent between 1987 \nand 1997, mainly due to China's engagement with other countries. I \nbelieve approving PNTR and allowing more trade with China would \ncontinue the trend toward higher wages for Chinese workers.\n  A group of 12 academicians recently commented on China's low wages \nand stated that PNTR would help improve China's labor standards. They \ndiscussed China's poverty as the main reason for low wages and often \npoor working conditions. They concluded child labor often is necessary \nto help families survive. They believe China's entry into the WTO will \nhelp it enforce and improve its own laws, and that opposing PNTR \nundermines China's efforts to improve its labor rights. They concluded \nby stating:\n\n       Whoever may benefit from a sanctions approach to trade with \n     China, it will certainly not be Chinese workers or their \n     children.\n\n  You will also hear claims that the U.S. is being flooded with \nproducts made by Chinese forced labor. Both our trade laws and the WTO \nprohibit forced-labor imports, and the U.S. Customs Service vigorously \nenforces our law.\n  Union leaders also talk about PNTR as a reward to China, yet it is \nhard to see how the bilateral agreements negotiated by China to enter \nthe WTO are a reward. Many, many concessions were made, and those \ncommitments are binding and will be vigorously enforced bilaterally and \nthrough the WTO.\n  I hope union members, who will benefit from the U.S.-China WTO \nagreement, will listen to their elder statesman Leonard Woodcock, who \nstated recently:\n\n       I have been startled by organized labor's vociferous \n     negative reaction to this agreement . . . in this instance, I \n     think our labor leaders have got it wrong. . . . American \n     labor has a tremendous interest in China's trading on fair \n     terms with the U.S. The agreement we signed with China this \n     past November marks the largest single step ever taken toward \n     achieving that goal.\n\n  In my State of Minnesota, Governor Jesse Ventura, in his March \ntestimony before the Ways and Means Committee, also sent union leaders \na message. The Governor said:\n\n       They (unions) better modernize themselves and realize that \n     opening up China to our trade is going to create more jobs \n     here. . . .\n\n  I have spoken to union members and others who are also concerned \nabout labor and environmental practices in China. While China, as a \ndeveloping country, has a way to go on these issues, they certainly \nhave made some progress as well. And I am proud that American companies \ninvesting in China have created better jobs, higher wages and better \nworking conditions and have begun to serve as a model for their Chinese \ncounterparts. Many U.S. companies have ``best practices'' of \nenvironmental, health, and safety standards which provide good job \nopportunities for many Chinese citizens. Housing, meals, insurance, and \nmedical care are often included in their employment.\n\n  Here is what a Chinese employee of one American company in Shanghai \nstated:\n\n       I, a common girl, with no power and no money, could hardly \n     imagine all these things could be done several years ago . . \n     . don't let the friendship become cool (U.S.-China). Many of \n     the Chinese people are longing for knowledge, techniques and \n     culture from western countries, especially U.S.\n\n  An employee of another American firm in China stated:\n\n       . . . when our local company merged two years ago, my \n     salary was increased five or six times . . .\n\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\n\n  Another worker said:\n\n       After I joined the company, my family's life and living \n     standard improved, I have some deposit in the bank and bought \n     a new apartment which is big enough for my family.\n\n  You will hear a lot during this debate about how we are pandering to \nU.S. companies who want to trade with China, ignoring all of our \nconcerns with China. However, as noted previously, there are many \nexamples of how American companies are helping Chinese citizens improve \ntheir lives, and as China privatizes more of its state-owned \nindustries, the new owners will look to our companies as an example of \nhow to succeed. I strongly believe American companies care about their \nemployees and that they do not invest abroad to exploit local workers \nand ruin the environment. I believe American companies help bring about \npositive changes in China and other nations, and the exposure to \nWestern ideals and values they bring to China includes a better work \nexperience for those they hire. In fact, American companies are taking \ntheir responsibility seriously by setting up programs in their Chinese \nsubsidiaries addressing issues from fair labor practices and \nenvironmental standards to community involvement.\n  For those concerned about human rights, I again ask why they believe \nhuman rights would be aided by isolating ourselves from China. \nMaintaining relationships with the Chinese people through trade and \nother contact I believe is the best way to help the Chinese people help \nthemselves. They are the ones who will promote changes from within that \nwill improve their lives. Even Martin Lee, the Chairman of the \nDemocratic Party of Hong Kong, who has long fought for human rights in \nChina, recently stated:\n\n       The participation of China in the WTO would not only have \n     economic and political benefits, but would also serve to \n     bolster those in China who understand that the country must \n     embrace the rule of law.\n\n  The Dalai Lama, also long critical of China's human rights practices, \nespecially in Tibet, states:\n\n       Joining the World Trade Organization, I think, is one way \n     (for China) to change in the right direction . . . I think it \n     is a positive development.\n\n  Some believe granting PNTR will help promote hardliners in China's \nleadership. However, a Washington Post story earlier this year noted \nthat China analysts have found hardliners, including PLA officials, \nworrying that WTO membership will privatize more of China's economy and \nimport more western ideas about management and civil society which they \nsee as a threat to those who want to ensure the longevity of the one-\nparty Communist state.\n  The U.S. should be part of this, through the granting of PNTR. While \nChina will become a member of the WTO with or without us, I would \ncertainly prefer the U.S. have a part in using our improved trade \nrelationship as a way to make progress on our differences with China.\n  Many human rights activists support China PNTR. Former political \nprisoner Fu Shenqi says:\n\n       I unquestionably support the (view that NTR and the human \n     rights question be separated because) the annual argument \n     over NTR renewal exerts no genuine pressure on the Chinese \n     communists and performs absolutely no role in compelling them \n     to improve the human rights situation . . .\n\n  The China Democracy Party, founded two years ago, issued a statement \nincluding:\n\n       . . . We declare hereby to support the Unconditional PNTR \n     to China by the U.S. government.\n\n  Zhou Yang, Executive director of the China Democracy and Freedom \nAlliance, states:\n\n       Granting PNTR to China is a positive force in promoting \n     China's recognition of world human rights and in improving \n     the human rights situation of the Chinese people.\n\n  Noted Chinese human rights activist Bao Tong was more direct, saying: \n``Pass permanent normal trade relations with China . . .'' and adding, \n``But in the U.S., the `Seattle coalition . . . have combined their \nlobbying firepower to oppose the move (PNTR). From here in China, their \nintellectual counterparts are looking on in dismay . . . it doesn't \nmake sense to use trade as a lever. It just doesn't work.'' There are \nmany others with similar advice.\n  Included in the definition of human rights is religious persecution. \nWhile religious leaders remain concerned about the recent report from \nthe U.S. International Religious Freedom Commission, which points out \nChina has a long way to go toward religious freedom, they point to \nprogress as well. A letter signed by 13 religious organizations \nconcluded:\n\n       Change will not occur overnight in China. Nor can it be \n     imposed from outside. Rather, change will occur gradually, \n     and it will be inspired and shaped by the aspirations, \n     culture and history of the Chinese people. We on the outside \n     can help advance religious freedom and human rights best \n     through policies of normal trade, exchange and engagement for \n     the mutual benefit of peoples of faith, scholars, workers and \n     businesses. Enacting permanent normal trade relations with \n     China is the next, most important legislative step that \n     Congress can take to help in this process.\n\n  As you know, the House has attached a Commission on China to PNTR, \nwhich would monitor human rights progress with an annual report. It \nwould set a U.S. objective to work to create a WTO mechanism to measure \ncompliance, and requires an annual USTR report on the PRC's compliance \nwith the 1999 agreement and also authorizes additional staff to monitor \nChina's compliance. It also includes sense-of-the-Congress language \nthat China and Taiwan should enter the WTO at the same time.\n  The bottom line is PNTR is easy. China had to do all the heavy \nlifting. We gave up noting in these negotiations, and PNTR doesn't \nforce us to give up anything. I urge my colleagues to oppose all \namendments offered in an attempt to either slow down or kill PNTR. \nWhile the amendments point out problem areas we have with China, these \nmatters should be, and are, addressed separately in high-level contact \nbetween our two countries. I address them as well in contact I have \nwith Chinese officials.\n\n  Particularly, I urge you to oppose the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. \nWhile I will have a much longer statement once that amendment is \noffered, I will only say now that this amendment in any form will drive \na wedge through our efforts to improve our relationship with China. It \nwill foster a relationship of mistrust that will not help us improve \nChina's proliferation record or its record on any other differences. \nThe amendment is counterproductive. The amendment will not accomplish \nits goal of reducing proliferation, and it will create hostility \nbetween our countries. As Henry Kissinger stated:\n\n       If hostility to China were to become a permanent aspect of \n     our foreign policy, we would find no allies. Nationalism \n     would accelerate throughout the region. Just as American \n     prestige grew with the opening to China, most Asian nations \n     would blame America for generating an unwanted cold war with \n     Beijing.\n\n  This amendment will force us on the path of a cold war most of us \nnever want to see again. Also, there have been so many drafts of this \namendment, I am not sure any of us will really know what we are voting \non. An amendment as controversial as this one deserves to go through \nthe usual congressional committee process, and not be offered in a \nhighly politicized matter on the Senate floor.\n  There has been progress with China and proliferation, human rights \nand other issues. Let's work with China toward further progress--and \nuse the laws we already have, if necessary, to address lack of \nprogress. Above all, let's not use trade as a weapon. Let's pass PNTR \nto provide our workers and farmers the benefits of the U.S.-China WTO \nagreement. This should be one of the easiest trade votes we will ever \ntake. Let's vote on H.R. 4444 without amendment now--this week--not 2 \nweeks from now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, am here to speak on the issue of \npermanent normal trade relations with China.\n  In order to be successful in today's global economy, every industry \nmust market its products overseas. And in order for the United States \nto continue the unprecedented economic growth we have seen during the \nlast few years, we must adopt policies that open international markets \nfor farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and service industries.\n  On November 15 of last year, our Government successfully negotiated \nan\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\nhistoric trade agreement with the People's Republic of China that will \nbring China into the World Trade Organization. The potential impact of \nthis arrangement cannot be overstated. China is home to one-fifth of \nthe world's population and is growing by 7 percent each year. Access to \nChina's enormous population will help sustain American economic growth.\n  But before the United States and Arkansas can reap the full benefits \nof this agreement, Congress must vote to grant China Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations status. The WTO requires that its members extend normal \ntrade relations to all other members.\n  There is a lot at stake depending on whether or not the United States \ngrants PNTR to China. Since February, I have been urging the Senate \nleadership to bring this issue up for a vote as soon as possible. I had \nhoped that we would approve this legislation prior to the August \nrecess, but nevertheless, I am anxious to finish work on this bill as \nsoon as possible and get it on the President's desk for signature. \nThere are so many things at stake. We must not lose this opportunity.\n  China will join the WTO regardless of the congressional decision on \nPNTR, so a decision to deny this new status to China will only give \nChina license to keep its markets closed to U.S. services and \nagriculture, and to keep its high tariffs in place on U.S. goods and \nservices while opening it up to all other WTO members.\n  All sectors of our economy, especially agriculture, will benefit from \nincreased trade with China. Likewise, all sectors of our economy will \nsuffer if we don't trade with China. Chinese accession into the WTO \ncould mean $2 billion more a year in national agricultural exports to \nChina by the year 2005.\n  On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an \naverage of 31 percent to 14 percent. China will also expand access for \nbulk agricultural products, permit private trade in these products, and \neliminate export subsidies. In my home State of Arkansas, rice, \npoultry, soybean and cotton producers will stand to reap enormous \nbenefits from opening markets with China, including lower tariffs and \nincreased trade. For instance, under its WTO accession agreement, China \nwill cut tariffs on rice to 1 percent. Also, China is already the \nsecond leading market for U.S. poultry exports. If Congress approves \nPNTR status, it will cut tariffs in half from 20 percent to 10 percent \nby the year 2004 for frozen poultry cuts.\n  In addition to the agricultural changes, China's tariffs on American \nindustrial goods will fall from an average of about 25 percent to less \nthan 10 percent within 5 years. Industries including \ntelecommunications, banking, insurance, reinsurance, and pensions will \nall gain expanded market access. In information technology, tariffs on \nproducts such as computers, semiconductors and all Internet-related \nequipment will decrease from an average of 13 percent to zero by the \nyear 2005.\n  In exchange, the U.S. gives up nothing; our trade policies remain the \nsame. The economic reasons make so much sense and are themselves a very \npowerful reason for passage of PNTR.\n  But the opportunity we have as a nation to make an impact on the \nhumanity of China only exists if we are engaged with the country and \nits people. We cannot build a relationship that is effective if we turn \nour backs on China and isolate them.\n  Is China a perfect country? No.\n  I too share the concerns about human rights abuses in China and \nbelieve that a greater international presence in the country, fostered \nby free trade, will help to improve the lives of Chinese workers and \ncitizens. WTO membership will strengthen the forces of reform inside \nChina by exposing the Chinese to better paying jobs, and higher labor \nand environmental standards.\n  Finally, permanent normal trade relations with China will force the \nChinese to play by the rules in the international marketplace.\n  Only under this agreement with their accession into the WTO will we \nhave the proper recourse to be able to question their practices.\n  The WTO's dispute settlement system will force China to explain its \nactions if other member countries question them. In addition, the WTO's \ntrade policy review mechanism will allow all other members to review a \ncountry's entire trade system. This type of scrutiny of China is \nvirtually unprecedented in history.\n  If we do not approve PNTR status for China, the missed opportunities \nwill be tremendous, not to mention the devastation it could have on our \nstrong economy today. Our producers and industries will not be in a \nposition to openly access the 1.3 billion people who live in China. The \nUnited States will not have the ability to challenge China's trade \npractices or demand better human rights practices. In short, the United \nStates stands to gain enormously if we grant PNTR status to China, and \nwe stand to lose enormously if we do not.\n  Certainly once China does enter the WTO, there will still be many \nchallenges ahead for all of us, but congressional approval of PNTR for \nChina is a critical first step. It means so much to this Nation and to \nmy home State of Arkansas. We must take this first step in passage of a \ngood, clean PNTR bill in the Senate. Having China in the WTO is a good \ndeal for Arkansas and a good deal for this Nation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to approve the House-passed bill granting \npermanent normal trading relations with China--soon, not later--and \nthat we send it to the President to be confirmed so we can continue \nbuilding a relationship which will benefit both countries.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today, Mr. President, to express my opposition \nto granting permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic \nof China.\n  The recent history of U.S.-China relations has been a study in self-\ndelusion. The administration and this Congress do not lack for evidence \nor information about the nature of the Chinese government. But I am \nafraid the siren song of vast Chinese markets has deafened too many \nears to the news of oppression and abuse inside China. Too often, the \nU.S. has chosen to ignore the realities before us and, as in this trade \ndebate, has engaged in political and intellectual contortions to \ncompartmentalize and seal off a host of important issues so that the \npromise of vast profits can stand alone and unencumbered.\n  But I urge my colleagues to remember today--the mythological sirens' \nsong served to lure sailors onto the rocks that crushed their ships. \nAnd refusing to look at the whole picture of U.S.-China relations in \nthe single-minded pursuit of trade is, I submit, both foolish and \ndangerous. I fear that this country will find its policy in shambles \nunless we force ourselves to see the facts before us.\n  The fact is that China continues to be one of the most oppressive \nstates in the world.\n  The State Department acknowledges that the human rights situation in \nChina has deteriorated over the past year--a year in which the U.S. has \nextended normal trade relations with China, casting doubt on the claims \nthat trade will lead to greater openness and therefore greater civil \nand political rights in China.\n  The list of abuses committed by the Chinese government is so lengthy, \nso encompassing, as to be numbing. Thousands of political prisoners \nremain in prison--many sentenced after unfair trials or no trial at \nall. Torture is regularly used to extract ``confessions'' from \ndetainees. Authorities continue to use the brutal laogai system of \n``reeducation through labor'' to detain dissidents and others deemed \ndangerous to this paranoid state. Religious freedom does not exist in \nChina; from global faiths like Catholicism to more obscure sects, the \nleadership in Beijing has sought to force its will and its agenda on \nspirituality. Nowhere is this more egregious than in Tibet, where \nthousands of monks and nuns still are arbitrarily detained, where \nsomething termed ``patriotic education'' is forced on Tibetans at their \nmonasteries, where individuals have been arrested and sentenced to \nimprisonment for activities such as displaying the banned\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\nTibetan flag, where an entire culture is at risk. And forced abortion \nand forced sterilization are realities in the PRC.\n  The Chinese government has waged a campaign to destroy all sources of \ndissent. Leading members of the China Democracy Party have been \nsentenced to lengthy prison terms for ``conspiring to subvert state \npower.'' Activists in Xinjiang have been the target of a campaign of \narrests, substandard trials, and executions. Leaders of laborers and \npeasants daring to call for worker's rights are detained. Expression, \nin virtually all of its forms, is restricted. The government of China \nhas zealously launched into a campaign to monitor and control content \non the internet. According to Human Rights Watch, ``last fall, local \nnewspapers and magazines were put under Communist Party control. And \nthe State Press and Publications Administration banned foreign \ninvestment in wholesale book publication and distribution, and limited \nthe right to distribute textbooks, political documents, and the writing \nof China's leaders to a handful of enterprises.''\n  My colleagues, this is the state that seems so promising to the \nsupporters of PNTR. This is the China with which we are urged to \nengage. This is to be our full partner.\n\n  That very abbreviated list of abuses sounds awfully bad, doesn't it? \nBut the Administration's material on PNTR sounds so good. It is full of \npromises and optimism. How, I wonder, do they imagine getting from here \nto there--to that promised land in which our relationship with China is \nall about good news and profits?\n  I would suggest that the influence of money in politics goes a long \nway toward explaining the peculiar nature of this debate and U.S. \npolicy toward China more broadly.\n  The push for PNTR legislation is one of the most expensive lobbying \ncampaigns in history. Business interests are pitted against labor \nunions, as they make PAC and soft money contributions, and wage huge \nlobbying campaigns on television and in the halls of Congress. So \nbefore we go any further with this legislation, I would like to Call \nthe Bankroll on the PNTR issue, to give my colleagues and the public an \nidea of the spending spree that has gone on to lobby us on this bill.\n  Labor unions have donated heavily to the parties as they have fought \nagainst Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. The Center for \nResponsive Politics estimates labor's overall soft money, PAC and \nindividual contributions at roughly $31 million so far in this election \ncycle in a May 24th report. In particular, the AFL-CIO and its \naffiliates, which have campaigned hard against PNTR, have given $60,000 \nin soft money through the first 15 months of this election cycle.\n  And then there's the other side of the debate. On the side of PNTR we \nfind corporate America, which, according to a New York Times report, \nengaged in its ``costliest legislative campaign ever'' to win this \nfight--including an $8 million advertising campaign. The ``costliest \nlegislative campaign ever'' by corporate America--now that's saying \nsomething.\n  As we know, corporations typically spend the most in the political \nmoney game, and often win as a result. And it looks like PNTR will be \nno exception, Mr. President.\n  For example, take the Business Roundtable, a well-known business \ncoalition eager to get this bill passed. The Center for Responsive \nPolitics' May 24th report put the collective contributions of Business \nRoundtable members at $58 million in soft money, PAC money and \nindividual contributions so far in the election cycle. And that is in \naddition to the Roundtable's $10 million dollar advertising campaign to \npush PNTR, according to the Center.\n  Business Roundtable members are corporations like Boeing, Philip \nMorris, UPS and Citigroup. These are heavy hitters who regularly write \nchecks to the political parties for $50,000, $100,000, even a quarter \nmillion dollars. These companies have to ante up to stay in the game, \nMr. President--PNTR is a high stakes game, and the ante is bigger than \never.\n  I will quickly run down the soft money contributions of these \ncompanies, Mr. President. These are huge numbers, and they are just \nthrough the first 15 months of this election cycle: Boeing has given \nmore than $465,000 in soft money through the first 15 months of the \nelection cycle, including 10 contributions of $25,000 or more.\n  UPS, its subsidiaries and executives have given more than $960,000 in \nsoft money through March 31st of the current cycle. That includes two \ncontributions of a quarter million dollars.\n  Citigroup, its subsidiaries and executives gave more than one million \ndollars in soft money through the first 15 months of this election \ncycle, including six contributions of $50,000 or more.\n\n  And of course who could forget Philip Morris, Mr. President? Long \nknown as the granddaddy of political donors, Philip Morris and its \nsubsidiaries have given more than $1.2 million in soft money through \nMarch 31st of the election cycle, including more than eight donations \nof $100,000 or more.\n  Since I've mentioned Philip Morris' contributions here, let me take a \nmoment to discuss the impact of contributions of large multinational \ncorporations with many legislative interests. Some might argue that is \nunfair to mention Philip Morris in this calling of the bankroll because \nits main interest is tobacco legislation.\n  That is exactly the beauty of soft money contributions from the point \nof view of the corporate donor. They buy access for the company that \nmakes them. They aren't payment for a particular piece of legislation. \nNo, they are more powerful than that because they are so large, and so \nsought after by the parties. They further the interests of that company \non all pieces of legislation. There can be no doubt that Philip Morris \nhas an interest in PNTR.\n  China is a huge untapped market for cigarettes. So Philip Morris's \nsoft money contributions open the doors for its lobbyists on this \nissue, just as they open the doors for its anti-tobacco control \narguments.\n  Everyone knows that PNTR is the very top legislative priority for the \nbusiness community in this country. There is absolutely no dispute \nabout that. The lobbying effort has been extraordinary. And Philip \nMorris's legislative and lobbying muscle, supported by their huge \ncampaign contributions, have been put at the service of that priority, \nas well as of its own particular interest in tobacco legislation.\n  Mr. President, corporations such as Philip Morris, and the other \nmembers of the Business Roundtable pay to play--they get visibility in \nthe debate, and they get their voices heard loud and clear. The shape \nof the PNTR debate so far is exactly what we should expect from a \ncampaign finance system that is rigged to value money above all else.\n  So it is clear that some people do stand to gain from PNTR and \nChina's accession to the World Trade Organization. But I think that \ncamp has vastly overstated its case. These forces, which have paid to \npipe the siren song into the halls of the Senate for months now, claim, \nfor example, that America's farmers will benefit greatly from PNTR for \nChina. They wave impressive graphs, they promise access to vast \nmarkets. But I for one, as a Senator from a very important agriculture \nstate, am not convinced that those claims are more than just empty \npromises. China's Vice Minister of Trade has already noted publicly \nthat market-opening promises for U.S. wheat exporters are only a \ntheoretical opportunity--not an actual one. The fact is that China's \npromises to import more agricultural products conflict with internal \nChinese political and cultural dynamics--dynamics that are affected by \nlongstanding fears about dependence on foreign food and by employment-\ncreation imperatives. China has produced a glut of agricultural goods \nfor years. Beijing now has massive stockpiles and a three-to-one ratio \nof exports to imports. Chinese prices will likely continue to be lower \nthan American ones for years. I am not convinced that there is a big \npay-off in store for American agriculture.\n  Ask Wisconsin's ginseng growers about the Chinese commitment to rule-\ngoverned trade. They will tell you that the Chinese have continued to \nmislabel their ginseng as ``Wisconsin-grown ginseng.'' As a result of \nthis misleading practice, the price paid to actual American ginseng \nfarmers has steadily declined. Recent press reports even suggest that \nthe Chinese are now smuggling ginseng containing dangerously high \nlevels of harmful pesticides and chemicals into U.S.--again \ninaccurately labeled as Wisconsin ginseng.\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\n  I concede, Mr. President, that profits are within the reach of some. \nAnd I recognize that the business community is responsible to its \nshareholders. Seeking profitable opportunities is their very purpose, \nand there is nothing wrong with that. But this Senate is responsible to \nall of the citizens of the United States, to the core values of this \ncountry, and to future generations of Americans. And the United States \nof America does not stand only for profit. Even if I were convinced \nthat Permanent Normal Trade relations with China and Beijing's \naccession to the WTO would bring significant new economic opportunities \nto a large number of Americans--and I am not convinced of this fact--I \nstill believe it is my responsibility to weigh that factor against \nothers--including the fact that the Chinese government's human rights \nrecord is unquestionably appalling. I still believe that certain \neconomic gains are not worth their moral price. I still believe that \nthe prosperity we all seek for our great country should never be a \nprosperity that also brings shame.\n\n  But de-linking trade from human rights and prohibiting an annual \ndebate on this issue suggests that I do not have the right to weigh \nthese factors, that I cannot consider the totality of U.S.-Chinese \nbilateral relations when matters of trade arise. Apparently, we are all \nsimply supposed to follow the music.\n  I argue that to compartmentalize our national values is to cordon off \nour national identity, to subordinate what we stand for so completely \nthat it no longer affects how we behave. That is dangerous. I think it \nis an abdication of the responsibility I accepted when I took this \noffice.\n  So apart from the question--and it is a good question, a question not \nanswered nearly so easily as the Administration would like--of whether \nor not a significant number of Americans will reap economic benefits \nfrom PNTR for China--and apart from legitimate questions grounded in \nthe historical record about whether or not China will stick to its \ntrade-related commitments--apart from these issues, we are debating \nwhether or not to draw a sharp, impenetrable division between one of \nour interests--economic gain--and what we believe and who we are. That \nis the question that has been evaded in the mountains of pro-PNTR \nliterature and the countless pro-PNTR briefings that have become a \nfixture on Capitol Hill in recent months. I cannot support such a \ndivision. I will not abdicate my responsibilities in the hopes of \navoiding tough choices and decisions. I cannot support this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in making opening comments relative to \npermanent normal trade relations with China, I feel compelled to sort \nof qualify as a witness in that we have over the years in these \nparticular debates about international trade made very little progress, \nwhether with Democratic administrations or Republican administrations.\n  My rising in opposition and my amendments will be to the thrust of \nnot having permanent and not having normal trade relations with anybody \nbecause our normal trade relations are a $350 billion to $400 billion \ntrade deficit which is destroying the middle class in our society, \nweakening our democracy, and diminishing our influence in world \naffairs. With all of the pep talk about the wonderful economy, we are \nactually, on this particular score, in tremendous decline.\n  I say ``as a witness'' in a sense because I can remember when \nsouthern Governors started computing. People up in New Hampshire and \nother places say that they are from down south and that they are blind \nprotectionists; they do not understand the importance of manufacturing \nand international trade and exports. So I hearken back to the day when \nI represented the northern textile industry from New Hampshire as well \nas the southern textile industry. I appeared before the old \nInternational Tariff Commission. Who ran me around the room? None other \nthan Tom Dewey. This was back in 1960. The subject was textiles--that \n10 percent of the American consumption of textiles in clothing was \nrepresented in imports, and if this continued at the pace that it was \ngoing, before long we would be out of business.\n  By the way, they told me at that particular hearing: Governor, what \ndo you expect? For those emerging Third World countries in the Pacific \nrim and everywhere else, what do you expect them to make? Let them make \nthe shoes and the clothing, and we will make the computers and the \nairplanes.\n  Fast forward 40 years: They are making the shoes. They are making the \nclothing. They are making the airplanes and they are making the \ncomputers. They are making all of it. Actually, we have high tech. I \nwant to get into that in a minute. High tech--they think that is saving \nus. We have a deficit in the balance of trade with the People's \nRepublic of China in high technology.\n  This Congress doesn't have any idea where we are on this particular \nscore. Everybody is outside talking about the new economy. True it is, \nwe are all proud of that new economy, particularly on this side of the \naisle. They were afraid to say they raised the Social Security tax in \n1993 when Clinton came into office. But I wasn't afraid. I brought it \nin line with all other pension plans. We are afraid to say we raised \ngasoline taxes. But we did. We cut spending $250 billion. The taxes \nthat were supposed to be $250 billion are now up to $370 billion. Then \nwe cut some taxes very minimally. We reduced the size of government by \nsome 377,000 Federal employees.\n  They have the new economy. But the new economy has a private side and \na public side. The private side is doing extremely well. High \nemployment, low unemployment, low interest rates, booming economy, \nbooming stock market, strong bank system--but the public side is almost \na disaster. I say that advisedly. The reason I say it is so that, for \none thing, they are talking surplus, surplus. Everywhere, someone cries \n``surplus.''\n  The public debt to the penny according to the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment shows that, as of September 1, the debt is $5.676 trillion. \nAt the beginning of the fiscal year of September 30, 1999, it was \n$5.656 trillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      THE PUBLIC DEBT TO THE PENNY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n9/01/2000.....................................     $5,676,516,679,692.56\nPrior months:\n  8/31/2000...................................      5,677,822,307,077.83\n  7/31/2000...................................      5,658,807,449,906.68\n  6/30/2000...................................      5,685,938,087,296.66\n  5/31/2000...................................      5,647,169,888,532.25\n  4/28/2000...................................      5,685,108,228,594.76\n  3/31/2000...................................      5,773,391,634,682.91\n  2/29/2000...................................      5,735,333,348,132.58\n  1/31/2000...................................      5,711,285,168,951.46\n  12/31/1999..................................      5,776,091,314,225.33\n  11/30/1999..................................      5,693,600,157,029.08\n  10/29/1999..................................      5,679,726,662,904.06\nPrior fiscal years:\n  9/30/1999...................................      5,656,270,901,615.43\n  9/30/1998...................................      5,526,193,008,897.62\n  9/30/1997...................................      5,413,146,011,397.34\n  9/30/1996...................................      5,224,810,939,135.73\n  9/29/1995...................................      4,973,982,900,709.39\n  9/30/1994...................................      4,692,749,910,013.32\n  9/30/1993...................................      4,411,488,883,139.38\n  9/30/1992...................................      4,064,620,655,521.66\n  9/30/1991...................................      3,665,303,351,697.03\n  9/28/1990...................................      3,233,313,451,777.25\n  9/29/1989...................................      2,857,430,960,187.32\n  9/30/1988...................................      2,602,337,712,041.16\n  9/30/1987...................................      2,350,276,890,953.00\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Bureau of the Public Debt.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that shows that the debt has increased \n$20 billion--no surplus. They don't want to say where they get the \nsurplus from. I can tell you where they get the surplus from. We had an \nincreased measure of taxation over the years. When we had the 1983 \nSocial Security settlement, we wanted it to increase to build up a \ntrust fund to take care of the baby boomers in the next generation--\nwhich is now. In 1992, the Social Security surplus was $50 billion; now \nthe Social Security surplus is $150 billion.\n  Over the last 8 years--because of what we did back in 1983--we have \nan additional $100 billion surplus, if you please, for the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We voted it here--section 13-301 of the Budget \nAct--that you shall not use Social Security surpluses in your budgets. \nSection 12 of the Greenspan commission said it should be set aside. It \ntook us from 1983 until 1990 in order\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nto get that done, but we finally got it done. Ninety-eight Senators \nvoted for it. Almost all the Members of the House voted for it. It was \nsigned into law on November 5, 1990, by President George Bush.\n  But all of them are running around saying we are going to save Social \nSecurity while they are spending it with all kinds of monkeyshine \nplans--invest a little, invest a lot, do this, or do that to save \nSocial Security. They set up the straw man in violation of the law--the \npolicy of the Greenspan commission and talking about surpluses when \nthere is not any surplus. The debt is increasing. If there is a \nsurplus, why has the debt increased $20 billion? With all the wonderful \nincome tax from which we had revenues on April 15, with all the good \ncorporate tax revenues in June, we are still increasing the debt some \n$20 billion.\n  All of them say tax cut, tax cut, but if you cut the estate taxes, \nyou have increased the debt. All tax cuts are increasing the debt. They \nare all saying pay down the debt, pay down the debt. It is Alice in \nWonderland. It is double talk. They are not talking sense with relation \nto what is actually going on.\n  Everybody says we are paying down the debt. But they are for all of \nthese taxes. Whether it is middle class, or targeted, or estate, or \ngasoline, or capital gains, or marriage penalty, any of those tax cuts \nunder present circumstances obviously amount to an increase in debt. \nThey talk about surplus that doesn't exist, and they talk about paying \ndown the debt as they regularly increase it. They don't mention waste.\n  As a result of this charade, interest costs have gone up to $366 \nbillion for this fiscal year. I remember when we balanced the budget in \n1968 and 1969 under President Lyndon Johnson. The interest cost on the \nnational debt was less than $1 trillion; the interest cost was only $16 \nbillion. That was the cost of all the wars from the Revolution, to the \nCivil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, \nVietnam. We had a debt of less than $1 trillion and they had interest \ncosts of only $16 billion. Now we are up to $5.7 trillion, with $1 \nbillion a day being spent. Wait until the whopping payment is made in \nSeptember.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the interest \nexpense as of this minute.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Interest Expense on the Public Debt Outstanding\n\n       The monthly Interest Expense represents the interest \n     expense on the Public Debt Outstanding as of each month end. \n     The interest expense on the Public Debt includes interest for \n     Treasury notes and bonds; foreign and domestic series \n     certificates of indebtedness, notes and bonds; Savings Bonds; \n     as well as Government Account Series (GAS), State and Local \n     Government series (SLGs), and other special purpose \n     securities. Amortized discount or premium on bills, notes and \n     bonds is also included in interest expense.\n       The fiscal year Interest Expense represents the total \n     interest expense on the Public Debt Outstanding for a given \n     fiscal year. This includes the months of October through \n     September.\n\n                   INTEREST EXPENSE--FISCAL YEAR 2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJuly..............................................    $19,332,594,012.00\nJune..............................................     75,884,057,388.85\nMay...............................................     26,802,350,934.54\nApril.............................................     19,878,902,328.72\nMarch.............................................     20,889,017,596.95\nFebruary..........................................     20,778,646,308.19\nJanuary...........................................     19,689,955,250.71\nDecember..........................................     73,267,794,917.58\nNovember..........................................     25,690,033,589.51\nOctober...........................................     19,373,192,333.69\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Fiscal Year Total.............................    321,586,544,660.74\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n               AVAILABLE HISTORICAL DATA--FISCAL YEAR END\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1999.............................................    $353,511,471,722.87\n1998.............................................     363,823,722,920.26\n1997.............................................     355,795,834,214.66\n1996.............................................     343,955,076,695.15\n1995.............................................     332,413,555,030.62\n1994.............................................     296,277,764,246.26\n1993.............................................     292,502,219,484.25\n1992.............................................     292,361,073,070.74\n1991.............................................     286,021,921,181.04\n1990.............................................     264,852,544,615.90\n1989.............................................     240,863,231,535.71\n1988.............................................     214,145,028,847.73\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is $321 billion without the August and September \npayments. When we get those particular payments, it will go up, up, and \naway. And that is under low interest rate circumstances.\n  We have the worst waste of all. I served on the Grace Commission \nunder President Reagan. We were going to cut out waste, fraud, and \nabuse. Now we have caused the greatest waste of all.\n  After President Clinton early this year made the State of the Union \nAddress, the comment was made by the distinguished majority leader that \nit was costing $1 billion a minute. The President talked for 90 \nminutes; that is $90 billion. Governor Bush wants to give a $90 billion \ntax cut. We could give President Clinton $90 billion in spending. We \ncould give Governor Bush $90 billion in tax cuts and still have $170 \nbillion left for all the increases to the Department of Health, for \nclass size reduction and school construction and any and every kind of \nresearch at NIH that we wanted.\n  The point is, we are spending the money and we are not getting \nanything for it and we don't talk about it on the campaign trail. What \ndo they avoid talking about? The $350 to $400 billion--and it will \nprobably be nearly $400 billion--deficit in the balance of trade. The \neconomists say that costs us at least 1 percent on our GNP. Instead of \n4.1, we would have 5.1, and more jobs.\n  This is ignoring the failure of the United States to compete in \ninternational trade. I emphasize that for a reason, for those who say \nwe are blind protectionists, that we don't understand the global \neconomy, the global competition and do not want to compete and want to \nstart a trade war. No. 1, we have been in a trade war and we have been \nlosing. They don't understand that. No. 2, on globalization, I don't \nwant to sound like the Vice President, but I helped invent it 40 years \nago. I went as a young Governor to Europe. I have that Deutsche Telekom \nbill that they talked about in the paper the other day. The truth is, I \ncalled on the Germans in Frankfurt. Today we have 116 German industries \nin the little State of South Carolina. I will never forget calling on \nMichelin in downtown Paris in June of 1960 with 11,600 Michelin \nemployees. We have Hoffman-LaRoche from Switzerland. And Honda broke \nground a few years ago. I was amazed to hear that Honda produced and \nexported more vehicles than General Motors.\n  I have been in public service 50 years. I have been debating this \nissue in all five textile bills that passed here. Four of them passed \nthe House also and were vetoed by Presidents over the years. When we \ncome to trade and globalization, I think it behooves me not to talk \nabout permanent, not to talk about normal, but use this opportunity to \nsober up the Congress and the leadership of the United States, making \nthem realize that we are in a real competition, but not for profit. \nThat is, the American multinational. They could care less. They don't \nhave a country. Boeing came out the other day and said in the United \nStates, we are not a U.S. company but an international company. \nCaterpillar has been holding in Illinois. But they were international. \nThey think it is fine. The Chamber of Commerce has forgotten about Main \nStreet America and gone with the multinationals. NAM and the Business \nRoundtable--we are in the hands of the Philistines. We are losing our \nmanufacturing base because we don't understand that the global \ncompetition is not for profit but for jobs and market share.\n  Let me talk a minute about jobs. At the fall of the wall, 4 billion \nworkers came from behind the Iron Curtain, ready to work for anything, \nanywhere, at any time. In the last 10 years, with computerization and \nsatellites, you can transfer your technology on a computer chip, you \ncan transfer your financing by satellite. You can produce anything \nanywhere that you please. That is the global competition and \ninternational trade.\n  While our American producers for the so-called profit want to \nmanufacture, say, in the People's Republic of China, for 10 percent of \nthe labor costs than it is paying in the United States, we have been \nlosing, losing, losing. In manufacturing, they say 30 percent of volume \nis in the cost of labor. Or you can save 20 percent of your volume by \nmoving the manufacturer of your product offshore or down to Mexico. \nSimply put, you can maintain your executive and your sales force here \nbut put your manufacturing elsewhere. If you have $500 million in \nsales, at 20 percent, before taxes, you can save $100 million. Or you \ncan continue to work your own people and go broke because your \ncompetition\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nis headed that way. That is the job policy of the U.S. Congress today. \nIt is to accelerate the exodus and the export of jobs.\n\n  I will never forget when they told us that NAFTA was going to create \n200,000 jobs. I just looked at the figure from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. It is more than just that 38,700 figure, but in textiles \nalone we have lost 38,700 jobs since NAFTA; in North Carolina, 90,000. \nI will never forget when they came down to Charlotte and said they \nwanted to talk about the digital divide. They are the ones dividing it. \nYou think if you lost a job you are going out and buying a $2,000 or \n$3,000 computer? ``It's the economy, stupid.'' That is where we are. \nYou just can't understand we are here, when they think it is a \nproductivity thing on jobs: Productivity, productivity, productivity--\nWe have global competition.\n  The U.S. industrial worker was the most productive industrial worker \nin the world, all during the 60s, all during the 1970s, all during the \n1980s, all during the 1990s, and is today still the most productive \nindustrial worker. They are not the highest paid. They pay much more in \nGermany and a bunch of other countries--and I will have a word to say \nabout that, where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting \npoorer and the middle class is disappearing. But the point is, we are \nlosing our manufacturing strength and capability. We are losing our \neconomy.\n  America's security and strength is like a three-legged stool. You \nhave the one leg which is the values of a nation, and that is \nunquestioned. We commit for freedom in Somalia and down in Haiti, \nBosnia, Kosovo. There are nine peacekeeping missions currently and we \nare adding four more around the world. People admire the United States \nof America and its high principles and values.\n  The second leg is one of the military, and that is unquestioned.\n  But the third leg is a fraud--intentionally so. You see, after World \nWar II we had the only industry, so with the Marshall Plan, that really \nstarted globalization. We not only sent the money, we sent the \ntechnology and the expertise--and capitalism has defeated communism. In \nthe People's Republic of China, which is the present subject, they are \ntending more every day towards capitalism. That is a wonderful thing.\n  The question is, Can we afford to give away the store? We have \nsacrificed and sacrificed so that now Boeing of Seattle, WA is moving \nproduction of airplanes--the most prominent of export industries--out \nof the country. Why do you think the machinists at Boeing led the \nstrike not to break up in Seattle last December? That was a crowd that \ncame out of Oregon, if I remember correctly, the Ruckus Society, or \nsomething like that. But the AFL-CIO march, at that WTO meeting in \nSeattle in December was led by the Boeing machinists. Why? Because 70 \npercent of the Boeing 777--McDonnell 90-10 is made overseas. In order \nto sell the Boeing plane in the People's Republic of China, according \nto Bill Greider, 50 percent of the Boeing 777 is made in downtown \nShanghai.\n  So we are losing the best, the best of the jobs. We know about jobs. \nWe know about globalization. We are looking at this constant drain, so \nto speak, over the 50-year period. At the end of World War II we had 41 \npercent of our workforce in manufacturing. Last month, we lost another \n69,000 manufacturing jobs. Go to the Department of Commerce--ask them.\n  So we have gone from 41 percent down to 12 percent. Akio Morita, the \nformer head of Sony said: Wait a minute, that world power that loses \nits manufacturing capacity ceases to be a world power. That is why we \nstand opposed to permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  I know full well--I live in the real world--we are going to have \ntrade with China. I am not opposed to trade with China. I am opposed to \npermanent, normal. When I say ``permanent,'' that is exactly what these \nCEOs of the Fortune 500 companies want. Because they know if they go \nover and invest in China and it has been permanent, they can come back \nappealing, ``Don't change anything,'' and they can get a foothold there \nand they can really make a wonderful profit. But, of course, that puts \nus more and more in jeopardy because we cannot shout ``productivity'' \nto the most productive industrial worker while at the same time \nsaddling him with all the penalties.\n\n  What are the penalties? What are the costs of productivity? We, the \nCongress of the United States, say: Before you open up the XYZ \nmanufacturing company you have to have a minimum wage, Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, clean air, clean water, safe working place, safe \nmachinery, plant closing notice, parental leave. We might add on \nprescription drugs. Everybody is for prescription drugs. That is the \ncost of doing business.\n  You can go down to Mexico for none of that, 58 cents, $1 an hour. You \ncan go, for 10 percent of the cost, to China. We run around here like \nwe understand something when we are totally off base, operating in the \ndark, on one of the most important issues confronting the United \nStates. They think: Technology, high tech, high tech. Let's talk about \njobs. High tech jobs? Do you know that a third of Microsoft's workers \nare part time? At one time they were all full time and lower-level \nworkers sued and said: We are going to get some of these stock options \nand other benefits. And they won the case in court. So Gates and \nMicrosoft turned around and gave them a 364-day contract. They are part \ntime; 40 percent of the employees in Silicon Valley are part time. They \ndon't give them any jobs. Gates has 22,000 up there in Redmond, WA and \nBoeing has 100,000. But what jobs they do have don't produce anything \nto export.\n  We had a deficit balance of trade in advanced technology products \nwith the People's Republic of China of $3.5 billion in 1999. This year \nit will be almost $5 billion. So don't give me anything about high \ntech--the high tech is going to save us. That is not going to save us \nat all. Advances in technology has spurred productivity. We all \nacknowledge that. The Japanese, after all, are the ones that taught us \nthat with their advances in robotics in the early 80's. The BMW plant \nin Spartanburg, SC has been able to incorporate cutting edge technology \nand machinery. That is why over half the employees came off the farms \nwithin 50 miles and the other little textile industries and have been \nable to produce very efficiently. The quality of the Spartanburg plant \nexceeds the quality of Munich BMW. As a result, BMW is doubling the \nsize of its operations at the Spartanburg plant.\n  Open your eyes. The most productive automobile plant in the world, \naccording to J.D. Power, is not in Detroit, it is down in Mexico--the \nFord plant. We know about productivity and we know about jobs. While we \nlost 69,000 manufacturing jobs this August, we took on some 127,000 \nservice jobs. We are going just the way of England.\n  At the end of the war, they told the Brits: Don't worry; instead of a \nnation of brawn, this will be a nation of brains; and instead of \nproducing products, we will provide services. Instead of creating \nwealth, we will handle it and be a financial seller. And England has \ngone to hell in an economic hand basket. Even Land Rover is leaving \nthere now, and there is some question with the BMW plant there.\n  I am not anti-British. I love the Brits. But London has become a \ndowntown amusement park. I like to go there like everybody else. What I \nam talking about here is economic strength. The British Army is not as \nbig as our Marine Corps. We are running around here puffing and blowing \nabout the world's superpower. You cannot use and you would not use the \nhydrogen bomb. They couldn't care less now about the 6th Fleet or our \nmilitary superiority.\n  So what counts? Money. Money talks in international affairs. I will \nnever forget when in the U.N. there was a resolution to examine China \nwith respect to human rights and they were preparing to set up the \nhearings. This was 1993.\n  The last time I checked 5 years later, 1998, they did not have the \nhearings. Why? Because the Chinese are the best diplomats. The Chinese \nare the best negotiators. They are the best business people. They have \nthe best commercial minds. They went all around Africa, down into \nAustralia and everywhere else. They never called for the hearings. Why? \nBecause everybody wants to get into that rich market of $1.3 trillion. \nAt the moment, we have the richest market in the world, and we refuse\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\nto use it and whine: Be fair, fair trade, level the playing field.\n  Come on. Trade is not Boy Scouts. There is no morality to trade--be \nfair. I know what they are talking about. I know the word ``trade'' \nitself. ``Free trade'' is an oxymoron, but they hope there will be no \nbarriers, no tariffs, no limitations.\n  As we shout for free trade, the same thing we shout for is world \npeace. I do not believe we are going to get either one in my lifetime. \nMaybe in Strom's. The fact of the matter is, the father of this country \nsaid the best way to preserve the peace is to prepare for war. The best \nway to get free trade is to compete, raise the barriers and then remove \nthem. The Chinese do that. They use their market.\n  Some come to the floor and talk at length with respect to how the \nagreement is so good and it will not do this and it will not do that. I \nwill touch on one thing this afternoon because I am limited in my time. \nMy colleagues will remember, they said there would not be any more \nforced technology transfers. That is what Qualcomm thought when it \ninvested in China. Ambassador Barshefsky, the Special Trade \nRepresentative, said:\n\n       The rules put an absolute end to forced technology \n     transfers.\n\n  This was November of last year after they had the agreement. I have \nan article from the Wall Street Journal with regard to ``Qualcomm \nlearns from its mistake in China'':\n\n       U.S. mobile phone maker listens to Beijing's call for local \n     production.\n\n  This is dated June 7 of this year. The Ambassador is telling us the \nagreement does one thing, but the reality is quite another. Qualcomm, \ntrusting it would not have to transfer, has to have local production \nbefore it can sell. So it is with all of these other industries.\n  I am not anti-Chinese. I am anti this policy. I have been against \nthis particular policy for years on end. We had a GAO report--about \nwhich I could go on at length--that the agreement is indecisive and \ncomplex. When we negotiate, we find out again and again it is normal \ntrade relations; namely, you have to give before you can take. You have \nto give the Chinese the technology, and move production to China. I do \nnot fault China. The Chinese are doing only what we did to build this \ngreat United States of America.\n\n  In the earliest days, we had just won our freedom, and the Brits \ncorresponded with the fledgling Colonies and said: Now that you have \nwon your freedom, why don't you trade with us what you produce best, \nand we will trade back with you what we produce best--the doctrine of \ncomparative advantage these economists will tell you about.\n  Alexander Hamilton had the wisdom, outlined in the Report on \nManufactures. There is one copy left at the Library of Congress. That \nlittle booklet in a line told the Brits to bug off: We are not going to \nremain your colony. As a result, the second bill that ever passed \nCongress--the first being the Seal of the United States--was a \nprotectionist measure passed on July 4, 1789, a tariff bill of 50 \npercent on 60 different articles. From there we began to build our own \neconomic strength, our own industrial capacity, carried on by President \nLincoln. When plans were being made to build the transcontinental \nrailroad, some said buy the steel from London. Lincoln said: Oh, no, we \nare going to build our own steel plants, and then when we get through, \nwe will not only have the railroad, we will have a steel capacity.\n  Again, that crowd that comes around here whining about free trade, \ngetting all the protection you can possibly imagine--the farmers--are \nsolid for this. They are going to learn a lesson--be careful what you \nwish for. Maybe I will get on to that in a minute.\n  It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who instituted marketing quotas, \nprotective import quotas, price supports--protectionism that built up. \nYes, I am for the farmer and we are the greatest agriculture producer \nin the world. But do not tell me about free trade. There have not been \nany price supports for my textiles and my 38,700 textile workers who \nhave lost their jobs since NAFTA. Incidentally, I remind people just \nexactly what happened. Yes, they are having to turn to service jobs if \nthey can.\n  I remember Onieta Industries in Andrews, SC. They made T-shirts. \nEverybody can understand it. They closed the plant in the early part of \nlast year. There were approximately 480 employees with an average age \nof 47. Do it Washington's way; do it the way Congress lectures: \nEducation, education--we have to reeducate. They sound like a bunch of \nMao Tse-tungs. So we reeducate, and tomorrow we have 487 expert \ncomputer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old or the 21-\nyear-old?\n  Those 47-year-olds are out of a job. The average employer is not \ngoing to take on the pension costs and health costs for the 47-year-old \nwhen they have relatively none to consider for the 20-year-old. So they \nare sidelined. And that is the anxiety explored recently in Business \nWeek: ``The Backlash Behind the Anxiety of Globalization.''\n  President Clinton, himself--this is from the Los Angeles Times in May \nof this year. I quote:\n\n       So Clinton asked rhetorically, why are we having this \n     debate on PNTR? Because people are anxiety ridden about the \n     forces of globalization.\n\n  I just finished reading David Kennedy's ``Freedom from Fear,'' the \nlegacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The legacy of William Jefferson \nClinton is fear and fear itself. Global anxiety. Why? Because that 47-\nyear-old who worked at a plant for 25 years was saving his money, \nmaking his home payments, his car payments and had a little boat down \non the Black River--now he is high and dry. At best, he is trying to \nget a job at McDonald's or at the laundry or somewhere else in the \nservice economy that doesn't pay.\n  Talking about those jobs, I think we ought to really emphasize the \nfact that we are separating, if you please, the society. In Fortune \nmagazine, dated September 4 there is the article entitled, ``Are the \nRich Cleaning Up?'' It is by Cait Murphy:\n\n       Blue-collar workers make less than they did a generation \n     ago while the earnings of professionals have soared.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Fortune, Sept. 4, 2000]\n\n                       Are the Rich Cleaning Up?\n\n                            (By Cait Murphy)\n\n       The average price of a Manhattan apartment south of Harlem \n     has hit more than $850,000--at a time when two-fifths of New \n     York City's residents make $20,000 or less a year. In Silicon \n     Valley teachers struggle with the rent while dot-com-rich \n     parents wonder how to cope with ``affluenza''--the perils of \n     new and great wealth. (Hint: Just don't buy that helicopter.) \n     In leafy suburbs nurses and cops commute from 50 miles away: \n     They cannot afford to live near their work.\n       This dichotomy--between new wealth and the not-so-wealthy--\n     has lately become something of an academic and political \n     obsession. Economists and social scientists have turned the \n     study of income inequality into a thriving cottage industry. \n     And while the rich-poor gap has not cropped up explicitly in \n     the presidential campaign, it is the stubtext for a number of \n     front-burner issues like tax cuts, educational reform, and \n     the ``digital divide.'' When a politician uses the word \n     ``fairness'' in an economic debate, that's often shorthand \n     for ``inequality.''\n       Why the concern about inequality? Basically, because \n     there's more of it. From 1977 on, the cash earnings of the \n     poorest fifth of the U.S. population fell about 9%, estimates \n     the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; middle-class \n     earnings rose 8%; and upper-income earnings, 43%. The exact \n     numbers are hotly contested, but it is clear that the \n     distance between the top and the bottom tiers of the income \n     distribution has grown strikingly since the 1970s. By some \n     measures, Americans' earnings are more unequal today than at \n     any time in the past 60 years; at best, even after the past \n     several years, when income has grown throughout the income \n     distribution, the gap has plateaued at or near record levels.\n       Of course, no serious person would argue that everyone \n     should get the same-sized piece of the economic pie. That \n     would be unfair to those who work hard, as opposed to those \n     who watch reruns of Gilligan's Island all day. And if \n     spectators want to pay more to watch a baseball game than, \n     say, a badminton match, there is no reason both sets of \n     athletes must be paid alike. At the same time, no serious \n     person would deny that inequality can hit such levels \n     (think medieval societies) that it comprises both an \n     ethical problem and a threat to social peace (the peasants \n     revolt). Finally, there is little disagreement about \n     whether inequality has increased. It has. But there is \n     also massive mud-wrestling about how much it has grown, \n     why, and what it all means.\n       FORTUNE will spare you the arcane details--for now, anyway. \n     But the fundamental argument about inequality is simple. The\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\n     pessimists contend that income distribution has grown so \n     lopsided that all society is worse off. Richard Freeman of \n     Harvard speculates that there is a link between inequality \n     and crime. He notes that high school dropouts fill the \n     nation's jails--and that these men have lost the most ground \n     economically. Edward Wolff of New York University contends \n     that if young men had a better shot at earning a stable \n     living they might be more willing to marry and stop having \n     children on a freelance basis. Robert Greenstein of the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that earnings \n     disparities are one of the reasons that almost one in five \n     children lives in poverty. America's lowest-paid workers make \n     less, as a percentage of the median wage (the point at which \n     50% are above and 50% below), than their counterparts in any \n     other country (38%, compared with 46% in Britain and Japan \n     and more than 50% in France and Germany). This means that \n     many low-skilled parents just cannot earn enough to escape \n     poverty. ``If there were somewhat less inequality,'' \n     Greenstein concludes, ``more would have a better standard of \n     living.''\n       There is also considerable (but contentious) literature \n     that more-equal societies are healthier. And there is the \n     inchoate but deeply felt belief that inequality at current \n     levels is simply un-American. It gives the rich too loud a \n     voice. It makes it too hard for those at the bottom to rise \n     to prosperity. And it allows the wealthy to separate \n     themselves from society through private clubs, private \n     schools, and gated communities.\n       The optimists respond to that critique with a polite yawn. \n     Or perhaps a rude word along the lines of ``Rubbish!'' Sure, \n     inequality has grown, but so what? As long as people at the \n     bottom have not become absolutely worse off, goes this set of \n     arguments, it doesn't matter that the rich got richer faster. \n     And no, the poor are not worse off. Though men's earnings \n     seem to have fallen since 1973 (and maybe they haven't), \n     women's have clearly risen. That trend and smaller households \n     mean that family income and income per head have increased \n     all along the income distribution. Housing quality and access \n     to medical care have improved markedly for the poor since \n     1973.\n       Besides, people don't necessarily stay in the same \n     position. They move up and down the income ladder: Horatio \n     Alger was not just making stuff up. Today's income \n     distribution is the result of long-standing economic forces \n     and social trends. Nothing is broke, so don't fix it.\n       Those are the broad outlines of a debate in which the devil \n     is most definitely in the details. What follows is a primer \n     of the arguments, followed by a suggestion about how to get \n     out of this thicket.\n       What are people so concerned about? Students of inequality \n     use several tools in their trade. One is the Gini \n     coefficient; a 0 coefficient is perfect equality (everyone \n     has exactly the same share of the economic pie). A \n     coefficient of 1 is perfect inequality (Bill Gates gets it \n     all). In America the coefficient has risen from 0.323 in 1974 \n     to 0.375 in 1997, according to the Luxembourg Income Study, \n     higher than in any other rich country. Britain's is 0.346, \n     Germany's 0.300, Canada's 0.286, and Sweden's 0.222.\n       Matters naturally are not quite that straightforward. Alan \n     Greenspan has pointed out that while the Gini coefficient is \n     comparatively high for income, when applied to consumption it \n     is about 25% lower. In other words, poorer people are \n     spending more like the rich; they are, for example, almost as \n     likely to own such things as dryers and microwave ovens. So \n     the economic distance between the top and the bottom may be \n     narrower than the income numbers suggest. And Europe's \n     greater equality may simply reflect the widely accepted \n     premise that while America has adapted to economic change by \n     allowing inequality to rise, Europe has adjusted by allowing \n     higher unemployment. Which is better?\n       Another favored analytical tool for measuring inequality is \n     to divide the population into fifths, or quintiles, and see \n     what share of the nation's earnings each fifth took home. \n     According to the Census Bureau, in 1998 the bottom 20% earned \n     only 3.6% of total income (4.2% in 1973), compared with more \n     than 49% for the top 20% (44% in 1973).\n       But wait a minute. The Heritage Foundation points out that \n     the Census defines quintiles in terms of households--and \n     households in the bottom quintile are much smaller than those \n     at the top. Therefore, while there are 64 million people in \n     the richest quintile, there are fewer than 40 million in the \n     poorest one. Adjust for population, and the share of the \n     bottom fifth grows. Also, many Americans have income that is \n     not in the form of wages or cash transfers--food stamps and \n     housing subsidies for the poor, realized capital gains for \n     the better-off. Adjust for that, and the distribution narrows \n     again, as it does after accounting for taxes. Should the \n     adjustment include Medicaid and Medicare? If so (and that is \n     debatable), the gap shrinks further still; put it all \n     together, and Heritage figures that the bottom quintile takes \n     in 9.4% of national income, and the top 39.6%.\n       There is, then, no consensus on how to measure inequality. \n     There is, however, broad agreement that it has indeed grown. \n     Since the early 1970s the cash incomes of the rich have \n     indeed risen faster than those of the poor, with the middle \n     class hanging in there; the higher up the income ladder, the \n     faster the growth. That may help explain why the poverty \n     rate, now 12.7%, has still not dipped to 1973 levels (11.1%). \n     Median household income (the point at which 50% are above \n     and 50% below) has grown grudgingly, rising about 9% in \n     real terms from 1973 to 1998 and passing its 1989 peak \n     only in 1998.\n       Men have had a particularly dismal time. The median income \n     of men is significantly lower than in 1973 ($27,394 then vs. \n     $25,212 in 1997, in 1997 dollars). Men under 45 are making \n     less now, in real terms, than they did in 1967, and blue-\n     collar workers have taken the biggest hit. Blacks and women, \n     however, have seen their earnings rise.\n       Why is inequality increasing? Income inequality is \n     increasing because wage inequality is. The U.S. economy has \n     evolved to reward highly educated people even more than in \n     the past--a trend that social scientists, in a flight of \n     whimsy, call ``skill-biased technological change.'' This \n     means that demand for labor has shifted toward the skilled \n     and away from the unskilled. Brains beat brawn--hands down.\n       That explains the rise in the college premium--the extra \n     income college graduates can expect to earn compared with \n     those who finish only high school. The premium rose much \n     faster in the U.S. than in Europe because the supply of \n     graduates in the U.S. did not rise as fast in the 1980s and \n     1990s as the demand for them; Europe came closer to matching \n     demand and supply. It sounds like a tautology, and perhaps it \n     is: Income shifted toward the more highly skilled because \n     employers would pay more for their services. But it really is \n     that simple.\n       Of course, that by itself doesn't explain the income gap. \n     Another significant factor has been family structure. \n     Weighing on the downscale side of income distribution has \n     been the burgeoning number of single-parent families, \n     particularly those headed by never-married mothers; overall, \n     single-parent families earn about half as much as two-parent \n     households. On the upscale side, there has been an increase \n     in families in which both spouses make lots of money. To put \n     it another way, there are almost 2\\1/2\\ times as many people \n     working in the richest fifth of households as in the poorest \n     fifth. Less than a third of the people in the bottom quintile \n     live in households headed by a married couple; the rest are \n     single (55%) or in single-parent families. In the top \n     quintile some 90% live in married-couple families.\n       Changes in family structure account for more than a third \n     of the increase in income inequality since 1979, figures Gary \n     Burtless of the Brookings Institution, making it a slightly \n     more important factor than the widening wage gap. Lynn Karoly \n     of the Rand Institute in California calculates that the wage \n     gap is a bigger deal, but no matter: No one disputes that \n     both factors are crucial.\n       Other suspects in the inequality lineup are the declining \n     minimum wage (lower in real terms than in 1973), declining \n     unionization among men (accounting for as much as 20% of the \n     gap, estimates Freeman), deregulation (protected industries \n     kept wages high), immigration (which can depress wages), and \n     trade (that giant sucking sound). Higher levels of \n     entrepreneurship may also be associated with higher \n     inequality.\n       All those things probably count, but to a minor degree \n     compared with the changes in earnings patterns and family \n     structure. Immigrants, for example, can drive down wages in \n     local labor markets, particularly among the low-skilled, but \n     that effect is muted across the country as a whole. When it \n     comes to trade, the effect is even more difficult to \n     identify. While some companies have certainly shipped jobs to \n     cheaper climes, most U.S. trade is with other rich countries, \n     and most low-paid jobs are domestic, such as cleaning or food \n     service. Remember, too, that to critique immigration and \n     trade strictly in terms of their impact on inequality is to \n     look through a cracked mirror: Doing so ignores the \n     contributions immigrants make to America and the \n     opportunities wrought by freer trade.\n       What is more important than any of these individual \n     factors, Karoly notes, is how all of them have reinforced one \n     another. At the same time, there have been few countervailing \n     forces. The U.S. could have tried to slow these trends, as \n     Europe has done, through high minimum wages or centralized \n     wage bargaining or protective trade barriers or high taxes. \n     It chose not to.\n       What can be done? The primary rule of economic policy \n     should be like that of medicine: First, do no harm. And the \n     problem with many of the knee-jerk policy responses to \n     inequality is that they cannot pass that test. Looking at the \n     list of culprits responsible for the run-up in inequality, \n     for instance, one could argue for less technological change, \n     less trade, more regulation, and less entrepreneurship. Would \n     America really be better off with such an economic blueprint? \n     To ask the question is to answer it.\n       Even the more plausible approaches carry side effects worth \n     thinking about. Take unions. Unions are an essential part of \n     a free society, and they do an excellent job of raising wages \n     for members. But they can also be associated with not-so-good \n     things, such as protecting their workers at the expense of \n     those trying to get into the labor market--an important \n     factor in the high level of European unemployment. In July, \n     Alan Greenspan contended that it was America's greater labor-\n     market flexibility that had allowed it to take advantage of \n     information technologies faster and more fully than Europe; \n     tech-led productivity has been the bedrock of America's \n     recent wage and productivity surge. In this context, the case \n     for actively encouraging more unionization begins to weaken.\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\n       What about raising the minimum wage? That's plausible too, \n     and the increased minimum wage probably played a role in \n     steadying inequality in the past few years. Moreover, \n     countries like France, which has a high minimum wage, have \n     seen inequality grow much less. America may be robust enough \n     to swallow the proposed minimum-wage increase to $6.15. But \n     there is clearly a point where a minimum wage can become \n     burdensome, killing job opportunities, as has happened in \n     Europe. And raising the minimum wage is an awkward way to \n     lessen inequality. Most minimum-wage workers do not live in \n     low-income households (think of suburban teens), and many \n     poor households have no workers at all. So most of the gain \n     from a higher minimum wage goes to families that are not \n     poor. Worse, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development has documented a connection between the minimum \n     wage and youth unemployment: the higher the wage, the more \n     idle youngsters. That has to be a large part of the reason a \n     quarter of France's under-25-year-olds are out of work.\n       Is all this simply an argument for complacency? Not quite. \n     It is really an argument for looking at the issue from a \n     different perspective. Let's face it: Normal Americans do not \n     fret about rising Gini coefficients or quintile \n     displacements. They do however, worry if hard-working people, \n     even professionals, cannot find a home of their own that fits \n     their means. They don't want children suffering, even if \n     their parents made bad choices. They believe that opportunity \n     is available to all and that government should not hinder \n     people's ability to take care of themselves. Americans, in \n     short, are hapless at class warfare (perhaps because they are \n     so absorbed in racial and ethnic issues). If they were better \n     at it, they would be howling, say, at the proposed death of \n     the death tax, which applies to only a tiny share of estates. \n     Instead, most people want it killed. The attitude seems to \n     be, ``Hey, that might be my estate someday.''\n       Given such attitudes, a plausible list of goals for \n     government might go something like this: Enhance the \n     prospects of poor children, improve living conditions, reward \n     work, bolster family responsibility, keep taxes from \n     impoverishing people and ensure mobility.\n       And surprise, surprise: American social policy in the 1980s \n     and '90s has done almost precisely that. The Reagan \n     Administration can take credit for the 1986 tax reform, which \n     released many lower-income Americans from federal income-tax \n     liability. The earned-income-tax credit (EITC), also a \n     Reagan-era initiative, supplements the pay of low-wage \n     workers with children through a refundable tax credit of up \n     to 40% of earnings. The Bush and Clinton Administrations \n     expanded the EITC (the latter in the teeth of strong \n     Republican opposition). Both also expanded the provision of \n     support services for poor children outside the home--child \n     care, foster care, Head Start, and so on. Child-support \n     enforcement expanded under all three (with, it has to be \n     said, spotty results), and health insurance and child-care \n     subsidies for poor children expanded under Bush and Clinton. \n     The welfare reform of 1996 (in the teeth of strong Democratic \n     opposition) explicitly connected working to the receipt of \n     benefits. Overall, these policies make up a broadly \n     consistent approach that Americans are in tune with--and that \n     has delivered real improvements.\n       Perhaps, then, the way to remedy inequality is not so much \n     to try to lessen the Gini coefficient--through redistributive \n     taxation, for example--but to ameliorate the problems of \n     those snagged at the bottom. One such problem is clearly \n     housing. There is a gap between the growing numbers of low-\n     income renters (10.5 million in 1995) and the shrinking \n     numbers of low-cost rental units (6.1 million). A record 5.4 \n     million households spend more than half of their income on \n     rent or live in substandard housing. The feds can and should \n     do more in this regard by boosting the number of housing \n     vouchers. (Congress eliminated new housing vouchers for four \n     years in the 1990s; the 2000 budget envisions expansion.)\n       But inequality begins at home. It is not coincidental that \n     two cities with massive affordability problems--New York and \n     San Francisco--may also have the most tortured housing \n     markets in the country. Byzantine regulations suppress new \n     construction and raise its cost. Insiders--those who have \n     scored a price-controlled apartment--benefit at the expense \n     of outsiders, who pay prices exaggerated by the artificially \n     induced constraint in supply. So while rent decontrol rarely \n     makes the egalitarian to-do list, it deserves to be on it. \n     And Silicon Valley and other wealthy communities should take \n     a hard look at regulations--two-acre zoning and the like--\n     that put up a keep out sign for the unrich.\n       Expanding the EITC further--by increasing the credit \n     (particularly to families with three or more children) and \n     extending it to childless full-time workers--would also help. \n     The EITC is first-rate social policy. Essentially it promises \n     parents that if they work, their income will exceed the \n     poverty line. In 1998, EITC supplements lifted almost five \n     million people out of poverty, and that money has proved an \n     important carrot to get former welfare recipients into the \n     job market. A further expansion would put more dollars in low \n     earners' pockets and reduce the ranks of the working poor, \n     without the scattershot effect of the minimum wage. It also \n     makes perfect equity sense in the context of the tax cuts \n     both parties are fiddling with. Don't believe the fluff: Tax \n     cuts would benefit the better-off most, for the very good \n     reason that they pay the lion's share of taxes. The top 1% of \n     earners, for example, pays almost a fifth of all individual \n     federal income taxes, according to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, and the top fifth almost 60%. The bottom two \n     quintiles contribute 8%. An expanded EITC, in combination \n     with tax cuts, would spread tax largesse all the way up and \n     down the income distribution. Along the same lines, states \n     that are considering cutting taxes would do well to cut sales \n     taxes, which hit the poor hardest, rather than income taxes. \n     Or they could start or expand their own versions of the EITC, \n     as more than a dozen states have already done.\n       Third, surely a country as rich and talented as America can \n     figure out some way to ensure reasonable, regular health care \n     at a level of access that, say, Ireland provided in the \n     1960s. There has been expansion of guaranteed medical \n     provision for poor children, but about 15% still slip between \n     the cracks. A system with fewer gaps could also promote \n     mobility; it is scary for low-income people in a job with \n     health coverage to try to improve their position by moving to \n     a new job without it.\n       Fourth, let's remember that not every problem comes with a \n     ready solution, from government or anywhere else. For \n     example, it would be an unambiguously good thing for America \n     as a whole if families formed more readily and stayed \n     together more reliably. This would also narrow wage \n     inequality and boost family income. It's just far from \n     obvious how to get there from here.\n       Social policy is not a field of dreams; miracles are rare. \n     Across the rich world, estimates Ignazio Visco of the OECD, \n     the long-term poor are some 2% to 4% of the population. \n     But at any given time, these families make up half of the \n     population living in poverty--everyone else moves up and \n     out. The major problem in such homes is not lack of money \n     but disorganization, illness, lack of social skills, and \n     general cluelessness. In her book What Money Can't Buy, \n     Susan Mayer of the University of Chicago argues that after \n     basic needs are met, additional income has little effect \n     on children's prospects. Using a form of regression \n     analysis that only a social scientist could love (or \n     indeed understand), Mayer estimates that doubling the \n     income of the poor would reduce high school dropout rates \n     by one percentage point, increase education by a few \n     months, have no effect on teen pregnancy, and possibly \n     worsen male idleness. ``Any realistic redistribution \n     strategy,'' she concludes, ``is likely to have a \n     relatively small impact on the overall incidence of social \n     problems.'' Enhancing living standards to provide dignity \n     and reasonable comfort is a social good in itself. But \n     humility is warranted in terms of the long-range benefits \n     of doing so.\n       In the long run, because so much of inequality is connected \n     with the higher returns on skills, it is crucial that \n     Americans learn the things they need to know in order to \n     succeed. Which brings us to education, the most important \n     component of the mobility that is the bedrock of the American \n     dream. Poor people in poor communities are educationally \n     short-changed, and the problems begin early. That Americans \n     of almost any intellectual level can find a college to accept \n     them does not excuse the lack of basic skills too many high \n     school graduates demonstrate. Money may be part of the \n     answer, but only part. Cash can be spent wisely or stupidly; \n     there is, at best, an ambiguous correlation between spending \n     and achievement. But evidence indicates that increased \n     attention to education in early childhood brings enduring and \n     positive results. It's clear that there has to be more \n     emphasis on accountability and outcomes--what children \n     actually learn--as opposed to how much is being spent. That's \n     beginning to happen. And it's hard to believe that \n     competition--vouchers, charter schools, and the like--would \n     not be a goad to improvement.\n       Finally, let's remember that nothing good is going to \n     happen if the economy goes into the tank. Tight labor markets \n     have done more to make welfare reform work than any aspect of \n     its design; productivity has driven up wages since 1993 \n     faster than any transfer program could have done. Remedies to \n     inequality that hurt the economy as a whole will hurt the \n     poor first and worst.\n       Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former head of the Council of \n     Economic Advisors under President Clinton, offered a striking \n     way of looking at these issues at a Federal Reserve \n     conference in 1998. Imagine the income distribution, she \n     suggested, as an apartment building in which the penthouse is \n     more and more luxurious, and the basement, in which a number \n     of dwellers (and their children) are stuck year after year, \n     is rat infested. What to do? Well, some social critics, \n     offended by the presence of wealth amid such distress, would \n     like to pillage the penthouse. Tyson simply notes, ``We need \n     to do something about that rat-infested basement.'' Taking \n     care of the rats and making sure people can climb out of the \n     cellar: That seems about right.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You begin to understand--when we talk about jobs, when \nwe talk about pay, when we talk about our society, when we talk about \nour economic strength, when we talk about the middle class--that the \nstrength of our democracy is disappearing.\n  So, yes, we are going to trade with China. But if you make it \npermanent\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\nand you make it normal and you want to compete with China, you are \ngoing to be in one heck of a fix, is all I have to say.\n  Let me say a word about market share. Japan has been practicing this \nfor a long time. They have a society that sacrifices at the home market \nin order to take on the international market, the market of the United \nStates. There is no question about it.\n  That Lexus that costs $34,000 in the United States costs $40,000 to \n$44,000 in downtown Tokyo. That camera that sells for $300 here--a \nJapanese camera--sells for $600 to $1,000 in downtown Tokyo. That \nHandycam that sells for $640 in the United States--made in Japan--sells \nfor almost $2,000 in downtown Tokyo.\n  We do not have that kind of society. This is a spoiled society. We \nare supposed to give you tax cuts even though we have hardly any taxes \nto cut. And they can't be punitive, because look at the economy. By the \nway, we are paying down the debt, but we do not tell them we are \nincreasing the debt at the same time.\n  I really have not had but one person ask me about the estate tax. \nNobody has asked me about the Social Security tax because we put it in \nline with all other pension plans. Nobody has bothered about gasoline. \nOverseas, they regularly sacrifice $4.20 for a gallon of gas. When we \nget to $2 a gallon, we go ape and hold Federal investigations, TV \nshows, and everything else.\n  So the competition in globalization is one of sacrifice. In China, \nthey call it communism; sacrifice, in Japan, in Korea, and even in \nFrance and Germany. They have all kinds of rules and regulations. Try \nto buy a year 2000 Toyota in France. They keep it at the Port of Le \nHavre and inspect it a year or so, and you can buy the year 2000 model \non January 1, 2001.\n  They have all kinds of barriers and different tricks. We talk about \nglobalization and productivity as if we know something about it and \nthat all we have to do is reeducate and get more engineering graduates. \nCome on.\n  I am talking about middle America, the blood and guts of this \nsociety, the blood and guts of this democracy. That is what keeps us a \nstrong country. That Fortune magazine article that came out the day \nbefore yesterday will tell you about that divide, will tell you that \nthe take-home pay of that industrial worker is less than what it was 20 \nyears ago, adjusted for inflation. It is a devil of a trend, but they \nare not talking about that or even mentioning trade. But when it comes \nto market share, the Japanese set the pace.\n  What is going on in telecommunications?\n  I have a bill which is a reminder because the law is there. I am \ngoing to testify tomorrow that it is nothing more than a reminder. No \ncommunications bill is going to pass unless they put it as a rider on \none of these appropriations bills. Because they do not want to debate \nthese things.\n  All you have to do is look at Deutsche Telekom's SEC reports and know \nthey call themselves a monopoly and that the German government is in \ncontrol.\n  When you are a country in control, you can print money. We know that \nbetter than anybody. We have been running deficits since 1968, 1969 \nunder Lyndon Johnson; now the debt is $5.7 trillion. So we know about \ngovernments printing money.\n  Deutsche Telekom had its stock at $100 earlier this year, in March. \nNow it is down to $40. Do you think Ron Sommer, the CEO of Deutsche \nTelekom, is worried? He could care less. He says: I have $100 billion.\n  He just had a bond issue of $14 billion. Everybody got into it. We \ncould not get a $14 billion bond issue going in this country. But a \ngovernment-controlled company can easily get it because that company \ncan't go broke. It is bound to win.\n  Sommer says: I have $100 billion. And I am ready to buy AT or MCI \nor Sprint or VoiceStream or any telecom company I please. If his stock \nwas down in the regular market to $40, and he had $100 billion, there \nwould be a footrace between Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn. They would be \nin there in a flash. There would have been a takeover long ago. You \nsee, they can come in with all kinds of capital and distort the \ncompetitive market.\n  That is why we deregulated telecommunications from U.S. Government \ncontrol in 1996. We certainly did not do it to put it under German \nGovernment control. That is why we have the World Trade Organization, \nin order to get competition, not to set up government-controlled \ncompanies to take over in the private market.\n  But why do they do that? Who does offer the highest price, they tell \nme, per subscriber in one of these communications entities. Previously \nthe highest bid was $12,000 per subscriber. Deutsche Telekom comes in \nwith $21,000 to $22,000. Money is nothing to them. Why? Because they \nwant market share. They battle. And the whole fight in globalization is \nfor either jobs on the one hand, market share on the other hand, or \nboth.\n  That is the globalization. That is the trade. And we do not have a \ntrade policy.\n  They talk about free trade, and they get together. Unfortunately, our \nDemocratic leadership gets together with the Republican leadership on \nthis score.\n  They put out the white tent and they fixed the vote. The New York \nTimes wrote the article about it. The New York Times put in there that \nthey got the NAFTA vote by giving our friend, Jake Pickle, a culture \ncenter; another Congressman two C-17s; another one a golf match. They \nhad 26 gimmies to fix the vote. So they fixed the vote here in the \nFinance Committee and fixed the vote with the leadership, and they have \nthe unmitigated gall to come and say: No amendments, don't discuss it, \nwhen can we vote, let's get this thing over with, free trade, free \ntrade, free trade.\n  I am going to join my friend, our leader from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, and others, and hope we bring some sobriety to this crowd up here \nin Washington. Let's start competing and let's start being productive. \nCongress berates the U.S. industrial worker. You must become \nproductive. But we can't pass an increase in the minimum wage. We can't \npass a patients' bill of rights. We can't pass gun control. We can't \npass campaign finance. We can't do anything.\n  Remember, we are competing with ourselves. I think that is one of the \nmain points to be understood. I will never forget those industrialists \nwho traveled all the way to Europe and back with jet lag to implement \nthe Marshall Plan. Now with the profit the corporations make, they \ndon't mind the jet lag. They don't mind moving for a while to Japan and \nKorea and other places. And as of 1973, the banks--Citicorp and Chase \nManhattan--made a majority of their revenues and profits outside of the \nUnited States. They became more or less multinational. Then, of course, \nthe corporations themselves started traveling over there and they \norganized in order to support this so-called free trade, which they \nknew historically was a bummer. They organized the Trilateral \nCommission and the Foreign Policy Association. If you run for \nPresident, the first thing you do is get a gilded invitation to go up \nand pledge on the altar of almighty free trade your loyalty and your \nfealty to free trade. So you become sophisticated. You become \nknowledgeable. Yet you don't know what you are talking about.\n  Then they give the contributions to the college campuses so that you \nnot only have the companies and the banks, but you have the campuses. \nThere was a Ms. Jacobson who put out a study back in the 1980s where \nthe majority of the contributions, I think, on the Harvard campus were \nJapanese. So you get all the campuses. You get the consultants. You get \nthe Washington lawyers. We don't hear too much from our friend Pat \nChoate. I wish he would run again. Pat Choate wrote ``The Agents of \nInfluence.''\n  The agents of affluence were our special Trade Representatives, \nwhether it was Eberly or Brock or Strauss, those representing us \nimmediately went to represent the other side. It would be like General \nPowell going to represent Saddam Hussein and Iraq. But that is what has \nbeen going on. To Mickey Kantor's credit, he has not done that. But I \nhave been here long enough to watch all of them. Carla Hills, who gets \nall of these awards and everything else, represented the other side, \nthe competition.\n  Then you have the retailers. We used to debate a bill, Mr. President. \nI would go down to Bloomingdale's, and I would get a lady's blouse made \nin Taiwan and\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\none made in New Jersey because they are trying to fill up the order. \nThey were never the same price, and the American manufacturer wasn't \nthe lower price. I went to Herman's and got a catcher's mitt, one made \nin Michigan, one made in Korea--the same thing, the one from Korea was \ncheaper. So they make a bigger profit, the retailers. And the retailers \npay the newspapers through advertisements. That is the source of the \nmajority of newspapers' profits. The business manager of that newspaper \nsays you have to be for free trade because the retailers are their \nclientele.\n  I just heard the distinguished Senator from Arkansas talk about free \ntrade. She was very much for this particular bill. Their biggest \nindustry? Wal-Mart, import industry. They are going to sell a few \nchickens in Arkansas. Tyson hopes he can sell a few chickens. But they \nare not producing anything else there. So we have to go over to the \nretailers.\n\n  We have the banks, the corporations, the consultants, the societies, \nthe campuses, the lawyers, special trade representatives and, yes, the \nlawyers. The Commerce Committee does not consider a bill that your \noffice does not fill up with this crowd. In fact, these folks are \nconfusing the Deutsche Telekom bill that my distinguished colleague \ncosponsored with me, running around the whole month of August trying to \nfigure out how to get this vote and how to get that vote.\n  Section 310(a) says you cannot license a foreign government in \ntelecommunications. It has been that way since 1934. We argued and \ndebated it in the 1996 bill. We ultimately left it alone. In spite of \nthe White House and the FCC and all the other legal shenanigans they \nhave ongoing, the law is still there, but they are trying to confuse \nthat.\n  It is like Spain with the fifth column. We have the enemy within, \nlike Bobby Kennedy wrote about. I mean, I am not worried about China. I \nwould run it the same way they are running it. They have a $68 to $70 \nbillion plus balance of trade. We have got $70 billion minus balance of \ntrade and it has been growing each year. It is going to continue to \ngrow.\n  This is not about jobs in the United States. It is about jobs in \nChina. The Wall Street Journal had a big headline that said investors \nare racing now to invest in downtown Beijing, get a foothold there and \nthen get the protection of the WTO--because you know who the WTO is \ngoing to rule in favor of. Fidel Castro can cancel your vote, Senator, \nmy vote, the U.S. vote. I mean, come on, the WTO setting our trade \npolicy?\n  I have introduced a bill in each of the last sessions of Congress and \nI will introduce it again next year. I am trying to get the 28 \nDepartments and the Agencies coordinated in a department of trade and \ncommerce so that we can have a coordinated assault on the needs of this \nNation. At the present time, it is all spread around, disparate. You \nhave the policy from the Trade Representative. No, it is the Commerce \nSecretary. No, it is the Secretary of Defense. No, it is the White \nHouse. No, it is some other ruling that the administrative body, the \nFCC, has made. That is why we have these booming 60,000 lawyers at the \nbar in the District of Columbia--not 6, 60,000. I believe 59,000 of \nthem are communications lawyers.\n  If we could just coordinate and get one trade policy for this country \nand get competitive like the old Yankee trader; otherwise, we are \nlosing our jobs, our manufacturing. We are in economic decline. We are \nlosing our middle class. Unfortunately, we are losing the strength of \nour democracy. I really believe that.\n  My friend, the Senator from New York, says this is a most important \nvote. Well, I think it is just as important for the exact opposite \nreason, that we kill it, not pass it, kill this thing, have regular \ntrade, not normal, because we have been losing. I want to start \ncompeting. I certainly don't want a permanent trade agreement. Don't \nhave one Congress try to bind the other Congresses. ``Permanent'' was \nput in there by the NAM Business Roundtable and the downtown lawyers. \nThey are trying to get predictability to that investment over there, \nand they want to come back and tell ensuing Congresses: Look, you told \nus it was permanent and so we have our money over there.\n  And so just like the Senator from Arkansas protects Wal-Mart, which \nhe should, maybe I would be here trying to protect a textile company \nthat wants to produce in downtown Beijing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The time under cloture has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this \nafternoon to discuss a motion to proceed on what many of us believe to \nbe a very important issue, and that is Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n(PNTR) for China.\n  While this issue has been a long time in coming to the floor of the \nSenate, its time has come. Our Nation, for a good number of years, has \npursued a relationship with mainland China to improve the trade and \ncommerce flows that are critical to this country. The agreement that we \nare here to ultimately get to final debate and passage on, is an \nagreement that allows an unprecedented access to the China market.\n  I support PNTR for China because it will seal the deal on the U.S.-\nChina Bilateral Agreement and finally allow U.S. business and farmers \nthe access to Chinese markets that the Chinese have to our market. In \nother words, America has had a relatively open market to China while \nChina's market has been, for all intents and purposes, closed--except \nby category and by definition. Passage of PNTR will help pave the way \nfor China's eventual membership in the World Trade Organization.\n  I think, as you would probably agree, all of these are critical in \nour relationship to this very large country and the role that it will \ninevitably play in our future world. This deal cuts the barriers to \ntrade that U.S. farmers and businesses have unfairly encountered for \ndecades. It serves Idaho because it slashes tariffs on exports critical \nto Idaho's economy.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. On U.S. priority industry products, \ntariffs will fall to 7.1 percent. Tariffs will fall on several products \nthat are critical to my State, including wood and paper, which are \ncritical to my State; chemicals, a growing industry in my State; and \ncapital and medical equipment. In information technology--now a very \nimportant part of Idaho's economy--the tariff on products, such as \ncomputers, semiconductors, and all Internet-related equipment will fall \nfrom an average of 13 percent to zero by the year 2005.\n  On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will be reduced from \nan average of 35.1 percent to 14 percent by January of 2004, at the \nlatest. It will also expand market access for U.S. corn, cotton, wheat, \nrice, barley, soybeans, meat, and other products.\n\n  I think we all know the current state of the agricultural economy, \nand while we will set policy, to hopefully help production agriculture, \nwe have always known that knocking down trade barriers and expanding \nthe world marketplace for our producers in agricultural products \nremains critical. We have long since passed the day when we are the \nconsumers of all that we produce. Now, well over 50 percent of \neverything a farmer or rancher produces on his or her property has to \nbe sold in world markets to maintain current economies and to improve \nthe profitability of those individual operations.\n  China, without question, is struggling today to determine what it \nwill do in agriculture. Without question, it will want to feed itself \nand to continue to do so. Any nation worth its own gravity wants to \nprovide food and fiber for its own citizens. But as that economy \nimproves--and it is improving--the ability of disposable income in the \nhands of the mainland Chinese means that they will want to buy more of \na variety of products that our tremendous agricultural economy \nproduces. This is merely a step, and that is why I say dropping tariffs \nfrom 31.5 percent to 14.5 percent by the year 2004 is significant. As \nwe work with them, those\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\ntariffs could actually drop more rapidly in that area with additional \nagreements. There is no question that future Administrations in this \ncountry will continue to pressure the Chinese to move in the direction \nof even lower tariffs, but that significant drop of over 15 percent \nwill rapidly enhance agricultural opportunities for sales to China.\n  The United States needs this deal. We are the strongest economy in \nthe world and, as a Senator, would I stand here and say we need this \ndeal? Yes, because we do. The U.S. trade deficit with China is large \nand continuing to widen. The deficit surged from $6.2 billion in 1989 \nto nearly $57 billion in 1998. And it continues to rise.\n  That statement alone is proof that our economy has been a largely \nopen economy and theirs has been a relatively closed economy. This \nagreement, however, rapidly moves them toward a much more open economy \nand, therefore, spells in very simple language an opportunity for \nAmerican business and industry and America's working men and women to \nexpand the products they produce to sell into the Chinese markets.\n  In addition to reducing barriers to trade, it will also force China \nto play by the rules.\n  There is, I guess, a bit of a saying that when you deal with the \nChinese on the mainland, you sign the contract, and then you begin to \nnegotiate. In this country, when you sign the contract, you have made \nthe agreement. The negotiation is complete. That is why bringing them \non line with PNTR and into WTO means that not only will they have to \nultimately play by the rules, but there will be a learning process for \nthem as well. In working with the dispute mechanisms of the WTO they \nwill obviously learn that as they move more aggressively into world \nmarkets, there is a rule of law that we have all trading nations of the \nworld play by; that is, a rule of fair trade based on the standards \nestablished and negotiated within the agreements.\n  Let me give you an example of the problems we face today.\n  Idaho is known for its beautiful orchards. Of course, the State of \nWashington--our neighbor--is known for more orchards and that fine red \napple that many of us see on the shelves of the produce markets and \nsupermarkets of our country. Today, many of those orchards that produce \nthose marvelous apples in Idaho and Washington are being pulled out and \nreplaced by other crops. Why? Because the Chinese have flooded the \nUnited States market with concentrated apple juice--that when you buy \napple juice in the marketplace, the apple juice could well be produced \nfrom a Chinese concentrate shipped into our markets, then processed and \nbottled and sold into the American market.\n  The only way we can control the Chinese flow of concentrated apple \njuice into our market today would be to either openly threaten or close \ndown our markets--close down our borders to the Chinese. That makes \nvery little sense when you are working to expand markets because they \nthen would counter by closing down access to another portion of their \nmarkets only to hurt another segment of our agriculture.\n  If they were in the WTO--if we accept this agreement--then they come \nunder entirely new standards so that they have to regulate the flow of \ntheir concentrated apple juice into our markets, and without question, \nsubstantially improve the overall economy of the fresh fruit industry \nof this Nation and of the State of Idaho, and the State of Washington.\n  PNTR also means better opportunity for Idaho business-people and for \nthe Idaho workforce.\n  For several years now Idaho has exported to China on a growing basis. \nWe are 1.2 million strong in the State of Idaho. We are not a large \nState--at least population-wise.\n  In 1993, my State exported just about $2 million worth of goods and \nservices to China. But by just 2 years ago, in 1998, that number had \ngrown to $25 million. That is a 1,000-percent increase in the flow of \ngoods and services leaving Idaho and going to mainland China, which \njust shows you the tremendous expansiveness in the marketplace that \nstill remains relatively closed. This agreement rapidly opens that \nmarket and allows us greater access.\n  This last year, in December of 1999, I had the opportunity to lead an \nIdaho trade mission to China. I asked 13 different businesses and \nindustries to go along with me and my wife, Suzanne, and some of our \nstaff. Representatives from agricultural companies and building \nmaterial companies and the high-tech community went along with us. We \nwere all united, not only in our recognition of the importance of \nChina's entry into the WTO, but all of these companies that went along \nwent to look for opportunities to expand the marketplace of products \nbuilt in Idaho for expanding the economy of my State and expanding the \nworkforce and the job opportunities that exist in my State.\n  While we were there, we had the distinct privilege of meeting with \nPresident Jiang Zemin. President Jiang gave us the courtesy of nearly \nan hour of his time in a direct discussion with myself and the trade \ndelegation. During that time, he talked about China's future and he \nexpressed it this way. He said China is serious about a transition to a \nmore market-based economy, although the President made it very clear \nthat China was not going to fall for the Russian model. In other words, \nthey weren't going to throw out the old and assume that the new would \njust naturally take its place.\n\n  What they recognized and what they are doing at this moment is a \nprogressive step-by-step approach for greater access in the \nmarketplace, greater flexibility in the marketplace, without collapsing \ntheir economy, and without destroying the job base they currently have. \nThere is no question that China is eager to gain the economic benefit \nand the political prestige of a WTO membership.\n  During that tour, we also went to an area and a province to the \ncoastal city of Xiamen. There you can see firsthand what happens when \nan economy that was once guarded, protected, and limited by state-owned \ncompanies and by political control is turned, relatively, loose to join \nthe world economy. Xiamen is one of six free-trade zones in China that \nwas created by Premier Deng Xiaoping a good number of years ago. Their \ngross domestic product is phenomenal with average GDP of 20 percent, \nand job creation of the kind that is tremendously significant in giving \nthe workforce of China the kind of upward mobility that all of us seek \nfor all peoples of the world.\n  While we were there, we toured a brand new Kodak plant that was built \non about 19 acres of ground. It was once a rice paddy for water buffalo \nand cobra snake. In just 19 months, this rice paddy was transformed \ninto a very modern company that met all of the building codes, \nstandards, and safety requirements as if they were built in my \nbackyard, or in your backyard, or anywhere in this Nation. It was the \nhome of thousands of workers, working for a much higher wage given the \nkind of power that a higher wage gives, and even given the opportunity \nto buy and own their own apartment.\n  If we really want to see China change, we must help give their \nworkforce this kind of an economy, give them more money in their \npockets, a chance to own private property, and then we will watch, over \nthe years, a political change that will take place.\n  PNTR for China will improve the standard of living for many Chinese \nwho have endured very poor standards of living.\n  PNTR isn't just a good deal for the farmers of Idaho, or the business \nmen and women of Idaho. It is a good deal for the Chinese people who \nhave suffered poverty beyond compare, and who are now beginning to \nexperience through the marketplace, the opportunity of upward mobility, \nand the opportunity of private property ownership that truly begins to \ntransform the political base and the landscape of a country.\n  Over the last year, as this issue developed and certainly over the \nlast 6 months as we have known and as the Nation has known that we \nwould ultimately debate the issue of permanent trade status for China \nand debate their entry into the WTO, I have received a multitude of \nletters from Idaho from all kinds of constituents who for one reason or \nanother see the issue of permanent trade status the same way I do. \nWhile we agree that some of the human rights issues in China, and some \nof the other kind of concerns that we have are important, we also agree \nthat our\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\nNation must be continually engaged with the Chinese to change the world \nand to change their role in the world. Building a wall or turning our \nbacks on this huge population base is no way to gain those kinds of \nultimate changes or benefits.\n  These letters, and letters from my Governor, Dirk Kempthorne, I think \nnote, at least for the moment, that I share them with you. Let me give \nyou a couple of examples.\n  Here is one from David Sparrow, of Boise, ID.\n  He writes:\n\n       Dear Senator: As a constituent and a member of the \n     agricultural community, I continue to urge your strong \n     support of PNTR legislation with China.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       PNTR for China is vital to the farmers and other \n     agricultural interests in our district. Your vote is \n     critical.\n\n  Another one is just a simple one-liner from a gentleman in America \nFalls, when he said:\n\n       Support trade with China. Nothing to lose except a market \n     to other countries.\n\n  That is exactly right. If we don't compete effectively, then our \nproducers and our American workforce will be the loser as other \neconomies of the world continue to increasingly engage the Chinese \nmarketplace in their bid for consumer products and a role in the world \nmarkets.\n  Doug Garrity from Blackfoot, ID, wrote this Senator:\n\n       Dear Senator: As your constituent, I urge you to vote in \n     favor of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. \n     Congress must approve PNTR this year in order to secure \n     unprecedented access to world markets for my company and \n     others across America.\n\n  He was talking about a company in American Falls, ID, that is an \nagriculture-based company.\n  When the Idaho trade delegation and I met with President Jiang Zemin \nit was very clear from what he was saying that they believed this time, \nit was their turn to make the concessions. He openly talked about why \nthey had made these concessions, why they were lowering their trade \nbarriers, why they would phase them in over a period of time, and \nopenly discussed even freer markets than the kind that are proposed in \nthe current agreement Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky negotiated in late \nOctober and early November. President Jiang Zemin recognizes that the \nstrength of his country in the future is not going to be based on the \nstrength of a government but the strength of an economy and the right \nof his people to share in that economy, both individually and \ncollectively as a country. He spoke very openly about that.\n  It was an amazing experience to visit for well over an hour with a \nman who had walked behind Mao in the great revolution. He did not \nmention that once, but instead talked in terms of open and free markets \nand talked about China's role in a world economy and our role and our \ncompanies' roles and our national economy's influence over them and \ntheir economy. It was a dialog I would not expect to have. Yet it is a \ndialog that is now pursued nearly every day of the week in China by \nU.S. companies who are openly and actively gaining a piece of that \nmarket.\n  Another letter from Marlene Sanderlin of Lewiston, ID, which is a \nforest products and agricultural town. It is the location of our \nseaport where ocean-going barges come all the way up the Columbia and \nSnake Rivers into the heart of Idaho to take out Montana and Idaho \ngrain, forest products, paper, and coal from Montana. All of that is \nmoving out to the Pacific rim and some of it ultimately going to China. \nThe vitality of that seaport, in the heart of Idaho, is in large part \nconnected to the vitality of our trade in the Pacific rim and China. \nAnd China's economic growth, without question, is an opportunity for \nthat seaport and for every seaport in the United States and the men and \nwomen who work in the maritime industries.\n\n       As your constituent, I urge you to support PNTR legislation \n     for China. This legislation benefits real people: Me, my \n     family, and my country. It guarantees economic growth for \n     America and promotes the growth of democracy in China.\n\n  She speaks from my experience and my limited exposure in China, and \nthe absolute truth when she says it addresses the growth of the \ndemocracy or the democratic actions within China itself.\n  Potlatch Corporation happens to be a company that is a large paper \nand fiber producer in Lewiston, ID. They write, asking that we support \nthis. Why? Because of the thousands of workers they have at Potlatch \nand the products they can supply into the Pacific rim and into the \nChinese market.\n  I have a good many letters from Idaho. We have received thousands. I \nknow that nearly every Senator has received phenomenal communiques from \ntheir State in support of this particular issue that is now before the \nSenate itself. Establishing a permanent trade relationship with China \nmeans establishing a permanent, but also growing and developing \nrelationship with the most populated country in the world. Without \nquestion, it is a vast opportunity for the sale of our products, and \nfor an ongoing and working relationship with those Chinese people that \ncan do nothing but help improve the ongoing relationship.\n  We will have some important tests in the coming days as other votes \non other issues directly related to China come up. I will take a \nserious look at some of them because we need to make very clear, \nstraightforward statements to our friends in China as to what we can \nand will expect and what we don't expect as it relates to their role in \nthe world community and our role along with theirs.\n\n  If PNTR were voted down, the real losers would be the American \nbusiness person, the American farmer, and the American workforce. We \nhave a vibrant economy today, and our economy is vibrant because we can \nsell in an ever-opening world market. It has not cost us jobs, it has \ncontinually improved and built a stronger economic base and a greater \njob opportunity for nearly every citizen in our country who seeks it. \nWhile that economy is strong, in the agricultural communities of Idaho \nand across the Nation, it is weak. It is weak because nearly 20 percent \nof the world market is off limits or in some way restricted to direct \naccess for our production agriculture.\n  This is a quantum leap forward to not only gaining greater access but \nimproving the economy of hometown, smalltown America. Idaho, my State, \nhas a good many of them. PNTR is a critical link in providing that \nbusiness economy, jobs, and growth relationship with China and China's \nfuture. Rejecting permanent normal trade relations would, in my \nopinion, have a dramatic impact on the economy for all the opposite \nreasons I have expressed that passage would have a positive impact.\n  Lastly, if we reject this, we largely freeze our relations with \nChina. We can't afford to do that as a country. We can't afford to do \nthat as a world leader. I, along with a lot of my colleagues, have been \nvery stressed in the last several months with some of the utterances \ncoming from China and some of what appear to be their activities here. \nShame on us if we ignore this and if we ignore all of those other \nutterances. Full engagement is the only way we can deal with the \nChinese. Full engagement economically, full engagement in trade, \ndealing with defense matters, openly stating our positions in \nunequivocal ways as to how we will deal with our friends, neighbors, \nand potential adversaries around the world.\n  It is that kind of leadership that is incumbent upon this country, it \nis that kind of leadership that is asked for in the Senate now in the \npassage of a permanent normalizing trade relationship with mainland \nChina. I hope as we move to this vote we can get there, pass it, pass \nit as cleanly as possible, and get it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is presently considering the \nextension of permanent normal trade relations status, or PNTR, to the \nPeople's Republic of China contingent upon China's accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO. Earlier this year, it appeared that \nChina might seek to join the WTO this fall, but now, in the first blush \nof autumn, that possibility has\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\nreceded. And so has the urgency for us to consider granting PNTR on a \npermanent basis or on a temporary basis to China. Yet, here we are, \nwith but a scant handful of days left in this Congress and a large \nnumber of must-pass appropriations bills awaiting our attention, \ndiscussing the merits or demerits or lack of merits of forevermore \nforegoing our annual ritual of reviewing and extending normal trade \nrelations to China.\n  It might be worthwhile for the Senate to so consume its time, if we \nwere taking this debate seriously. After all, it is quite a significant \nvote, the outcome of which may have long-lasting effects on our \neconomy, on American jobs and on American workers. Proponents of \nextending PNTR to China note with some alarm that, should China join \nthe WTO, the United States could be subject to sanctions by China \nbecause we do not currently treat it exactly the same as we do other \ntrading partners, both in the WTO and outside the WTO. And that is \ntrue. We do not treat China the same as, say, the United Kingdom or \nJapan. We put conditions on our trade with China, human rights \nconditions and labor conditions and nonproliferation conditions. We do \nso out of concern for those issues with respect to China.\n  Our annual debate and vote to extend for another year normal trade \nrelations, with conditions or without conditions, allows us, here in \nCongress, to comprehensively review our relationship with China. The \nannual vote on NTR is important to China, more important, perhaps, than \nany other single piece of legislation might be. The United States is a \nhuge market, an attractive market, and an important market for Chinese \ngoods. The competitive advantage of NTR tariff rates is consequential. \nIt is both a carrot and a stick to persuade China to alter its behavior \nwith regard to issues near and dear to Americans, such as religious \nfreedom, such as nonproliferation.\n  I would be happy to spend many hours on this debate, and discussing \nthis important trade and security relationship. I consider it an \nimportant debate. But I am somewhat dismayed to read news accounts \nabout a cabal among Senators to stifle one of the most important rights \ngranted by the Constitution to the Senate. That is the right to offer \nand have debate on and votes on amendments. In the House, the rule \nguides debate and the number and content of amendments that might be \noffered to a bill. That is perhaps necessary in a body with 435 \nMembers. But the Constitution says: Each House may determine its own \nrules. The framers made the Senate a place where minority views, and \nsmall States, had an equal voice.\n  Thus, West Virginia, a State consisting of 24,000 square miles--as a \nmatter of fact, 24,231.4 square miles--is not a very large State when \nplaced beside, on a geographic map, the great State of New York, which \nis so ably represented and which has been so ably represented by the \nsenior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan.\n  I oppose this legislation with due apologies to my friend. And he is \nmy friend--a man of great wit, of great stature, a man of natural \ngrace, a student, a scholar, a teacher--Pat Moynihan. I apologize to \nhim for having to vote against this bill, but I shall do it with gusto.\n  The framers established the Senate as a forum for unlimited debate \nand unlimited amendment. Or did they? They certainly did so with \nrespect to unlimited amendments. But for several years, there was the \nprevious question here in the Senate by which debate could be limited. \nBut when Aaron Burr completed his tenure as Vice President of the \nUnited States and made his farewell address to the Senate, in early \nMarch of 1805, he recommended that the previous question be dropped \nfrom the rules. It had only been used 10 times in the previous years \nfrom the inception of the Republic. When the rules were revised in \n1806, the previous question was dropped. It was then that unlimited \ndebate reigned pure and undefiled and unchallenged in the Senate of the \nUnited States. So this is a precious birthright.\n  By the way, there were no limitations placed upon debate from that \ntime--1806 or 1805--until 1917, when the present rule XXII--not exactly \nthe present rule; it has been changed some since then--but a rule \nproviding for the invoking of cloture was adopted in the Senate in \n1917.\n  But this group of Members--I do not know who they are, and I am not \nsure that such a group exists, but I will take rumor for truth at this \npoint because it very well could occur to some Members to want a \n``clean'' vote, up or down.\n  This group of Members, I read, want a ``clean'' vote, up or down, on \nthe House-passed bill. They, and a number of House Members, do not want \na conference. And they do not want a second vote in both Houses on a \nconference report. So these Senators--well-intentioned, well-meaning--\nare determined to defeat every amendment, I hear, to this bill, \nregardless of merit. So having heard it, let me accept it as the truth \nand proceed accordingly. I am embarrassed to read that. I hope that it \nis not true, that Members of this body would relinquish a critical \nSenate prerogative, especially over so important an issue. Perhaps they \nwould say: Well, it isn't exactly relinquishing a prerogative. Other \nSenators may call up amendments, but we will vote them down. They shall \nnot pass.\n  If it is true, then we are just spinning our wheels here, are we not, \nby trying to fulfill our Constitutional role of regulating foreign \ncommerce? We are just spinning deep ruts in the Senate floor by \nattempting to offer amendments to improve this bill before we close off \nour opportunity to annually review and affect our relationship with \nChina.\n  I have reviewed the House bill, somewhat cursorily, I admit. It is \nnot that the House-passed bill is a bad bill. It contains a number of \nreporting requirements that attempt to assuage concerns about human \nrights and labor rights in China. But without the goal of an annual \nrenewal of NTR status behind it, what force does a report have to \naffect behavior in China? How can a report protect American workers \nwhose jobs are in jeopardy because of unfair actions in the trade field \nby China? How can a report protect American missionaries in China or \nChinese citizens who wish to practice their religious beliefs? How does \na report turn back a shipment of missile technology? How does a report \nturn back threatening words and actions directed at another nation like \nTaiwan?\n  The goal of this administration, and of the past few \nadministrations--and I say this most advisedly; I have been in Congress \nnow 48 years--and every administration since I came to Washington, \nDemocratic and Republican, has been the same way, always singing the \nsame old tune, and is guided, it seems to me, by the State Department.\n  The goal of all of these administrations, including the present one, \nhas been to, bit by bit, eat away at the constitutional powers of this \nbody to regulate foreign commerce. This is the message behind limiting \nmechanisms such as fast track. The argument is that our trading \npartners do not like agreements to be amended so it is take it or leave \nit for the Senate. But the Senate must make judgments based on our \nnational interest.\n  Trade is a matter of increasing national interest. No one would dream \nof making the argument that we cannot vote for reservations or changes \nin arms control treaties because it would upset our negotiating \npartner. The Soviets promptly renegotiated the changes we made with \nrespect to the INF treaty, a very fundamental change on the question of \nthe very definition of the missiles that were the subject of the \ntreaty. So are we to conclude that we can amend arms control treaties \nbut not trade agreements, or even legislation dealing with trade \nagreements?\n  Trade has now become a varsity sport in America, especially here in \nWashington. It is very important to our well-being, important to \nmillions of workers, important to the quality of our environment, \nimportant to the world's environment. It is important to large \nindustrial and service sectors, a matter of such importance that we \nshould at least pay careful attention to our constitutional \nresponsibilities. The final product will be more in the national \ninterest and Senators will have done their duty to their constituents \nand to our Nation, as it was envisioned by our Founding Fathers, if we \ndebate this matter at length and if we offer amendments, debate them in \ngood faith, and have votes up or down on them and let the chips fall \nwhere they may.\n  Is it not possible that we might improve this legislation by the vote \nof a\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nmajority here in the Senate? Suppose one were to offer an amendment \nvital to our security interest. It is not germane, but there is no rule \nof germaneness in the Senate except under rule XVI with respect to \nappropriations bills or when time agreements obtain or when cloture is \ninvoked. So why not? Why not offer subject matter that is important to \nour national security interest?\n  If there is a group of Senators who have, by tacit understanding, by \na wink and a nod, or by words openly declared that they will oppose any \nand every amendment regardless of its complexity or its complexion or \nwhether it is good or bad or in between--if there is such a group of \nSenators, why not abstain from that and let us vote? Let us have a vote \nup or down and have a vote based on the subject matter of the amendment \nwithout any prior agreement, without any wink or nod, if there be such. \nLet us see where the chips fall.\n  Are we to say that this particular bill is the acme of perfection and \nwe should not have any further amendments of any sort regardless of \nmerit? I don't think that would be the right way to commence.\n  Once granted, PNTR will be difficult, though not impossible, to \nretract. Any attempt to withdraw PNTR status in the future, if it is \ngranted now, will cause an uproar, and not just in China. The \ndiplomatic crowd in the aptly named Foggy Bottom here in D.C. will \nbleat that rejecting PNTR will upset delicate negotiations with the \nChinese. The big business crowd will complain about lost opportunities \nto sell or invest in China. The Administration at the time will prate \nerroneously about Congress interfering with their sovereign right to \nconduct foreign affairs. And even in Congress, bills might be \nintroduced, only to die an unremarked death in some committee or on \nsome calendar. I have been here a long time. I have seen a lot of bills \ndie and I know a thing or two about how to kill them. So I know that \nundoing a thing is much harder to do than doing it in the first place. \nIt will be much harder to undo PNTR than it will be to grant it.\n  So why are we apparently so gung-ho to have this sham debate and vote \nnow, this year, this week or next? There is no great urgency. The bill \nwill not even take effect until China's accession to the WTO is voted \nupon. Why do it now, just weeks after a damning report has been issued \nabout China's role in the proliferation of missiles and missile \ntechnology? Why do it now--why not next week sometime or next month or \nnext year sometime--mere weeks after Chinese authorities conducted \nanother raid on a so-called Christian sect that resulted in three \nTaiwan-born American citizens and approximately 100 Chinese citizens \nbeing arrested for meeting in worship? Why do it now, just months after \nChinese officials have made still more threatening gestures toward \nTaiwan?\n  Why do it now, before the final negotiations on the bilateral U.S.-\nChinese trade agreement, particularly the trade subsidy portions, have \nbeen ironed out?\n  Perhaps someone was listening to that advertisement I have heard on \nthe TV so many times: Do it now, do it here. Well, we don't do it now.\n  China's record on trade agreements is not stellar. Since 1992, six \ntrade agreements have been made--and broken--by China. In the last two \nyears, we have seen the effects of dumping on the U.S. steel industry, \nas well as on the apple industry. So why are we rushing this vote? Why \nnow? Why are we rushing this in such haste that we will not even \nseriously consider amendments that might improve the legislation? It is \nhardly perfect, sprung like Minerva, fully formed, from the forehead of \nJove, or like Aphrodite from the ocean foam.\n  In that vein, I have several amendments prepared which I believe \ncould improve this agreement. One concerns prospective U.S. investments \nin the Chinese energy sector. This amendment, if adopted, supports the \nmarket for clean energy technology in China's admittedly booming \neconomy. I believe this amendment would pass the Senate. I think it \nwould command a decided majority in the Senate, if left to its own \nmerits. Sales of such clean technology helps U.S. firms, of course, but \nalso provide a mechanism for the Chinese to improve their air and water \nquality, a necessary step if China is ever to step up to what should be \nleadership role for her among the world's developing nations with \nregard to climate change.\n  Now I am all for dealing with global warming. I am for the Kyoto \nProtocols, if China will get on board. So why not have an amendment to \nthat effect. Let's have a vote here in the Senate.\n  After all, by the year 2015 at the latest, China is expected--let's \nsee, I will be serving in my tenth term; that will be my tenth term. \nAfter all, by 2015 at the latest, China is expected to surpass the \nUnited States as the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases. For \nher own sake, as well as for the future of all of us, China needs to \nstep up to the plate and tackle her role in addressing the global issue \nof climate change. The United States would also benefit from this \neffort, as increased volume of clean technology sales helps to reduce \nprices and make the best technology more affordable to retrofit on \nexisting U.S. facilities.\n  My other amendments are perhaps somewhat more specific in nature. In \nlight of China's less-than-sterling record of abiding by previous trade \nagreements, these amendments are focused on increasing the transparency \nof Chinese Government subsidies made to China's many state-owned \nenterprises, and on improving existing U.S. procedures for acting on \ndumping complaints. China has made vague promises about not dumping and \nabout not providing unfair subsidies to her enterprises. Yet China has \nalso staked a verbal claim to the status of developing nations, which \nwould exempt her from any sanctions with regard to subsidies made to \nChinese industries. My amendments would require reports on China's \nstate-owned enterprises--what's wrong with that?--and the advantages \nthey enjoy, which would better enable us to determine if China's \nactions are fair.\n  Another of my amendments would add certainty to the sometimes \nexcessively lengthy process used to determine if such subsidies have \nadversely affected U.S. companies and U.S. workers. These amendments \nwill help us better to protect American manufacturers, American jobs, \nAmerican workers, and American families from unfair trade practices.\n\n  American trade negotiators have crowed that, in the U.S.-China \nBilateral Trade Agreement, the United States has given up nothing, \nwhile the Chinese have made substantial concessions and have offered to \nsignificantly lower tariff rates on certain goods. But I argue that the \nUnited States is giving up something substantial, though not directly \nthrough the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement. We are making our \npart of the bargain now. We are giving up our annual review and \nextension of normal trade relations with China in favor of a permanent \nnormal trade relations status. And we are doing it now, before China \nhas to make a single concession as a result of the bilateral agreement, \nwhich, like PNTR, is contingent upon China's accession to the WTO. But \nI suspect that the Chinese may also be gambling on the fact that having \nonce made the plunge in granting PNTR to China, the United States will \ngive it to them even if they never make it to the WTO, or even if the \ndetails of the bilateral change are ignored. That is the way we are, \nand the Chinese know it as well as I do.\n  We have an obligation to our constituents and to the citizens of our \ngreat Nation to look out for their best interests. The Constitution \ngives us a role. Yes, it does. This is the Constitution that I hold in \nmy hand for all to see through that electronic eye. This is the \nConstitution. Article I, section 8 gives Congress the power to regulate \ninterstate and foreign commerce. So why don't we utilize that power? \nWhy don't we utilize it? The Constitution gives us a role in regulating \nforeign commerce. I am not sure that we perform that obligation very \nwell. We grant--I don't--fast-track authority to the Executive to \nnegotiate massive trade deals and leave ourselves without the ability \nto amend. We take away the Senate's right under the Constitution to \namend. We grant fast-track authority to the Executive to negotiate \nmassive trade deals and leave ourselves without the ability to amend \nthem, as we did with NAFTA and GATT, both of which I voted against--\nproudly, I voted against both.\n  My State certainly did not benefit from those actions. West Virginia \nlost\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\njobs and lost a lot of the diversity in its manufacturing base. China \nis an enormous potential market, perhaps, but she is also an enormous \nlabor pool competing for jobs and competing at a price advantage. Our \neconomy is strong, but we cannot all sit at computer keyboards and be \ninformation age technology wizards. As a Nation, we also need to \nactually make things and grow things. Production and farming are \nimportant. But I would not invest in planting a new apple orchard right \nnow, with Chinese apples and apple juice flooding the U.S. market. I \nwould think twice about establishing a new assembly plant or some \nfactory right now that faces competition from lower-paid workers in \nChina, who do not have the same labor protections that workers in the \nUnited States enjoy and deserve. The future is uncertain and cloudy.\n  Who will get the prize? Chinese or American workers? Will China be \nrewarded despite a history of broken trade agreements, weapons \nproliferation, religious repression, poor labor protection, and \naggressive foreign policy statements? Will China be rewarded before the \nfinal trade issues concerning subsidies have been inked in? Or will \nAmerican workers enjoy a respite? Will American concerns for security, \nhuman rights, and fair trade hold sway for a little while longer? I say \nto my colleagues, let it wait. Let it wait. This debate, this vote, can \nwait until we have the leisure and the will to do it right. If we \npersist in this misguided charade of a debate with no intention of \nconsidering any amendments on their merits, I will fulfill my \nobligations. I will offer amendments--good amendments, useful \namendments, not dilatory amendments. I hope they will not be tabled \nsimply to avoid a vote up or down, to avoid going to conference.\n  At this time, I believe it would be extremely unwise to simply rubber \nstamp the House bill and approve PNTR with China without amendments.\n  Granting PNTR to China with no amendments and no conditions signals \nthat the U.S. Congress has given up on putting worker rights and \nenvironmental standards on the international trade agenda. Coupled with \nthe rhetoric of the President, the Vice President, and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative in support of PNTR, congressional acquiescence will \nreduce American credibility on labor and environmental issues to \nvirtually nothing.\n  At this time, it is not known whether China will actually apply for \nmembership in the WTO. But one thing is clear; the Chinese Government \nhas not wavered in its absolute opposition to any consideration of \nlabor rights and social standards in the WTO. Despite claims that a \nmarket economy is bringing democracy to China, the U.S. State \nDepartment's 1999 human rights report on China concludes that the \nChinese Government's ``poor human rights record deteriorated markedly \nthroughout the year, as the government intensified efforts to suppress \ndissent, particularly organized dissent.'' Documented human rights \nviolations include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced \ndetentions, denial of due process, and extra-judicial killings. Violent \nrepression of all efforts to organize independent union activity \ncontinues.\n\n  Given such a record, it would seem unbelievable to many that the \nUnited States Congress would grant a green light to PNTR with China, \nwithout so much as even a nod toward conditions or amendments.\n  Are we to turn a blind eye to every deeply held principle we have as \na people about justice, freedom, and right and wrong for the pie-in-the \nsky promises of economic gain? I hope not. For that would be much, much \nmore than a sell-out. That would be a shame.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with deference and not a small \nmeasure of awe at the continued erudition of my colleague from West \nVirginia. The first decision I made when I came to the Senate was to \nsupport him for majority leader, and I have not made one of equal \nconsequence since. None has given me greater pleasure.\n  I say on the question of amendments that it is a point of \nsignificance. When the Finance Committee reported a measure on its own, \nit was a two-page bill. It was not a complicated matter. It was just \nagreed to. It will allow us to reap the benefits of an agreement that \nwas reached between two countries.\n  Now, I must say with absolute openness--and I hope always to be such. \nYes. It is the hope of the managers of the legislation that the Senator \nfrom Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and the ranking \nmember, that we not amend the House bill. We have agreed to take up \nH.R. 4444, because if we amend it with a semicolon, it will require us \nto go back. The bill will go back. I do not have to tell the Senator. \nIt will have to go to conference and pass the House again, and then \ncome here and pass the Senate. Time has run out. This would have been a \nwholly acceptable and sensible approach in May, but here we are in \nSeptember of an election year in the last weeks of the Senate.\n  So the Senator from West Virginia is right. He said he has read it in \nthe newspapers. I stand here to tell him that it is the case. I hope we \nmade no effort to conceal this. It is simply our judgment and the \nadministration's judgment.\n  I would like to say one last thing about fast track. The Senator \ncould not be more correct--that we have given up our right to amend the \ntrade agreements. But we did that in the aftermath of the disastrous \nexperience, which was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. If you were \nto make a list of five events that led to the Second World War, Smoot-\nHawley would be one. We raised our tariffs to the 60-percent level by \ntrading on the floor in the most normal political process that works \nvery well in most matters. But in trade it can be ruinous. We reached a \nlevel of tariffs of 60 percent. We were in that early stage of a sharp \nmarket crash. The economy was down. But it came back up. But with \nSmoot-Hawley, indeed imports dropped by two-thirds. And exports dropped \nby two-thirds. The British went off free trade into commonwealth \npreferences. The Japanese went to the Greater East Asian Coprosperity \nsphere.\n  In 1933, with unemployment rates of almost 33 percent, Germany \nelected Hitler chancellor.\n  So under Cordell Hull, that great statesman from Tennessee, and \nSecretary of State under President Roosevelt, we began reciprocal trade \nagreements. We gave the President the authority to negotiate reciprocal \nreductions in tariffs without coming back for the formal approval of \nthe Congress. This was the predecessor of, the precedent for, the fast \ntrack procedures that were established in the Trade Act of 1974. In \neffect, the Congress itself said we will deny ourselves this \ntemptation, if you like. We can always take it back.\n  Indeed, right now the President has no fast-track authority. It \nexpired in 1994. He could not get it in the atmosphere of the divided \nparties.\n  It is that atmosphere, too, that leads us to believe that we should \nnot send this measure back to the House. It had been thought that the \npermanent normal trade relations bill might pass by two or three votes. \nIt was more, but not overwhelming. As the Senator from West Virginia \nknows, here in the Senate Chamber 86 votes were cast in July on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I want to be open about this matter, if I can, and as I am. There is \nnothing more to say than what I have said, save that I believe I have \nmore time--possibly 3 hours--apportioned to me in this debate. If the \nbeloved President pro tempore--and all of those things--would wish more \nof my time to speak further, he would only have to ask.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior \nSenator from the State of Alexander Hamilton, New York. Alexander \nHamilton was the only one of the New York delegation who finally signed \nthe Constitution. He was one of the truly great statesmen in the early \nlife of this Republic. He helped guide the people of that delegation at \nthe Convention to a resolution concerning this great document, and one \nwho helped, along with John Jay and James Madison, to write those, if I \nmight use the word, ``immortal'' papers, the Federalist Papers. He \nhelped to win the approval of the State of New York for the \nConstitution.\n  There is no one with whom I would rather, very honestly, discuss this \nparticular subject in the Senate than the\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\nSenator from New York because I am so opposed to the view that he has \njust expressed. I am so opposed to it. I could with much greater \npassion say that if it were someone else.\n  I respect the Senator. I admire him. I know he was and is the great \nteacher. I wish I had had the good fortune to sit in a class and listen \nto Senator Moynihan speak as a Professor.\n  I am proud to say that I had much to do with Senator Moynihan's being \na member of the Finance Committee, as he also had to do with my \nbecoming majority leader.\n  But I am very, very much opposed to this approach. I am very, very \nmuch opposed to and somewhat chagrined and disappointed, I say with due \napologies to my friend, at the philosophy which seems to govern the \nSenate at the moment with respect to this legislation, with respect to \nnot adopting amendments.\n\n  The distinguished Senator has had no hesitancy whatever. He is not \ndoing something behind closed doors or under the table or under the \ndesk, but sitting it on front of the desk: This we are doing and this \nis why we are doing it.\n  He honestly believes that is the best for his country. I admire that. \nI respect the Senator for that forthrightness. He would not be \notherwise but forthright. I respect his reasons, therefor. However, I \ncannot agree with him. I am totally, absolutely, unchangeably, \nunalterably set in my viewpoint that this is not the right thing to do; \nit is not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States; it \nis not in accordance with the wishes, the intentions of the framers. So \nbe it. I am not going to argue that point. We will just disagree and be \nas great friends as we have ever been. And the Senator will win when we \ncast our final vote on this. His conscience will be clear and mine will \nbe clear.\n  My State has lost under these trade agreements--GATT. Our country has \nlost under NAFTA. It is my understanding that we have lost 440,000 \nworkers in this country as a result of NAFTA. Those are the statistics \nmy staff has been able to get from the administration.\n  As I say, I will not belabor the point further. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator for leadership that he has given the Senate. He \nis a man who has always enjoyed the respect of his colleagues whether \nhe agrees or disagrees in a particular matter. He doesn't go out of \nthis Chamber and carry it with him. We all love him, and we will all \nhate to see him go. But I will say to him, of his illustrious words \nthat have been spoken in the Senate so many times, I have very \ncarefully listened to them, and they will never dim from my memory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask for an additional 1 minute to thank my \nillustrious, incomparable colleague for his remarks.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, inasmuch as no Senator seeks recognition, \nand there is a little time remaining before the Senate goes back to the \nappropriations bill dealing with energy and water, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may speak for not to exceed 10 minutes without the time \nbeing charged against time under the rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Vice President \nGore on his particularly fine choice of a running mate for the coming \nFall election.\n  Joe Lieberman is an able Senator. More importantly, he is a sincere \nand thoughtful Senator. He really fits no ideological sleeve, although \nsome are already busily trying to label him. Joe Lieberman is his own \nman, I believe. He follows his own conscience, I am confident of that, \nas even these early days of the Presidential campaign have already \ndemonstrated.\n  Senator Lieberman has firmly gripped the national political steering \nwheel, and he is bravely addressing one of the more fundamental issues \nbefore this Nation, namely the erosion of faith-based values from \npublic life and public policy and the consequences of that regrettable \nloss.\n  On July 17, I took this Senate floor to express my own general \nconcern and alarm over the direction this nation seems to be taking \nwhen it comes to spiritual values. My speech on that occasion was aimed \nin particular at a recent Supreme Court decision regarding voluntary \nprayer at a high school football game, but my remarks reflected my \nlong-held general view that the Supreme Court has gone too far on such \nmatters, and has increasingly misinterpreted the Framers intent \nregarding the establishment clause and perhaps more to the point the \nfree exercise clause of the first amendment.\n  During my remarks, I called for a Constitutional amendment which \nmight help to clarify the Framers' intentions. I even wrote to both \nPresidential candidates, with the hope of focusing attention on the \nmatter, and thereby starting a national conversation about the proper \nplace of religion in our public life, in our political life, in our \ncountry's life.\n  My friend, Joe Lieberman, has done this Nation a great service by \nmaking his belief that faith-based principles and religion must and \nought to have a place in our national policy and in our discussions \nabout directions and priorities.\n  To my utter amazement, however, Joe Lieberman has been misunderstood, \nand even maligned by some.\n  My colleague, now a candidate for the second highest office in the \nland, is not trying to force his religion or any religion down the \nthroats of any unwilling recipient. Nor is Joe Lieberman claiming, at \nleast I do not read his remarks in this way, that a person cannot be \nmoral if that person is not religious--even though I have to say that \nGeorge Washington made it clear that without religion, morality cannot \nprevail; George Washington, in his Farewell Address. So, upon that \nauthority I would rest my case. Joe Lieberman is simply saying that in \ntrying to assure that no one is coerced into embracing any one \nreligion, or any religion, for that matter, the pendulum may have swung \ntoo far. Joe Lieberman is simply expressing his own, and many other \npeople's views, that it sometimes appears that persons of religious \nfaith are not allowed their full freedom to practice and live their \nvarious faiths as their consciences dictate. He wants to have a \nnational conversation about that, and I applaud his courage, for it is \na subject easily misunderstood.\n  Political correctness gets in the way of all too many things in this \ncountry of ours. I am not a subscriber of political correctness by any \nmeans, shape or form. It has gotten in the way of an honest and open \ndialogue about how to allow for the open expression of faith-based \nvalues and practices for those who want those things in their lives, \nwithout infringing on the rights and beliefs of those who don't.\n  In my humble opinion, we must, as a Nation have this dialogue. The \npendulum has swung too far. The Framers did not intend surely for a \ntotally secular society to be forced on the populace by government \npolicy. They only wished for individuals to be free to embrace whatever \nfaith they wished, or none at all, if they desired none.\n  Prayer abounds throughout the speeches of our great men. References \nto God virtually drip from our public buildings, and invocations of the \nCreator's blessing crop up at every important public gathering \nthroughout our history. We have wandered off the Framers' track on \nthis, and we need to work toward a better understanding of what was \nintended, what was to be protected and why.\n  I hope that our fine colleague, Mr. Lieberman, continues to try to \nfurther the conversation. Not to do so would be detrimental. I fear \nthat the misunderstanding about this issue is huge and growing. There \nis a new sort of intolerance about religion that I find most \ndisturbing. It has become the thing we don't talk about, because it is \nnot politically correct, so many of us are driven into a closet. It is \nseen as a divider in our culture, instead of the\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\nforce for good it certainly can and should be.\n  Where we do not want to go, and where we have rapidly been heading, \nis toward an instituted governmental policy which is prejudiced against \nall religion. We need to think long and hard about this together, as a \ncountry. How sadly ironic it would be if, after over 200 years, a \nnation grounded in religion and founded by religious men and women, \nwith shining faith-based ideals about equality, fairness, freedom, and \njustice, and decades of effort to make those ideals a reality, wound up \nreflecting in its laws and policies a prejudice against religion and \nreligious people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8067-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S INJURY\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I will proceed with PNTR on that basis. I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and \nPacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I rise today \nin strong support of H.R. 4444, a bill to establish permanent normal \ntrade relations with the People's Republic of China.\n  Let me begin today by disposing of the principle argument offered by \nopponents of this bill--that this bill somehow is a ``gift'' to the \nPRC, a reward. To hear the opponents of this bill talk, you would think \nthat we were on the losing end of this equation.\n  However, examining the basic facts shows there is a fatal flaw in \nthat assertion. Our markets are already open to the Chinese and to \nChinese goods; the same is not true about our ability to enter China's \nmarkets. This bill, and the accompanying accession of China to the WTO, \nchanges that. This bill opens up their markets to the United States. \nThis bill lowers tariff and nontariff barriers to our goods and \nservices. This bill gives us a level playing field. In other words, it \nis a win-win situation for the United States.\n  It is estimated that in the first year after this bill is enacted, \nand China accedes to the WTO, our trade with China will increase by $14 \nbillion; in other words, almost double today's volume. And that \ntranslates into more jobs for U.S. workers and U.S. companies.\n  To use my home State of Wyoming, as an example, which is not a large \nexport State, China ranked as Wyoming's 15th largest export destination \nin 1999; that is up from 16th in 1998 and 19th in 1997. Our largest \nexports are agricultural products, such as beef, grains, and, in \naddition to that, minerals.\n  Under this agreement, Wyoming farmers and cattlemen will no longer \nhave to compete with export subsidies China uses to make its \nagricultural products unfairly competitive. China has agreed to \neliminate sanitary requirements which are not based on sound scientific \nbases and which act as artificial barriers to products from America's \nNorthwest, which includes Wyoming. Wyoming producers will benefit from \na broadening of the right to import and distribute imported products in \nChina, and from wide tariff cuts on a wide range of products.\n  To illustrate, under the agreement, China has cut its tariff on beef \nfrom 45 percent to 12 percent. It has cut its tariff on pork from 20 \npercent to 12 percent. And, significantly for a great number of my \nconstituents in Sweetwater County, it will reduce its exorbitant \ntariffs on soda ash--90 percent of which is mined in Wyoming--from \ndouble-digits to 5.5 percent.\n  Passage of this bill means fewer barriers to U.S. exports. Fewer \nbarriers mean more exports, and more exports mean more jobs for Wyoming \nfarmers, ranchers, cattlemen and small business owners.\n  I don't need to tell my colleagues about the present sorry economic \nstate of many of our agricultural sectors and small businesses. The key \nto their continuing viability and growth is increasing their share of \nforeign markets. It is for that principal reason that I support this \nbill and for China to go into the WTO. Clearly, it is going to be more \nadvantageous for us to deal with the People's Republic of China through \nthis organization than on a unilateral basis which we have done for the \nlast number of years. By the way, this same trade arrangement has been \navailable to them on an annual basis.\n  Let me make one more observation before moving on. Defeating the bill \nwill not keep the PRC out of the WTO. China will accede to that body \nregardless of what we do this week, regardless of whether or not we \nwant it. We don't have a veto over their admission, and we make it \nsound as if that is the case from time to time.\n  What defeating this bill will do, however, will be to deny us the \nbenefits of an open Chinese market, at least a more open Chinese \nmarket. It would allow China to keep its doors closed. It would give \nour allies and competitors a huge advantage over us.\n  I was there a while back, when we had a feud going on between the \nUnited States and China. They canceled large orders from Boeing and \nbought airbuses from France. That is the way the world has become. They \ncan do that. It would set in stone our present trade regime where 40-\npercent tariffs are the norm, not the exception. That is what would \nhappen if we don't pass this bill.\n  These are not the only bases for my support. Unlike some of my \ncolleagues, I believe China is changing for the better and that \nadmitting them to the WTO will, hopefully, speed that process. One has \nonly to compare the China of 1978--the China of the Cultural \nRevolution, of Mao suits, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong theory--with \nthe China of 2000, the China of the economic revolution, to see that \nchanges are indeed both substantial and widespread.\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\n  This is not to say that everything is great there. That is not really \npart of the discussion. Of course, there are a number of things that \nneed to be done. The country continues to have an abysmal human rights \nrecord, to stifle political dissent, to subjugate Tibetans, to \nstridently attempt to cow Taiwan into submission. All these things \ncontinue to go on. No one likes that, but that is not really the issue. \nThe issue is how can we best bring about change.\n  There is no argument in this Senate as to whether China needs to \nchange. We all agree it does. I believe the real issue is how do we \neffectuate that change. Do we do it by continuing to attempt to isolate \nChina, as some Members would have us do, by pushing them away from us, \nor do we accomplish the task by seeking to engage China, by drawing it \nfurther into the community of nations, by giving its people an \nopportunity to see how others live in the world and then become \nimpatient to make that transformation for themselves?\n  We can see that happening in a number of places around the world. Is \nit too slow? Sure. Isolating China off by itself is to some a feel-good \nposition, a solution for some people. Improve your human rights record \nor we will cut off trade. Stop threatening Taiwan or we will cut off \nmilitary exchanges. Stop selling military hardware to other countries \nor we will cut off high-tech transfers. Do we want a policy that makes \nus feel good or do we want something that works?\n\n  I don't believe you can unilaterally isolate a country such as China. \nCut off trade and the European Union is more than happy to step in, \nsell China Airbuses, as I mentioned, in place of our Boeings. Cut off \nmilitary-to-military exchanges and we lose the opportunity to impress \nthe PLA with the vast superiority of our military while improving \nincreasing mutual distrust among our two militaries. Cut off high-tech \ntransfers and Beijing simply gets it somewhere else. Add that to the \nfact that foreign governments rarely react kindly to ultimatums from \nother governments--take, for example, how we in the U.S. would react to \nanother country if they told us how to manage our affairs--and I \nbelieve the unworkability of the ``isolationist solution'' becomes \nself-apparent.\n  Instead, I believe the best way to influence China is to engage it, \nto draw it inextricably into the world community, to expose it to the \nworld of ideas.\n  In 1995, on my first trip to China as subcommittee chairman the \ndifference that contacts and trade with the West made in the PRC were \nclearly evident. I have not traveled there over the years as many \npeople have, but just in the last few years there has been great \nchange. Perfect? Absolutely not. More change is needed, of course.\n  In Beijing, the vast majority of the population was still riding \nbicycles. There were, 5 years ago, very few private cars, and political \nquestions, especially in Taiwan, and the party line were the sole topic \nof discussion. In Shanghai, bicycles were replaced by mopeds and more \nprivate cars. While Taiwan and ``one China'' were still topics of \ndiscussion, individuals I met there were more interested in talking \nabout trade, what they could do to facilitate economic change and \ngrowth. In Guangzhou, there were fewer bicycles or mopeds to be seen. \nPrivate cars, including BMW and Mercedes Benz, appeared to be the norm. \nPolitics wasn't talked about a great deal.\n  The lesson was quite clear. The establishment of the rudiments of a \nmarket economy coupled with trade with the outside world leads to \nincreased personal wealth and to increased personal entrepreneurship. \nThat in turn leads to an increased interest in and expectation of \ngrowth and certain basic personal freedoms. We have seen that same \ndevelopment in Taiwan and South Korea where authoritarian governments \nhave been replaced by thriving democracies over the last 20 years. The \nsame hopefully will happen with China. Once the genie is out of the \nbottle, there is no putting it back. The march toward an open \ndemocratic society will happen. The only question is how long it will \ntake.\n  I am told by experts that in Asia it probably takes a generational \nchange before some of those things happen. I am sure that is true. I \nbelieve, however, that we do speed its pace by passing this \nlegislation. I also believe that Chinese accession will remove a major \nirritant in our relationship. Whenever we have a disagreement with \nChina over trade relations, be it intellectual property or market \naccess or whatever, our reaction is to apply some unilateral sanctions \non China, sanctions which only serve eventually to limit the rest of \nour relationship and our exports to that country. It is ineffective \nhere and it has been ineffective other places. We have removed a number \nof those sanctions this year.\n  By bringing China into the WTO, we turn trade disputes \nfrom unilateral into multilateral issues. We transform the dispute from \n``I said/he said'' to one mediated by an independent international \nbody. We thereby lessen the irritation of bilateral affairs while at \nthe same time increasing the likelihood that China will find a remedy \nto the problem.\n\n  For all those reasons, I support H.R. 4444.\n  Before I close, let me add a word or two about possible amendments \nwhich may be offered for consideration. Regardless of their relative \nmerit, I, as Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, and many \nothers am strongly opposed to adding any amendments to the China PNTR \nbill. Any amendment will only have the effect of killing it for this \nyear, since amending would require it to be sent back to the conference \ncommittee. Once in conference, it is unlikely the bill would emerge \nbefore we adjourn sine die. We only have some 20 legislative days \nremaining in this session and a full plate of domestic appropriations \nand legislation with which to deal. It would be a herculean task under \nany circumstances, but this year makes it more difficult because, of \ncourse, some on the other side of the aisle are doing everything they \ncan to stall the process. We hope that won't continue to happen.\n  There is not, realistically, enough time for a conference and to pass \nit back through both Houses. It is clear the House fully supports the \npresent unamended version. It passed by a vote of 237-197. So does a \nvast majority of the members of the Senate Finance and Foreign \nRelations Committees, and so do I.\n  Mr. President, despite all the hyperbole about passage of H.R. 4444, \nit does not mean we are selling out to the Chinese, that we are telling \nthem it is all right to proliferate, to abuse human rights, or to \nthreaten Taiwan. It means we expect them to play by the same rules we \ndo; we expect them to be a responsible member of the world community, \nand we expect to be able to reap the same benefits they do from an \never-expanding global economy. No more, no less. The bill is good for \nthe United States, good for U.S. companies, good for U.S. workers, and \ngood for the U.S. consumers.\n  In the final analysis, this is good for China because it will \nundoubtedly bring about the kind of changes that many would like to see \nin that country, including many Chinese. Many Chinese would like to see \ndemocratization, rule of law, and respect for basic fundamental human \nrights.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of \nH.R. 4444.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to echo the remarks made yesterday \nby Chairman Roth and also to concur with my friend and senior colleague \nfrom New York, Pat Moynihan, regarding China's compliance, or lack \nthereof, with the U.S.-China bilateral agreement signed as part of \nChina's admission to the World Trade Organization.\n  I am concerned that after laboriously working out a bilateral trade \nagreement that addressed myriad economic issues, China seems to be \npicking and choosing which aspects of the agreement to follow and which \nto ignore. A prime example is insurance. Under the bilateral agreement \nsigned last November, China agreed to preserve the existing market \naccess currently enjoyed by foreign insurance companies. In other \nwords, under the agreement, a foreign-owned insurance company in China \nwould be able to continue to operate and to add new branches and sub-\nbranches as a wholly-owned company once China entered the WTO. Less \nthan a year after this historic and painstaking agreement was signed, \nChina is unilaterally rewriting the rules and treating these \ngrandfathered companies like new entrants into the China\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nmarket. This puts the very companies that invested in China's economic \ngrowth at a competitive disadvantage to new entrants.\n  Fundamental to the foundation of the U.S.-China bilateral agreement, \nto China's ascension into the WTO, and to the possible establishment of \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations with China is the belief that \nagreements will be honored, not on a piecemeal basis, but fully. This \n``interpretation'' by the Chinese government on insurance begins to \ncast doubts about whether ironclad agreements with China will truly be \ncompletely and totally honored.\n  I still intend on supporting PNTR for China, but I am disappointed \nthat China appears to be backsliding on its agreement regarding \ninsurance. I hope that the Chinese leadership will adhere to the \nagreements signed last year on insurance, and absent that, I hope the \nAdministration continues to apply forceful pressure to see that China \nkeeps its end of the bargain. That is the essence of free, fair and \nopen trade.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 3011 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introducted Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I have a request that the leader asked \nme to make that has been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the Thursday \nmorning vote relative to the Missouri River provision in the energy and \nwater appropriations bill, the Senate then proceed to a vote on the \nadoption of the motion to proceed on H.R. 4444, notwithstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the energy and water appropriations bill, all first-degree \namendments must be filed at the desk by 6:30 p.m. this evening, with \nthe exception of up to five amendments each to be filed by Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico and Senator Reid of Nevada, and those be filed \nno later than 7:30 p.m. tonight, and that all first-degree amendments \nbe subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished \nSenator from the State of Missouri, Mr. Bond. I say to the Senate, \nsince the amendment that we are now going to take up for up to 3 hours \nthis evening has to do with the upper and lower Missouri River debate, \nI am not going to manage any of that. I am going to let the management \nbe in the hands of Senator Kit Bond, if he does not mind, in my stead. \nI join him in his effort. He knows that. But nonetheless, it is his \nissue. I prefer to have him managing it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4081\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the section relating to revision of the Missouri \n                   River Master Water Control Manual)\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 6 through 13.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours of debate on this amendment.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, this issue really has a very fundamental premise. The \nissue is: Can we use the best information available to us to manage the \nMissouri River, to manage it in a way that recognizes the sensitive \nbalance that exists today--environmentally, industrially, \nagriculturally, recreationally? Can we take the best information we \nhave available to us and put together the best management plan \nrecognizing that balance? That is the essence of the question before \nus.\n  My distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, has said: I \ndon't want the Corps of Engineers to alter the manual that has been \nused now for more than 40 years. His view is that the manual that was \nwritten in the 1950s and adopted in approximately 1960 ought to be the \nmanual that we use from here on out, and he wants to stop in its tracks \nany effort to consider whether or not the Missouri River management \nreflects today that sensitive balance.\n  I think it is wrong to say to the Corps of Engineers--to say to any \nFederal agency--we don't want you to look at the facts. We don't want \nyou to look at the information. We don't want you to take into account \nthat delicate balance. We want you to blindly follow whatever decisions \nyou made in 1960--I might add, before even all the dams on the Missouri \nRiver were built--and we want you to follow that verbatim.\n  We can't afford to do that. The decisions that we make on the \nMissouri affect the decisions we make on the Mississippi and on \nvirtually every other river in this country. For us to freeze in place \nwhatever decisions may have been made decades ago, and say it must not \nchange, is putting our head in the sand and, I must say, endangering \nthe health and the very essence of the river for years, if not decades, \nto come.\n  It was in 1804 that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on \ntheir Corps of Discovery expedition to explore the Missouri River and \nsearch for a passage to the Pacific Ocean.\n  Stephen Ambrose wrote an extraordinary book, ``Undaunted Courage,'' \nthat I just reread over the summer. I must say, I do not know that \nthere is a better book about what they found and the splendor that they \ndiscovered having traversed the entire Missouri River.\n  Along this expedition, Lewis and Clark encountered a wild river, \nteeming with fish and wildlife, that rose every spring to carry the \nsnowmelt from the Rocky Mountains and shrank back in the summer as part \nof the ancient and natural flow cycle. That is what the river did; that \nis what most rivers do.\n  Since that historic trip, we have constructed six major dams and we \nhave forever changed the flow and the character of that river. The last \nearthen dam was completed during the administration of John F. Kennedy. \nTo manage the dams, the Corps produced, in 1960, as I noted a moment \nago, a management plan, that we call the master manual. That manual \ncaters primarily\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nto barge traffic on the Missouri River at the expense, virtually, of \neverything else, at the expense of fish and wildlife, at the expense of \nagriculture, at the expense of recreation, at the expense of ecological \nconsiderations, at the expense of the environment, at the expense of \npeople virtually north of the State of Missouri.\n  What is amazing to me is that we do this with the recognition that \nthe barge industry today is minuscule, valued at $7 million--that is \nmillion with an ``m''--and it transports less than 1 percent of all \nagricultural goods transported in the upper Midwest. Talk about the \ntail wagging the dog. This is the tip of the tail wagging the tail and \nthe dog. The legs, the head, you name it, it is all wagging because of \nthe tip of the tail.\n  These charts reflect the current circumstances on the river. This is \nthe barge traffic that was first projected. They thought, when they \nwrote the master manual, that about 12 million tons of traffic would be \ncarried by barge on the river on an annual basis. That was the estimate \nwhen the manual was written in 1960. I was about 10 years old, I \nsuppose, when that manual was written. The Corps, of course, did the \nbest they could projecting what they thought would be the level of \ntraffic, 12 million tons. But as oftentimes is the case, they made a \nmistake. It wasn't 12 million tons. By 1977, it was only 3 million \ntons. And guess what. Current traffic is not 12, it is not 3, it is \n1.5. That is all the traffic there is, 1.5 million tons, representing \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of all agricultural traffic.\n  What is really amazing--as I said a moment ago, is that this is a \nclassic example of the tip of the tail wagging the rest of the tail and \nall of the dog. Look who has sacrificed. Navigation provides roughly $7 \nmillion in benefits annually, compared to $85 million in recreational \nbenefits. It compares to $415 million in flood control, $542 million in \nwater supply projects and priorities of all kinds, and $677 million, \ntwo-thirds of $1 trillion, in hydropower. Yet we have written a manual, \nincredibly, that says we are going to let this minuscule $7 million \nindustry dictate what is best for the 85, the 415, the 542, and the \n$677 million. Figure that out. Who in his right mind would say that \nsomehow we ought to let that minuscule amount dictate what is best. \nForget the ecological and environmental factors for a moment.\n  I go back to my original point. Barge traffic today is three-tenths \nof 1 percent. If I had not magnified this slice, you couldn't even find \nit in this pie. Roughly 99.7 percent of all agriculture produced in the \nUpper Midwest doesn't go by barge. How does it go? It goes the way the \nrest of the country. It goes by rail and by truck. So why would we \nthreaten to throw even more out of kilter the ecological priorities of \nthe river by putting barge traffic first? Why would we endanger \nhydropower, water supply, flood control, and recreation? I cannot \nanswer that question.\n  But that is not even the question we are facing tonight. There are \nthose on the other side who have said: We don't care what factors are \nout there. We don't care what percentage is barge traffic. We will not \neven let the Corps consider, even think about the possibility of \nchanging the master manual, regardless of the facts. Don't confuse us \nwith the facts. We are going to protect the barge industry, and it does \nnot matter what the costs are.\n  We will have to face extraordinarily problematic ramifications of \nthis provision for all of these other very critical priorities, \nincluding the ecology of the river. Three endangered species are headed \ntowards extinction: the piping plover, the least interior tern, and the \npallid sturgeon. Two fish species are candidates for listing on the \nendangered species list. But that isn't the only thing this fight is \nabout. What this fight is all about is whether or not we can recognize \nthe delicate balance that exists today.\n  This fight is not about endangered species. This fight is about an \nendangered river. This fight is about whether or not the health of the \nMissouri can be secured. That is what this fight is about. This fight \nis about restoring balance to management of the river. We will never go \nback to the days of Lewis and Clark, the pre-dam period. That will \nnever happen. But there are things we can do through good management \nthat will give us the opportunity to make the river as vibrant as it \ncan be. But we cannot do it if the current provision in this bill stays \nintact and becomes law.\n  Recognizing that, the question is whether or not we will let the \nCorps be the Corps, whether or not we will allow the Corps to go \nthrough the legal process involved in evaluating what is best for the \nriver and change the management plan to reflect a more fair balance.\n  That is all we are asking. Let us come up with a plan that allows us \nin the most complete way to analyze what is happening to the river, \nwhat is best for the river, what can be done in Montana and the Dakotas \nand Iowa and Missouri and all the way up and down the Missouri River to \nensure that the health and vitality of that river can be sustained and \neven improved upon. That is what the Corps is trying to do.\n  What the Corps is simply trying to do is to say, look, we can do a \nbetter job than we did in the 1950s and 1960s in managing this river. \nWe can reflect the new balance, and the recognition must be made that \nthings have changed dramatically since the fifties and sixties. We need \nto reflect that change in the master manual itself.\n  Here is the process; the process is pretty simple. A preliminary \ndraft of the EIS, environmental impact statement, was completed all the \nway back in 1998. Following that, there was a coordination and public \ncomment period that lasted through January of 1999. That period allowed \ntribal and public officials to respond to the preliminary revised draft \nof the environmental statement. Then we went on to the fish and \nwildlife consultation and biological opinion phase, which some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to stop just recently. \nThey wanted to kill that, to move it so we would not have the \nopportunity to consider very carefully what the scientists and \nbiological experts have said about the quality of life on the Missouri \ntoday. They wanted to kill it.\n  Thanks to the Director of the Corps, Joe Westphal, and others, we are \nnow in a position to at least hear what the scientists have had to say, \nand we will have that report by November 1. Following that, there will \nbe a revised draft of the environmental impact statement. They will \ntake into account all of the comments made by those who are concerned \non all sides. They will take into account this coordination and what \ncomments public officials have made, in particular. They will then take \ninto account fish and wildlife and biological opinions.\n  When all of that has been gathered, we will then revise the draft and \nmake available to the public a draft for additional comment for 6 \nmonths. We then see the final environmental impact statement after a 6-\nmonth tribal and public comment period. Washington will then review all \nof those comments. A record of decision will be made and the revise of \nthe master manual will then be implemented. Those are all the steps.\n  This is like a court of law. This is like any other legal process. \nThere are a number of very important steps that we apply in all cases--\nin all cases where difficult decisions involving critical public policy \nhave to be made. We make these steps for a reason. We want public \ncomment. We want scientific input, the best decisions from governmental \nleaders at all levels. We want to do that with the full involvement in \na democracy of everyone who cares and everyone who has some \nresponsibility.\n  But here is what happens. Under the provision currently in the bill, \nthere is a big red stop sign on this process. It says: You are not \ngoing to do any of this. We are going to stop you in your tracks. We \nare not going to let you go through that process. We are not going to \nallow public comment and the array of other opportunities for public \ninvolvement. We are not going to have that process. It is over. That is \nwhat this amendment says; that is what the provision in the bill says.\n  So I have to say it is extraordinarily damaging to the river to have \nthis attitude. It is such an important issue involving so many \npriorities--environmental, ecological, industrial, recreational, \nagricultural--because it is endangering the interests of our country in \nsuch a profound way on this river. This administration has said, \nwithout equivocation, it will be vetoed if this provision is still in \nthe bill. That is how strongly the administration\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\nfeels about it. It will be vetoed. So we can play this game as long as \nour colleagues wish to do so. But let's make one thing clear. This will \nnot become law. This will not become law because it is just too \nimportant.\n  I don't fully appreciate the reasons my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are opposed to even allowing the process to go forward, \ngiven what I have said is this multistep opportunity for careful \nconsideration of all the options. But it goes down to, as I said in the \nbeginning, a need on the part of some to protect this minuscule barge \nindustry regardless of all of its ramifications on everything and \neverybody else.\n\n  But as I understand it, there are those on the other side who are \nopposed because they understand that what has happened is that there \nhas been some effort to find this new balance. This new balance is a \nrecognition of all of the different factors that need to be calculated, \nin part, through the Fish and Wildlife Service and, in part, through \nthe Corps of Engineers and, in part, through States' direct \ninvolvement.\n  What has been proposed is that the Corps slightly revise its master \nmanual to increase spring flows, known as a ``spring rise,'' once every \n3 years--not every year, but once every 3 years they would increase the \nspring rise in an effort to attempt to bring back a natural flow, a \nnatural rejuvenation of the river as we have understood it prior to the \ntime the dams were built. They would reduce summer flows, known as a \n``split season,'' every year.\n  The spring rise and the split season roughly mimic the natural flow \nof the river, which increase in the spring due to snowmelt and sharply \ndecline in the summer, beginning around July 1. It is as Lewis and \nClark found it. We can't go back to Lewis and Clark. Nobody is \nsuggesting that. What we are attempting to do, however, is to show once \nagain that there is this balance, this need to recognize that if we are \ngoing to keep the river healthy, we have to allow it to do what it once \ndid, prior to the time the dams were built. This is the flow pattern \nunder which native species developed, which is absolutely critical to \ntheir very survival--not just the three endangered species, but all \nspecies on the river.\n  The spring rise is needed to scour sandbars clean of vegetation so \nthey can be used by endangered birds for nesting habitat.\n  The spring rise also signals native fish species that it is time to \nspawn. This is the green light. They see these spring rises, and that \ntriggers to the species that they can spawn. When they don't have that \nspring rise, the whole natural cycle is put out of whack. That is what \nhas been happening year after year and decade after decade.\n  The low summer flows, or split season, exposes the sandbars during \nthe critical nesting time, so that the birds have sufficient room to \nnest and so that the nests don't get flooded. To prevent any potential \ndownstream flooding, the Corps, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others, \nhave already thought about addressing the concern of some downstream \nwho are understandably concerned about flooding. They would simply \neliminate this plan from implementation during the 10 percent highest \nflow years--eliminate it; it would not happen. Changes would not be \nimplemented during the 25 percent lowest flow ``drought'' years.\n  So this plan would not harm Mississippi River navigation. We have \nalready conceded that. This is the balance. This is an effort to try to \nfind middle ground. We are going to say we will lop off the top 10 \npercent and the top 25 percent; we will deal with those normal years in \nthe middle. Once consultation between the Corps and Fish and Wildlife \nService is completed, the Corps then still will take into account other \nsuggestions made during the public comment period.\n  There are so many beneficiaries of this plan. Naturally, the river \nitself is the biggest beneficiary.\n  The river itself--not species on the river, not those living along \nthe river, not the States upstream, but the river--will be the prime \nbeneficiary of this effort. Why? For the reasons I have just stated--\nbecause we want to find a way to bring balance back into the \nmanagement. We want to find middle ground in an effort to recognize all \nuses on the river.\n  Downstream farmers will benefit from better drainage from fields \nduring the summertime. That is a given. The public will have greater \nopportunities to recreate up and down the river. Even the Mississippi \nbarge industry will benefit from the changes that are being called on \nfor the Missouri River.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk briefly about each of those \nbenefits.\n  First, with regard to the river itself, the combination of the spring \nrise and flood season will help restore the health of the river and \nrecover from the dangerous imbalance that we have with regard to all \nspecies on the river today.\n  According to the Fish and Wildlife Service's draft opinion and the \nCorps of Engineers' revised draft environmental impact statement of \n1998, high spring flows will signal native fish species to spawn, flush \ndetrital food into the river, inundate side channels for young fish \nhabitat, and build up the sandbars in the river channel for the tern \nand plover nesting habitat, and provide a greater area for the \nendangered birds to nest, as well as for all birds.\n  The 600-page draft of the Fish and Wildlife Service opinion is based \non hundreds of published peer review studies. The opinion itself was a \npeer review by a panel of experts who supported all of those \nconclusions.\n  The fact is that whether or not we give the Missouri River the chance \nto survive, to flourish, to be healthy again depends in large measure \non whether or not we as Senators will allow the Corps, the Fish and \nWildlife Service, and all affected governmental authorities to \nrecognize the importance of proper balance; to recognize that what we \ndecided to do in 1960 does not now apply and should not be used to \nmanage the river in the next century; to recognize that if we are going \nto take all of the economic and environmental concerns and put them in \nproper balance, we have to revise the manual. To say that the Corps \nwill be prohibited from doing so is just bad, bad policy.\n  We recognize that maybe the barge industry on the Missouri--not the \nMississippi barge industry--will be hurt by this. But we recognize that \nthis minuscule three-tenths of 1 percent should not dictate all of the \nother uses of this river, or any river. We shouldn't let the tip of the \ntail wag the tail and the dog. But that is what is happening today. \nThat is what this legislation would do. That is why it is so important \nthat we strike it when we have the vote. That is why I feel so strongly \nabout this issue.\n  There is one other factor as we look at the barge industry itself \nthat is perplexing. Barge benefits on the river economically are about \n$7 million. The subsidies to the barge industry last year exceeded the \ntotal benefits of the industry itself. There is $8 million in subsidies \nto the barge industry even recognizing that the industry generated $7 \nmillion in benefits. Not only do we have managerial concerns, not only \ndo we have concerns reflecting the life and health of one of the most \nimportant rivers in the United States of America, we ought to have \ntaxpayer concerns. Why in Heaven's name are we subsidizing a $7 million \nbarge industry with an $8 million subsidy? That one I don't understand. \nBut that is why we are having this debate.\n  I am very appreciative of the leadership shown by the senior Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Baucus, who has been the preeminent environmentalist \nand environmental leader, as ranking member of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. I am grateful for his presence on the \nfloor, as well as my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, who \nhas been an extraordinary advocate of the effort that we have made now \nfor several months to ensure that the Missouri River has the future \nthat it deserves.\n  I yield the floor. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I certainly concur with my friend from South \nDakota on the great words he said about Stephen Ambrose's book, \n``Undaunted Courage.'' I know the occupant of the chair read it. A lot \nof the guys who started out in my State wound up in the State of \nOregon. It is truly a masterful piece of work and a wonderful piece of \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\n  I had a great, great, great, great-grandfather who was one of the \nfellows who poled the barges up the river. He wasn't sufficiently \noutstanding to get his name in the book. But it is quite an honor to \nhave somebody who went up the river who was with Lewis and Clark. So I \nhave been a great devotee of the river and have followed it a good bit.\n  I was really interested to hear the Senator from South Dakota talk \nabout what we were trying to do to hurt the poor old river. The \nminority leader claims the provision that he seeks to strike would stop \nany changes in the Missouri River manual and would keep the plans just \nas they have been for 50 years.\n  So I thought to myself: Gee, that wasn't the section that I put in. \nMaybe they changed it somehow in the writing of it. So I went back and \nread section 103. This is the provision that would be stricken. It \nsays:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual when it \n     has been made known to the Federal entity or official to \n     which the funds are made available that such revision \n     provides for an increase in the springtime water release \n     program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period \n     in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River \n     below the Gavins Point Dam.\n\n  What it says is that you can't implement a plan to increase flooding \nduring spring flood season on the Missouri River during the course of \n2001.\n  Contrary to what you have just heard, any other aspect of the process \nto review and amend the operation of the Missouri River, to change the \nMissouri River manual, to consider the opinions, to discuss, to debate, \nto continue the vitally important research that is going on now on the \nriver and how we can improve its habitat will continue.\n  I have been proud to sponsor the Mississippi and Missouri River \nHabitat Improvement Program in which we funded the Corps of Engineers \nto make changes to improve the river and to bring it back more to its \nnatural state. It is not going to be all the way back to its natural \nstate but to provide conservation opportunities, to provide spawning \nhabitats, nesting habitats for birds, the kind of habitat we want to \nencourage the biological diversity on the river.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey has an environmental research arm that is \nstudying the river to find out what really works. Do you know \nsomething. That work is going on. Those studies are being pursued. They \nhave some interesting information that they don't have a conclusion on \nyet. It is not the spring rise that would improve the habitat. Perhaps \nit is the gravel bars on side channels. That looks promising. This work \ncan continue; so can all of the work under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act to develop an environmental impact statement. Any other \nchange to the manual can continue. Analysis and public comment can \ncontinue.\n  The provision is clear. It tells the U.S. Government that the ``risky \nscheme'' of increasing the height of the river in the flood-prone \nspring months is one option and the only option that cannot be \nimplemented during the coming year because it is too dangerous.\n  This is the fifth time that we have put forward this prohibition. It \nhas been signed into law four times previously by this President.\n  Why is it so important this year? Because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService decided to short circuit the process, to jump over all of the \nproceedings, the hearings, the studies, that the Corps of Engineers has \ncarried out.\n  They issued what I guess is called in an authoritarian, Communist \ngovernment, a diktat, a letter, on July 12 to the Corps of Engineers: \nYou will change the manual to have a spring rise, the spring surge.\n  They were the ones who wanted to skip over the process. They were the \nones dictating to the Corps--despite the public comment, despite all \nthe other information--they should implement that.\n  We have spring rises on the Missouri River. This chart shows 1999. In \nMarch and April the river rises. These are the rises at different \nstages of the river. We have spring rises. We already do because there \nare many tributaries coming in. Perhaps we don't have quite the floods \nin some years that we did because there have been dams built to reduce \nthe danger of flooding and to reduce somewhat the loss of life and the \ndamage to property and communities.\n  We already have a spring rise because of tributaries, including the \nPlatte and the Kansas, the Tarkio, the Blue, the Gasgonade, and others. \nThat spring rise results in frequent flooding. And the more water \nreleased at Gavins Point, the greater the flood risk.\n  Since when should this deliberative body, the U.S. Congress, say we \nshould encourage a Federal agency to take a premeditated action to \nincrease flood risk when there is no scientific evidence that it will \nhave the benefit for endangered species that is proposed.\n  This is untenable for farmers living along the river. One-third of \nthe commodities of Missouri are grown in the floodplains of the \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers. It is untenable for mayors who want \ntheir communities and their critical infrastructure protected. It is \nimperative for the families who do not want to lose their family \nmembers in floods. Some who don't live in areas of flood may not know \nbut floods do take lives. Floods are deadly. Floods are devastating. I \nhave witnessed the aftermath of too many floods. I have seen the \nheartbreak and devastation, not just the loss of homes. I have seen \nfamilies who have lost a parent, lost a child, in floods.\n  Agricultural groups, flood control groups, have supported our \nposition very strongly. It is not a complicated issue. It is certainly \nnot a partisan issue. The Governor of Missouri is a Democrat. The \nDemocratic mayors of St. Louis and Kansas City support this provision. \nThe Southern Governors Association supports this provision because of \nthe impact of the Missouri River on the Mississippi River and its lower \ntributaries.\n  Make no mistake about it, the impact of this spring flood is serious \non the traffic on the Mississippi River.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters \nregarding this issue.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Southern Governors' \n     Association, I am writing to express concerns about proposed \n     plan by the Fish and Wildlife Service for a springtime rise \n     of 17,500 cubic feet per second in the Missouri River at \n     Gavins Point Dam. This plan has the potential to harm \n     citizens and agricultural activities along the lower portion \n     of the Missouri River and urge your support for restricting \n     this spring rise proposal.\n       If the current plan is implemented and these states incur \n     significantly heavy rains during the rise, there is a real \n     risk that farms and communities along the lower Missouri \n     River will suffer serious flooding. In addition, a spring \n     rise has a negative effect on agriculture land. Sustaining \n     high river flow rates over several consecutive weeks will \n     exacerbate the problems of wetness and poor drainage \n     historically experienced by farmers along the river, limiting \n     the productivity and accessibility of floodplain crop lands.\n       Finally, the proposal for a spring rise also brings harm to \n     Mississippi River states and users of the nation's inland \n     waterway system. Any spring rise in April or May puts \n     additional water in the Mississippi River when it is normally \n     high and does not need the extra water. This spends water out \n     of a limited water budget in the Missouri River Basin and \n     ends up subtracting water out of the Mississippi during the \n     summer or fall when the water is needed for river commerce.\n       We appreciate your serious attention to these concerns and \n     urge your support for a restriction on the spring rise \n     proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike Huckabee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                            State of Missouri,\n\n                                  Jefferson City, August 17, 2000.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing regarding recent \n     developments surrounding efforts to revise the Missouri River \n     Master Manual. Specifically, I am concerned about proposed \n     plans by the Fish and Wildlife Service outlined in letters to \n     the Corps of Engineers dated March 28, 2000 and July 12, \n     2000. The July 12 letter directs the Corps of Engineers to \n     implement major changes in operations affecting both the \n     Missouri and Mississippi Rivers while circumventing the \n     public review processes required by law.\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\n       I respectfully request your immediate assistance in \n     directing the Service to reevaluate its plan and to commit to \n     a more open process that conforms to the public involvement \n     requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. \n     Further, there are legislative efforts underway to prohibit \n     the Service from initiating its plan at this time, and I \n     request your support of those efforts.\n       Absent a change in the Service's plan, it is likely that \n     efforts to restore endangered species along the river will be \n     damaged, an increase in the risk of flooding river \n     communities and agricultural land will occur, and states \n     along the river will suffer serious economic damage to their \n     river-based transportation and agricultural industries.\n       There are numerous problems with the plan as proposed by \n     the Service that may actually harm endangered species rather \n     than help them recover. The plan calls for a significant drop \n     in water flow during the summer. The months of June and July \n     are, in fact, the two highest flow months under natural pre-\n     dam conditions primarily because of mountain snow melt \n     combined with downstream rainfall. Unfortunately, the \n     mistiming of the Service's plan will allow predators to reach \n     river islands on which endangered terns and plovers nest \n     giving predators access to the young still in the nests. \n     Predation is discussed in the species recovery plans as one \n     of the significant impediments to restoration of healthy tern \n     and plover populations.\n       In addition, model runs of the Fish and Wildlife Service's \n     proposal indicate substantially greater water storage behind \n     the Missouri River dams as compared with current operations. \n     This increased water storage would raise average reservoir \n     levels so that approximately 10 miles of free-flowing river \n     would be sacrificed to the artificial lakes. If solving the \n     Missouri River endangered species problems is the objective, \n     it would seem reasonable for the Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     make proposals that do not increase the dominance of \n     reservoirs over free-flowing rivers.\n       The spring rise will also increase our susceptibility to \n     flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. An \n     analysis of the Missouri River flooding that occurred during \n     the spring of 1995 shows that if the spring rise proposed by \n     the Service had been in effect, the level of flooding would \n     have been worse. The Corps could not have recalled water \n     already released hundreds of miles upstream, as the water's \n     travel time from Gavins Point to St. Charles, Missouri is 10 \n     days. If the proposed plan is implemented and heavy rains \n     occur during the spring rise, there is a real risk that farms \n     and communities along the lower Missouri River will suffer \n     increased flooding.\n       The Service's plan for a spring rise also will damage prime \n     agricultural land because it will limit the productivity and \n     accessibility of floodplain croplands. If implemented, the \n     Service's plan will result in the Missouri River being held \n     four feet higher for several consecutive weeks along \n     southwestern Iowa and northwestern Missouri. Our agricultural \n     community is extremely concerned that increased soil \n     saturation and poor drainage will compromise the productivity \n     of their farms. In addition, the plan will damage the ability \n     for agricultural producers and commercial employers to \n     utilize the river to move their products to markets. \n     Consequently, it will make the price of these products \n     increase and damage the ability of our farmers and \n     manufacturers to compete in the world economy.\n       Mr. President, it is vitally important to the residents of \n     the State of Missouri as well as the entire Midwest that the \n     Service's plan be reevaluated. Again, I would appreciate your \n     assistance in this very important matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Mel Carnahan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Office of the Mayor,\n\n\n                                        City of St. Louis, MO,\n\n                                                  August 30, 2000.\n     Re: H.R. 4733, the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The City of St. Louis is a central \n     transportation hub for the Midwest that includes the second \n     largest inland port in the nation. Water transportation on \n     the Mississippi River has been central to St. Louis' \n     development and today is integral to our economic structure. \n     All of this stands to be threatened by the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service proposal to implement a policy that increases the \n     risk of flooding on our principal inland waterways.\n       The movement of more than 100 million tons of cargo through \n     the Port of St. Louis could be placed in jeopardy during low \n     water years if flows from the Mississippi River are \n     restricted during the summer and fall months. Conversely, the \n     St. Louis region has struggled periodic flooding during the \n     spring that would be devastating without the management of \n     the Mississippi River for flood control purposes.\n       I urge you to press forward with your provision to H.R. \n     4733, the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, that would \n     restrict implementation of a ``spring rise'' in the spring \n     and a ``split navigation season'' in the summer and fall as \n     requested by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Before any \n     provision or policy reversing the multiple uses of the rivers \n     can be supported, we must fully understand the economic and \n     environmental implications to the citizens of St. Louis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Clarence Harmon,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, July 25, 2000.\n     Subject: Spring Rise on Missouri River: Sec. 103--Energy & \n       Water Appropriations Bill.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The City of Kansas City, Missouri wishes \n     to express its concern over consideration being given to a \n     spring rise along the Missouri River. The increase in release \n     rate being proposed for Gavins Point by the Fish & Wildlife \n     Service would raise the water service levels along the lower \n     Missouri River by approximately two feet. As you know, Kansas \n     City is susceptible to flooding from the Missouri River and \n     in 1993 several of the levees protecting our city came within \n     inches of overtopping. Any allowed increase in flows will \n     subject us to a worsened flooding condition.\n       As we proceed with the study of seven levees along the \n     Missouri and Kansas Rivers, in cooperation with the Corps of \n     Engineers and several other local sponsors, to investigate \n     changes that may be needed and justified to enhance flood \n     protection from the Missouri River it seems inappropriate at \n     best to be considering changes that will serve to decrease \n     our level of protection. Additionally, the spring rise will \n     necessitate a split navigation season, the impacts of which \n     would be potentially disastrous to the barge industry along \n     the lower Missouri River and have far reaching impacts to the \n     economy in our region.\n       We strongly urge that Section 103 preventing the study and \n     implementation of a spring rise along the Missouri River be \n     included in the upcoming Energy & Water Appropriations Bill. \n     Thank you for your consideration of this matter and for your \n     continued support in helping to reduce flooding throughout \n     the City of Kansas City, Missouri.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kay Barnes,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Every waterway group and every flood control group that I \nhave spoken to that is knowledgeable about the river supports the \nprovision.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby 92 organizations supporting my provision.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  National Waterways Alliance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On September 5, 2000, the Senate is \n     scheduled to begin consideration of H.R. 4733, the Energy and \n     Water Development Appropriations Bill for FY 2001. We are \n     writing to express our strong opposition to any efforts to \n     strike Section 103, which prohibits implementation of a \n     ``spring rise'' on a portion of the inland navigation system.\n       A recent directive issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service to implement a ``spring rise'' immediately on the \n     Missouri River is a reversal of water resource policy without \n     appropriate public review, independent scientific validation, \n     Congressional debate or endorsement. For decades, every \n     Congress and Administration has endorsed a policy of water \n     resource development that was designed to protect communities \n     against natural disasters and serve efficient and \n     environmentally friendly river transportation, reliable low-\n     cost hydropower and a burgeoning recreation industry.\n       The ``spring rise'' demanded by the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service is based on the premise that we should ``replicate \n     the natural hydrograph'' that was responsible for devastating \n     and deadly floods as well as summertime droughts and even \n     ``dust bowls.'' For decades, we have worked to mitigate the \n     negative implications of the ``natural hydrograph'' with \n     multiple-purpose water resources management programs, \n     including reservoirs storing excess flood and snow-melt \n     waters in the spring and releasing those waters in low-flow \n     periods. These efforts have protected communities from \n     floods, enabled the safe and efficient movement of a large \n     percentage of the Nation's intercity freight by a mode that \n     results in cleaner air, safer streets, and a higher quality \n     of life and also provided hundreds of thousands of family-\n     wage jobs in interior regions.\n       Retaining Section 103 will allow National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA) compliance and provide time for Congress to \n     adequately consider whether reversing proven water resources \n     policy makes sense and whether a ``spring rise'' is \n     scientifically supported. We urge you to keep the existing \n     language in H.R. 4733 and oppose any efforts to strike or \n     unnecessarily amend it.\n           Sincerely,\n       Tal Simpkins, Executive Director, AFL-CIO Maritime \n     Committee, Washington, D.C.\n       Floyd D.

These organizations represent labor, agriculture, port \nfacilities, flood control districts, and others. They are located in \nareas as distant as the States of Washington, Louisiana, Minnesota, and \nPennsylvania.\n  Since this letter was signed, additional groups have asked to join \nwith us in our position in support of section 103. They include the \nMinnesota Association of Cooperatives, the St. Louis Building and \nConstruction Trades Council, the Minnesota Farm Bureau, the Minnesota \nSoybean Growers Association, and the Minnesota Corn Growers \nAssociation.\n  In Missouri, our Department of Natural Resources supports section \n103. They oppose raising the spring river height, and they are just as \nknowledgeable and just as dedicated as the so-called experts at the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who want to jump over\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\nthe process and impose their particular risky scheme on our State and \nall the downstream States.\n  I had a very enlightening week traveling from the northwest corner of \nmy State, down the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers, talking with \nreal people, knowledgeable people, scientists, and experts about this \nproposal. I was joined and supported by members of the Governor's \nstaff. I was joined by the director of our department of natural \nresources. I was joined by farmers and mayors and chambers of commerce \nofficials, economists and flood control advocates, and other members of \nour resource agencies. I was joined by representatives of our \nindependent department of conservation--one of the finest departments \nof conservation in the Nation, one that is looked to as a model, and \none that is engaged in ongoing work to preserve the pallid sturgeon and \nto work with us on reasonable, common sense, scientifically proven ways \nto assure that we keep the pallid sturgeon.\n  From all of these people I heard firsthand how dangerous the Fish and \nWildlife Service plan is and how unnecessary it is. I heard from people \nwho ship the goods on the river now and from people who want to ship on \nthe river in the future but who are withholding investment in river \nfacilities until the uncertainty of the Fish and Wildlife Service \nproposal is resolved. I have heard from mayors who are worried about \nthe flood risk in the spring. Unless you have been in one of those \ncommunities or one of our large cities where a flood has hit, you do \nnot appreciate how devastating a flood is.\n  I have heard from power companies worried about not having adequate \nwater for cooling in the summer. I have heard from farmers who have \nbeen flooded and know firsthand that more water in the spring, despite \nsuggestions to the contrary, means more risk of flood.\n  The farmers who live along the river know that even if it doesn't \nflood, a higher river level in the spring means more seepage under the \nlevees and wetter fields that you cannot plow and you cannot plant.\n  We are here tonight discussing section 103 because despite the views \nof the Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, the downstream \nStates, the agricultural groups, and the waterway users, the Fish and \nWildlife Service is determined to have it their way or no way. The Fish \nand Wildlife Service wants to experiment with spring flooding. They \nmust think we have forgotten about the controlled burn in Los Alamos. \nThey want to give us controlled floods on the Missouri River in the \nspring. I say no thanks; we have been there; we have done it; and we \ndon't need the Federal Government making floods worse.\n  This is not a new proposal. It was raised by the Corps of Engineers \nin 1993, and after public hearings in Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, \nQuincy, Memphis, New Orleans, and elsewhere, the administration went \nback to the drawing room to find a consensus with the States. \nApparently, the Fish and Wildlife Service is not interested in a \nconsensus or we would not be here today. They are not interested in the \ndangers of increased flood risk or we would not be here today. They are \nnot interested in the public meetings and the viewpoints that were \nexpressed in 1995 or this would have ended then. They want to raise the \nheight of the river in the spring because they think flooding may \nimprove the breeding habitat for the pallid sturgeon.\n  The distinguished minority leader says we ought to be able to act on \nthe best information available. I have asked these people: Where is the \ninformation?\n  When I talked with them last week, our resource agencies, the U.S. \nGeological Survey had not seen any biological opinion. They issued that \ndiktat, that letter of instruction, on July 12. As of last week, the \nState agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey, with expertise in \nenvironmental assessment, a fellow Federal agency, had not seen it.\n  How can we let them go ahead with the scheme when they won't even \nallow us to look at the basis for their proposal? This truly is a risky \nscheme. This is one that we cannot tolerate.\n  Our State Department of Natural Resources disagrees with Fish and \nWildlife. Our State Conservation Department believes the Fish and \nWildlife plan is not necessary. They have presented a plan that does \nnot have spring flooding and no transportation flows in the spring--in \nthe summer and fall. And they believe that plan will do more to help \npreserve the pallid sturgeon, the least tern, and the piping plover, \nthan this risky scheme put forward by Fish and Wildlife.\n  Our State Conservation Department has an alternative species recovery \nplan. They cannot get Fish and Wildlife to look at it. Don't you think \nthey would want to look at the various options? Don't you think they \nwould want to consider the evidence before they threaten property and \nlives with spring floods in Missouri?\n  I have a lot of respect for the difficult and important job of Fish \nand Wildlife, but let me say this is not about who cares the most about \nendangered species. The commitment of our Natural Resources Department \nand our Conservation Department to fish and wildlife is not inferior to \nthat of Fish and Wildlife of the U.S. Government. U.S. Fish and \nWildlife does not have a monopoly on dedication and they do not have a \nmonopoly on wisdom. In fact, our Department of Natural Resources has \nsome serious concerns the Fish and Wildlife Service plan may actually \nharm endangered species rather than help them recover. That fear was \nexpressed by our Governor of Missouri, Governor Carnahan, a Democrat, \nin a letter to the President 2 weeks ago. Why? Because normally in the \nsummer the natural hydrograph is for the snowmelt to bring the river \nup. Under this plan, river levels will be going down. That means less \nwater cover. It means burying sandbars where predators might come after \nthe smallest hatch.\n  Fish and Wildlife has a twofold plan. One, it proposes a split season \nwhich will end river transportation on the Missouri and do great harm \nto the river transportation on the Mississippi River. Without water \ntransportation, we are left with a regional railroad monopoly.\n  The minority leader said we initially projected there would be 12 \nmillion tons on the river. That is not true. If you look at the 1952 \nreport and the testimony in 1952 and 1956 when they were developing the \nMissouri River plan, they said 5 million tons. This past year, it was 8 \nmillion tons on the river. As I said earlier, there would be a lot more \nbecause there is investment out there waiting to happen if we know that \nFish and Wildlife is not going to take over the river and get rid of \nall barge traffic.\n  Barge traffic is the most environmentally sound means of transporting \ngrain to the world markets. It is the most efficient. One barge, one \ntow with 25 barges, carries the same amount of grain as 870 individual \nsemitrailer trucks that put out far more pollution. Barge \ntransportation bringing inputs to farmers up the river is much more \nefficient than rail or truck. That lowers the price farmers pay for \ngoods brought in in the spring for Missouri farmers. It lowers them for \nSouth Dakota farmers too; the landed price at Sioux City has an impact \non what farmers pay. If you got rid of river transportation \naltogether--which I think may be the ultimate goal. I don't think the \nFish and Wildlife Service and the people supporting this just want to \nflood out the people downstream in the spring; I think there is a \ngreater objective--getting rid of barge transportation altogether. One \ncan only assume that the railroad industry thinks that having no \ncompetition is a good idea. But I seriously question whether we, as \nSenators, should be supporting consolidation rather than competition.\n\n  The low summer flow proposed by Fish and Wildlife is curious for two \nadditional reasons: One, because it will reduce energy revenues by more \nthan one-third at the dams generating hydropower, particularly during \nhigh usage months in the summer. We are about to debate the necessity \nof a national energy commission to look at how we can meet our growing \nenergy needs, and here we are with a Fish and Wildlife plan to decrease \nclean hydropower generation. We do not have the luxury of letting \nexisting power capacity go to waste. The low summer flow proposed by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service reduces revenues in the high demand \nsummer months by more than one-third.\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\n  Another reason the low flow is curious is that, while the Fish and \nWildlife Service said they want the river to ``mimic its natural \nhydrograph,'' historically the highest flows were following the summer \nsnowmelt upstream, and that is the same time Fish and Wildlife demands \na low flow. They go the opposite way of their stated objective.\n  This risky scheme has not been subject to adequate analysis and \ncomment by scientists, by people who understand, who live along, work \nwith, and study the river. That is why we say it should not be \nimplemented in the coming year. Let the studies, the debates go on. We \nwould like to see sound science. We would like to see the best \ninformation available. Fish and Wildlife has not shown it to us.\n  The fall harvest is approaching. It looks like bumper crops. We have \nshort supplies of storage. As a matter of fact, many elevators, grain \nelevators, started calling my office saying they do not have rail \ncapacity. The railroads cannot get them the cars they need to carry out \nthe fall harvest, and they are going to have to stop taking in grain \nthat comes in. Two years ago, because of railcar shortages and \ndisorganization, grain was piled up on the ground as it was in the \nformer Soviet Union. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes a complete \nreliance on that one mode of transportation.\n  Last night on the floor, Senator Reid spoke candidly about the value \nof our Nation's inland waterway system and noted that:\n\n       To move this additional cargo by alternative means would \n     require an additional 17.6 million trucks on our Nation's \n     highway system or an additional 5.8 million railcars on the \n     nation's rail system. To say what can be handled by our \n     inland water system can be moved by rail or trucks, it simply \n     can't be done.\n\n  I agree with Senator Reid. He is quite right. Fish and Wildlife seeks \nto eliminate water transportation on the Missouri. But Fish and \nWildlife has really thought this through because they have a solution \nfor eliminating the transportation options. They are going to propose, \nthrough this plan, to curtail agriculture production by flooding \nfarmers in the spring with high water. As I said earlier, raising the \nriver levels in the spring keeps farmers out of the field. So, as a \nresult of the Fish and Wildlife spring rise, there will be less \nagricultural production awaiting the transportation that is not \navailable.\n  Doesn't that just gladden your hearts? I mean, the farmers who depend \nfor their living upon raising crops and shipping them economically into \nthe world market--guess what, you are not going to have the \ntransportation. But we will take care of that because we will keep you \nfrom having the production. That is why the farmers of Missouri say, \n``No thanks.''\n\n  Let me speak to a couple of assertions that do not paint a very full \npicture of the importance of the debate. First, there is the assumption \nby some that the Missouri River ends suddenly and does not impact the \nMississippi River. That is convenient, but it is not true. I have seen \nthe confluence with my own eyes. I know that in low-water years, \ndrought years, dry summers, 65 percent of the flow of the Mississippi \nRiver at St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. And to say that the \nMississippi barge traffic would love to have that water cut back is \nabsolutely ludicrous. That is why the southern Governors, noting the \nimportance of the Missouri River flow in the Mississippi, have sent a \nresolution in support of section 103 that the minority leader seeks to \nstrike.\n  Second, there is this notion--we heard it expressed earlier--the \nCorps will never release extra water in the spring if there is a risk \nof flooding. Good intention, of course. Give them full credit for \ntrying. But they could only carry out this intention if they could \npredict the weather perfectly because water released from the South \nDakota dam takes 11 days to arrive in St. Louis. A lot of weather can \nhappen in 11 days.\n  Have any of you watched the weather forecasts for the Midwest this \nsummer? I try to keep some trees alive. I watch it. I turn on the \nweather channel in the morning. It is a lot more informative than some \nof the morning talk shows. My Farmers Almanac said we were going to \nhave heavy rains in mid-June and the end of June. The week before, 5 \ndays before the middle of June--the middle of July, they said this is a \ndrought season; there is not going to be a drop of water; it is going \nto be a dry year. The heavens opened up, and we had 5-, 6-, 8-inch \nrains. A lot of weather can occur in even 3 days.\n  I have a lot of respect for my friend from South Dakota--political \nmiracles we see him perform--but I don't trust him or the Fish and \nWildlife Service to predict the weather 11 days in advance downstream.\n  One mistake is all it takes to result in a Government-imposed flood \nthat brings to mind the controlled burn in Los Alamos. That was not \nsupposed to happen, either. The water is not retrievable when it is \nreleased.\n  Rainfall in the lower basin will swell the river after the release, \nand water from the release will only supplement the flood damage.\n  If the water is at your Adam's apple, the Federal Government will do \nyou the courtesy of raising it to your temple.\n  Third, there is already a spring rise as I have stated. If a spring \nrise is what is needed to recover the species, we ought to have \nsturgeon all over the place because we had bodacious floods in 1993 and \n1995. Those little sturgeons should be popping up all over because we \nhad a spring rise to end all spring rises. It did not happen.\n  Fourth, with respect to water transportation benefits, the Fish and \nWildlife Service and my colleague from South Dakota assume that in the \nabsence of competition, the railroad industry will not raise rates on \nfarmers. Try that out on any shipper. Ask anybody in the Midwest who \nhas been captive of the railroad if they really believe that \ncompetition does not make any difference. That is the assumption which \nunderlies the small $7 million in benefits from river transportation \ncited by the opponents of this transportation.\n  If it sounds as if I am picking on the railroad industry, which would \nbe the biggest beneficiaries, along with farmers and producers in Latin \nAmerica and Australia and Europe, I am not. I have no quarrel with the \nrailroads aiming to maximize their profits. You cannot blame a compass \nfor pointing north. They need to maximize profits.\n  If the Government wants to eliminate their competition, why would \nthey interfere? Every Senator knows, or should know if they studied \neconomics, that in the absence of competition, prices will rise. We see \nprices rise at the end of the navigation season. On the Mississippi, we \nsee prices rise when locks are closed for maintenance.\n  There is a Fortune 100 firm on the Mississippi River that has built a \nriver terminal it has never used except when it negotiates with the \nrailroads. It has that river terminal, and the railroads come in and \nsay: We are going to charge you x amount for bringing your product in. \nAnd they say: We will just open up this river terminal, and we will \nbeat your prices down. They come around.\n  According to the Tennessee Valley Authority which did a study on the \nMissouri River, the savings to rail shippers because of competition \ncreated by barge traffic is an estimated $200 million annually. That is \nthe benefit to shippers. Those people get goods coming in and those \nshipping commodities out. That includes benefits worth $56 million to \nshippers in Missouri, $43 million to shippers in Iowa, $36 million to \nshippers in Nebraska, and as the occupant of the Chair will be \ninterested to know, $52 million to shippers in Kansas, and $14 million \nto shippers in South Dakota.\n  In summary, flood control is important, energy production is \nimportant, and having modern and competitive transportation options for \nour farmers and shippers is important.\n  With respect to the species, our resource agencies say the Fish and \nWildlife Service is wrong and their plan is harmful and unnecessary. \nThat is why I included the provision for the fifth year. This provision \ndoes not stop the process as has been alleged by my colleague. It \nsimply says the water management manual cannot be changed to force a \ndangerous spring rise. It is a risky scheme on which we cannot afford \nto gamble. It is a controlled flood that is not controllable.\n\n  Ten years ago, the courts decided to review the river management. \nSeven\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\nyears ago, it proposed a spring rise. It was opposed in public hearings \nfrom Sioux City to Memphis to New Orleans. It was opposed by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. It was opposed by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation. It was opposed by agriculture and other shippers.\n  Twenty-seven Senators in a bipartisan letter to the President opposed \nit. So in 1995, the administration rejected the spring rise and went \nback to the drawing board. The President ordered the Corps to work with \nthe States to find a consensus. Meanwhile, Congress included section \n103 four different times to remind the Fish and Wildlife Service that \ntheir obsession to increase flooding was not acceptable.\n  Last year, seven out of eight States arrived at a consensus that the \nCorps accepted which did not include a spring rise. Then, \nnotwithstanding the public hearings in 1994, the letter to the \nPresident, the legislative provisions, notwithstanding the consensus, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service arrogantly pushes the same old plan to \nraise the river height in the spring.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey told me last week that they do not know \nenough about the river or the pallid sturgeon to know if there is any \nchance the Fish and Wildlife Service's plan will work. They are the \nones who work to define habitat and biological response. They have not \nbeen shown the information from the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  The Missouri department of conservation says they have an alternative \nto recover species which does not do premeditated damage to safety, to \nproperty, and to human lives. The Missouri department of natural \nresources said the Fish and Wildlife Service's plan is flawed and \nunnecessary.\n  The provision permits any experiment the Fish and Wildlife Service \ncan dream up except the one risky scheme of a controlled flood in the \nspring which we cannot tolerate. Members of Congress have every right \nto place commonsense parameters on bureaucratic excursions. That is the \npurpose of this provision.\n  We know there are many other benefits that come from wise management \nof the Missouri River. The spring rise does not help the upstream \nStates. In fact, States such as the Dakotas and Montana will find that \nthey will not have the water they want for recreational purposes if it \nis flushed down the river in the spring. I know the Fish and Wildlife \nService wants to run this river, just as it wants to take over \nmanagement of a lot of other rivers, but the rivers are authorized for \nmultiple uses. That is the way the Corps and the States manage them.\n  Because the proposal to initiate floods is harmful, because there are \nalternatives, I believe section 103 is a prudent and restrained \nsafeguard that should be retained in this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Daschle-Baucus \namendment to strike section 103 from the energy and water \nappropriations bill. One might ask why. The answer is very simple: \nBecause section 103 is an anti-environmental rider that prevents the \nsound management of the Missouri River. It is that simple.\n  I begin by endorsing the points made so well by Senator Daschle. The \nArmy Corps of Engineers is managing the Missouri River today on the \nbasis of a master manual that was written in 1960. Guess what? It has \nnot changed much since then. It is 40 years old. It is like trying to \nrun the Internet based on a plan that was written in the heyday of \nrotary telephones. Conditions are different. Priorities are different.\n  As Senator Daschle explained, the master manual favors some uses of \nthe river, such as barge traffic, that may have made sense in 1960 but \nmakes little sense today. That is a very important point. In effect, a \n40-year-old master manual favors the barge industry, which may have \nmade sense in 1960 but makes virtually no sense today based upon the \nCorps's own economic analysis of the river, and it favors those uses \nover other uses, such as recreation, which are much more important now \nthan they were in 1960.\n  As has been pointed out, the master manual also wastes taxpayers' \ndollars. We are today spending more than $8 million a year in operation \nand maintenance costs to support a $7 million barge industry. That is a \nbad deal for taxpayers. It is a subsidy that does not make sense.\n  In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on all those points. \nThe Senator from South Dakota, the minority leader, has covered that \nground very well. I do not want to repeat them. Instead, I would like \nto make three additional points.\n  First, the anti-environmental rider proposed by the Senator from \nMissouri harms my State of Montana. Second, it prevents the Corps of \nEngineers from complying with the law, from complying with the \nEndangered Species Act. And third, the rider derails a process of \ncarefully revising the master manual, a process that is working.\n  In addition, I want to respond to an important argument made by the \nSenator from Missouri and other proponents of the rider. They argue \nthat the rider is necessary to reduce the risk of floods. I will \naddress that in a later point.\n  First, the impact of the rider on my State of Montana would be \nprofound. The Missouri River flows not only through our State but \nthrough our history, as well as the history of other States.\n  Meriwether Lewis found the source of the Missouri River on August 12, \n1805. It is at Three Forks, MT. It is shown on this map up here to the \nleft, just east of the Continental Divide.\n  From there the river flows north, winding around near Helena, Great \nFalls, past Fort Benton, and then east through the lake created by the \nFort Peck Dam near Glasgow.\n  There is Fort Peck Dam right here on the map. It is one of the major \ndams in the Missouri River system.\n  This is eastern Montana, an agricultural region. As the occupant of \nthe Chair knows, agriculture has been suffering some very hard economic \ntimes for more than a decade with low prices for wheat, low prices for \nbeef, drought. In eastern Montana, as well as in the western Dakotas, \npeople are moving out, looking for jobs, virtually for survival.\n  Fort Peck Lake--that is this lake shown on the map right here--is a \nkey part of our plan in our State to revive our State's economy, at \nleast in that part of the State. It is a center for boating, a center \nfor fishing, and, I might say, all kinds of recreation which is related \nto the lake.\n  Fort Peck is host to several major walleye tournaments each summer. \nThe biggest is called the Governor's Cup, which attracts people from \nall around the State, all around the Nation, and all around the world.\n  I was there last July with one of the major sponsors of it, Diane \nBrant. I might say, she provides the gusto that makes the tournament \nwork. It is incredible watching everybody line up to go out and go \nwalleye fishing. Hundreds of boats went by the review stand, in single \nfile, as walleye anglers set forth to prove their mettle.\n  This tournament brings jobs and excitement to the area. We are \nworking hard to get more done. For example, I am working with Diane and \nlocal community leaders, and others, to establish a warm water fish \nhatchery on the north bank of the river to improve the walleye fishery. \nBut we face a problem. It is a big one. Under the master manual, water \nlevels in the Fort Peck Lake are often drawn down in the summer, \nlargely to support the barge traffic downstream, which is an industry \nthat need not be subsidized near to the degree that it is, and \ncertainly according to the Army Corps of Engineers' information.\n  In fact, there have been times when the lake has been drawn down so \nlow that boat ramps are a mile or more from the water's edge. This is \nwhat this photograph shows. This is a photograph of a boat landing at \nFort Peck Lake. It is called Crooked Creek. It is a mile from the boat \nlanding to the edge of the lake.\n  Why? Because Fort Peck has been drawn down to support a barge \nindustry downstream. Frankly, the industry is dated and does not need \nto be supported near that much at the expense of people upstream, \nupriver, who, frankly, do not have many means of recreation. But the \nmain thing they want to do is to be able to put a boat in the river. \nThey are unable to do so because the boat ramp is over a mile from the \nriver.\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\n  These drawdowns have occurred frequently. The effect is devastating. \nObviously, drawdowns prevent people from boating and fishing. They also \nreduce the numbers of walleyes, sturgeon, and other fish.\n  Let me be specific. Right now the water level at Fort Peck has been \ndrawn down about 10 feet, to increase flows for downstream barge \ntraffic. That is right now. A few weeks ago there was another walleye \ntournament at Crooked Creek, and it could well have been canceled. \nThere was a lot of concern because ramps could not be used. \nFortunately, it did not happen this year, but very often it does.\n  The drawdowns are a big part of the economic raw deal that eastern \nMontana has been getting for years. More balanced management of this \nsystem, which takes better account of upstream economic benefits is \nabsolutely critical to reviving our State's economy in eastern Montana.\n  I am not going to stand here and try to kid anybody. This debate is, \nto a significant degree, about who gets Missouri River water, and when. \nThat is accurate. But that is not all this debate is about. There is an \nawful lot more to it.\n  The section 103 rider prevents the Corps of Engineers from obeying \nthe law of the land. Let me repeat that. The section 103 rider prevents \nthe Army Corps of Engineers from obeying the law. It is that simple. It \nis that specific. It is that accurate. Specifically, it prevents the \nCorps from following the Endangered Species Act.\n  Before I get into the details, let me say a couple things about the \nEndangered Species Act. A lot of people are watching tonight. They may \nwonder: What is all this fuss about? There is less than a month left of \nthe congressional session. Big issues need to be addressed--the budget, \nprescription drug coverage, trade with China. Why in the middle of all \nof this are we debating the fate of two birds and a fish? Good \nquestion. This is why.\n  Any time an issue such as this comes up, it is tempting to think only \nabout the particular species that are being involved--the snail darter, \nthe spotted owl. In this case, the piping plover, the least tern, and \nthe pallid sturgeon. But that is thinking too narrowly.\n  In a much broader sense, the debate is about whether we really are \nserious about protecting endangered species. It is about whether our \ngeneration is going to meet its moral obligation to preserve the web of \nlife that sustains us, and pass it along, as a legacy, to future \ngenerations.\n  If we create a loophole here, there will be pressure to create \nanother loophole somewhere else--and another and another. Before you \nknow it, the law will be shredded into tatters.\n  Don't get me wrong. I am not saying that the Endangered Species Act \nis perfect. It is not--far from it. I have worked for years to come up \nwith reforms that would improve the act, that would increase public \nparticipation, assure that decisions are based on sound science, give a \ngreater role to the States, get more certainty to landowners, bring \npeople together, rather than drive them apart.\n  Over the last decade, I have worked as hard as anyone to reform the \nEndangered Species Act. But those reforms have not passed. They have \nbeen reported out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, but \nthey have been kept off this Senate floor, as good as they are.\n  Nevertheless, in the meantime, the Endangered Species Act today \nremains the law of the land. We have to respect it. It is the law.\n  With that as background, let me turn to specifics and explain how \nSenator Bond's rider prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from managing \nthe Missouri River in a way that is consistent with the law.\n  The river provides habitat for three endangered species: the piping \nplover, the least tern, and the pallid sturgeon. Each of these species \nevolved along a river that had higher flows in the spring and lower \nflows in the summer. That is the natural order of things. Each species \ndepended on a life cycle that depended on this pattern.\n  The tern and the plover need higher flows in the spring. Why? To \ncreate the sandbars they nest on. Higher flows create sandbars. They \nneed lower flows in the summer. Why? To create a buffer that reduces \nthe risk that the nests might be washed away by, say, a storm. That is \nthe natural order of things.\n  The sturgeon needs high flows in the spring for breeding and lower \nflows in the summer for the development of young fish.\n  This is a photo of a piping plover, a female, nesting over three \neggs.\n  But the way I just described the natural order is not the way the \nriver is being managed today. Under the master manual, today's \nmanagement system, the Corps tries to maintain steady water levels \nthrough the spring and summer so there is always enough water to \nsupport the barge traffic downstream. It is this steady, even, but \nunnatural, flow that is driving the three species to the brink of \nextinction.\n  The management plan in the master manual may have made sense in 1960, \nbefore we knew about the threat to these species and before the \nEndangered Species Act was passed--I remind my colleagues, it was \npassed 13 years later, in 1973--but the master manual does not make \nsense today. It may have made sense in 1960, not today. Therefore, when \nthe Corps began to revise the master manual 10 years ago--they have \nbeen at this for a long time--it was the first time the Corps seriously \nconsidered how the dams on the river affect endangered species.\n  There have been a lot of reports, a lot of discussions, a lot of \ngive-and-take, but finally, after a decade of work, the process is \nmoving forward. We are close to revising the master manual, revising it \nso we have a better, more balanced current use of the river, such as \nflood control, navigation, but also more to protect the plover, the \ntern, and the sturgeon.\n  How do we do this? Basically by providing for a moderate rise in \nflows in the spring and reduced flows in July and August. This is the \nso-called spring rise/split season alternative. This alternative has \nstrong support. Fish and game officials from all seven Missouri River \nbasin States say it is the right thing to do.\n  Last summer, they recommended that we--I will not read the whole \nquote, I will begin in the middle--\n\n       . . . provide higher flows during critical spring and early \n     summer periods for native fish spawning and habitat \n     development followed by lower flows during the critical \n     summer period.\n\n  That is the recommendation. They have studied this thing, believe me. \nGuess what? The Fish and Wildlife Service agrees. Its draft biological \nopinion says:\n\n       Spring and summer flow management is an integral component \n     of the measures to avoid jeopardy to listed species . . . \n     This would include higher spring flows and lower summer flows \n     than currently exist.\n\n  They have studied this. Guess what again? The Army Corps of Engineers \nrecognizes the benefits of a spring rise and a split season. The Corps \nhas said that ``periodic high flows are required for terns and plovers \nto remove encroaching vegetation, but during the nesting season, stable \nor declining flows are needed to avoid nesting flight.'' The Corps has \nmade similar observations about the pallid sturgeon. In other words, \nthe fish and game experts from the Missouri River basin States, the \nFish and Wildlife Service, and the Corps of Engineers all recognize the \nimportance of higher flows in the spring and lower flows in the summer.\n  This is where the section 103 rider comes in. Simply put, the rider \nprevents the Corps from revising the master manual to provide for \nhigher water levels in the spring. The Senator from Missouri said so. \nHe said that is what he intends to do. Those are the words of the \nrider: Prevent the master manual from providing higher water levels in \nthe spring. By doing so, the rider contradicts what fish and game \nexperts from the basin States and Federal agencies involved all \nrecognize is necessary to provide more protection for the three \nendangered species and comply with the law.\n  Again, the debate is not just about the allocation of water between \nupstream and downstream States. The debate is also fundamentally about \nwhether in one fell swoop we tell the Corps of Engineers to ignore the \nlaw; ignore the Endangered Species Act regarding the management of one \nof the country's largest rivers. The answer, of course, is obvious. The \nCorps should obey the law, just like everyone else.\n  Forget about the species for a minute, think about basic fairness. We\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\nrequire private landowners to comply with the Endangered Species Act, \nso why shouldn't we also require the Federal Government to do so. They \nshouldn't get a free pass, especially when the Federal Government is \nthe main cause of the problem. The Federal Government should not get a \nfree pass. The Federal Government--in this case, the Army Corps of \nEngineers-- should be held to the same standard as everybody else, and \nthe Corps agrees that it should be held to that same standard.\n\n  That brings me to a related point; that is, government by litigation. \nStop and think about this for a moment. If we think about it, we \nprobably all know what will happen down the road if this rider becomes \nlaw. What is going to happen? The Fish and Wildlife Service will issue \nits final biological opinion. Like the draft, it probably will \nrecommend higher flows in the spring, lower flows in the summer. \nNormally, the Corps would then revise the master manual. But because of \nthe rider, the Corps cannot make the revisions necessary to comply with \nthe Endangered Species Act. The rider says: Army Corps of Engineers, \nyou cannot follow the law.\n  So what is going to happen? At that point there is certain to be a \nlawsuit brought by environmental groups challenging the Corps' failure \nto obey the law. Guess what? The environmental groups are likely to \nwin. Why? Because the master manual will effectively ignore the needs \nof the species and therefore violate the Endangered Species Act.\n  It is not just my opinion that a master manual without a spring rise \nand a split season would ignore the needs of the endangered species. \nThis is the unanimous opinion of the experts who reviewed the \nbiological opinion. This unanimous recommendation was based on sound \nscience. I might add, two people from the State of Missouri were on the \npeer review committee. They unanimously agreed that this is the \nalternative--that is spring rise/split season--which is necessary to \nprotect these species.\n  Let's go back a little bit. Let's say that the rider passes. Let's \nsay a lawsuit is brought. As I mentioned, the likelihood is very high \nthat the plaintiffs, the environmentalists, would win. What happens \nnext? We wind up with the river being operated not by the Corps of \nEngineers, not influenced by the Congress, but by the courts, a judge \nin some Federal court somewhere--they will get venue probably somewhere \nalong the Missouri River--will be overseeing the operation of the \nentire Missouri River system; again, because of a lawsuit that wins. \nThat might be politically convenient for some, but it is an abdication \nof our responsibility. As we have seen along the Columbia and Snake \nRivers, it generates much more litigation and much more uncertainty.\n  Let us not go down the path of litigation. We do have a process in \nplace to carefully revise the master manual. It has been underway for \nyears; 10 years to be more specific. Now at the last moment, when the \nend is in sight, here we find a rider on an appropriations bill which \nwould derail the process by taking not only one of the alternatives \nright off the table but the one that probably is necessary to comply \nwith the law. Of course, that is not fair; of course, it is not right. \nIt is not the right way for us to be doing business here. Instead, we \nshould give the process we began 10 years ago a chance to work.\n  Now that we have a draft biological opinion, there will be an \nopportunity--this is a very important point--for public comment, both \non the draft and on the later environmental impact statement. That way \nwe have a decision that is not made in a vacuum. But this rider makes a \nmockery of that process. There will be an extensive period for public \ncomment, but the public agencies cannot take any of those comments into \naccount. That is what this rider does. It says: OK, here is your \nalternative, but you can't be implemented so the comments are \nirrelevant. What kind of message does that send to our people, already \ncynical about the way Government works? I say there is a better way: \nallow the process to work.\n  With that, I will briefly respond to a point made by the Senator from \nMissouri and some of his supporters. Concern has been expressed that if \nwe have higher flows in the spring, there is a greater chance of \nflooding--a wonderful metaphor, floods; wonderful picture, floods; wall \nof water; risky proposition. It gets people scared and nervous, \nobviously. That is what it is designed to do. It is designed to scare \npeople, scare them into supporting the rider. But we are not only \nemotional entities, we are supposedly analytical beings.\n  We are supposed to think about this stuff a little bit, look at the \nfacts, not just the emotion. So let's look at the facts, I say to my \nother good friend from Missouri who is managing this bill at this time.\n  First of all, nobody wants floods. Flood control comes first. There \nis no question about it. Flood control comes first. I might say, \nthough, the Corps and other agencies have taken flood control into \naccount. In fact, the Corps has modeled many different river management \nalternatives. Their models show that under a spring rise/split season, \nthere is no difference in flood control. Statistically, it is about 1 \npercent, which is basically zero. The Army Corps of Engineers has taken \nthis question fully into account already. Of course, they would; it is \ntheir responsibility, and they have done that. Their conclusions show \nthat under this alternative, there is virtually no difference in \nflooding compared with the current master manual--virtually none.\n  I heard one of my good friends from Missouri say, well, gee, nobody \ncan predict the weather. Mr. President, that is a total red herring, \ntotally irrelevant. That has nothing to do with what we are talking \nabout here. We can't predict the weather today under the current master \nmanual or tomorrow if the spring rise/split season are adopted--in \neither event. The two floods mentioned--in 1993 and 1997--under this \nproposal, the spring rise/split season, would not have been in effect; \nthat is, the spring rise/split season proposal would not have been \npermitted because of the modeling and the anticipation of the flood \nyears 1993 or 1997. Actually, the spring rise is to be implemented only \nonce every 3 years. Say year No. 1 comes up, and 4 years later year No. \n1 comes up again, and this might be a flood year. The model says, no, \nwe don't implement a spring rise; we are not going to take the risk of \nmore flooding.\n  So let's get the flood scare tactic off the table here. It has \nnothing to do with what we are talking about. The Army Corps of \nEngineers' own models conclude that the risk of flooding is virtually \ninsignificant.\n  In closing, I want to also point out one other thing. The basic \nargument of the Senator from Missouri is that we are just taking one \nitem off the table--spring rise/split season. That is all we are doing. \nWe are not taking other alternatives off the table, other environmental \nenhancement measures, wetlands restoration, and habitat restoration. We \nare not taking that off the table. So what is the big fuss here? That \nis the basic argument.\n  The flaw in that argument is that the people who have studied this, \nthe peer reviewers, have unanimously concluded that both are needed in \norder to solve this problem--that is, both a spring rise/split season \nand legislation to help restore habitat. Both are needed. They have \nconcluded you can't have one without the other; you have to have both. \nYou have to have the spring rise/split season. It makes sense because \nthat is the natural order of things; that is the way the river runs \nnaturally. It tends to flood in the spring and not later on.\n  The argument has also been made that this is going to hurt \nMississippi barge traffic downstream. Frankly, that is another red \nherring designed to scare Senators downstream from Missouri, from St. \nLouis. It is a scare tactic because if you look at the data, at the \nfacts, the facts show that, actually, because more water is being let \nout of the dams in the spring, and it is saved in the summer, on a net \nbasis, they are going to have to let a little bit more out in the fall, \nwhich benefits the barge industry on the Mississippi. So it is a red \nherring. It is inaccurate--more to the point--that this proposal would \nhurt barge traffic down from St. Louis. That is not right. The Corps \ndata shows more water is going to be released at the time it is more \nnecessary.\n  To sum it all up, let's pass this amendment that strikes section 103.\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\n Let the process continue to work. There is ample opportunity for \npublic comment. But let's not disrupt it in a way that will cause a \nlawsuit and will cause a lot more problems than it will solve. I \nunderstand Senators who feel obligated, regardless of the facts, to \nsupport the Senator. But let's do what is right and not pass this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to \njoin my colleagues to discuss the issue of the how the Missouri River \nshould be managed by the Corps of Engineers. I strongly urge the Senate \nto adopt the Daschle-Baucus-Johnson amendment to strike Section 103 \nfrom the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which prevents needed \nchanges to the management of the Missouri River that have been called \nfor by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. President Clinton has stated \nthat he will veto the bill if this amendment is not included. The time \nhas come to manage the river in line with current economic realities.\n  This issue has come before the Senate because some Senators from \nstates downstream on the Missouri River are attempting to politicize \nthe management of the River. As has been done in the last four years, \nthey are trying to politicize this issue by adding a rider to the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill to prevent the Army Corps of \nEngineers from changing the 40 year old master manual that sets the \nmanagement policy of the river.\n  Mr. President, let me assure you and the rest of my colleagues that \nafter 40 years, the management of the Missouri River is in serious need \nof an update to reflect the current realities of the River. The Corps \ncurrent plan for managing water flow from the Missouri River Dams, \nknown as the master manual provides relatively steady flows during the \nspring, summer and fall to support a $7 million downstream barge \nindustry. The manual has not been substantially revised on 40 years.\n  In that time, the projections of barge traffic used to justify the \nmanual have never materialized. Instead, the steady flows required by \nthe manual have contributed to the decline of fish and wildlife along \nthe river.\n  To counter this problem, the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed a \nrevision of the master manual which governs how the river is managed.\n  I was among those who first called for a revision of the master \nmanual because I firmly believed then, as I do now, that over the \nyears, we in the Upper Basin states have lived with an unfortunate lack \nof parity under the current management practices on the Missouri River. \nIt is no secret that we continue to suffer from an upstream vs. \ndownstream conflict of interest on Missouri River uses. Navigation has \nbeen emphasized on the Missouri River, to the detriment of river \necosystems and recreational uses. I recognize that navigation \nactivities often support midwestern agriculture, however the navigation \nindustry has been declining since it peaked in the late 1970's. It is \nno longer appropriate to grossly favor navigation above other uses of \nthe river.\n  Those of us from the upstream States have been working for more than \n10 years to get the Corps of Engineers to finally make changes in the \n40 year old master manual for the Missouri River.\n  After more than 40 years, the time has come for the management of the \nMissouri River to reflect the current economic realities of an $90 \nmillion annual recreation impact upstream, versus a $7 million annual \nnavigation impact downstream. The downstream barge industry carries \nonly 3/10 percent of all agriculture goods transported in the upper \nMidwest. The Corps has been managing the Missouri River for navigation \nfor far too long and it is time to finally bring the master manual into \nline with current economic realities. Passage of the Daschle-Baucus-\nJohnson amendment will do just that.\n  As I stated earlier, the process to review and update the master \nmanual began more than 10 years ago, in 1989, in response to concerns \nregarding the operation of the main stem dams, mainly during drought \nperiods. A draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was published in \nSeptember 1994 and was followed by a public comment period. In response \nto numerous comments, the Corps agreed to prepare a revised DEIS.\n  After years of revisions and updates that have dragged this process \nout to ridiculous lengths, the Corps finally came forward with \nalternatives to the current master manual, including the ``split \nseason'' alternative, which I strongly support, along with my \ncolleagues from the Upper Basin States.\n  The rider to prevent implementation of changes in the manual has been \nincluded for the last 4 years. In previous years, this rider was not as \nimportant because the Corps was not ready to revise the river \nmanagement policies. However, this year, the Corps is consulting \nextensively with the Fish and Wildlife Service and is officially \nlearning that it must implement a spring rise and split season to avoid \ndriving endangered species to extinction. Since the Corps finally has a \nschedule to complete the process in the near future, rejecting this \nrider is more than important than ever.\n  Those of us from the States in the Upper Basin are determined to work \naggressively for the interests of our region. For decades our states \nhave made many significant sacrifices which have benefitted people \nliving further south along the Missouri River.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to finally bring an outdated and \nunfair management plan for the Missouri River up to date with modern \neconomic realities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from \nIowa may consume in opposing this motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nsection 103 of the energy and water appropriations bill. This section \nwould prohibit changes to management of the Missouri River which would \nunquestionably increase flood risk on the lower Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers. If this section is dropped from the bill, \nlandowners in Iowa along the Missouri River will face the threat of \nincreased flooding. Farmers and other river barge users would face \nincreased transportation costs in getting their grain and other goods \nto market. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable to a majority of \nIowans.\n  There is nothing new in this bill language. It has been placed in \nfour previous appropriations bill by my distinguished colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond. Each of these bills has been signed into law by \nthis President. The measure would prohibit the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers from implementing a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to \nincrease releases of water from Missouri River dams in the spring. The \nDaschle amendment could result in significant flooding downstream given \nthe heavy rains that are usually experienced in my, and other \ndownstream states during that time.\n  We must keep in mind that it takes 8 days for water to travel from \nGavins Point to the mouth of the Missouri.\n  Unanticipated downstream storms can make a ``controlled release'' a \ndeadly flood inflicting a widespread physical and human cataclysm. \nThere are many small communities along the Missouri River in Iowa. Why \nshould they face an increased potential risk for flooding and its \ndevastation? They shouldn't.\n  Equally unacceptable is the low-flow summer release schedule proposed \nby the Clinton-Gore administration's Fish and Wildlife Service. A so-\ncalled split navigation season would be catastrophic to the \ntransportation of Iowa grain to the marketplace. In effect, the \nMissouri River would be shut-down to barge traffic during a good \nportion of the summer. It would also have a disastrous effect on the \ntransportation of steel to Iowa steel mills located along the Missouri, \nconstruction materials and farm inputs such as fertilizer.\n  Opponents of section 103 will advance an argument that a spring flood \nis necessary for species protection under the Endangered Species Act, \nand that grain and other goods can be transported to market by \nrailroad. I do not accept that argument. I believe that there is \nsignificant difference of opinion whether or not a spring flood will \nbenefit pallid sturgeon, the interior least tern or the piping plover. \nIn fact, the Corps has demonstrated that it can successfully create \nnesting habitat for the birds\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\nthrough mechanical means. Further, it is in dispute among biologists \nwhether or not a flood can create the necessary habitat for the \nsturgeon.\n\n  I would further point out that the Fish and Wildlife Service has yet \nto designate ``critical habitat'' for the pallid sturgeon as required \nby the Endangered Species Act.\n  Loss of barge traffic would deliver the western part of America's \ngreat grain belt into the monopolistic hands of the railroads. Without \nquestion, grain transportation prices would drastically increase with \ndisastrous results on farm income.\n  Every farmer in Iowa knows that the balance in grain transportation \nis competition between barges and railroads. This competition keeps \nboth means of transportation honest. This competition keeps \ntransportation prices down and helps to give the Iowa farmer a better \nfinancial return on the sale of his grain. This competition helps to \nmake the grain transportation system in America the most efficient and \ncost effective in the world. It is crucial in keeping American grain \ncompetitively priced in the world market. The Corps itself estimates \nthat barge competition reduces rail rates along the Missouri by $75-200 \nmillion annually.\n  Further, if a drought hits during the split navigation season, there \nwould be even less water flowing along the Missouri. This would greatly \ninhibit navigation along the Mississippi River. We cannot let this \nhappen.\n  Less water flowing in the late summer would also affect hydroelectric \nrates. The decreased flows would mean less power generation and higher \nelectric rates for Iowans who depend upon this power source.\n  I agree with the National Corn Growers and their statement that, ``an \nintentional spring rise is an unwarranted, unscientific assault on \nfarmers and citizens throughout the Missouri River Basin.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to support section 103. Vote against the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of section 103, \nand I yield myself such time as I may consume to make my remarks.\n  Section 103 of this bill is a provision that is necessary for the \nmillions of Americans who live and work along the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers. But before I get into detailing those \nconsiderations, let me commend Senator Baucus and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for including section 103 in the energy and \nwater appropriations bill.\n  This section protects the citizens of my State of Missouri and other \nStates from dangerous flooding and allows for cost-efficient \ntransportation of grain and cargo. Of course, cost-efficient \ntransportation provides a basis for much of our industry and \nagriculture.\n  The pending amendment would delete section 103 in the underlying \nbill, thereby sanctioning the Fish and Wildlife Service's attempt to \nbully the Corps of Engineers into immediately changing the river's \nwater management plan to include a spring rise which would increase \nflood risk on the lower Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.\n  This is not just a dispute between the States of Missouri and the \nDakotas. It is a much larger issue. It is about whether we will prevent \nunnecessary administrative intrusion into the operation of the Missouri \nor any U.S. river, and whether the public it is about should have the \nopportunity to review proposed changes and whether we should allow a \ndisputed biological opinion to be the subject of independent scrutiny.\n  Without section 103, decades of operating the Nation's commercially \nnavigable rivers for multiple purposes will be reversed without clear \ncongressional direction.\n  Joining us in urging defeat of the pending amendment is a bipartisan \ncollection of people and organizations representing farmers, \nmanufacturers, labor unions, shippers, cities, and port authorities \nfrom 15 Midwest States. Also supporting us in opposing the Daschle \namendment are major national organizations, including the American Farm \nBureau, the American Waterways Association, the National Grange, and \nthe National Soybean Association.\n  We are united in opposing this amendment because of the risk. It \nwould lead to a dangerous flooding condition and could interfere with \nthe movement and cost of grain and cargo shipped on our Nation's inland \nwaterways.\n  It is not a novel thing for me to stand in defense of the Missouri \nRiver. I come to this debate after fighting for Missouri's water rights \nas the Missouri attorney general and Governor, and I will continue to \nmake water flows on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers top priorities.\n  As background for this debate, Senators need to know that the use of \nthe Missouri River is governed by what is known as the Missouri River \nMaster Manual. Right now, there is an effort underway to update that \nmanual. The specific issue that is at the crux of this debate today is \nwhat is called a spring rise. A spring rise in this case is a release \nof huge amounts of water from above Gavins Point Dam on the Nebraska-\nSouth Dakota border during the flood-prone spring months.\n  To see whether such a controlled flood may improve the habitat of the \npallid sturgeon, the least tern, and the piping plover, section 103 is \na commonsense provision that states:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used to \n     revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if such \n     provisions provide for an increase in the springtime water \n     release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow \n     melt period in States that have rivers draining into the \n     Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.\n\n  This policy has been included in the last four energy and water \nappropriations bills, all of which the President signed without \nopposition.\n  In an effort to protect the species' habitats, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service issued an ultimatum to the Army Corps of Engineers \ninsisting that the U.S. Corps of Engineers immediately agree to its \ndemand for a spring rise. The Corps was given 1 week to respond to the \nrequest of Fish and Wildlife for immediate implementation of a spring \nrise. The Corps' response was a rejection of the spring rise proposal, \nand they called for further study of the effect of the spring rise.\n  The Bond language in section 103 will allow for the studies the Corps \nrecommends.\n  National environmental groups want to delete section 103. They want \nto do that in an attempt to circumvent additional analysis of the \neffects of the proposal.\n  What is ironic and even tragic is that spring flooding could hurt the \ntargeted species more than it would protect them, and it would do so in \na way that would increase the risks of downstream flooding and \ninterfere with the shipment of cargo on our Nation's highways.\n  Dr. Joe Engeln, assistant director of the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources, stated in a June 24 letter that there are several \nmajor problems with the Fish and Wildlife's proposed plan that may have \na perverse effect of harming the targeted species rather than helping \nthe targeted species.\n  First, Dr. Engeln points out that the plan would increase the amount \nof water held behind the dams, which would have the effect of reducing \nthe amount of river between the big reservoirs by about 10 miles in an \naverage year and a reduction in certain parts of the river.\n  In addition, Dr. Engeln writes, ``The higher reservoir levels would \nalso reduce the habitat for the terns and plovers that nest along the \nshorelines of the reservoirs.''\n  Dr. Engeln also points out that because the plan calls for a \nsignificant drop in flow during the summer, predators will be able to \nreach the islands upon which the terns and plovers nest, giving them \naccess to young still in nests. It is clear there isn't a single view \nabout the value, even in terms of seeking to protect these species \nwhich are the focus of this debate.\n\n  Some advocates of the proposed plan claim this plan is a return to \nmore natural flow conditions. They say, we want to return the river to \nits condition at the time of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Not only \nis it unrealistic to return the river to its ``natural flow'' when the \nMidwest was barely habitable because of erratic flooding conditions, \naccording to Dr. Engeln,\n\n       The proposal would benefit artificial reservoirs at the \n     expense of the river and create flow conditions that have \n     never existed along the river in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and \n     Missouri.\n\n  Dr. Engeln's letter states:\n\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n\n       Balancing the needs of all river users is complicated. \n     Predicting the loss of habitat and its impact on the terns \n     and plovers should not be subject to disagreements. The Fish \n     and Wildlife Service and the Corps of Engineers need to \n     examine the implications of this proposal and recognize its \n     failure to protect these species.\n\n  Listen to the last comment: The Missouri Department of Natural \nResources--I might note, this is a well-recognized department; our \nconservation and natural resource departments are nationally \nrecognized. We are especially supportive, with special independent tax \nrevenues for the conservation commission. The Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources states that the Fish and Wildlife Service should \nrecognize the proposal's failure to protect these species.\n  The plan by the Fish and Wildlife Service fails to protect species. \nIt exposes the citizens of the Midwest and Southern States and their \nfarms and cities and ports to dangerous flooding. It also interferes \nwith the shipment of cargo and could lead to higher prices being \ncharged for the shipment of cargo.\n  Over 90 organizations representing farmers, shippers, cities, labor \nunions, and port authorities sent a letter to Congress last week that \nSenator Bond has had printed in the Congressional Record. Let me \nbriefly quote from this letter:\n\n       The spring rise demanded by the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     is based on the premise that we should ``replicate the \n     national hydrograph'' that was responsible for devastating \n     and deadly floods, as well as summertime droughts and even \n     dust bowls.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       For decades we have worked to mitigate the negative \n     implications of the natural hydrograph with multiple purpose \n     water resource programs. These efforts have protected \n     communities from floods and also provided hundreds of \n     thousands of families wage jobs in interior regions.\n\n  These 90-plus organizations are exactly right. For decades, the \nGovernment has made water resource management decisions by taking into \naccount the many varied uses of the river in balancing the interests of \nall affected groups: agriculture, energy, municipal, industrial, \nenvironmental, and recreational. Our policies in the past have been \ndesigned to protect communities against natural disasters, as well as \nallow efficient and environmentally friendly river transportation, low-\ncost and reliable hydropower and a burgeoning recreation industry.\n  Let me indicate when I was attorney general of the State of \nMissouri--and that is several decades ago--there was a run made on the \nriver at that time to divert the river, to run it through a pipeline to \nthe lower Gulf States and to run the river in conjunction with powdered \ncoal through the pipeline as a means of taking the river.\n  I guarded the river then because I knew of its value to our State. \nHalf the people in the State of Missouri drink water from the Missouri \nRiver. It is a tremendous resource in terms of transportation, in \nmoving grain downstream for international sale. Soybean farmers in \nAmerica have to sell over half of their crop overseas. Moving their \ncrop to the ports is essential. Moving the crop efficiently to the \nports is very important in terms of our competitive position. It is a \nnecessary thing that we preserve this potential for those who operate \nour family farms--not just to have the transportation--to avoid the \nunnecessary and devastating potential of floods.\n  Last week, the sponsors of the pending amendment circulated a Dear \nColleague letter regarding their amendment. It is a letter to explain \ntheir idea of striking section 103. They laid out the arguments. The \nenvironmental groups who are supporting the Daschle amendment have made \nmany of the same points in defense of their position. I want to take a \nfew minutes to refute the main points of the supporters of this \namendment, which is to strike this provision.\n  First, the supporters argue that the Missouri River management \nchanges will not create potential downstream flooding because the \nspring rise would not occur every year. It would not be implemented \nduring the 10 percent highest flow years, they say, ``and the Corps \nwould not release additional water from Gavins Point dam if the \nMissouri were already flooding.''\n  While this may sound reassuring, it is not acceptable to those \ncitizens living downstream because unreliable waterflows pose a grave \ndanger to everyone living and working along the banks of the river. The \nspring rise would come at a time in the year when downstream citizens \nare most vulnerable to flooding and downstream agriculture is certainly \nvery vulnerable to flooding.\n  It normally takes 11 or 12 days for water to travel from the Gavins \nPoint reservoir to St. Louis. During the spring, the weather in the \nMidwest is unpredictable. I might want to protect myself. It may be \nthat the weather in the Midwest is always predictable.\n  I remember last summer visiting a flood-ravaged city in eastern \nMissouri in this watershed. Union, MO, had a 14-inch rain that was not \npredicted. I had flooding on my farm in late July when we had a 7-inch \nunpredicted rain. And not only just this kind of outburst or cloud \nburst, but we know that the weather in the Midwest is hard to predict. \nHeavy rain or a series of heavy rains in the 12-day period following a \nspring rise would certainly greatly increase the chances for downstream \nflooding, and the amount that would be necessary to top a levy here and \nthere could be the amount precipitated with the rise, the purposeful \nrelease of the water.\n  The second major point the opponents make is that section 103 \nprohibits the Corps from producing a final environmental impact study. \nThe true fact is the language of section 103 only forbids the use of \nFederal funds to make revisions of the master manual to allow for a \nspring rise. It does not impact the Corps' ability to produce a final \nenvironmental impact study, nor does it permanently ban revisions. \nSection 103 would only be operative for fiscal year 2001.\n\n  The third point that the opponents make is that the Fish and Wildlife \nService proposal will help Mississippi barge navigators. The true fact \nis every Mississippi navigational organization and transportation \nentity is against the proposed spring rise and in support of section \n103. They say these folks will all be assisted by this. But all the \nfolks who actually work in this industry, every single navigational \norganization says that kind of assistance ``we don't want.'' It is akin \nto the fellow saying: I don't think the check is in the mail and I \ndon't think you are from the Federal Government and here to help me.\n  The fourth point that our opponents make is that the Missouri River \nfarmers will benefit by the proposed management changes. The real fact \nis that every farm group is against the proposal and is in favor of \nretaining section 103. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, the American Soybean Association, the National Grain and Feed \nAssociation, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, Agriculture \nRetailers Association--enough.\n  The fifth point our opponents make is that public recreational \nopportunities in upstream States will be improved by the proposed \nchanges. According to the mark 2,000 set of groups, no evidence exists \nto suggest that recreation and tourism will benefit from a spring rise.\n  The sixth point our opponents make is that the spring rise will help \nto restore the health of the river and recover endangered fish and bird \nspecies. No documentation has been provided that establishes the need \nfor a spring rise beyond what currently occurs naturally. As I \nmentioned before, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources strongly \ndisagrees that a spring rise would have environmental benefits for \nendangered birds.\n\n  The seventh point our opponents make in their letter is that the only \nindustry harmed by the proposal would be the downstream barge industry. \nThey don't always make this point. Sometimes they say this will not \nmake any difference to the barge industry. Sometimes they say it is \ngoing to help the barge industry. Then they say the only industry that \nwould be hurt would be the barge industry. I think what we can all \nagree on is the barge industry would be affected, and I think we ought \nto listen to the barge industry. The barge industry simply says very \nclearly they don't want any part of this, that they reject this \nconcept.\n  Competition on the waterways, of course, would be impaired. If you \nhurt the barge industry, it is totally naive\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nto think that you can hurt the barge industry and that would be the \nonly industry hurt. If you hurt the barge industry and take that grain \nshipment capacity out of the system, all of a sudden you have to load \nmore trucks. So there would be a greater demand for trucking. With more \ndemand, we all know what happens: Supply and demand, if the supply is \nthe same the price goes up. In fact, it doesn't take a particularly \nstrong analytical bent to get there. But the Tennessee Valley Authority \nhas made some estimates about this. According to the TVA, water \ncompetition holds down railroad rates, not only trucking rates but \nrailroad rates, and the holddown of the railroad rates by water \ncompetition is about $200 million each year.\n  If you are talking about that kind of impact holding down those \nrates, I think it is fair to say there are potential ripple effects on \na lot of other folks than just the barge industry, and I happen to \nbelieve this is a time when the American farmer might find himself on \nthe tracks and the fast freight coming through, and not for the benefit \nof the American farmer. It is time for us to say we need as much \ncompetition as possible in hauling these resources to market rather \nthan to minimize that competition.\n  Finally, the amendment sponsors say the President will veto this bill \nif section 103 is maintained. If the President decides to veto the \nentire bill after having signed this provision four times previously, \nit states a very clear message by the Clinton-Gore administration to \nthe citizens of the Midwest. It is very easy to understand. \nUnfortunately, it would be very hard to digest and accommodate. But the \nmessage would be this: The Clinton-Gore administration is willing to \nflood downstream communities as part of an unscientific, risky scheme \nthat will hurt, not help, the endangered species it seeks to protect. \nIf that is the message, I wouldn't want to be the messenger. A vote for \nthe Daschle amendment sends the message to communities all along the \nMissouri River that this Congress supports increased flooding of \nproperty and higher costs for family farmers, factory workers, and \nindustrial freight movers.\n  I think it is pretty clear that there is not sound science to support \nsome protection of these species. There is a clear disagreement among \nscientists, and a strong argument that the implementation of this plan \nwould, in fact, damage the capacity of some of these species to \ncontinue.\n  I urge Senators to look closely at the facts and to stand with the \nmen and women who depend upon sane, scientific management of the \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers, and to join me in voting no on the \nDaschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know if the Senator from Missouri wants to speak \nnow. I have maybe 5 or 10 minutes of points I want to make, but if the \nSenator wants to speak now----\n  Mr. BOND. Please; my colleague has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just several points for the record. In all \ndue respect, listening to my colleagues, there were lots of \nconclusions. I don't hear a lot of facts, support for the statements \nmade.\n  One of the statements I heard is that flood control benefits will be \nmuch worse under the preferred plan, that is the spring rise/split \nseason. But that is not what the facts are, according to the Army Corps \nof Engineers. If you look at all the various data here on all the \nvarious alternatives that the Corps considered, it totaled up the flood \ncontrol benefits for the river from the Fort Peck Dam down to the \nmouth, and I must say there is statistically no difference in flood \ncontrol benefits. So this big scare tactic of floods--I have heard some \nsay, not on this floor, a wall of water--is, according to the facts, \ninaccurate. It is inaccurate according to the modeling done by the \nCorps on all the various alternatives.\n  The benefits under the current master manual, flood control benefits, \naccording to the Army Corps of Engineers, are about $414 million. The \nspring rise/split season flood control benefits are virtually \nstatistically the same; that is, $410 million--virtually no difference. \nThose are the facts. Not the rhetoric, not the abstraction, not the \ngeneralization, but the facts.\n  Second, I have heard here that the spring rise/split season will \nincrease Mississippi River navigation costs. That is the assertion. \nLet's look at the facts, again, facts according to studies done by the \nArmy Corps of Engineers--not by that dreaded Fish and Wildlife Service, \nbut by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The facts: If you look at the average annual Mississippi River \nnavigation costs for the Army Corps of Engineers, under the master \nmanual it is about $45.70 million; under the spring rise alternative is \nit $46.85, which comes out to less than a 1-percent difference. So, \nagain, it is a scare tactic and an inaccurate scare tactic to say that \nthe spring rise/split season is going to increase navigational costs \ndownriver on the Mississippi. It is just not accurate, according to \nstudies done by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  I have also heard on the floor this evening that the spring rise/\nsplit season will decrease hydropower benefits for the main stem \nreservoir system. That is the assertion. That is the rhetoric. Let's \nlook at the facts. Let's look at what the Army Corps of Engineers' \nactual data says. I have it here before me. Under the current master \nmanual, the average annual hydropower benefits total $676 million. \nUnder the spring rise/split season, the average annual hydropower \nbenefits are higher, $683 million; not lower, higher. So the hydropower \nbenefits under the spring rise/split season are actually better, higher \nthan they are under the current master manual.\n  Another point, you have heard stated many times on the floor tonight \nthis provision has been in the appropriations bill for about 4 years \nand there has been no objection; the President hasn't objected, so what \nis the big deal? The difference is in those prior years it was all \nabstraction. That is, there was no Fish and Wildlife Service biological \nopinion. We were dealing with thin air, not dealing with something \nsubstantive. Now we are. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued their \nbiological opinion. We have something definite. And they concluded the \nspring rise/split season is necessary.\n  On that same point, I might say the group that peer-reviewed this \nproposal--I think there are seven or eight from the Missouri River \nbasin--unanimously concluded this is necessary.\n  I might tease my good friend from Missouri, saying his colleague at \nlength quoted a Missourian who has had problems with the proposal \nalternative. I might tease my friend from Missouri, pointing out of the \nseven scientists on the peer review who unanimously concluded this \nmakes sense, two of them are Missourians, one with the department of \nconservation and the other with the University of Missouri at Columbia. \nOne says it is a bad idea; two say it is a good idea. I will take the \nmajority vote from the Missourians.\n  I might also point out that basically we want the Corps of Engineers \nto follow the law. Under the law, whenever a species is threatened or \nendangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service consults with the relevant \nagency--in this case the Army Corps of Engineers. And under the law, \nthe alternative must comply with the Endangered Species Act. It will \nnot have the devastating effect that has been asserted.\n  I say so not as an assertion but backed up by facts, backed up by the \nArmy Corps of Engineers' own data. Look at the data. The data shows, A, \nthis is not going to cause all the problems that have been asserted \nand, B, this is probably necessary under the law. Otherwise, it is \nthrown in the courts, and we all know what happens when something like \nthis is thrown into the judicial system. We will be wrapped up trying \nto resolve this for years and years.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to do what is right. Follow the \nscience, follow the law, and vote to delete section 103 from the \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, which I hope ends \nthis debate for this group who is listening in rapt attention. I \nappreciate the attention of those people who are sitting\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\non the edge of their seats learning more than they ever wanted to know \nabout the Missouri River. It is important to us. It is vitally \nimportant to Missouri and other downstream States.\n  We do disagree with some of the statements that have been made by my \ncolleagues on the other side. We have a disagreement on the \ninterpretation and I think a disagreement on the facts.\n  The statement has been made that the Fish and Wildlife Service's \nsplit season does not have any impact on the river flows in the \nMississippi River. That has not happened. The Fish and Wildlife Service \nproposal, according to the Corps of Engineers' advice to us today, has \nnot happened. That is not accurate.\n  I believe strongly the spring rise will take water out of upstream \nreservoirs. They need that water for recreation. I have worked very \nclosely with my friend and colleague from Montana, and others, to do \nwhat we can to accommodate legitimate recreation needs. My colleague \nfrom Montana was a very valuable ally when we pushed through the middle \nMissouri River habitat mitigation plan that made changes that we think \nare improving fish and wildlife habitat along the Missouri. I thank him \nfor that.\n  When he says the models show there is a statistically insignificant \nimpact downstream, any kind of spring rise in any year which is an \nexceptional flood year is going to have exceptional and disastrous \nimpacts. Look at it in a low-flow year. It may not make much \ndifference, but if you put that spring surge down the river in a year \nwhen we get that unexpected 6-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, 14-inch rise, we \nhave a devastating flood that not only wipes out property and destroys \nfacilities along the river but puts lives at danger.\n  The statement was made that fish and game agencies are united behind \nthis plan. They are not. This is one of the big questions that needs to \nbe resolved. Resolution of those questions can and must go on during \nthe coming year. We do not stop all of the agencies from continuing the \ndiscussions and debate. Contrary to what has been said on this floor by \nthe proponents of the motion to strike, we only say you cannot \nimplement the spring rise.\n  This risky scheme needs to be thoroughly worked out, thoroughly \ndebated, before anybody has a thought of putting it into action. That \nis why we want to have a year with no spring rise implemented as \nordered by the diktat of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their \nletter of July 12.\n  The statement was made that the consensus of the States in the \nMissouri River Basin Association was in favor of a spring rise. There \nis a difference between a spring rise in the upper part of the river \nwhich is above the dams, above Gavins Point, which makes the difference \non what the flows are in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska.\n  The Missouri River Basin Association recommends trial fish \nenhancement flows from Fort Peck Reservoir. The enhanced flows will be \ncoordinated with the unbalancing of the upper basin reservoirs and thus \nwill occur approximately every third year. This is in the upper basin. \nIt does not have any impact directly downstream.\n  With respect to the lower Missouri River, which is below the last \ndam--that is, Gavins Point releases--the statement of the Missouri \nRiver Basin Association is that it recognizes the controversial nature \nof adjustment to releases from Gavins Point Dam. MRBA recommends the \nrecovery committee investigate the benefits and adverse impacts of flow \nadjustment to the existing uses of the river system. They did not, have \nnot, and are not recommending increased flows.\n  This effort by the Fish and Wildlife Service to impose their views \nover the views not only of the neighbors of the people downstream who \nhave studied it, the fish and wildlife agencies, this is a risky scheme \nthat provides tremendous potential for a flooding disaster along the \nMissouri River, and I urge my colleagues tomorrow to oppose the motion \nto strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to say it has been a good debate. \nOur views have been aired. I deeply respect that different Senators \nmight have different points of view on this issue. After all, that is \nwhy we run for this job. That is why we are here. We all have various \npoints of view. I do not want to be corny, but that is what makes \ndemocracy strong--various points of view.\n  I very much respect and appreciate my good friend from Missouri and \nothers who are arguing to include this provision in the appropriations \nbill to prevent the spring rise. My basic point is we have different \npoints of view on this. My basic point is let the process work, do not \npreempt it. There will be plenty of opportunities for comments on the \ndraft opinion and on whatever alternative the Army Corps of Engineers \npicks. There are lots of different options. Let's not prejudge it by \nsaying it cannot be one as opposed to others. Somebody might come up \nwith a better idea between now and then. My belief is we should let the \nprocess work. We can let it work by not adopting this rider to the \nappropriations bill. We should work through this as it evolves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time on this \nside and bring this to a blessed conclusion after stating that I \nappreciate the chance to discuss this issue with my good friend from \nMontana and to say we are willing to let the process go forward. Just \ndo not send us a controlled flood next spring. That is all we ask. Let \nthe process work. Do not send the water down.\n  I now yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nask that we let the process work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8090-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n      CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, SEPTEMBER 1, 2000\n\n S. 2440: Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000, As Reported by the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on August 25, \n                                  2000\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 2440 would require the Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA) to revise certain airport security policies and \n     procedures. These policies would direct airports and air \n     carriers to implement a number of security measures, \n     including Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) electronic \n     fingerprint checks before filling certain jobs, better \n     training for security screeners, and more random security \n     checks of passengers. S. 2440 also would require the FAA to \n     expand and accelerate the current effort to improve security \n     at air traffic control facilities.\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 2440 would cost $155 \n     million over the 2001-2005 period, assuming appropriation of \n     the necessary amounts. That amount represents the\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\n     difference between estimated spending under FAA's current \n     plan for security improvements and spending for such \n     improvements under the bill. Because S. 2440 would affect \n     direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply, but \n     CBO estimates the net impact on direct spending would be \n     negligible.\n       S. 2440 contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) because it would \n     require airport operators to improve airport security. CBO \n     estimates that the new requirements would impose no \n     significant costs on state, local, or tribal governments, \n     including public airport authorities.\n       S. 2440 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in \n     UMRA, on air carriers and security screening companies. CBO \n     expects that total costs of those mandates would not exceed \n     the annual threshold established by UMRA for private-sector \n     mandates ($109 million in 2000, adjusted for inflation).\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 2440 is shown in the \n     following table.

Estimated \n     outlays are based on historical spending patterns.\n       S. 2440 would require the FAA to expand and accelerate its \n     current plans to improve security at air traffic control \n     facilities. Based on information from the FAA, implementing \n     this provision of the bill would cost about $155 million over \n     the 2001-2005 period. This amount includes a spending \n     increase of $182 million during the 2001-2003 period and a \n     $27 million reduction in spending over the following two \n     years, relative to current plans for security improvements.\n       Implementing S. 2440 would require airports and air \n     carriers to increase the number of fingerprint checks on \n     employees and potential hires that are conducted by the FBI \n     with assistance from the Office of Personnel Management. Both \n     of these agencies would receive payments from airport \n     operators and air carriers (or their contractors), which \n     would be recorded as offsetting receipts (a credit against \n     direct spending). These payments could then be spent without \n     further appropriation action to conduct fingerprint checks on \n     employees. Since the additional direct spending and \n     offsetting receipts would be approximately equal, we estimate \n     that the net impact on direct spending of this provision \n     would be negligible.\n\n\n                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS\n\n       the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. implementing S. 2440 would affect \n     direct spending, but CBO estimates that any such effects \n     would be negligible.\n\n\n        ESTIAMTED IMPACT ON STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS\n\n       S. 2440 contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined in \n     UMRA because it would require airport owners and operators to \n     improve airport security. Based on information from the \n     Airports Council International and the Air Transport \n     Association, CBO estimates that the new requirements would \n     impose no significant costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments, including airport authorities, because under \n     existing contracts and agreements any additional costs would \n     be borne by air carriers and other airport tenants.\n\n\n                 ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\n       S. 2440 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined by \n     UMRA, on air carriers and security screening companies. Based \n     on information from the FAA and industry representatives, CBO \n     estimates that the costs of those mandates would not exceed \n     the annual threshold established by UMRA for private-sector \n     mandates ($109 million in 2000, adjusted for inflation).\n       First, the bill would mandate new hiring procedures and \n     training standards for airport security workers. Section 2 \n     would require air carriers to conduct an FBI electronic \n     fingerprint check on all applicants for certain positions \n     related to airport security positions with unescorted access \n     to sensitive areas, positions with responsibility for \n     screening passengers or property (screeners), and screener \n     supervisor positions. Because the FBI electronic fingerprint \n     checks would make the current price of employment \n     investigations and subsequent audits of those investigations \n     unnecessary, enacting this section could result in savings \n     for air carriers. Section 3 would require additional hours of \n     training for security screeners. In addition, the bill would \n     require that computer training facilities be located near \n     certain airports.\n       Second, the bill would accelerate the effective date of two \n     sets of requirements that the FAA plans to implement in the \n     next year. Section 3 would accelerate the FAA's current \n     proposed rule on the Certification of Screening Companies. \n     The rule is intended to improve aviation security by \n     requiring companies and air carriers that provide security \n     screening to be certified by the FAA. Section 4 would also \n     accelerate a number of requirements on air carriers to \n     improve security at access control points at airports. Most \n     significantly, the section would require air carriers to \n     develop and implement programs that foster and reward \n     compliance with access control requirements. Because S. 2440 \n     would accelerate implementation of those new mandates, air \n     carriers and security screening companies would incur some \n     compliance costs months earlier compared to current law.\n       Third, Section 6 would require the FAA to gradually \n     increase the random selection factor in the Computer-Assisted \n     Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) at airports where bulk \n     explosive detection equipment is used. The selection factor \n     controls the number of passengers randomly selected to have \n     their baggage undergo enhanced security checks. If bulk \n     explosive detection equipment is available, it is used for \n     this enhanced security check. If it is not available, the \n     passenger's baggage is placed on the airplane only after the \n     air carrier has confirmed that the passenger is on board.\n       Because only about 5 percent of airports use the bulk \n     explosive detection equipment, enacting Section 6 would, in \n     theory, increase the number of bags that would be checked \n     with the bulk explosive detection equipment in only a few \n     airports. According to the FAA and industry representatives, \n     however, a limitation in CAPPS would not allow an increase in \n     the random factor in a subset of selected airports. All \n     airports would be subject to the increased random factor. \n     Thus, to comply with the mandate air carriers would have to \n     either (1) reprogram their computer systems to selectively \n     increase the random selection factor in airports that use \n     bulk explosive detection equipment or (2) increase the number \n     of bags undergoing enhanced security checks based on the \n     factor whether or not an airport uses such equipment. In \n     either case, air carriers would incur the incremental cost of \n     checking the additional bags at airports that use bulk \n     explosive detection equipment.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: James O'Keeffe (226-\n     2860).

Mr. President, Medicare, that's what seniors and health \ncare providers in Michigan talked\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nabout with me over the August recess--Medicare. Whether it was \nprescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare \nreimbursement restoration so that health care providers can continue to \nprovide quality health care for beneficiaries, or reining in the \nexcesses in this Administration's crusade to ferret out Medicare fraud \nand abuse, even where it does not exist, I have heard the message of my \nconstituents, and that is that Medicare needs to be modernized, \nreformed, and refocused on providing the best health care possible for \nseniors and the disabled.\n  Nowhere has the national debate on Medicare focused more clearly than \non prescription drug costs. The increased reliance on prescription \ndrugs in health care treatments in recent years means seniors are \npaying a much higher portion of their income on drugs. As new drugs \ncome on the market that allow doctors to treat illnesses without \nsurgery, or even allow them to treat illnesses for the first time, the \nresult is that health care has shifted from inpatient hospital services \nfor surgical treatment to outpatient care that utilizes more, better, \nand more specific drugs. The result is that while per unit costs of \ndrugs are expected to increase by an average of 3.2 percent over the \nnext five years, overall drug expenditures are expected to rise by \nalmost 14.5 percent per year as the number of prescriptions per senior \nshoots up by more than 20 percent.\n  But Medicare, developed in the late 1960's, and little changed since \nthen, is still geared primarily towards the antiquated focus on \nintensive, inpatient care, and continues to miss the fundamental shift \ntowards modern care techniques, including prescription drugs. \nComprehensive Medicare reform, such as that outlined in the \nrecommendations of the Bipartisan National Commission on the Future of \nMedicare that embodies choice, competition, and modernization, would \nallow Medicare to continue its guarantee of health coverage, while \nproviding the type of health coverage that a modern senior needs. \nUnfortunately, apparently due to the election cycle games of this \nAdministration, the necessary super-majority could not be mustered to \nreport these proposals to Congress. So, America's seniors continue to \nbe denied without a modern Medicare system, including prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  But these political realities do not lessen the immediacy of the \nproblem, nor the need for this Congress to move now on providing a \nprescription drug benefit. I believe we must move on passing a \nprescription drug coverage plan for Medicare seniors, and pass it now. \nI hear the cry of my colleagues who say this will take the wind out of \nthe sails for needed overall Medicare reform, but that assumes \ncomprehensive reform is possible during this session of Congress. Given \nthe politically charged nature of this election, and the fact that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to find new excuses \nevery week for why they can't vote for even the most non-controversial \nof the appropriations bills, I doubt that will happen. In the short \nterm, Medicare will remain solvent and will be able to provide adequate \nmedical care for seniors. However, Michigan seniors need prescription \ndrug coverage as soon as possible, and I intend to see that happen.\n  Twice this summer, once on my own, and once with a bipartisan group \nof 12 other Senators, I have called upon the Senate Leadership to bring \nto the Senate floor a meaningful prescription drug plan that will not \nonly cover these increasingly expensive drugs, but also ensure that \nsuch a plan does not impose additional costs on our seniors, additional \ncosts that would wipe out any savings the coverage would provide. It \nmakes little sense to me to establish a prescription drug plan that \npays for 50 percent, or even 100 percent, of a senior's drug expenses, \nwhich average about $550 per year, but then saddle them with $600 in \nnew premiums, and have them end up with greater out-of-pocket expenses \nthan if they never had the coverage in the first place. That's not what \nI hear Michigan seniors say they want in a prescription drug plan. No, \nwhat I hear them say is that they want a prescription drug plan that \nwill actually reduce their out-of-pocket expenses, allow them the most \nfreedom and choice in determining their own coverage, and protect them \nfrom unexpectedly high drug expenses, expenses that can make their \ndaily choice one between food and drugs.\n  That's why I am so excited about the prescription drug plan on which \nI have been working with Senators Hagel and McCain as well as the other \ncosponsors, the Medicare Rx Drug Discount and Security Act of 2000, S. \n2836. Of all the plans we have seen presented before this and the other \nChamber, I believe this bill most directly addresses the major issues \nof prescription drug coverage. First, unlike any other bill currently \nbefore Congress, it provides broad and deep discounts for prescription \ndrugs, on average 30-39 percent discounts, through multiple, competing \ndrug discount buying plans. Much has been made over the last few years \nabout the relative price difference American seniors pay for their \nprescription drugs as compared to those paid by their Canadian \ncounterparts, where prices are fixed by the Government. But those \ncomparisons are of the retail price. When the prices paid by Canadian \nseniors are compared to the prices paid by American seniors that are in \ngroup buying plans, the American senior pays less.\n  And these plans are not uncommon. In fact, 71 percent of all \nprescription drugs paid for by third parties have been administered by \nthese group buying plans, such as with the Michigan National Guard's \ndrug insurance coverage plan. Furthermore, many group buying plans are \noffered outside of insurance programs, such as those innovative \nprograms being offered by Macomb and Wayne Counties in Michigan, where \nprice savings of as much as 70 percent on drugs are obtained. But as \nI've pointed out before, Medicare beneficiaries can't take advantage of \nthese savings because the Medicare system still employs the antiquated \npriorities and structures of the days in which it was born.\n  For the average American senior with drug expenses of about $670 per \nyear, in 2002, our plan would provide an immediate savings of $235 per \nyear. And, depending upon the drugs they have prescribed, savings could \nbe as high as 70-85 percent for the more common drugs where usage \nis higher and competing brands more plentiful. Furthermore, there would \nbe even greater market pressure for lower prices under our plan because \nmultiple, competing drug discount plans would be available from which \nseniors could choose. If the particular drugs a senior uses were \ncheaper under another plan, that senior could shift over to that plan, \nand enjoy those better discounts. By allowing the market to drive down \nprices we can provide robust market price discounts that no other plan \nbefore Congress can beat, and which are substantially better than those \noffered under almost every Democrat plan which I've seen. In fact, \nbecause almost every plan that has been offered by Democrats in both \nthe Senate and the House allows for only a single entity to control the \nprice discounting for Medicare seniors, there will be little \ncompetitive pressure to pass along savings to Senior consumers, and \nlittle incentive to even try to get prices down. The Congressional \nBudget Office recognized this during their analysis of the President's \nprescription drug proposal, and determined that drug discounts would \nonly average 12.5 percent, or about a third of those that would be seen \nunder the Hagel-Abraham plan.\n\n  But reducing the price of drugs is only half of the prescription drug \nequation. The other half is ensuring that Medicare provides the needed \nprotections for Seniors against expensive drug treatments that may \nforce them to decide between putting bread on the table or taking a \nlife-saving drug. And the Hagel-Abraham bill does just that with the \nbest catastrophic drug coverage of any bill before Congress. By tiering \nthe coverage to income, we assure all seniors they will not be \nfinancially devastated by drug expenses for some of the new treatments \nthat can approach $500 per month.\n  Here is how the prescription drug costs caps break down under the \nHagel-Abraham plan. Seniors earning less than 200 percent of poverty, \n$16,700 for a single and $22,500 for a couple, would pay no more than \n$1,200 annually. All drug expenses after that would be covered by the \nFederal Government. For those seniors that earn more than that, but \nbelow 400 percent of poverty, $33,400 for singles and $45,000 for \ncouples, costs\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nwould be limited to $2,500 annually. And Seniors above 400 percent of \nthe poverty level, up to $100,000 for singles and $200,000 for couples, \nwould pay no more than $5,000 annually. Although some of my colleagues \nmay believe that prescription drug insurance should be available to all \nMedicare beneficiaries, and that the government should subsidize the \ninsurance of even the wealthiest Americans, I don't think it makes \nsense to subsidize the drug expenditures for those single seniors \nmaking more than $100,000, and those couples making more than $200,000, \nespecially considering they have much easier access to private \ninsurance coverage.\n  What makes this proposal particularly attractive, in my opinion, is \nthat it does not require seniors to pay hundreds of dollars in new \nMedicare premiums, premiums that could be greater than their actual \ndrug expenses. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has determined \nthat when the President's prescription drug proposal is fully \nimplemented, seniors will have to pay more almost $600 per year in new \nMedicare premiums, on top of the $88 per month they will have to pay \nfor their existing Part B Medicare coverage. I can't see how that can \nbe a good deal for America's seniors. CBO also recently scored the drug \nproposal offered by Senator Robb as an amendment to the Senate's Labor-\nHHS Appropriations Bill. That proposal would, according to CBO, \nincrease Medicare's financing gap between revenues and outlays by 25 \npercent, while imposing new premiums of $80 per month, or $960 per \nyear! Forcing America's seniors to pay almost $1,000 per year, just to \nhave the privilege of participating in this big-government drug \nprogram, is wrong, flat-out wrong. And it will most likely wipe out any \nsavings they would gain from the coverage in the first place. I believe \nby the time these plans were fully implemented, Michigan seniors would \nbe wishing for the ``good ol' days'' where the government wasn't \nproviding them such ``great'' coverage that forced them to spend more \nthan they did before.\n  I am not merely railing against these plans because they represent a \nbig-government view of legislating. No, it's that I am deeply concerned \nwith the record of the Health Care Financing Administration and its \nexisting prescription drug programs. The fact of the matter is that \nHCFA's centralized, top-down, bureaucratic method of providing it's \ncurrent inpatient drug benefit has led to drug rationing, cutbacks in \ncoverage, and price fixing. Just recently this Administration announced \nthat it intends to cut back coverage of cancer-fighting drugs \nadministered in doctors' offices and set the price for those drugs by \nExecutive fiat, even while it says that it's proposed additional drug \ncoverage will not result in these same things. There is no escaping the \nfact that when the government controls all aspects of prescription drug \ninsurance the quality of care and access are placed in jeopardy. It has \nbeen happening in Canada and we cannot allow that to happen to whatever \nnew prescription drug coverage we provide.\n  But we are taking action to stop the Administration's attempts to cut \nback cancer drug coverage for sick seniors. I am cosponsoring with \nSenator Ashcroft the Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will guarantee \nthat HCFA cannot implement any reductions in Medicare reimbursements \nfor outpatient cancer treatment unless those changes are developed in \nconjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and \nrepresentatives of the cancer care community, provides for appropriate \npayment rates for outpatient cancer therapy services, and is \nspecifically authorized by an act of Congress. Furthermore, I am \nsending a letter to the President of the United States today, calling \nupon him to rescind HCFA's plan until such time as such changes can be \nfully examined by the cancer care community and Congress. To think that \nthe Medicare system could stop covering the most effective cancer \ntreatments simply by it's own edict should be a clear warning to all of \nmy colleagues on the dangers in having a single agency control the \naccess to our senior's prescription drugs.\n  And that leads me to the second problem I've been hearing about in \nMichigan the issue of how HCFA and this Administration manage Medicare, \nespecially with regard to reimbursement rates. When I first came to the \nSenate, Medicare was going broke quickly, and was bound for bankruptcy \nby 2001. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 implemented necessary changes \nto contain the growth in Medicare spending to extend the system's \nsolvency until 2015, giving us time to implement necessary structural \nand market-based reforms in Medicare, reforms that can make the program \nviable for generations to come. But those modest reductions in the rate \nof growth for Medicare have become full-blown cuts in the face of this \nAdministration's refusal to spend the money Congress has authorized \nthem to spend.\n\n  In fact, this Administration has short-changed Medicare by $37 \nbillion in the last two years. The Congressional Budget Office's July \n2000 Budget Projection update indicates that Medicare spending this \nyear will be $14 billion below what Congress budgeted, following last \nyear's spending by the Administration of only $209 billion for Medicare \nversus the $232 billion Congress provided. The fact of the matter, is \nthat most reimbursement rates are set by the Administration and HCFA, \nand this Administration has repeatedly refused to spend the money on \nMedicare that Congress has given them. In fact, while the original \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 was expected to reduce Medicare growth by \n$103 billion between 1998 and 2002, this Administration's relentless \nratcheting down of reimbursements over and above that authorized by \nCongress has pushed those cuts to almost $250 billion. And between 2001 \nand 2005, the cuts are expected to be even more dramatic, climbing from \n$163 billion to $457 billion, 280 percent greater than Congress \noriginally intended.\n  The consequences for Michigan's health care industry are devastating. \nAccording to the March 2000 Michigan Health and Hospital Association \nreport, ``The Declining State of Michigan Hospitals'' HCFA's \nimplementation of BBA 97 has cost Michigan hospitals an average of $8.5 \nmillion each. As a result, 68 percent of the hospitals have been forced \nto eliminate at least one service, ranging from urgent care and rural \nhealth clinics, to rehabilitation and pain management centers, to \nscreening and preventative health services. Forty-five percent of all \nthe hospitals have eliminated at least two of the services, and more \nthan half of those who haven't yet eliminated services yet are \nconsidering it for 2000. Previous reports have put the statewide total \nlost hospital revenue at $2.5 billion, or just over $13.5 million per \nhospital.\n  But hospitals are not the only health care provider hit by the \neffects of BBA 97 and the voracious appetite of HCFA bureaucrats. Home \nHeath Care agencies have been particularly hard hit by HCFA policies \nseemingly intent on driving them all out of business. Home health care \nspending was expected to grow by $2 billion even after BBA 97 cost \ncontainment measures, but have dropped by $9 billion, a 54 percent drop \nin just two years. In fact, the number of home health care claims have \ndropped by 50 percent in just two years, and the average payment per \npatient lowered by 38.5 percent, far lower than originally projected \nwith BBA 97. CBO stated this unexpected drop in reimbursements as the \nprimary reason that total Medicare spending dropped last year. Over the \nfour years covered by BBA 97, CBO now expects home health care spending \nto be reduced by $69 billion, over four times the original $16 billion \nthat they originally estimated. Like hospitals, home health care has \nbeen decimated. Over 2,500 home health agencies have closed or stopped \nserving Medicare patients. Moreover, HCFA estimates that nearly 900,000 \nfewer home health patients received services in 1999 than in 1997.\n  Finally, I think we need to look at the effects of this \nAdministration's policies on reimbursements to skilled nursing \nfacilities. Under BBA 97, the rate of growth for skilled nursing \nfacility reimbursements was to be slowed by $19.8 billion between 1998 \nand 2004. However, since that original projection, reimbursements are \nnow expected to fall by an additional $15.8 billion. This even takes \ninto account the $2 billion in reimbursement restorations provided by \nthe Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. For Michigan, the numbers \nare equally disconcerting.\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\n Michigan has lost $643 million in nursing facility reimbursements, \nover and above those projected with BBA 97, over 75 percent more than \noriginally projected. Is it any wonder then, that 25 percent of all \nskilled nursing facilities serving Medicare patients are operating in \nbankruptcy and that why the number one problem for hospital discharge \ncoordinators is that they can't find nursing facilities for their \npatients needing them?\n  We have provided some important reimbursement relief in the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act of 1999. But it was only a first step and by no \nmeans a complete response to the Administration's policies. While \nMedicare reimbursements over the next five years are projected to be \ncut by $295 billion more than originally projected, BBRA 99 only \nrestored about $16 billion of that, or less than 5 percent of the \nadditional cuts. Containing the growth of Medicare was necessary to \nensure Medicare did not go bankrupt, but this continuous, unsustainable \nratcheting down of reimbursements is simply wrong, and we must reverse \nit now. That is why this body must bring to the floor real, \nsubstantive, Medicare reimbursement restoration legislation. And we \nmust do it very soon. We cannot wait until next Congress, or even until \nnext month. We must do it now. Ensuring Medicare's fiscal solvency on \nthe backs of Medicare providers is not only wrong, but \ncounterproductive, and will ultimately lead to the insolvency of \nMedicare's health care guarantees as we know it.\n  I have been working very hard to provide specific reimbursement \nrelief for Michigan's health care providers. First, Senator Hutchison \nof Texas and I have been fighting for two years now to improve the \ninpatient reimbursements for hospitals. Our American Hospital \nPreservation Acts of 1999 and 2000 would do just that. This year's \nversion will restore the entirety of the Market Basket Indicator \ninflation adjustment for inpatient hospital reimbursement rates, \nreturning over $6.9 billion to hospitals over the next five years, and \n$13.5 billion over the next 10. That will in turn mean more than $536 \nmillion in increased reimbursements for Michigan hospitals over the \nnext ten years, or more than $3.4 million per hospital.\n\n  Likewise, I have joined 53 of my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 2365, \nthe Home Health Payment Fairness Act to eliminate the automatic 15 \npercent reduction to home health payments currently scheduled to go \ninto effect on October 1, 2001. The home health care industry cannot \nsurvive with the current reimbursement reductions, let alone another 15 \npercent across-the-board cut. Finally, I am working closely with a \nnumber of my colleagues to craft a bill that will provide for adequate \nnursing home reimbursements through a refinement of the inflation \nadjustment factors. We believe appropriate legislation will be \navailable this week or next, and if any of my colleagues are interested \nin joining this effort, I encourage them to contact me immediately.\n  The third concern I hear from Michiganians about Medicare, is that \neven with the steps we have taken to improve its financial standing and \nthe quality of care, it is still headed towards bankruptcy in the very \nnear future. Seniors in Michigan are scared, scared that they will lose \ntheir Medicare benefits because we cannot modernize Medicare so that it \nwill stay solvent for generations to come. But it looks like things are \ngetting better with Medicare and that at least in the short term, we \nhave the fiscal breathing room to make the necessary changes to avoid a \ntrain wreck down the way.\n  This summer the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance \nTrust Fund issued a correction to their 2000 Annual Report. In it, the \nTrustees reported that the financial projections were more favorable \nthan those made in 1999, that the Trust Fund income exceeded \nexpenditures for the second year in a row, and that the Fund now met \nthe Trustees' test of short-range financial adequacy. In fact, income \nis now projected to continue to exceed expenditures for the next 17 \nyears, a substantial increase over previous estimates.\n  Now 2017 is still too soon for us to rest in our efforts to ensure \nthe permanent solvency of Medicare through market-based modernization \nand reform, as well as provide seniors' access to the full spectrum of \nhealth care options. First, we need to shift Medicare from a centrally-\ncontrolled government system to a market-based system, one that \nmaximizes choice and can best respond to changing medical care needs, \nsuch as recommended by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future \nof Medicare.\n  Second, to ensure that we don't raid the Medicare Trust Funds to pay \nfor non-Medicare spending, as repeatedly proposed by this \nAdministration, we need to wall off the Medicare Trust Fund surpluses \nso that they can only be used for Medicare. I have been proud to vote \nfor a Medicare lockbox proposal. But recent analysis by conservative \ngroups such as the Heritage Foundation, and liberal groups such as the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities have raised serious questions \nabout the efficacy of each of these proposals, and so I will be working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially my fellow \nBudget Committee Members, to draft a Medicare lockbox that not only \nprotects the Medicare surpluses, but also enhances our ability to \nprovide for the long-term solvency of the system. Even after providing \nfor a new prescription drug benefit, and after providing for healthier \nreimbursements for health care providers, we will still have about $110 \nbillion in Medicare surpluses available to fund this reform. Given that \nthe Bipartisan Medicare Commission's reform proposal would actually end \nup costing less than the current Medicare system through competition \nand choice, I believe this is more than adequate to fix our problems \nwith Medicare. Regardless, the Medicare lockbox will ensure those \nsurpluses are still there when the need comes for any funds to finance \nreform.\n  Third, I believe we need to allow Americans to prepare for their \nretirement health care needs outside of Medicare through Medical \nSavings Accounts, or MSAs, long-term care insurance, and existing \nhealth care benefit flexibility. Today's able-bodied workers will be \ntomorrow's seniors, and to the extent that we can set in motion now \nprovisions that will allow them more choices, more options, and more \naccess to quality health care, the healthier our entire retirement \nhealth care system will be, including Medicare. As we all know, MSAs \nare a market-based alternative for quality health care. They offer \nmaximum flexibility for the self-employed, employees, and employers \nwhile reducing the out-of-pocket cost of insurance. MSAs are an \nalternative health insurance plan with real cost-control benefits for \nthe millions of Americans who have been forced into managed care and \nfeel they have lost control of their health care decisions. By \nestablishing these MSAs now, tomorrow's seniors will have sizable \nbalances available in their retirement years to supplement whatever \ncoverage is available under Medicare. To that end, I believe we should \nmake MSAs permanent and affordable by removing eligibility \nrestrictions, including allowing Federal employees to have MSAs, \nlowering the minimum deductible, permitting both employer and employee \nMSA contributions, and allowing MSAs in cafeteria plans. Furthermore, I \nbelieve we should also waive the 15 percent penalty tax on non-medical \ndistributions if the remaining balance at least equals the plan \ndeductible.\n  As for long-term care insurance, I support legislation phasing-in 100 \npercent deductibility of long-term care insurance premiums, when they \nare not substantially subsidized by an employer. Under my plan, \nindividuals age 60 and older would not be subject to such a phase-in \nperiod, and would qualify for 100 percent deductibility immediately. I \nbelieve we should also allow long-term care insurance to be offered as \na cafeteria plan benefit. By providing for more accessible long-term \ncare options, retirees can build insurance against the catastrophic \nexpenses of long-term home and nursing facility care that is becoming \nincreasingly difficult to obtain under Medicare.\n  Finally, we should allow for greater health insurance plan \nflexibility, especially with regards to the multipurpose Flexible \nSpending Accounts. Flexible Spending Accounts and cafeteria plans have \nbecome a popular means of providing health benefits to employees, but \nunder current law, unused benefits are forfeited. This ``use it or lose \nit''\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\nrule has limited the appeal of these plans as well as forfeiting \nsubstantial amounts of money that could be available for retirement \nhealth care needs. I support legislation which will allow transferring \nup to $500 in unused Flexible Spending Account balances from one year \nto the next, or to roll-over that amount into an IRA, 401(k) retirement \nplan, or a Medical Savings Account.\n\n  All of these proposals will help retirees better plan for and provide \nfor their health care needs. But regardless of these supplemental \nprograms, Medicare will still be at the base of any retirees health \ncare program. That's why it's even more heartening to see in the \ncorrected Medicare Trustees' report that some of the more drastic \nmeasures we once thought would be required are no longer necessary to \nkeep Medicare sound. For example, in 1997, when Medicare was on the \nverge of bankruptcy by 2001, many of us, on a bipartisan basis, voted \nin favor of a limited move to raise the retirement age for Medicare \neligibility from 65 to 67 years of age starting in 2003 and phased-in \nover the following twenty-four years. We did that on a near emergency \nbasis, because the Medicare system was threatened. But I noted at the \ntime, if the situation improved, such a change would not be necessary. \nIn my opinion, that is now the case, and that kind of approach no \nlonger needs to be considered in light of the improved financial \ncondition of Medicare and the emergence of significant Medicare trust \nfund surpluses.\n  In fact, at the time I cast my vote on this question, I entered into \nthe Record on July 14, 1997, a number of prerequisites which I \nindicated would have to be met in order for me to support the actual \nimplementation of the proposal. In that none of these prerequisites--\nthe development of a viable system for low- and middle-income seniors \nto obtain and maintain affordable health care until eligible for \nMedicare, as well as concurrence by the National Bipartisan Medicare \nCommission on the Future of Medicare on raising the eligibility age--\nhave been addressed in the two to three year time-frame that I set \nforth in my statement, I have withdrawn my support for raising the \neligibility age. I no longer believe this change is necessary in light \nof the improved financial status of Medicare, or prudent in light of \nthe failure of its sponsors to adequately address the concerns I \nraised.\n  Finally, the fourth Medicare issue on which I have been inundated \nwith complaints is how hard it is to navigate the regulatory complexity \nof the Medicare system. I have heard from doctors and hospital \nadministrators, home health care agencies and skilled nursing \nfacilities, about how even a simple mistake, or even a difference of \nopinion, can embroil them in legal controversies that take years to \nresolve, and many times more in legal bills than the amount of the \noriginally contested bill. HCFA has now produced over 111,000 pages of \nMedicare regulations, three times the size of the incredibly complex \nInternal Revenue Code. These regulations make it nearly impossible to \noperate efficiently, and make simple administrative errors appear to be \ncriminal fraud. In fact, on August 10th, 1998, Dr. Robert Walker, \npresident emeritus of the Mayo Foundation, told the National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare, ``The public has been led to \nbelieve that the, Medicare, program is riddled with fraud, when in \nreality, complexity is the root of the problem. This has contributed to \nthe continuing erosion in public confidence in our health care system. \nWe must all have zero tolerance for real fraud, but differences in \ninterpretation and honest mistakes are not fraud.''\n  Recently, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons \nconducted a survey of its members as to the impact of HCFA regulations \non their ability to treat patients. They found that it costs on average \n27 percent more to process a Medicare claim as it does a private health \ninsurer claim, and that doctors and their staffs spend more than a \nfifth of their time on Medicare compliance issues. Furthermore, more \nthan half of all doctors say they will retire from active patient care \nat a younger age because of ``increased hassles with Medicare.'' This \nis bad news for Medicare seniors, as further pointed out by the survey. \nAlmost a quarter of all doctors are no longer accepting new Medicare \npatients, and of those that do, 34 percent are restricting services to \nthose patients, such as difficult surgical procedures or comprehensive \nmedical work-ups. Last, these are not changes simply to stop previously \nfraudulent activity. Thirty-eight percent of all doctors surveyed \nstated they submitted Medicare claims that they knew were for less than \nfor which they were entitled, or ``downcoding'' in the Medicare \nregulatory parlance, but did not want to subject themselves to the \npotential of erroneous HCFA reviews and claim denials. Similar \n``downcoding'' results have been found with hospitals who deny patients \nthe most appropriate regimen of care in complex cases because they do \nnot believe they will be fully reimbursed by Medicare if they submit \nsuch a complex care claim.\n  That is why on July 27, I introduced S. 2999, the Health Care \nProviders Bill of Rights, a bill aimed at addressing the numerous \nregulatory and law enforcement abuses in the Medicare system that have \nbrought to my attention by Michigan health care providers. This bill \naddresses many of the specific regulatory ``hassles'' experienced by \ndoctors and providers everyday as they try to provide the best possible \ncare for our Seniors.\n  The bill is divided into six titles: Title I--Reform of HCFA \nRegulatory Process; Title II--Reform of Appeals Process; Title III--\nReform of Overpayment Procedure; Title IV--Reform of Voluntary \nDisclosure Procedure; Title V--Criminal Law Enforcement Reforms; and \nTitle VI--Provider Compliance Education.\n  Provisions that should be of particular interest to my colleagues are \nthose that rescind HCFA's ability to withhold future reimbursements in \norder to offset alleged prior underpayments, a strict 180 day time line \nfor completion of the Medicare administrative appeals cases, placing \nprogram participation terminations and suspensions in abeyance while \nappeals are pending, prohibiting the use of sample audit results to \nreduce future reimbursement rates, stopping overpayment collections \nwhile appeals are pending, and establishing voluntary disclosure \nprocedures that also bring the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys \ninto the process, as well as providing safe harbor from prosecution for \nthose that enter into and abide by the voluntary disclosure \nrequirements.\n\n  Some further provisions that were specifically recommended by \nproviders include requiring HCFA, fiscal intermediaries, and carriers \nto all spend a portion of their Medicare funds on provider education, \nrequiring them to provide legally binding advisory opinions on Medicare \ncoverage, billing, documentation, coding, and cost reporting \nrequirements, as well as extending the current anti-kickback, civil \nmonetary penalty, and physician self-referral advisory opinion \nrequirements that are set to expire August 21st of this year.\n  A number of organizations have expressed their strong support for \nthis legislation, including the Michigan Health & Hospital Association, \nthe Federation of American Hospitals, the National Association for Home \nCare, the American Federation of Home Care Providers, the Healthcare \nLeadership Council, and the American Health Care Association. I ask \nunanimous consent these letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Michigan Health &\n\n\n                                         Hospital Association,\n\n                                      Lansing, MI, August 9, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Michigan Health and Hospital \n     Association (MHA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on \n     the Health Care Provider Bill of Rights and Access Assurance \n     Act. The legislation includes many provisions aimed at \n     ensuring that health care providers are treated in a fair, \n     equitable and civil manner.\n       Michigan's hospitals and health systems must contend with \n     an array of complex Medicare laws and regulations. Too often, \n     Medicare billing errors, due to confusing and conflicting \n     regulations and instructions, are presumed to be purposeful \n     and intentional acts. Title I of the bill positively \n     addresses this regulatory maze, mandating that the Health \n     Care Financing Administration follow clear and specific \n     procedures when issuing regulations.\n       Another provision that will be particularly beneficial is \n     the inclusion of criminal law enforcement reform. \n     Establishing specific\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\n     search warrant rules as well as revising current law \n     enforcement powers of the Health and Human Services Office of \n     Inspector General will greatly assist in minimizing any \n     disruption of patient care or threats to the confidentiality \n     of patient records.\n       We commend you for addressing these areas of concern. The \n     MHA also would like to express its gratitude for your \n     leadership on hospital issues as we work to maintain the \n     highest quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Peters,\n     Vice President, Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Federation of American Hospitals,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Federation of American Hospitals \n     commends you for your work to clarify and improve the \n     regulatory burdens and administration of the Medicare \n     program. The regulatory burden health care providers face is \n     massive, growing every day, and diverts us from our primary \n     mission of delivering high quality health care to the \n     patients in our communities. Hospitals and other health care \n     providers take their responsibility to comply with Medicare \n     laws and regulations very seriously and have devoted \n     significant amounts of energy and resources to these \n     obligations. While HHS has been diligent in its efforts to \n     implement an unprecedented number of regulatory changes in \n     the program, more work is needed to address problem areas in \n     the current administration of the Medicare Program and to \n     develop a more active partnership with health care providers \n     to promote the integrity of the Program.\n       The ``Health Care Provider Bill of Rights and Access \n     Assurance Act'' proposes some important changes to the status \n     quo to address some key problem areas. One of the most \n     important checks and balances on the validity of the \n     regulations HCFA promulgates is the ability of health care \n     providers to challenge those regulations in a court of law \n     when they believe that the regulations are excessive, \n     unconstitutional, beyond the scope of statutory authority or \n     have been promulgated in violation of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. This legislation solidifies timely judicial \n     review of these challenges. Another important provision in \n     the legislation promotes greater health care provider \n     participation in program integrity efforts by improving the \n     voluntary disclosure and overpayment repayment processes.\n       The bill also contributes to health care provider education \n     and compliance efforts by providing for the reauthorization \n     of the existing advisory opinion provisions subject to expire \n     in August and setting some new advisory opinion requirements. \n     The existing advisory opinion statutes provide guidance on \n     the application of the antikickback and physician self-\n     referral laws. The bill also adds a new requirement that \n     HCFA, acting through its contractors, provide written answers \n     to health care providers on nuts and bolts billing, coding \n     and cost report questions. In a program this complex, errors \n     are likely and providers need greater assistance to navigate \n     the myriad of law, regulation and policy. Hospitals want to \n     be active partners in the effort to promote program integrity \n     and hope to work closely with HCFA and its program integrity \n     partners on education and prevention efforts.\n       We appreciate your interest in these matters and look \n     forward to working with you on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Scully,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                for Home Care,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Home Care (NAHC), the nation's largest organization \n     representing home care providers and the patients they serve, \n     I want to extend my sincerest appreciation and support for \n     your legislation, ``The Health Care Provider Bill of Rights \n     and Access Assurance Act.'' This legislation to reform the \n     regulatory processes used by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration (HCFA) to administer the Medicare program is \n     greatly needed.\n       Home health agencies are currently instituting an \n     overwhelming number of administrative changes. Many of these \n     changes are costly and significantly increase the workloads \n     of already strained agency staffs, affecting the ability of \n     agencies to retain staff and continue to provide high-\n     quality, appropriate care. HCFA frequently ignores public \n     notice and comment requirements in implementing programmatic \n     changes, and often underestimates or downplays the impact of \n     new requirements on struggling agencies. As a result, \n     providers are subject to onerous and burdensome requirements \n     without an opportunity for input, and are given insufficient \n     time to make operational changes in order to comply with \n     regulations.\n       This legislation would ensure public input in HCFA's \n     regulatory process and prevent arbitrary actions and \n     erroneous decisions by HCFA from having a devastating impact \n     on home care providers and their patients before corrective \n     action is taken. Too often today home care agencies are \n     bankrupted and their patients lose care before faulty \n     policies are corrected. This bill would provide an \n     opportunity to correct errors before irreparable harm is \n     done. It would also prevent sanctions for conduct which \n     providers did not know was against the rules. Providers have \n     every intention of following the rules, but they must have \n     advance notice of what the rules are.\n       The Medicare home health benefit is at great risk due to \n     severe financial reductions and onerous and unnecessary \n     administrative burdens. Direct intervention by the Congress \n     is necessary to ensure the integrity and future of this \n     important and popular benefit. We deeply appreciate your \n     concern for home health patients and those who care for them. \n     Enactment of the provisions in this bill would make a major \n     contribution to expanding access to home health care and \n     strengthening the home care infrastructure. Our hats are off \n     to you for this groundbreaking legislation.\n       With best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Val Halamandaris,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Healthcare Leadership\n\n\n                                                      Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the Healthcare \n     Leadership Council (HLC), I would like to express our deep \n     appreciation for your proposal to help health care providers \n     comply with Medicare's increasingly burdensome regulatory \n     maze.\n       The HLC is a chief executive coalition of over 50 of the \n     largest health care organizations in the country, including \n     hospital systems, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and \n     medical device companies. The HLC has zero tolerance for true \n     fraud and abuse. True fraud and abuse in our health care \n     system undermines quality, threatens patients' trust and \n     should not be tolerated.\n       However, the public's confidence in the nation's health \n     care system has been eroded by headlines of health care fraud \n     investigations that are most often not the result of true, \n     intentional fraud--but rather errors or misunderstandings due \n     to countless, complex regulations. We believe strongly that \n     Medicare's complexity actually undermines compliance and, \n     ultimately, the quality of patient care.\n       The Provider Bill of Rights and Access Assurance Act \n     contains several provisions that will improve communication \n     and relations among Medicare's providers, regulators, and \n     enforcers. Provisions that we particularly support are those \n     that would expand providers' appeals rights, coordinate \n     voluntary disclosure procedures among enforcement agencies, \n     and educate providers regarding the application of certain \n     regulations through advisory opinions and other means.\n       The Healthcare Leadership Council commends you for your \n     leadership on this very important issue and we stand ready to \n     help you further refine this legislation so that it will \n     serve to greatly improve the Medicare program for providers \n     and patients alike.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mary R. Grealy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            American Federation of\n\n\n                                     HomeCare Providers, Inc.,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, July 25, 2000.\n     Sen. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The American Federation of HomeCare \n     Providers is pleased to endorse your legislation, the \n     ``Medicare Provider Bill of Rights.''\n       Our members are small business health care providers who \n     say that they would much rather deal with the Internal \n     Revenue Service than with the Health Care Financing \n     Administration (HCFA) and its contractors. Home care \n     businesses have no rights that the Fiscal Intermediaries, \n     carriers, and state surveyors appear to feel obligated to \n     respect. There is no penalty for incorrect contractor \n     decisions and no viable system to resolve disputes. Even \n     instances of blatant abuse of providers and beneficiaries go \n     without remedy because there is nothing to hold HCFA and its \n     agents accountable when they are wrong and when their \n     behavior goes beyond the bounds of ethical and legal \n     behavior. Contractors routinely refuse to consider \n     documentation, deny that they received records sent by \n     providers, deny the obvious wording of the law and \n     regulation, and sometimes even refuse to abide by court \n     decisions.\n       Health care providers also believe that speaking out for \n     the right of patients to receive an appropriate level of care \n     and standing up for their own rights become grounds to target \n     them for harassment. They believe that they are held to 100 \n     percent standards of excellence and accuracy, which they are \n     proud to meet, and those who serve as HCFA's contractors are \n     held to no standards of excellence and accuracy in their \n     dealings with the provider community. It is now time to \n     ensure due process rights so that conscientious health care \n     companies, who render critical and appropriate services in \n     their communities and abide by the tenets of the Medicare law \n     and regulation, are not subject to arbitrary and abusive \n     behavior that has the potential to put them out of business, \n     literally on the spot. Favorable decisions by Administrative \n     Law Judges are of little comfort to a home health agency that \n     has unjustifiably been shut down, on specious surveyor claims \n     that it does not meet the Medicare Conditions of \n     Participation, or\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n     by massive statistical sampling overpayment assessments, \n     later overturned on appeal.\n       Medicare providers must be accorded the same type of \n     protections that Congress saw fit to enact for the American \n     pubic in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We believe that your \n     legislation would do just that.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Ann B. Howard,\n     Vice President for Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the American Health Care \n     Association (AHCA), a federation of state affiliates \n     representing more than 12,000 non-profit and for-profit \n     nursing facility, assisted living, residential care, \n     intermediate care for the mentally retarded, and subacute \n     care providers I am writing to thank you and express our \n     support for your legislation, The Health Care Provider Bill \n     of Rights and Access Assurance Act.\n       This legislation is extremely important to long term care \n     providers for a number of reasons. Recently, in, Shalala v. \n     Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., the U.S. Supreme \n     Court ruled that virtually all challenges to the legality of \n     Medicare regulations or policy must be brought through the \n     same Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'') \n     administrative review process used to address individual \n     provider reimbursement and certification issues before \n     proceeding to federal court. The Court's decision means that \n     a provider or beneficiary cannot challenge the legality of \n     any Medicare regulation or policy without accepting an \n     adverse agency action and proceeding through a time-consuming \n     and costly administrative process. It is particularly \n     problematic for nursing homes because many components of \n     HHS's survey and enforcement regulations and policies \n     conflict with federal law and are fundamentally flawed. Your \n     legislation would give Medicare providers the right to \n     challenge directly the constitutionality and statutory \n     authority of HCFA's regulations and policies.\n       Additionally, the bill will suspend the termination and \n     sanction process while appeals on deficiencies are pending, \n     as well as prohibit the public dissemination of deficiency \n     determinations while an appeal is pending, absent clear and \n     convincing evidence of criminal activity. In the current \n     survey system, skilled nursing facilities are cited and then \n     may be terminated for highly questionable deficiencies which \n     do not present a risk to resident health and safety. \n     Additionally, these citations may be posted on a public \n     website and this plus the risk of closure of a facility can \n     confuse and scare the residents and their families. Your bill \n     would prevent facilities from closing while they appeal a \n     citation. Also, the bill establishes precedence for \n     administrative appeals so that providers will have an \n     affirmative defense in appeals where other providers have \n     gone through similar appeals. This would add must needed \n     certainly to the complex rules and regulations under the \n     Medicare program. We appreciate your commitment to this \n     important provision.\n       Among many other provisions in the legislation, the bill \n     will make needed changes to the False Claims Act. It will \n     require that claims brought under the Act for damages alleged \n     to have been sustained by the government must be of a \n     material amount, which will limit False Claims Act claims to \n     those that have a significant impact on the Medicare program.\n       Senator Abraham, we commend your efforts and praise your \n     leadership. As the nation's largest association of long term \n     care providers, AHCA is available to assist you in any way \n     that we can to advance this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Charles H. Roadman II, M.D.,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am continuing to reach out to additional organizations \nto garner their support, as well as to my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin Senators Cochran of Mississippi and Senator Grams of Minnesota as \ncosponsors. Furthermore, Members of the other body will soon introduce \ncompanion legislation to S. 2999 in the hope that we can incorporate \nthese necessary reforms in a Medicare reimbursement restoration bill or \nother reform legislation that may pass this Congress. Finally, I am \njoining Senator Craig in calling on the Senate Finance Committee to \nhold immediate hearings on this legislation, and the broader issue of \nHCFA regulatory complexity. With this legislation, I believe we can \nbreak down one of the primary obstacles to assuring access to quality \nhealth care in this country, the seemingly unfettered abuses of \nMedicare bureaucrats against doctors and providers alike. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me on this important measure.\n  I believe I have laid out a comprehensive and sensible policy for \nensuring the continued viability of Medicare. Medicare has provided \nmillions of seniors access to quality health care where otherwise they \nwould go without. But more must be done, and must be done soon: we must \nmodernize Medicare so that it provides for coverage of prescription \ndrug expenses; we must improve reimbursements to providers so that \nreform and cost containment does not come at the expense of the very \naccess to health care Medicare is trying to provide; we must implement \ncomprehensive Medicare reform that improves beneficiaries choices in \ntheir health care decisions, mirrors the health care needs of the \nmodern senior, and is fiscally sound for generations to come; and we \nmust rein in the abusive and incredibly complex bureaucratic behemoth \nthat has crippled health care providers' ability to operate efficiently \nin the Medicare system. We can do all of this, but time is running very \nshort. Our seniors need these changes, and the time to act is now.\n  I ask unanimous consent a section-by-section analysis of the measure \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      THE ABRAHAM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS (S. 2999)\n\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n                       Title I--Regulatory Reform\n\n     Section 101. Prohibiting the Retroactive Application of \n         Regulations\n       Providers have complained that HCFA, its Financial \n     Intermediaries (FI's; the private firms that administer the \n     Part A payments), and its carriers (the private firms that \n     administer the Part B payments), issue retroactive rules and \n     policies that are not subject to the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. In fact, they show where HCFA has often \n     issued these rules and policies rather than regulations \n     specifically to avoid the requirements of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act (public hearings, public discussion periods, \n     publication in the Federal Register, etc.), and that they do \n     so retroactively. This section will prohibit HCFA from \n     issuing anything regarding the legal standards governing the \n     scope of benefits, the payments rates, or eligibility rules \n     except by regulation, and then only prospectively, so that no \n     retroactive regulations are issued.\n     Section 102. Requiring HCFA to Follow Normal Regulation \n         Issuance Procedures\n       Providers also complain about how HCFA circumvents the \n     Administrative Procedures Act regulatory process by issuing \n     interim final rules, which are implemented without the public \n     discussion period and hearings, under emergency powers called \n     the ``Good Cause'' clause, but fails to provide any \n     justification other than simply that they have good cause. In \n     order to prevent these tautologies from continuing, this \n     section prohibits HCFA from issuing interim final regulations \n     that haven't gone through the normal regulation public \n     vetting process.\n     Section 103. GAO Report on HCFA Compliance with Regulatory \n         Procedure Laws\n       Given the extensive reports of HCFA abusing its regulatory \n     issuance authority, this section directs GAO to conduct an \n     audit of, and report to Congress within 18 months on, HCFA's \n     compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act and the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n     Section 104. Providing for Summary Judicial Challenges of \n         HCFA Regulations on Constitutional or Other Broad Grounds\n       Before the Supreme Court Decision of Shalala v. Illinois \n     Council this spring, providers had a right to prospective \n     judicial challenges to HCFA regulations they thought were \n     either unconstitutional or were beyond HCFA's statutory \n     authority to issue. After this decision, however, the only \n     recourse providers have to challenge these regulations is to \n     wait until they are found in violation, then appeal the HCFA \n     decision. This section reestablishes a prospective regulatory \n     and judicial challenge process of those HCFA regulations to \n     challenge the constitutionality or statutory authority of a \n     regulation, or to preemptively challenge an interim final \n     rule issued under the Good Cause clause.\n     Section 105. Delineating Procedures for National Coverage \n         Determination Changes\n       There is a regulatory process that is exempt from even the \n     currently liberal HCFA regulatory issuance rules, called \n     National Coverage Determinations. These determine what will, \n     and will not, be covered by the Medicare program, and can \n     change rules on what medical procedures that will be covered \n     rules overnight. This section establishes a National Coverage \n     Determination review process that requires a 30-day prior \n     notice of initiating such a process, and allows for adequate \n     public comment before implementing the new coverage \n     determination.\n\n                    Title II--Appeals Process Reform\n\n     Section 201. Expanding Providers' Overpayment Appeal Rights\n       Current appeal regulations only allow providers three \n     options when HCFA tells them\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\n     they have been overpaid: admit the overpayment and pay it; \n     submit evidence in mitigation to reduce the amount of alleged \n     overpayment but waive all appeal rights; or appeal the \n     decision, but be subjected to a Statistically Valid Random \n     Sample Audit (SVRS), a process which essentially shuts the \n     provider down. This section will allow providers to exercise \n     the second option (submitting evidence in mitigation) without \n     waiving their appeal rights.\n     Section 202. Deadlines for Appeal Adjudication\n       This section requires the Medicare appeals process to be \n     completed within 180 days, 90 days for the Administrative Law \n     Judge first level appeal and 90 days for the Departmental \n     Appeals Board second level appeal. Where the appeals process \n     does not meet these deadlines, this section provides for the \n     appeals process to be automatically advanced to the next \n     stage.\n     Section 203. Provider Appeals on the Part of Deceased \n         Beneficiaries\n       This section allows providers to pursue appeals on behalf \n     of deceased beneficiaries where no substitute party is \n     available.\n     Section 204. Suspending Terminations and Sanctions During \n         Appeals\n       Currently, if HCFA makes a determination that a provider is \n     abiding by HCFA standards, it can terminate that provider's \n     participation in Medicare, publicly disseminate that \n     deficiency information, and impose sanctions short of \n     termination, even if the provider appeals the determination. \n     This section suspends the termination and sanction process \n     while appeals on deficiencies are pending, as well as \n     prohibits the public dissemination of deficiency \n     determinations while the appeal is pending, absent clear and \n     convincing evidence of criminal activity.\n     Section 205. Establishing Precedence for Administrative \n         Appeals\n       Ninety-eight percent of all appeals that are adjudicated at \n     the first level of the appeals process (the Administrative \n     Law Judge level), are determined in favor of the provider. \n     This appears to be due in large part because HCFA apparently \n     tries to squeeze providers into not fighting overpayment \n     determinations in the hope that some providers simply will \n     pay rather than fight. This section will give Departmental \n     Appeals Board decisions national precedence in the Medicare \n     appeals process so that providers will not have to fight the \n     same appeal over and over.\n     Section 206. Safe Harbor for Substantial Compliance With HCFA \n         Procedures\n       Providers can try their very best to comply with HCFA \n     regulations but then be told by HCFA that they have violated \n     some policy or rule, and be subject to fines and overpayment \n     determinations. This section gives providers protection from \n     HCFA action where a claim was submitted by a provider in \n     reliance on erroneous information or written statements \n     supplied by a Federal agency.\n     Section 207. GAO Audit of HCFA's Statistical Sampling \n         Procedures\n       HCFA bases much of its compliance determinations on \n     statistical sample audits, either through random audits as \n     part of the Medicare Integrity Program, or through \n     overpayment audits. However, there is substantial evidence \n     that HCFA's statistical sampling procedures do not follow \n     generally accepted procedures, and don't interpret the data \n     in a statistically valid manner. This section direct GAO to \n     conduct an audit of HCFA's (and its Financial Intermediaries' \n     and Carriers') statistical sampling and utilization \n     procedures.\n\n                Title III--Overpayment Procedure Reform\n\n     Section 301. Prohibit Retroactive Overpayment Determinations \n         through New Policies\n       HCFA currently has the authority to change policy \n     interpretations and implement them so as to make retroactive \n     overpayments determinations, even though the previous policy \n     may have allowed the charges. This section bars HCFA from \n     making overpayment determinations based upon the retroactive \n     application of a new policy interpretation.\n     Section 302. Prohibit Reductions of Future Payments Based on \n         Sample Audits of Past Claims\n       HCFA currently reduces future payments by whatever error \n     rate they derive from their statistical sample audits, even \n     where there is no evidence that the pending or future \n     payments are similarly in error, they simply assume that they \n     are so, even if under appeal. Furthermore, the provider has \n     no way to stop that withholding until the appeal is decided \n     in their favor. This section bars HCFA from making such \n     blanket withholdings from future payments, without clear and \n     convincing evidence of fraud.\n     Section 303. Prohibit Withholding of Underpayments or Future \n         Payments for Past Overpayments\n       In addition to withholding future payments by whatever \n     error rate a HCFA sample audits produce, HCFA also regularly \n     withholds underpayments owed the provider, as well as the \n     full amount of future payments, and applies them to past \n     overpayments, regardless of whether the provider is appealing \n     the overpayment determination, or has entered into a \n     repayment agreement. This can effectively strangle a \n     provider's entire revenue flow, and has forced many providers \n     into bankruptcy, even when such overpayments are being \n     appealed. This section prohibits HCFA from withholding \n     underpayments or future payments to pay for past \n     overpayments, unless clear and convincing evidence of fraud \n     exists.\n     Section 304. Suspend Overpayment Collections While Appeals \n         are Pending\n       Even if a provider decides to be subjected to the lengthy \n     and expensive appeals process, they are still required to \n     immediately repay HCFA for alleged overpayments. This section \n     suspends overpayment recoupment while appeals are pending. \n     Given that appeals will be expedited under this bill to 180 \n     days, the Medicare system will still have timely access to \n     any overpayment funds.\n\n            Title IV--Voluntary Disclosure Procedure Reform\n\n     Section 401. Effective Voluntary Disclosure Procedures\n       Many times the first person to discover that a provider has \n     been overpaid or has not been in compliance with Medicare \n     regulations is the provider himself. However, the Department \n     of Health and Human Services voluntary disclosure procedures \n     still allow the Attorney General and U.S. Attorneys to use \n     the exact same information provided by the provider to the \n     Department Office of Inspector General under the current \n     voluntary disclosure process against the provider for \n     prosecution. This section directs the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services (HCFA's parent department) and the Attorney \n     General to make joint voluntary disclosure procedures which \n     provide a safe harbor from prosecution for providers who \n     report the violation so long as these agencies haven't \n     already approached them about the possible violation or \n     overpayment, and there isn't previously and independently \n     obtained clear and convincing evidence of fraud.\n\n                Title V--Criminal Law Enforcement Reform\n\n     Section 501. Rescind Law Enforcement Powers of HHS OIG \n         Investigators\n       Currently, the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     Office of Inspector General investigators are the enforcement \n     arm of the Medicare program for HCFA, and are deputized by \n     the U.S. Marshal Service to execute those duties. This has \n     turned into their being granted near carte blanche authority \n     for enforcing Medicare laws and regulations. With that, it is \n     increasingly evident that OIG investigators may abuse that \n     power, such as raiding hospitals and physicians offices with \n     the same tactics that SWAT teams use on crack houses. This \n     section rescinds OIG's deputation, and bars those \n     investigators from carrying weapons in the execution of their \n     duties.\n     Section 502. Codify More Stringent Search Warrant Rules for \n         Health Care Facilities\n       Many health care providers who find themselves on the wrong \n     side of an HHS OIG investigation are subjected to \n     unnecessarily intrusive search warrant executions, with \n     doctors and nurses accosted by gun-wielding investigators, \n     and patients removed from medical care. This section codifies \n     search warrant rules that so as to protect the \n     confidentiality of medical records, the provider-patient \n     relationship, and the uninterrupted continuation of medical \n     care. Specifically, it requires the law enforcement agency \n     requesting the search warrant to take the least intrusive \n     approach to executing the warrant, consistent with vigorous \n     and effective law enforcement. It also directs the law \n     enforcement agency seeking the warrant to work closely with \n     the Department of Justice and the relevant U.S. Attorney's \n     office to ensure the warrant is indeed necessary and that the \n     search minimizes disruption to patient care or threats to the \n     confidentiality of patient records.\n\n                Title VI--Provider Compliance Education\n\n     Section 601. Provider Education Funding\n       This section requires Financial Intermediaries and Carriers \n     to spend 3 percent of their Medicare funds on provider \n     billing and compliance education, and HCFA to dedicate 10% of \n     their Medicare Integrity Program funds to such education, so \n     as to try to decrease the rate of provider non-compliance, as \n     well as over- and under-billing.\n     Section 602. Advisory Opinions for Health Care Providers\n       This section requires HCFA to provide written answers to \n     questions about coverage, billing, documentation, coding, \n     cost reporting and procedures under the Medicare program, \n     answers which can be used as an affirmative defense against \n     an overpayment determination or an allegation of violating \n     Medicare regulations.\n     Section 603. Extension of Existing Advisory Opinion \n         Provisions of Law\n       The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n     (HIPAA) included a provision requiring the Secretary to issue \n     written advisory opinions on certain specified topics under \n     the anti-kickback statute and civil monetary penalty \n     provisions. However, that provision sunsets on August 21st, \n     2000. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97) provides a \n     similar provision regarding the legality of referrals under \n     the physician self-referral laws, which also sunsets August \n     21st, 2000. This section extends these advisory opinion \n     provisions permanently.\n\n                        Supporting Organizations\n\n       Michigan Health & Hospital Association.\n       Federation of American Hospitals.\n       National Association for Home Care.\n       American Federation of Home Care Providers.\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n       Healthcare Leadership Council.\n       American Health Care Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8099-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENTIAL VETO OF THE ESTATE TAX REPEAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I will vote to uphold the President's \nveto of the wildly irresponsible estate tax repeal bill sent to his \ndesk, and I will also continue to support changes in the law that will \nprovide additional relief for the two percent of American families that \nare subject to this law.\n  Under current law, family farms and small business pay no Federal \nestate tax unless their property is worth more than $1.3 million. \nOthers are eligible for an estate tax exemption of $675,000. I recently \nvoted to raise the small business and family farm exemption to $4 \nmillion by 2001 and with a phased in exemption of $8 million by 2010. \nThe general exemption would increase to $2 million by 2001 and $4 \nmillion by 2010.\n  The cost to the Treasury for this additional exemption for America's \nwealthiest families comes to about $61 billion over ten years. The cost \nof the total-repeal bill being vetoed by the President, however, comes \nto $105 billion over the first ten years, and a whopping $750 billion \nwhen fully phased in during the next ten years.\n  Very few South Dakota farms or small businesses have any Federal \nestate tax liability whatever under current law, but I do want to make \nsure that exemptions are ample. What I don't want to see, however, is \nan estate tax repeal bill that is so terribly expensive that it makes \nit almost impossible for Congress to pass tax relief for middle class \ntaxpayers, to shore up Medicare, to pay down more of the accumulated \nnational debt or improve education.\n  Keep in mind that most of the budget surplus that is being talked \nabout will not materialize for another five years or so, and prudence \nwould suggest to us that it may never materialize at all. Thank heavens \nfor some adult supervision from the White House at a time when Congress \nhas been behaving like spoiled children under the Christmas tree. \nSupporters of this irresponsible legislation believe there is room in \nour budget to give multimillionaires an $8 million tax break, but the \nlegislation sent to the President would have broken the bank and denied \nrelief and assistance to the other 98 percent of American families.\n  Once Congress concludes its partisan political finger-pointing games, \nit is my hope that estate tax and marriage penalty relief can be passed \nin a proper and careful manner that will allow for debt reduction, \nMedicare improvements, and a commitment to education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8099-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PURPLE HEART AWARDED TO SPECIALIST RAYMOND S.

I am confident \nthat I speak for all of my colleagues in the Senate when I say that his \nintellect and leadership will be greatly missed.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Moynihan--A Profile in Rare Courage\n\n                           (By Gray Maxwell)\n\n       As the final summer of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's \n     public career comes to an end, I think back to one languid \n     Friday afternoon three summers ago.\n       Not much was happening. The Senate was in recess. So \n     Moynihan--my boss at the time--and I went to see an exhibit \n     of Tyndale Bibles at the Library of Congress. William Tyndale \n     wrote the first English Bible from extant Greek and Hebrew \n     manuscripts. Moynihan was eager to learn more about a man \n     whose impact on the English language, largely unacknowledged, \n     is equal to Shakespeare's.\n       One might wonder what Tyndale has to do with the United \n     States Senate. Not much, I suppose. But like Tennyson's \n     Ulysses, Moynihan is a ``gray spirit yearning in desire to \n     follow knowledge like a sinking star.'' He has unbounded \n     curiosity. I'm not one who thinks his intellectualism is some \n     sort of indictment. Those who do are jealous of his \n     capabilities, or just vapid. In a diminished era when far too \n     many senators know far too little, I have been fortunate to \n     work for one who knows so much and yet strives to learn so \n     much more.\n       There is little I can add to what others have written or \n     will write about his career. But I would make a few \n     observations. On a parochial note, no other senator shares \n     his remarkable facility for understanding and manipulating \n     formulas--that arcane bit of legislating that drives the \n     allocation of billions of dollars. He has ``delivered'' for \n     New York, but it's not frequently noted because so few \n     understand it.\n       More important, every time he speaks or writes, it's worth \n     paying attention. I think back to the summer of 1990, when \n     Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) offered an amendment to a housing \n     bill. Gramm wanted to rob Community Development Block Grant \n     funds from a few ``Rust Belt'' states and spread them across \n     the rest of the country. The amendment looked like a winner: \n     More than 30 states would benefit. Moynihan spoke in \n     opposition. He delivered an extemporaneous speech on the \n     nature of our federal system worthy of inclusion in the \n     seminal work of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay as The Federalist \n     No. 86.\n       (His speech was effective. The amendment was defeated. New \n     York's share of CDBG funding was preserved.) What I most want \n     to comment on is Moynihan's courage. Too many of today's \n     tepid, timid legislators are afraid to offer amendments they \n     know will fail.\n       They are afraid of offending this constituency or that \n     special interest. They have no heart, no courage. Moynihan \n     always stands on principle, never on expediency. He's not \n     afraid to cast a tough vote, to be in the minority--even a \n     minority of one. His positions on issues from bankruptcy \n     ``reform'' to government secrecy, from welfare repeal to \n     habeas corpus, from the ``line item'' veto to Constitutional \n     amendments du jour, haven't been popular. But I'm confident \n     they are right. It just takes the rest of us a while to catch \n     up with him.\n       While Moynihan has been successful as a legislator, I think \n     of him as the patron senator of lost causes (i.e., right but \n     unpopular). Every senator is an advocate for the middle \n     class. That's where the votes are. What I admire and cherish \n     about Moynihan is his long, hard, eloquent fight on behalf of \n     the underclass--the disenfranchised, the demoralized, the \n     destitute, the despised.\n       T.S. Eliot wrote to a friend, ``We fight for lost causes \n     because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface \n     to our successors' victory, though that victory itself will \n     be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in \n     the expectation that anything will triumph.'' Eliot's wistful \n     statement, to me, captures the essence of Moynihan. He has an \n     unflinching sense of responsibility.\n       For the past quarter century, Moynihan has been the \n     Senate's reigning intellectual. But he has been more than \n     that. He has defended precious government institutions under \n     attack by those who have contempt for government.\n       And he has been the Senate's--and the nation's--conscience. \n     His fealty as a public servant, ultimately, has been to the \n     truth as\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n     best as he can determine it. He seeks it out, and he speaks \n     it, regardless of who will be discomfited.\n       He has done so with rigor, and wit, a little bit of \n     mischief now and then, and uncommon decency.\n       I have been privileged to work in the United States Senate \n     for 16 years, and for several outstanding members, \n     Republicans and Democrats. I will not see another Moynihan in \n     my career. He is sui generis.\n       When Thomas Jefferson followed Benjamin Franklin as envoy \n     to France, he told the Comte de Vergennes, ``I succeed him; \n     no one could replace him.'' Others will succeed Moynihan; no \n     one will replace him. We should pause for a moment, and give \n     thanks that he has devoted his life and considerable talents \n     to public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8100-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, imagine 140 students who want to \nspend their summer learning math. For students participating in the \nSummer Math Program at Thomas Jefferson High School in Federal Way, \nWashington, this is just the case. For the past five years, Tom Norris \nand James Brown have worked tirelessly and created a successful program \nthat has dramatically improved the math skills of hundreds of students.\n  When Mr. Norris and Mr. Brown started the Summer Math Program, they \nhad five students in attendance. Since then, the program has become \nwell-known throughout Thomas Jefferson High School as a resource for \nstudents struggling with math or hoping to improve their SAT scores and \nhas grown by leaps and bounds.\n  The Summer Math Program is based on a three part system that \nincludes: Advanced Algebra or Pre-Calculus, an SAT summer program, and \n``The Math Team.'' The Advanced Algebra and Pre-Calculus course enables \nstudents who desire to complete Calculus before they leave high school \nto enroll in higher math classes in the following school year. The SAT \nsummer program, offered at a much lower cost than other SAT review \nclasses, equips students with the skills and confidence needed for \ntheir college preparatory exams. As a result, Thomas Jefferson High \nSchool has some of the highest SAT scores in the South Puget Sound of \nWashington State.\n  Additionally, students who enjoy competing in math competitions can \nparticipate on the Math Team. Students practice throughout the summer \nin preparation for the annual national competition which took place in \nJuly. As a true testament to the excellence of the program, Mr. Norris \nand Mr. Brown coached the team to a fifth-place victory last summer \nwhen the students participated against 50 other schools. This certainly \nwas a great accomplishment for the program and students participating!\n  Samuel Kim, a Math Team member who will be a senior this year, told \nme that the Math Team, ``keeps you in the right frame of mind during \nsummer so you can keep your math skills strong, and it gives you good \ninteraction with others.'' Samuel had nothing but applause for his \ncoaches stating, ``Mr. Norris is very friendly and inspirational, yet \ndemanding and excited to see us succeed in competition, while Mr. Brown \nis more light-hearted in his motivational tactics.''\n  The record of the Math Team and the achievements of students in the \nSummer Math Program speaks not only to the excellence of the program \nbut also to the efforts and drive of both Mr. Norris and Mr. Brown. \nTheir dedication to education, and math in particular, is rarely \nparalleled in other local school districts during the summer months. I \nam impressed with the dedication of these two men to their students' \neducation even during the summer months. It is with great pleasure that \nI recognize them for their outstanding service to the students of \nThomas Jefferson High School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8100-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RETIRED U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE ROBERT R. MERHIGE, JR.\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to pay \nspecial recognition to a good friend of mine and a distinguished former \njurist, Robert R. Merhige, Jr. of Richmond, Virginia. Now in private \npractice after serving as a U.S. District Judge, Bob was recognized a \nfew months ago in an article in The National Law Journal as the driving \nforce behind the resolution of the Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust. The \narticle details Judge Merhige's efforts to resolve over 400,000 claims, \nand it's clear that he accomplished this difficult task by working \ntowards a fair result with skill and intellect. He kept his eye on the \nball until the job was concluded. I ask that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n             [From the National Law Journal, May 15, 2000]\n\n  $3 Billion Later, Dalkon Trust Closes Shop: Mass Tort Clearinghouse \n            Seen by Some as the Best-Run Outfit of Its Kind\n\n                            (By Alan Cooper)\n\n       Richmond, VA.--The numbers are impressive, even by mass \n     tort standards.\n       More than 400,000 claims reviewed. Nearly $3 billion \n     distributed. Administrative costs just 9%, including lawyer \n     fees.\n       Even more impressive, the job is done.\n       The Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust closed on April 30 with a \n     claim to being the best-managed mass tort plan so far.\n       Retired U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., now of \n     counsel at Hunton & Williams, gets much of the credit for \n     what many view as the success of the trust, as well as the \n     blame for what others see as its shortcomings.\n       The trust emerged from the 1985 bankruptcy petition of A.H. \n     Robins Co., which sold 3.6 million intrauterine birth devices \n     called the Dalkon Shield between 1971 and 1974. Robins took \n     it off the market under government pressure.\n       Robins and its products liability insurer, Aetna Casualty & \n     Surety Co., were overwhelmed by allegations that women had \n     suffered perforated uteruses and pelvic inflammatory disease \n     that left them sterile. More than 326,000 women filed claims \n     in response to a worldwide ad campaign.\n       Judge Merhige's 1987 estimate that the liability wouldn't \n     top $2.475 billion set off a bidding war, won by American \n     Home Products Corp. It acquired Robins by providing about \n     $2.3 billion for claimants, to be paid by the trust, and $700 \n     million-plus in stock to Robins shareholders.\n       Claimants' payments were based on amounts Robins paid to \n     settle cases before the bankruptcy and based on their medical \n     records. With interest, they totaled nearly $3 billion.\n       Robert E. Manchester, of Burlington, Vt., who represented \n     3,500-plus claimants, said of Judge Merhige, ``He shaped the \n     solution by tapping into people who were willing to be \n     constructive.''\n       ``There was a significant number of people who felt they \n     were treated badly by the process''--mostly atypical \n     claimants --plaintiffs' lawyer Stephen W. Bricker, of \n     Richmond said.\n       James F. Szaller, of Cleveland's Brown & Szaller, said that \n     Judge Merhige ``sometimes took unusual courses, but he did \n     get it done. The result for the vast majority of people was \n     good.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8100-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8100-S8101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETURN OF FLAGSHIP ``NIAGARA'' TO LAKE ERIE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

I commend the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum \nCommission, the Flagship Niagara League, and the City of Erie for \nrestoring the ship and making it available so that others in the United \nStates may learn of its history.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere \nappreciation to those who serve on the Flagship Niagara. The Flagship \nNiagara is a part of Pennsylvania's history, and your commitment to the \nship and to Erie is highly commendable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8101-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF JIM SUTTON, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE KALAMA SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's \nattention today to Mr. Jim Sutton, a man who has given a generation of \nKalama students a unique look at the courageous acts of an older \ngeneration--the men and women who fought in World War II. Mr. Sutton is \nthe Superintendent of the Kalama School District and also finds the \ntime to teach a course on World War II and the Cold War. Through his \ngreat personal interest in WWII and his desire to transfer some of his \ninterest onto his students, Jim has made history come alive for them.\n  Mr. Sutton's class, based on the book Band of Brothers, by Stephen \nAmbrose, uses firsthand accounts of companies who were a part of D-Day \nin WWII. Ambrose's book documents the accounts of E Company, which the \nmovie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' was based.\n  Mr. Sutton has made it possible for his students to meet some of \nthese great men who fought in WWII. Jim has brought an Italian officer \nthat fought Rommel in the African Campaign, a P-51 pilot who brought \nactual video footage from his wing cameras, a machine gunner who landed \nat D-Day, and a German soldier who spent two years in a Russian \nprisoner of war camp.\n  Anyone can see how Mr. Sutton recognizes the sacrifices of the WWII \ngeneration and has shared it with others. Most impressive was in June \nwhen five of Mr. Sutton's students accompanied him to the opening of \nthe D-Day museum in New Orleans, Louisiana where students were able to \nmeet their history book heroes in person.\n  I have always considered my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards to \nhighlight special people and programs, and this award demonstrates how \ninnovative a typical U.S. history class can be. Mr. Sutton has created \na live link between the past and the present for his students.\n  Greg Rayl, Principal of Kalama Middle and High School, who nominated \nMr. Sutton for the award adds, ``Too often superintendents are many \nsteps removed from the daily classroom management and operations of \ntheir district's schools. Jim not only walks the halls interacting with \nstudents and teachers, but teaches as well.''\n  As an avid reader of history, I am delighted to learn about Mr. \nSutton who has gone the extra mile to make history come alive for his \nstudents. I ask that the Senate join me in commending Mr. Sutton for \nhis dedication to his students and for bringing two generations \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8101-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF MRS.

She was born on July 30, 1909 in Pittsburgh to the late Sally \nand Henry Black.\n  Mrs. Ogburn graduated from the Pittsburgh Public School System and \nlater became employed for many years with the Allegheny County Health \nDepartment from which she retired in the 1970s. She was also well known \nas a dedicated and highly respected community leader for her committed \nefforts to her Church and community organizations. She was actively \ninvolved in the Negro Emergency Education Drive (NEED), the Urban \nLeague, the YWCA, the YMCA, and the Pittsburgh branch of the NAACP.\n  During her tenure as a member of the NAACP, Mrs. Ogburn sat on the \nExecutive Committee, Human Rights Dinner Committee, Scholarship \nCommittee, Women in the NAACP (WIN), and the Membership Committee. As \nChair of the Membership Committee, she was instrumental in increasing \nbranch memberships for the organization, and in 1958, she received her \nfirst award for soliciting the most NAACP memberships. In addition, the \nNational Office of the NAACP awarded Mrs. Ogburn a medal for her \naccomplishments as one of the top membership solicitors in the entire \nnation. Mrs. Ogburn was awarded several other awards for her commitment \nand dedication to this organization.\n  It is an honor for me to recognize Mrs. Coretta Ogburn and the \nselfless time and energy she put towards her community. She was a true \ncivil servant and community leader, and Pittsburgh was very blessed to \nhave her a resident of its city. She cared a great deal for her loved \nones, illustrated true dedication to the organizations which she \nbelonged, and will be sorely missed by all those who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8101-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8101-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8101-S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-10526.

A bill to require country origin labeling of all forms of \nginseng; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 ginseng truth in labeling act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a package of \nlegislation (S. 3005 and S. Res. 348) that addresses the increased \namount of smuggled and mis-labeled ginseng entering this country.\n  This legislation provides for some common sense reforms that would \nrequire country-of-origin labeling for ginseng products, and express \nthe Sense of the Senate that customs should put a stop to the flow of \nsmuggled ginseng into the United States. My legislation will push for \nstricter enforcement of ginseng importation and allow consumers the \ninformation they need to determine the origin of the ginseng they buy.\n\n\n                       smuggling-labeling problem\n\n  Mr. President, Chinese and Native American cultures have used ginseng \nfor thousands of years for herbal and medicinal purposes.\n  In America, ginseng is experiencing a newfound popularity, and I am \nproud to say that my home state of Wisconsin is playing a central role \nin ginseng's resurgence.\n  Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United \nStates, and 85 percent of the country's ginseng is grown in Marathon \nCounty.\n  The ginseng industry is an economic boon to Marathon County, as well \nas an example of the high quality for which Wisconsin's agriculture \nindustry is known.\n  Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because \nit is considered to be of the highest quality and because it has a \nlower pesticide and chemical content.\n  With a huge market for this high-quality ginseng overseas, and \ngrowing popularity for the ancient root here at home, Wisconsin's \nginseng industry should have a prosperous future ahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious \nproblem--smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is \nconsidered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go \nto great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as \n``Wisconsin-grown.''\n  Here's how the switch takes place: Smugglers take Asian or Canadian-\ngrown ginseng and ship it to plants in China, allegedly to have the \nginseng sorted into various grades.\n  While the sorting process is itself a legitimate part of distributing \nginseng, smugglers often use it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng \nwith the Asian or Canadian ginseng considered inferior by consumers.\n  The smugglers know that while Chinese-grown ginseng has a retail \nvalue of about $5-$6 per pound, while Wisconsin-grown ginseng is valued \nat roughly $16-$20 per pound.\n  To make matters even tougher for Wisconsin's ginseng farmers, there \nis no accurate way of testing ginseng to determine where it was grown, \nother than testing for pesticides that are legal in Canada and China \nbut are banned in the United States.\n  And in some cases, smugglers can even find ways around the pesticide \ntests. A recent ConsumerLab.com study confirmed that much of the \nginseng sold in the U.S. contained harmful chemicals and metals, such \nas lead and arsenic.\n  And that's because the majority of Ginseng sold in the U.S. \noriginates from countries with lower pesticide standards, so it's \nvitally important that consumers know which ginseng is really grown in \nWisconsin\n\n\n                        consumer/producer impact\n\n  For the sake of ginseng farmers and consumers, the U.S. Senate must \ncrack down on smuggled and mislabeled ginseng.\n  Without adequate labeling, consumers have no way of knowing the most \nbasic information about the ginseng they purchase--where it was grown, \nwhat quality or grade it is, or whether it contains dangerous \npesticides.\n  The country of origin labeling is a simple but effective way to \nenable consumers to make an informed decision. And putting the U.S. \nSenate on record in support of cracking down on ginseng smuggling is an \nimportant first step toward putting an end to the illegal ginseng \ntrade.\n  The lax enforcement of smuggled ginseng also puts our producers on an \nunfair playing field. The mixing of superior Wisconsin ginseng with \nlower quality foreign ginseng root penalizes the grower and eliminates \nthe incentive to provide the consumer with a superior product.\n  Mr. President, we must give ginseng growers the support they deserve \nby implementing country-of-origin labeling that lets consumers make in \nformed choices about the ginseng that they consume.\n  We must ensure when ginseng consumers reach for a quality ginseng \nproduct--such as Wisconsin grown ginseng--that they are getting the \nreal thing, not a cheap imitation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 3006. A bill to remove civil liability barriers surrounding \ndonating fire equipment to volunteer fire companies; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\n        the good samaritan volunteer firefighter assistance act\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nGood Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2000. This bill \nwill assist our nation's volunteer firefighters, who daily risk their \nlives to protect our families, friends and neighbors. The legislation I \nam introducing will allow volunteer fire departments to accept much \nneeded fire-fighting supplies from manufacturers and others by limiting \nthe liability of companies and fire departments that donate certified \nsurplus equipment.\n  In the United States today, the local fire department is expected to \nbe protector of life, property and environmental safety concerns. Many \ncommunities must rely on the capable and courageous men and women in \nthe local volunteer fire department to protect lives and safety. In \nfact, 75 percent of firefighters in this country are volunteers. Most \nvolunteer departments serve small, rural communities and are quite \noften the only fire fighting services available for these areas. \nUnfortunately, one of the largest problems faced by volunteer fire \nservices is lack of sufficient resources. Too often, these departments \nare struggling to provide their members with adequate protective \nclothing, safety devices and training programs.\n  In my home state of Missouri, there are approximately 450 fire \ndepartments throughout the state that have a budget of less than \n$15,000 per year. Many have budgets under $7,000/year and there are \neven some under $2,000/year. After paying insurance premiums, most \ndepartments do not even have $5,000 in their operating budgets. This is \nsimply not enough money to purchase new and much needed fire-fighting \nequipment. In addition, the cost of fire and emergency medical \napparatus and equipment has steadily increased over the past 20-30 \nyears. Because of this, volunteer firefighters spend a large amount of \ntime raising money for new equipment; time that could be better spent \nproviding training to respond to emergencies.\n  Fire protection equipment is constantly improving and advancing with \nnew state-of-the-art innovation. Because industry is constantly \nupdating its fire protection, it is not unusual for plants and \nfactories to accumulate surplus fire equipment that is slightly dated, \nbut still effective, and most is almost new, or never used. Despite the \nexcellent condition of most of these surplus items, company attorneys \nusually refuse to allow donations to fire departments, which \ndesperately need this equipment. Companies routinely destroy surplus \nequipment to guarantee it will never be used by other firefighters. \nPressure bottles for breathing apparatus are cut in half and the \nregulators buried. Protective fire coats are cut apart. Fire trucks are \nbroken up and sold for scrap. All of this is done to prevent any \nliability from falling on corporate donors. Approximately $20 million \nper year in surplus equipment is scrapped, while a lot of rural \ndepartments go without the most basic supplies, such as protective \nclothing. Tragically, each year millions of dollars worth of fire \nequipment is destroyed instead of donated to these volunteer fire \ndepartments.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense that quality fire-fighting \ntools are destroyed because of fear of liability by those who wish to \ndonate their unused equipment. According to some estimates, over \n800,000 volunteer firefighters nationwide save state and local \ngovernments $36.8 billion annually. We need to support the volunteer \nfire departments, and Congress should start by removing liability \nbarriers that keep volunteer firefighters from receiving perfectly \nsafe, donated equipment. Under this bill a person who donates qualified \nfire control or fire rescue equipment to a volunteer fire company will \nnot be liable in civil damages in any State or Federal Court for \npersonal injuries, property damage, or death proximately caused by a \ndefect in the equipment. In order to protect firefighters from faulty \ndonated equipment, this bill requires the equipment to be recertified \nas safe by an authorized technician. The bill does not protect those \npersons who act with malice, gross negligence, or recklessness in \nmaking the donation; nor does it protect the manufacturer of the \ndonated equipment.\n  Mr. President, this bill is supported by a number of firefighting \norganizations. In States that have removed liability barriers through \nlegislation similar to this, volunteer fire companies have received \nmillions of dollars in quality fire fighting equipment. For example, in \n1997, the Texas state legislature passed a bill that limited the \nliability of companies who donated surplus equipment to fire \ndepartments. Prior to passage of this bill, companies in Texas had \nrefrained from donating their used equipment for fear of potential \nlawsuits. Now, companies donate their surplus equipment to the Texas \nForest Service, which then certifies the equipment and passes it on to \nvolunteer fire departments. The donated equipment must meet all \noriginal specifications before it can be sent to volunteer departments. \nThe program has already received in excess of six million dollars worth \nof equipment for volunteer fire departments.\n  Companion legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Castle. I urge my Senate colleagues to \njoin me in ending the wasteful destruction of useful fire equipment, \nsaving taxpayer funds, and better equipping our volunteer firefighters \nto save lives. I am proud to introduce this bill and look forward to \nworking to ensure that the federal government increases its commitment \nto the men and women who make up our local volunteer fire \ndepartments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grams, Mr. Murkowski, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 3007. A bill to provide for measures in response to a unilateral \ndeclaration of the existence of a Palestinian state; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n        unilateral palestinian statehood disapproval act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Lugar in \nintroducing the Unilateral Palestinian Statehood Disapproval Act. This \nis cosponsored by Senators Moynihan, Specter, Inhofe, Santorum, Grams, \nCollins and Murkowski.\n  We are now 7 days away from September 13. That is the day that the \nPalestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has set, in the past, as a \nday when he would declare, unilaterally, Palestinian statehood. He has \nrecently said that he would reassess his intention to declare an \nindependent Palestinian state unilaterally. I am hopeful that he will. \nBut, nonetheless, I am concerned that neither he nor other senior \nPalestinian leaders have repudiated the idea of a unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood.\n  As part of the 1993 Oslo accords, the Israelis and Palestinians \ncommitted to resolving all outstanding issues through negotiation. \nChairman Arafat reiterated this position on July 25 of this year, at \nthe conclusion of the last round of the Camp David negotiations when he \nand Prime Minister Barak issued a statement agreeing on the importance \nof ``avoiding unilaterally action that prejudiced the outcome of \nnegotiations.'' Indeed, one of the keys to the success of the peace \nprocess thus far has been the commitment by each side to avoid any \nunilateral action that would undermine the search for a mutually \nsatisfactory agreement.\n  A unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would violate the \ncommitments of Oslo. A unilateral declaration of statehood would be a \ngrave blow to the peace process, one from which that process might not \nbe able to recover.\n  I believe very strongly, and my cosponsors do as well, that any \nPalestinian state should be the result of negotiations between Israel \nand the Palestinians, not the result of the unilateral action of either \none side or the other.\n  It is my sincere hope that in the next few days, Mr. Arafat and \nothers in the Palestinian leadership will step back from the September \n13 deadline and recommit themselves to the Oslo process and \nnegotiations with Israel.\n  This legislation is necessary, however, because should Mr. Arafat go \nforward with the unilateral declaration, the repercussions for the \npeace process and stability in the Middle East are, indeed, both \nserious and severe. The United States must make it clear that\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nwe will not recognize or condone a unilateral declaration and that the \nUnited States will work to make sure the international community \nneither accepts nor supports a unilaterally declared Palestinian state.\n  The legislation we introduce today would do the following:\n  It would state that the United States should not recognize any \nunilaterally declared Palestinian state.\n  It would urge the President and the Secretary of State to use all \ndiplomatic means to work with other countries to deny recognition to \nsuch a unilaterally declared state.\n  It would prohibit any direct U.S. assistance to a unilaterally \ndeclared Palestinian state, except for humanitarian assistance or \ncooperation on antiterrorism efforts.\n  It would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose membership in \nany international financial institution by a unilaterally declared \nPalestinian state and oppose any financial assistance from these \ninstitutions to such a state.\n  It would state the sense of the Congress that the President should \ndowngrade the status of the Palestinian office in the United States to \nan information office.\n  It would also state the sense of the Congress that the President \nshould oppose Palestinian membership in the United Nations or any other \ninternational organization, and that the United States should oppose \neconomic or other assistance to a unilaterally declared Palestinian \nstate, except for humanitarian or security assistance.\n  Finally, it would urge the President to expedite and upgrade the \nongoing review of strategic relations between the United States and \nIsrael.\n  We have included a Presidential national interest waiver authority so \nthat if the President deems that even with a unilateral declaration \nthat the peace process can move forward, the United States will have \nthe flexibility to continue that process.\n  I realize that it is a little unusual to say, but it is my sincere \nhope that this legislation will never require action, let alone \nimplementation.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of the peace process and for a \npeace agreement that provides security for Israel and leads to the \nconsensual establishment of a Palestinian state that will be a peaceful \nneighbor of Israel. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked long and \nhard as an advocate for peace in the Middle East and as a supporter of \nthe negotiations led by President Clinton, Secretaries Christopher and \nAlbright, and conducted so ably by Dennis Ross.\n  Because of this support, it is my sincere hope that Mr. Arafat will \nnot choose to heed those who have suggested that the Palestinian \nAuthority should unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on September \n13. If Mr. Arafat is willing to continue to work within the context of \nthe peace process and stick to his commitments at Oslo and Camp David \nnot to take unilateral steps, then I believe the United States should \ncontinue our partnership with the Palestinian people in search for \npeace. Under such circumstances, there is no need for this legislation.\n\n  I was deeply disappointed that the last round of negotiations at Camp \nDavid did not succeed in reaching an agreement. Prime Minister Barak \nappeared to make every effort to reach out and extend the hand of peace \nand placed items on the table for negotiation that no Israeli Prime \nMinister was previously even willing to discuss with the Palestinian \nleadership.\n  Although there is still a long way to go, I believe that if both \nsides are sincere in their desire for peace, a negotiated settlement is \nstill possible, and it is my hope that Israel and its Palestinian \nneighbors will once again find themselves at the negotiating table in \nthe not too distant future. I understand that Mr. Arafat, Prime \nMinister Barak, and President Clinton will be meeting in New York this \nweek, and I hope the talks can get back on track. But if the \nPalestinians should choose to endanger the peace process by a \nunilateral declaration of statehood on September 13, the United States \nmust be clear what our policy should be.\n  The United States has a vital and an important role to play as an \nhonest broker in the region and as a guarantor of the peace process and \nany peace that may result. It is precisely our role as an honest broker \nthat compels me to offer this legislation. If the Palestinians take \nunilateral steps that undermine the peace process, the United States \nmust make it clear that we will neither condone nor support such \nactions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the Senator from Indiana and me in \nsending a clear and compelling message in support of the Middle East \npeace process. Unilateral actions are not acceptable to the United \nStates, and should the Palestinian Authority choose to break with the \npeace process, the United States will act accordingly.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Specter may well \nbe coming to the floor to make some comments on this. If he does, I ask \nunanimous consent that his comments be reflected directly following \nmine and Senator Lugar's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Feinstein and other \nMembers from both sides of the aisle to introduce the Unilateral \nPalestinian Statehood Disapproval Act of 2000. I am pleased to be an \noriginal co-sponsor of this legislation.\n  At the conclusion of the July round of negotiations between Israel \nand the Palestinian Authority at Camp David, Prime Minister Barak and \nChairman Arafat issued a statement agreeing on the importance of \n``avoiding unilateral action that prejudices the outcome of \nnegotiations.'' They both acknowledged that progress is best assured if \nboth parties refrain from unilateral actions that would have the effect \nof undermining the peace process.\n  After the Camp David talks ended, Chairman Arafat announced that he \nintended to unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian state by \nSeptember 13 if negotiations with Israel did not conclude in a \nsatisfactory manner by then. Such a statement is harmful to the \nnegotiations and would be disastrous to the peace process.\n  It is important for the Congress to be heard on this issue. A \nunilateral declaration of a Palestinian state is objectionable and \nwould create an unnecessary rupture in our ability to work with the \nPalestinian Authority to advance the peace process. It is my hope that \nChairman Arafat will listen to the voices of other leaders in the Arab \nworld, and elsewhere, which have counseled caution and urged him to \nrefrain from these unilateral steps toward statehood.\n  Our legislation proposes several targeted limitations and \nrestrictions on the Palestinian Authority should they decide to declare \na Palestinian state in advance of a final agreement. It states that if \nChairman Arafat unilaterally declares a Palestinian state, the U.S. \nshould not recognize it, that we should work with our friends and \nallies not to recognize any such state, and that we should downgrade \nthe Palestinian office in the United States to an information office.\n  The legislation places limitations on official U.S. assistance to a \nunilaterally declared Palestinian state but provides exceptions for \ncooperation on anti-terrorism and security matters. Our bill also urges \nthe President to oppose membership to a unilaterally declared \nPalestinian state in the United Nations and to oppose any economic and \nfinancial assistance from the U.N., affiliated agencies and \ninternational financial institutions.\n  It is my hope that none of these restrictions will have to be \nimplemented. Because we want to insure that the President can use all \nthe tools available to him to assist the parties to succeed in the \npeace negotiations, we included a presidential national interest waiver \nauthority on those provisions pertaining to economic and financial \nassistance.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree to support this legislation and the \nlong-standing effort to construct a comprehensive peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the statements by Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat that there \nmay be a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood on September \n13. That, in my judgment, would be a grave mistake, and the United \nStates and our allies ought to do everything in our power to prevent \nChairman Arafat of the Palestinian Authority from making that \nunilateral declaration of statehood.\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n  When the Oslo accords were signed in 1993, there was an agreement \nthat all of the outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority would be negotiated with a solution. There have been very \nextensive discussions, including recent talks at Camp David, which have \nnot produced that kind of an agreement and that has led Chairman Arafat \nto raise the issue--perhaps more accurately called ``threat''--to have \na unilateral declaration of statehood on September 13.\n  I have cosponsored S. 3007, which was introduced today by the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, which calls for \naction by the United States in the event that there is a unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood. The bill contains provisions which would \narticulate the policy of the United States not to recognize a \nunilaterally declared Palestinian state, to extend diplomatic efforts \nto deny recognition by working with the allies of the United States, \nthe European Union, Japan, and other countries, to downgrade the status \nof the Palestinian office in the United States if there should be such \na unilateral declaration, to prohibit U.S. assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority if there should be such a unilateral declaration, \nto take steps to oppose Palestinian membership in the United Nations or \nother international organizations, and to oppose Palestinian membership \nin or assistance from the international financial institutions.\n  I believe this bill is an effective shot across the bow.\n  I wrote to Chairman Arafat on August 18 of this year, urging Chairman \nArafat to abandon any thoughts about a unilateral declaration of \nstatehood for the Palestinian Authority. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of the letter which I wrote \nto Chairman Arafat is contained in two paragraphs where I say:\n\n       . . . There is a strong feeling, both in the United States \n     Senate and the United States House of Representatives, as \n     well as that expressed by President Clinton, that there be no \n     such unilateral declaration of statehood.\n       There has been tremendous support in the Senate and House, \n     as well as from the President, for an overall peace \n     settlement and that Congressional support has included U.S. \n     contributions to implement such an accord. That Congressional \n     support would certainly be eroded by a unilateral declaration \n     of statehood.\n\n  I had urged Chairman Arafat in the past to avoid a unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood when the possibility was raised that such a \nunilateral declaration might be made back on May 4, 1999.\n  Chairman Arafat came to the United States on March 23, and I was \nscheduled at that time to visit him in his hotel in Virginia, but \nshortly before our scheduled appointment I found that Chairman Arafat \nwas visiting on the House side in the Capitol complex, and I had an \nopportunity to invite Chairman Arafat to my Capitol office.\n  At that time, we had an extensive discussion where I urged him not to \nmake the unilateral declaration of statehood. He asked me at that time, \nif he would refrain from that unilateral declaration of statehood, \nwhether I would make a statement saying it was a wise course of action, \ngiving recognition to the restraint of Chairman Arafat and the \nPalestinian Authority. I said I would do so and that I would make a \nstatement on the floor of the Senate on May 5 if Chairman Arafat and \nthe Palestinian Authority, in fact, did not make a unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood. I wrote Chairman Arafat to that effect on \nMarch 31, 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nCongressional Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I made two statements for the \nCongressional Record--one on April 26, 1999, which I incorporate by \nreference, and another statement on May 4, 1999, when Chairman Arafat \nand the Palestinian Authority did not make a unilateral declaration of \nstatehood.\n  The meeting I had with Chairman Arafat in my Capitol office was a \nvery interesting one and a very constructive one. One note which I had \nreferred to in one of my earlier statements on the floor is worth a \nvery brief reference. I have a very large poster which has a joint \npicture of President Clinton with thumbs up and a picture of Chairman \nArafat right next to him making the V sign, obviously not taken \ntogether but juxtaposed together on one large poster. It looks like a \ncampaign poster, almost as if the two men were running for political \noffice, which, of course, they were not.\n  I had accompanied President Clinton on his trip to Israel in December \nof 1998. I saw the poster and thought it a nice item of memorabilia and \nhad it framed and put in my Capitol office. When Chairman Arafat saw \nhis picture on my wall, it did a good bit more than any of my \npersuasive comments to establish an aura of goodwill in a complimentary \nsense. He very much liked seeing his picture there. In fact, he wanted \nto take a picture of the two of us standing in front of his picture, \nwhich now stands beside the poster in my Capitol office.\n  I mention that because of the--I am searching for the right word. \n``Congenial meeting'' might not be exactly right, but it was a \nbusinesslike meeting where Chairman Arafat listened to my arguments \nagainst a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n  When I recite this, I do not really mean to suggest my voice was the \ndeterminative voice. I think that comported with what the Palestinian \nAuthority had in mind in any event. I think every extra bit of pressure \nthat can be brought ought to be brought. That is why I wrote to \nChairman Arafat earlier this year, on August 18, and that is why I am \nsupporting the bill introduced by the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, which would impose certain restraints and, in effect, \ncertain sanctions on the Palestinian Authority if they do make a \nunilateral declaration of statehood. In my judgment, it would set back \nthe peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority \nsubstantially. I retain some optimism that the differences between \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority may yet be reconciled.\n\n  I compliment the President and the Secretary of State for their very \nextensive efforts to try to bring about that accord. I believe those \nefforts should be continued and intensified. I also compliment Dennis \nRoss of the State Department who has done so much in the negotiating \nprocess with the parties.\n  While there are meetings underway at the United Nations, there may be \nsome occasion for the President to act further in consultation with \nIsraeli Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser \nArafat to try to bring about advances on the peace process and \nultimately an accord. But certainly a unilateral declaration of \nstatehood by the Palestinian Authority would be met with grave \nopposition in this Chamber--I know that for a certainty--and I believe \nalso in the House of Representatives.\n  In conclusion, I urge Chairman Arafat and his colleagues in the \nPalestinian Authority not to make a unilateral declaration of statehood \non September 13, or at any other time, but to continue the peace \nprocess to try to work out outstanding differences in accordance with \nthe commitments made by the Palestinian Authority on the Oslo accord.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1999.\n     Chairman Yasser Arafat,\n     President of the National Authority,\n     Gaza City, GAZA, Palestinian National Authority.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you very much for coming to my \n     Senate hideaway and for our very productive discussion on \n     March 23.\n       Following up on that discussion, I urge that the \n     Palestinian Authority not make a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood on May 4 or on any subsequent date. The issue of \n     the Palestinian state is a matter for negotiation under the \n     terms of the Oslo Accords.\n       I understand your position that this issue will not be \n     decided by you alone but will be submitted to the Palestinian \n     Authority Council.\n       When I was asked at our meeting whether you and the \n     Palestinian Authority would receive credit for refraining \n     from the unilateral declaration of statehood, I replied that \n     I would go to the Senate floor on May 5 or as soon thereafter \n     as possible and compliment your action in not unilaterally \n     declaring a Palestinian state.\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\n       I look forward to continuing discussions with you on the \n     important issues in the Mid-East peace process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 18, 2000.\n     Chairman Yasser Arafat,\n     President of the National Authority,\n     Gaza City, GAZA, Palestinian National Authority.\n       Dear Chairman Arafat: On March 23, 1999, when you visited \n     my Senate Office in Washington, I urged you not to make a \n     unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood, which had \n     been discussed as a possibility for May 4, 2000.\n       At that time, I told you that I would make a statement on \n     the Senate floor on May 5, 1999, praising your decision not \n     to declare statehood unilaterally if, in fact, you made that \n     decision. You did not declare statehood on May 4, 1999; and, \n     as promised, I made the statement on the Senate floor. For \n     your re-review, I enclose a copy of that statement.\n       Now, again, there is talk that there may be a unilateral \n     declaration of Palestinian statehood on September 13, 2000. \n     Again, I urge you not to make such a declaration, but to \n     continue negotiations to try to work out an overall agreement \n     with Israel.\n       I know that there is a strong feeling, both in the United \n     States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, \n     as well as that expressed by President Clinton, that there be \n     no such unilateral declaration of statehood.\n       There has been tremendous support in the Senate and House, \n     as well as from the President, for an overall peace \n     settlement and that Congressional support has included U.S. \n     contributions to implement such an accord. That Congressional \n     support would certainly be eroded by a unilateral declaration \n     of statehood.\n       If you do not make such a unilateral declaration of \n     Palestinian statehood on September 13, I will again speak on \n     the Senate floor in praise of your restraint.\n       Again, I urge you to renew discussions with Israel for an \n     overall settlement.\n       I look forward to our next meeting when you are in \n     Washington or I am in the Mideast.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Pennsylvania leaves \nthe floor, I want the Record to reflect the statements he has made are \nbipartisan in nature. I underline and underscore the importance of the \nstatement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think it would be very \nunwise for Chairman Arafat to move unilaterally on establishing \nstatehood. I hope he will sit back and look at the great loss that will \ntake place if an agreement is not reached at this time.\n  I commend and applaud the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \nstatement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNevada for those very timely comments. It is important to have that \nnote of bipartisanship. May the Record further reflect, 20 minutes ago \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico said he wanted to do \nsomething sharp at 6 p.m., and the big hand is at the 12 and the little \nhand is at the 6 in this instant.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I knew when I asked the Senator from \nPennsylvania if he could be finished in 20 minutes that he was going to \nbe delivering such an important speech, I might have been reluctant to \nask him. I do commend him on that speech--not the brevity and coming in \non time, but the substance is very important.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for \nthose comments. We have worked together for many years and earlier \ntoday on the Appropriations Committee, and I appreciate what he just \nsaid.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 3008.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to \nintroduce legislation that will restore to state employees the ability \nto bring claims of age discrimination against their employers under the \nAge Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967. The Older Workers Rights \nRestoration Act of 2000 seeks to provide state employees who allege age \ndiscrimination the same procedures and remedies as those afforded to \nother employees with respect to ADEA.\n  This legislation is needed to protect older workers like Professor \nDan Kimel, who has taught physics at Florida State University for \nnearly 35 years. Despite his years of faithful service, in 1992, \nProfessor Kimel found that he was earning less in real dollars than his \nstarting salary. To add insult to injury, his employer was hiring \nyounger faculty out of graduate schools at salaries that were higher \nthan he and other long-service faculty members were earning. In 1995, \nProfessor Kimel and 34 colleagues brought a claim of age discrimination \nagainst the Florida Board of Regents.\n  Dan Kimel and his colleagues brought their cases under the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act of 1967 (``ADEA''). In 1974, Congress \namended the ADEA to ensure that state employees, such as Dan Kimel has \nfull protection against age discrimination. I stand before you today \nbecause this past January the Supreme Court ruled that Dan Kimel and \nother affected faculty do not have the right to bring their ADEA claims \nagainst their employer. The Court in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, \nheld that Congress did not have the power to abrogate state sovereign \nimmunity to individuals under the ADEA. As a result of the decision, \nstate employees, who are victims of age discrimination, no longer have \nthe remedies that are available to individuals who work in the private \nsector, for local governments or for federal government. Indeed, unless \na state chooses to waive its sovereign immunity or the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission decides to bring a suit, state workers now find \nthemselves with no federal remedy for their claims of age \ndiscrimination. In effect, this decision has transformed older state \nemployees into second class citizens.\n  For a right without a remedy is no right at all. Employees should not \nhave to lose their right to redress simply because they happen to work \nfor a state government. And a considerable portion of our workforce has \nbeen impacted. In Vermont, for example, the State is one of our largest \nemployers. We cannot and should not permit these state workers to lose \nthe right to redress age discrimination.\n  This legislation will resolve this problem. The Older Workers Rights \nRestoration Act of 2000 will restore the full protections of the ADEA \nto Dan Kimel and countless other state employees in federally assisted \nprograms. The legislation will do this by requiring the states to waive \ntheir sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds for \ntheir programs or activities. The Older Workers Rights Restoration Act \nof 2000 follows the framework of many other civil rights laws, \nincluding the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. Under this \nframework, immunity is only waived with regard to the program or \nactivity actually receiving federal funds. States are not obligated to \naccept such funds; and if they do not they are immune from private ADEA \nsuits. The legislation also confirms that these employees may bring \nactions for equitable relief under the ADEA.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Older Workers Rights \n     Restoration Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1974, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.) has prohibited States from \n     discriminating in employment on the basis of age. In EEOC v. \n     Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld \n     Congress' constitutional authority to prohibit States from \n     discriminating in employment on the basis of age. The \n     prohibitions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 remain in effect and continue to apply to the States, as \n     the prohibitions have for more than 25 years.\n       (2) Age discrimination in employment remains a serious \n     problem both nationally and\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n     among State agencies, and has invidious effects on its \n     victims, the labor force, and the economy as a whole. For \n     example, age discrimination in employment--\n       (A) increases the risk of unemployment among older workers, \n     who will as a result be more likely to be dependent on \n     government resources;\n       (B) prevents the best use of available labor resources;\n       (C) adversely effects the morale and productivity of older \n     workers; and\n       (D) perpetuates unwarranted stereotypes about the abilities \n     of older workers.\n       (3) Private civil suits by the victims of employment \n     discrimination have been a crucial tool for enforcement of \n     the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 since the \n     enactment of that Act. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, \n     120 S. Ct. 631 (2000), however, the Supreme Court held that \n     Congress lacks the power under the 14th amendment to abrogate \n     State sovereign immunity to suits by individuals under the \n     Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. The Federal \n     Government has an important interest in ensuring that Federal \n     funds are not used to facilitate violation of, the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Private civil suits \n     are a critical tool for advancing that interest.\n       (4) As a result of the Kimel decision, although age-based \n     discrimination by State employers remains unlawful, the \n     victims of such discrimination lack important remedies for \n     vindication of their rights that are available to all other \n     employees covered under the Act, including employees in the \n     private sector, of local government, and of the Federal \n     Government. Unless a State chooses to waive sovereign \n     immunity, or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n     brings an action on their behalf, State employees victimized \n     by violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 have no adequate Federal remedy for violations of the \n     Act. In the absence of the deterrent effect that such \n     remedies provide, there is a greater likelihood that entities \n     carrying out federally funded programs and activities will \n     use Federal funds to violate the Act, or that the Federal \n     funds will otherwise subsidize or facilitate violations of \n     the Act.\n       (5) Federal law has long treated nondiscrimination \n     obligations as a core component of programs or activities \n     that are, in whole or part, assisted by Federal funds. \n     Federal funds should not be used, directly or indirectly, to \n     subsidize invidious discrimination. Assuring \n     nondiscrimination in employment is a crucial aspect of \n     assuring nondiscrimination in those programs and activities.\n       (6) Discrimination on the basis of age in federally \n     assisted programs or activities is, in contexts other than \n     employment, forbidden by the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.). Congress determined that it was not \n     necessary for the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 to apply to \n     employment discrimination because the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1974 already forbade discrimination in \n     employment by, and authorized suits against, State agencies \n     and other entities that receive Federal funds. In section \n     1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000d-7), Congress required all State recipients of Federal \n     assistance to waive any immunity from suit for discrimination \n     claims arising under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The \n     earlier limitation in the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, \n     originally intended only to avoid duplicative coverage and \n     remedies, has in the wake of the Kimel decision become a \n     serious loophole leaving millions of State employees without \n     an important Federal remedy for age discrimination resulting \n     in the use of such funds to subsidize or facilitate \n     violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967.\n       (7) The Supreme Court has upheld Congress' authority to \n     condition receipt of Federal funds on acceptance by the \n     States or other recipients of conditions regarding or related \n     to the use of those funds, as in Cannon v. University of \n     Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). The Court has further \n     recognized that Congress may require a State, as a condition \n     of receipt of Federal assistance, to waive the State's \n     sovereign immunity to suits for a violation of Federal law, \n     as in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary \n     Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). In the wake of \n     the Kimel decision, in order to assure compliance with, and \n     to provide effective remedies for violations of, the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in State programs or \n     activities receiving Federal assistance, and in order to \n     ensure that Federal funds do not subsidize or facilitate \n     violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967, it is necessary to require such a waiver as a condition \n     of receipt of that Federal financial assistance.\n       (8) The waiver resulting from the acceptance of Federal \n     funds by 1 State program or activity under this Act will not \n     eliminate a State's immunity with respect to other programs \n     or activities that do not receive Federal funds; a State \n     waives sovereign immunity only with respect to Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 suits brought by \n     employees within the programs or activities that receive such \n     funds. With regard to those programs and activities that are \n     covered by the waiver, the State employees will be accorded \n     only the same remedies that were available to State employees \n     under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 before \n     Kimel and that are accorded to all other covered employees \n     under the Act.\n       (9) The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that State \n     sovereign immunity does not bar suits for prospective \n     injunctive relief brought against State officials, as in ex \n     parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Clarification of the \n     language of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 \n     will confirm that the Act authorizes such suits. The \n     injunctive relief available in such suits will continue to be \n     no broader than the injunctive relief that was available \n     under the Act before the Kimel decision, and that is \n     available to all other employees under that Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide to State employees in federally assisted \n     programs or activities the same rights and remedies for \n     practices violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     of 1967 as are available to other employees under that Act, \n     and that were available to State employees prior to the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Board of \n     Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000);\n       (2) to provide that the receipt of Federal funding for use \n     in a program or activity constitutes a State waiver of \n     sovereign immunity from suits by employees within that \n     program or activity for violations of the Age Discrimination \n     in Employment Act of 1967; and\n       (3) to affirm that suits for equitable relief are available \n     against State officials in their official capacities for \n     violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967.\n\n     SEC. 4. REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 7 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 626) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g)(1)(A) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance in any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this Act for \n     equitable, legal, or other relief authorized under this Act.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `program or activity' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).\n       ``(2) An official of a State may be sued in the official \n     capacity of the official by any employee who has complied \n     with the procedures of subsections (d) and (e), for equitable \n     relief that is authorized under this Act. In such a suit the \n     court may award to the prevailing party those costs \n     authorized by section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. \n     1988).''.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of such provision or amendment to another \n     person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Waiver of Sovereign Immunity.--With respect to a \n     particular program or activity, section 7(g)(1) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     626(g)(1)) applies to conduct occurring on or after the day, \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, on which a State \n     first receives Federal financial assistance for use in that \n     program or activity.\n       (b) Suits Against Officials.--Section 7(g)(2) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     626(g)(2)) applies to any suit pending on or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, as an original \ncosponsor of the Older Workers Rights Restoration Act of 2000.\n  With advances in medicine and science, Americans are living longer \nthan ever before. This means that older Americans are also working \nlonger than ever before. We should ensure that those Americans who work \nwell into the golden years of their lives--including state employees--\ncan do so without fear of being denied a job, fired or overlooked for a \npromotion based on their age.\n  Since enactment of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967, \nour Nation has come a long way in eliminating age discrimination in the \nworkplace. But the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year in Kimel \nv. Florida Board of Regents threatens to turn back the clock on the \nprogress we've made. Under that decision, a state employee who has a \nclaim of employment discrimination based on age cannot bring a private \nlawsuit against a state government under the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act. The state government is immune from such suits. The \nindividual's only legal recourse is to file a complaint with the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission and hope that the EEOC takes the \ncase. But the EEOC has limited resources and only pursues a fraction of \nthe cases filed.\n  Mr. President, this result is unacceptable. Older American workers\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nmake important contributions to their employers--both businesses and \ngovernments, at the state and federal levels. Older Americans should be \nable to work free of even a hint of discrimination. And older Americans \nemployed by state governments deserve the same protections against \ndiscrimination on the job that other older Americans employed by \nprivate businesses or the federal government enjoy.\n  This bill that we introduce today would do just that. It ensures that \nstate employees in federally assisted programs or activities have the \nsame rights and remedies for practices violating the Age Discrimination \nin Employment Act as are available to other employees under that act \nand that were available to state employees prior to the Supreme Court's \nKimel decision.\n  Mr. President, I have had a longstanding commitment to aging issues, \nboth as a U.S. Senator and, previously, as a Wisconsin State Senator. \nIn the U.S. Senate, I have served on the Special Committee on Aging. In \nthe Wisconsin state senate, I served for ten years as the chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Aging. In fact, the first legislation I \nintroduced as a state senator was a bill to eliminate mandatory \nretirement. That bill passed and was signed into law. As a result, \nolder Wisconsin residents have the right to work without being forced \nto retire at a certain age.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords to move this \nimportant legislation through the Senate. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in taking this step toward restoring protections for state employees \nagainst age discrimination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 3010. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nprocedures for the determination of the inability of veterans to defray \nexpenses of necessary medical care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n      legislation for the benefit of land-rich cash poor veterans\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill which \nwould exclude the value of real property of a veteran, or a veteran's \nspouse or dependent, in determining how a veteran's eligibility for \nhealth care from the Department of Veterans Affair (VA) is classified. \nThe bill would also simplify eligibility determinations by eliminating \nthe annual self-reporting burden for veterans, and instead enable the \nDepartment to obtain income information directly from the Internal \nRevenue Service and the Social Security Administration.\n  The problem asset-rich, cash-poor veterans experience in gaining \neligibility for veterans pension and health care benefits was brought \nto my attention late last year by one of my constituents, Larry \nSundall. Larry is one of Iowa's county veterans service officers. He \nserves veterans in Emmet County, in northwest Iowa. In the course of \nhis work, he was finding that many of his farmer-veteran constituents \nwhere in desperate straits with no, or little, income, but still could \nnot qualify for VA pension programs without selling their land. Because \nof the value of their land, these veterans would also be classified in \nCategory 7 for purposes of health service eligibility in the event they \nsought health care from the VA. Category 7 veterans can receive health \ncare services as long as the VA has sufficient funds. However, they are \nrequired to pay co-payments for any health care they receive through \nthe VA because of the value of their land, even if they have no income \nand are in debt to boot. If the administration and Congress don't \nappropriate enough money, these Category 7 veterans will not be \neligible for health care services from the VA.\n  At Larry's urging, I decided to convene a meeting of interested \nparties in Des Moines last April to talk over this issue. Because many \nof his county veterans officials in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and \nSouth Dakota were encountering constituents with similar problems, we \ninvited the associations of county veterans service officers from those \nstates to send a representative to participate. We invited the State \nVeterans Affairs Officers from those states. VA staff from \nheadquarters, regional offices, and VISNs also participated. The \nmeeting was very useful and informative from my perspective, and I am \ngrateful to all who participated. As it happens, the VA's Health \nServices Administration had already recognized the asset test as a \nproblem for veterans and had formed a task force to look into the \nfeasibility of eliminating the asset test. The Veterans Benefits \nAdministration had also begun to discuss the issue. In any case, VA \nparticipants at the meeting agreed to convey the essentials of our \ndiscussion to principal officials at VA headquarters.\n  The problem follows from a provision of Title 38 which holds that the \nSecretary may deny benefits to a veteran ``. . . when the corpus of the \nestate of the veteran . . . is such that under all the circumstances . \n. . it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of such estates be \nconsumed for the veteran's maintenance''. In other words, if the income \nand estate of a veteran are large enough, they should be used before \nthe veteran receives benefits from the VA. The law also states, \nhowever, that liquidations of assets should be required only when it \ncan be done at ``no substantial sacrifice'' to the veteran. Regulations \nimplementing this provision of law contain essentially the same \nlanguage. The complications begin with a VA manual, 21-1, which lays \nout criteria to be used by VA staff in adjudicating eligibility for \npension and health benefits. Under the criteria set out in M21-1, the \nnet worth of a veteran must be adjudicated when the veteran's income \nand net worth is greater than $50,000. Ownership of $50,000 of farm \nland or other real property does not automatically and inevitably mean \nthat adjudicators will declare a farmer veteran ineligible for these VA \nprograms. In principle, the $50,000 is just a threshold which is to \ntrigger adjudication of a veteran's claim for benefits, not to \nautomatically disqualify a veteran for benefits.\n\n  But there are two problems with the treatment of assets in the \nschema. First is the $50,000 level. It's obviously much too low, even \nas a trigger for adjudication. In Iowa currently, the average value of \nan acre of farm land is $1,781. So a farm holding valued at $50,000 \nwould average about 28 acres, clearly two small to be viable. A 40 acre \nfarm, at the current average value per acre, would be worth $71,240. A \nmore viable 80 acre farm would be valued at $142,480. It seems to me, \ntherefore, that the threshold triggering review of a farmer veteran's \nincome and assets should be raised to $150,000. But, second, and more \nfundamentally, the law stipulates, as I noted earlier, that divestiture \nof an estate should not involve ``substantial sacrifice''. It is \ndifficult for me to see that selling off the family farm, in many, if \nnot most, cases, the sole source of livelihood for a farm family, would \nnot involve substantial sacrifice. It thus seems inherently unrealistic \nto require a veteran to liquidate land holdings in order to become \neligible for VA pension benefits or in order to pay co-payments for VA \nhealth care services.\n  What the bill I am introducing today would do is eliminate completely \nthe asset test as a factor is establishing eligibility for health care \nservices. A veteran's income, however, would still be considered in \neligibility determinations. The bill would also permit the Secretary to \ndetermine the attributable income of the veteran using income date from \nthe year preceding the prior year in the event that the Secretary is \nunable to use prior year data. Finally, the bill would permit the \nSecretary to use information obtained from the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Treasury for the \npurpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran.\n  The VA estimates that this proposal should save the VA money, Mr. \nPresident. They estimate that more than $11 million would be saved in \nfiscal year 2001, growing to more than $13 million in fiscal year 2005.\n  I ask that the full text of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3010\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, like so many Americans, I have been faced \nwith a barrage of confusing and frightening information about the \nrecent Firestone tire recall. I have a Ford Explorer, and it has \nFirestone tires on it. My wife and I drive it and take our children and \nour friends and others for rides in that vehicle. So I understand what \na lot of my fellow Vermonters are going through regarding this deadly \nepisode. It never should have happened.\n  But it is not just Explorer owners who are at risk--pedestrians, \njoggers, bicyclists, and other cars could be hit by out-of-control \nvehicles or by tire pieces.\n  The tires on my car are the same size and type as those covered by \nthe recall. But they were manufactured at a different plant--a North \nCarolina plant. Even though employees of that plant have raised serious \nconcerns about quality control in that factory, the tires on my \nExplorer are not eligible for the recall. But I have to tell you, I \nlook long at them each time I get into the vehicle, and it is in the \nback of my mind every time I drive.\n  Even though they tell me that they are not yet the subject of a \nrecall, I wonder what tomorrow's news may bring.\n  The first foreign recall occurred on August 1999, but the Secretary \nof Transportation apparently was not even informed of this by the \nmanufacturer until May of 2000--nearly a year after the fact. That is \noutrageous. It is unacceptable. Worse yet, that kind of delay has \nproven deadly. I don't even want to think about the lives that could \nhave been saved had there been quicker action, and had the \nmanufacturers been honest enough to notify the public immediately.\n  Even after the recall was issued, the deadly risk continues as \nfamilies have to wait to get replacement tires. I want to mention one \nsad case. A grandfather, Gary Meek of Farmersville, California, was a \nretired police officer. He, his wife and granddaughter, Amy, 13 years \nold, were driving on August 16, a couple weeks ago, when a Firestone \ntire on the Ford Explorer separated. His wife survived the crash, but \nMr. Meek and his granddaughter were killed. His widow has to carry on \nwith those awful memories.\n  I am going to introduce legislation today to mandate that the \nSecretary of Transportation be immediately notified of defects in motor \nvehicles or vehicle components--immediately after the foreign \nmanufacturer becomes aware of the dangerous defect or when the \nmanufacturer is notified about the defect by the foreign government. \nThis notification would be earlier in time than the beginning of a \nforeign recall or any efforts to replace the defective product.\n  My bill also requires the manufacturer file a full report on the \ncircumstances regarding each defective vehicle or vehicle component. \nThe bill will impose stiff criminal penalties for false or misleading \nstatements, or efforts to coverup the truth, regarding these reports. \nIt also imposes criminal and civil penalties for other violations of \nthe bill. In other words, if tires are defective, or are going to be \nrecalled or replaced in some other country, they have to notify us--and \nnotify us accurately and truthfully.\n  One would think some of these foreign tire companies would feel a \nmoral duty to save lives. You would think that would be enough to \nmotivate them. One would think even the idea of huge fines might \nmotivate them. That doesn't seem to be enough. Maybe if they think they \nwill get a jail sentence if they don't notify us truthfully, maybe, \nthey will put the interests of the lives and safety of the public ahead \nof the short-term gains of their own companies.\n  My bill, the Transportation Information Recall Enhancement Act, \nrequires notification of a foreign dangerous defect within 48 hours. It \nrequires even more detailed information filings a few days later. My \nbill also requires notification of increases in deaths or serious \ninjuries in foreign countries regarding vehicles and vehicle components \nthat could prove deadly if they are on American soil.\n  Secretary Slater said in an interview that there should be a law \nrequiring that the United States be immediately notified of foreign \nrecalls. We are on the way to making that a reality. I will work with \nany Senator, Republican or Democrat, on this issue so we can pass this \nlegislation or any other bill to get the job done in the next couple of \nweeks.\n  It is incomprehensible to me how any corporate executives can live \nwith themselves when they withhold information that could have saved \npeople's lives. If they are going to conceal the truth or make false \nstatements, they should face criminal sanctions. Sometimes if a person \nthinks they are going to end up in the slammer, they will pay a lot \nmore attention to the safety of people, rather than simply looking at \nthe balance sheet.\n  For example, we just received reports about Mitsubishi over the past \ntwo decades. For 20 years, they routinely withheld information about \ndangerous products which ended up in America and other countries. These \ncorporate officers should be forced to explain their inaction to the \nfamilies of those who have been injured using their products. Maybe \nAmericans should not buy any Mitsubishi products because they lied for \n20 years. Criminal penalties are clearly needed. In the global economy \nthere has to be some compassion for the suffering that is sometimes \ncaused around the world. There seems to be almost a disconnect. The \nPresident of Ford Motors, for example, when he heard that Congress was \ngoing to question him, at first was unwilling to testify personally.\n\n  I think he heard an almost national outcry over that insolence and \ndisregard of the people of this country, insolence and arrogance that \nkept him from realizing how concerned Americans were. Fortunately, he \nchanged his mind and found the time. I suspect the appropriate \ncongressional committees would have gotten a subpoena, and the result \nwould have been the same. He would have testified.\n  Every corporation has a right to sell their products. Every \ncorporation has a right to make a decent profit. They\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nought to be able to do that. When they know they have a product that \ncan bring about death or injury, and especially when only they know it \nand nobody else does, they ought to make those facts known. The law \nshould be very clear that they have to make it known. If they \nmanufacture a product in this country to sell both here and abroad, if \nthere are problems in the other country and the product is defective, \nthey should notify this country of that fact. They will lose some \nbusiness in the short term. In the long term, they will do better. The \nAmerican public will be secure, and the American public will not be \nendangered.\n  What Firestone did, what Ford did, and for that matter, what \nMitsubishi did, was wrong. It was absolutely wrong. I want corporate \nleaders never to do this again. I want a law that says if you provide \ninformation to our government regarding defective products that is \nfalse, misleading or untruthful that you are going to go to jail.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a summary of the bill \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3012\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Information \n     Recall Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in an interview with ABC News on September 3, 2000, \n     Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater stated that he \n     thinks there should be a law requiring that the United States \n     be immediately notified of a foreign recall, ``especially in \n     the global economy when you've got U.S. goods really being \n     used by individuals around the world. We should know when \n     there's a problem someplace else.'';\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n     legal requirement for manufacturers of motor vehicles and \n     their components to notify United States agencies of a recall \n     issued in a foreign country;\n       (3) between August 1999 and spring 2000, Ford Motor Company \n     replaced Firestone tires on 46,912 vehicles in Saudi Arabia, \n     Thailand, Malaysia, and South America;\n       (4)(A) on May 2, 2000, the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration opened a preliminary evaluation into Firestone \n     ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires after receiving 90 \n     complaints, primarily from consumers in the Southeast and \n     Southwest, about tread separations or blowouts;\n       (B) as of September 2000, the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration has received over 1,400 complaints, \n     including reports of more than 250 injuries and 88 deaths; \n     and\n       (C) some of the complaints date back to the early 1990s, \n     and 797 of the complaints report that a tire failure took \n     place between August 1, 1999, and August 9, 2000; and\n       (5)(A) on August 9, 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone announced a \n     United States recall of 6,500,000 ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness \n     AT tires; and\n       (B) that date was 3 months after the National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration commenced its investigation and \n     nearly 9 months after Ford Motor Company initiated the \n     replacement of the tires in foreign countries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that \n     defects in motor vehicles or replacement equipment in foreign \n     countries are quickly, accurately and truthfully reported to \n     the United States Secretary of Transportation in cases in \n     which--\n       (1) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is \n     manufactured for export to the United States; or\n       (2) the motor vehicles or replacement equipment is \n     manufactured in the United States using a manufacturing \n     process that is the same as, or similar to, the manufacturing \n     process used in the foreign country, with the result that the \n     motor vehicles or replacement equipment manufactured in the \n     United States may also be defective.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A joint resolution authorizing special awards to \nveterans of service as United States Navy Armed Guards during World War \nI or World War II; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n            LEGISLATION TO HONOR NAVAL ARMED GUARD VETERANS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nprovide a long overdue honor to a distinguished group of American \nveterans. The United States Naval Armed Guard made heroic contributions \nto our naval efforts in World War I and World War II and the time has \ncome for a grateful nation to recognize these brave veterans.\n  The Armed Guard consisted of the officers, gunners, radiomen, \nsignalmen and later medics and radarmen who were placed on cargo ships \nto protect them from armed assault.\n  The U.S. Navy Armed Guard was first constituted during World War I \nand armed gunners served on 384 ships. During World War II, the U.S. \nNavy Armed Guard served on 6,236 merchant ships. 710 of these ships \nwere sunk and many more were damaged in combat. The Armed Guard has \n144,970 men assigned to it before the war ended in 1945. 1,810 men were \nkilled during engagements with the enemy.\n  I am here today because the contributions to victories in the two \nworld wars of these fine patriots has never been recognized by our \nGovernment or the Navy. I believe the Congress should act to honor \nthese veterans whose recognition is both deserved and long overdue.\n  The wartime contributions of these men were absolutely vital to the \nsafe delivery of cargos that took the war to our enemies. Many times \nthey stayed in the fight even as the decks of their ships were awash \nand sinking. What is most notable is that other nations that now are \nfree because of the contributing sacrifices of the U.S. Navy Armed \nGuards, have awarded special medals in recognition of the heroic \nactions of the members of the U.S. Navy Armed Guard Special Force.\n  Mr. President, It is high time we did the right thing and recognized \nthese fine fighting men for their service. This legislation would honor \nthese men in a very fitting way. It will recognized former members of \nthe U.S. Armed Guard Special Force with a special medal that honors \nthem as American heroes. It will recognize the military character of \ntheir service by awarding each of them at least one of the three World \nWar II campaign medals for service in the American, Asiatic-Pacific, \nand Europe-Africa-Middle East theaters of war. Let's do the right thing \nfor this unrecognized group of American veterans who sacrificed so much \nfor their country. For more than fifty years, members of the Naval \nArmed Guard have shared their wartime stories of sacrifice and \ncommitment with one another. Now is the time for all Americans to \nacknowledge their service in a heart felt way.\n  I urge prompt Senate consideration and passage of this legislation.\n\n

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) fiscal discipline, resulting from the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997, and strong economic growth have ended decades of \n     deficit spending and have produced budget surpluses without \n     using the social security surplus;\n       (2) fiscal pressures will mount in the future as the aging \n     of the population increases budget obligations;\n       (3) until Congress and the President agree to legislation \n     that strengthens social security, the social security surplus \n     should be used to reduce the debt held by the public;\n       (4) strengthening the Government's fiscal position through \n     public debt reduction increases national savings, promotes \n     economic growth, reduces interest costs, and is a \n     constructive way to prepare for the Government's future \n     budget obligations; and\n       (5) it is fiscally responsible and in the long-term \n     national economic interest to use an additional portion of \n     the nonsocial security surplus to reduce the debt held by the \n     public.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to--\n       (1) reduce the debt held by the public with the goal of \n     eliminating this debt by 2013; and\n       (2) decrease the statutory limit on the public debt.\n\n     SEC. __03. ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC DEBT REDUCTION PAYMENT \n                   ACCOUNT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 31 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 3114.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) fiscal discipline, resulting from the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997, and strong economic growth have ended decades of \n     deficit spending and have produced budget surpluses without \n     using the social security surplus;\n       (2) fiscal pressures will mount in the future as the aging \n     of the population increases budget obligations;\n       (3) until Congress and the President agree to legislation \n     that strengthens social security, the social security surplus \n     should be used to reduce the debt held by the public;\n       (4) strengthening the Government's fiscal position through \n     public debt reduction increases national savings, promotes \n     economic growth, reduces interest costs, and is a \n     constructive way to prepare for the Government's future \n     budget obligations; and\n       (5) it is fiscally responsible and in the long-term \n     national economic interest to use an additional portion of \n     the nonsocial security surplus to reduce the debt held by the \n     public.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to--\n       (1) reduce the debt held by the public with the goal of \n     eliminating this debt by 2013; and\n       (2) decrease the statutory limit on the public debt.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International \nCarriage by Air, done at Montreal May 28, 1999 (the ``Convention''). \nThe report of the Department of State, including an article-by-article \nanalysis, is enclosed for the information of the Senate in connection \nwith its consideration of the Convention.\n  I invite favorable consideration of the recommendation of the \nSecretary of State, as contained in the report provided herewith, that \nthe Senate's advice and consent to the Convention be subject to a \ndeclaration on behalf of the United States, pursuant to Article 57(a) \nof the Convention, that the convention shall not apply to international \ncarriage by air performed and operated directly by the United States \nfor noncommercial purposes in respect to its functions and duties as a \nsovereign State. Such a declaration is consistent with the declaration \nmade by the United States under the Convention for the Unification of \nCertain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, done at Warsaw \nOctober 12, 1929, as amended (the ``Warsaw Convention'') and is \nspecifically permitted by the terms of the new Convention.\n  Upon entry into force for the United States, the Convention, where \napplicable, would supersede the Warsaw Convention, as amended by the \nProtocol to Amend the Warsaw Convention, done at Montreal September 25, \n1975 (``Montreal Protocol No. 4''), which entered into force for the \nUnited States on March 4, 1999. The Convention represents a vast \nimprovement over the liability regime established under the Warsaw \nConvention and its related instruments, relative to passenger rights in \nthe event of an accident. Among other benefits, the Convention \neliminates the cap on carrier liability to accident victims; holds \ncarriers strictly liable for proven damages up to 100,000 Special \nDrawing Rights (approximately $135,000) (Special Drawing Rights \nrepresent an artificial `basket' currency developed by the \nInternational Monetary Fund for internal accounting purposes to replace \ngold as a world standard); provides for U.S. jurisdiction for most \nclaims brought on behalf of U.S. passengers; clarifies the duties and \nobligations of carriers engaged in code-share operations; and, with \nrespect to cargo, preserves all of the significant advances achieved by \nMontreal Protocol No. 4.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to a declaration that the Convention shall not \napply to international carriage by U.S. State aircraft, as provided for \nin the Convention.\n                                                  William J.

Res. 134\n\n       Whereas September 8, 2000 marks the 100th anniversary of \n     the hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas on September 8, \n     1900, the deadliest natural disaster in United States \n     history;\n       Whereas an estimated 6,000 people died in a few hours in \n     this thriving port of 37,000, dubbed the ``Wall Street of the \n     West'' at the dawn of the 20th century;\n       Whereas vast waves, surging flood waters, and powerful \n     winds of more than 120 miles an hour overtook the town, in an \n     era without radar, satellites, or modern radio, making off-\n     shore hurricanes difficult to track;\n       Whereas the residents of Galveston island showed much \n     courage and sacrifice during the tempest, exemplified by 10 \n     nuns who lost their lives along with the 90 children they \n     were trying to save at St. Mary's Orphanage on the beach;\n       Whereas Galveston never lost her resilient spirit, built a \n     sturdy 17-foot sea wall that staved off other fierce \n     hurricanes, pumped in millions of tons of sand from the Gulf \n     of Mexico in order to raise the level of the city and its \n     buildings to a safer height, and became a beautiful and \n     prosperous town yet again;\n       Whereas the city of Galveston is this year holding a \n     ceremony commemorating the hurricane, launching educational \n     efforts, and celebrating the rebirth of Galveston after the \n     storm; and\n       Whereas our Nation, which benefits from modern weather \n     technology and the lessons learned from the Galveston \n     tragedy, should never cease to improve hurricane forecasting \n     and make life safer and more secure along our coasts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) September 8, 2000 is designated as Galveston Hurricane \n     National Remembrance Day; and\n       (2) the President is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation in memory of the thousands of Galvestonians and \n     other Americans who lost their lives in the devastating \n     hurricane of 1900 and the survivors who rebuilt Galveston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8126-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2000\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Immediately following that vote, a vote will occur \non the motion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation. Therefore, two \nback-to-back votes will occur at approximately 9:40 a.m. Following \nthose two votes, the Senate will consider the China PNTR bill. It is \nhoped that agreements can be reached on various amendments to the bill \nand, therefore, votes can be expected to occur throughout the day.\n  As a reminder, the filing deadline for all first-degree amendments to \nthe energy and water appropriations bill was 6:30 this evening. As a \nfurther reminder, the Senate will continue to consider the China trade \nbill and the energy and water appropriations bill on a dual track for \nthe remainder of the week, with votes expected throughout each day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/06/senate-section/article/S8126-5", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8126-S8127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
