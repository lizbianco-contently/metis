Mr. President, I am here on the floor at this \nparticular time to ask the President of the United States who ``they'' \nare, and I hope the word ``they'' includes the President of the United \nStates. I hope the President of the United States is the chief \n``they.'' I hope we don't get into a position of debating what the \ndefinition of the word ``they'' is. The Constitution is pretty clear--\nthe President of the United States has all the executive power that \nexists in our Government.\n  That is the background for my visiting with you about the Wen Ho Lee \ncase, the President's comments last week in regard to the release of \nWen Ho Lee, and how the executive branch treated this Chinese American.\n  This is the latest instance of President Clinton failing to take \nresponsibility and refusing to hold himself accountable for the actions \nof his administration.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  The background of Wen Ho Lee--for those who may not have been \nfollowing this over the last year--is that the Government has recently \nagreed to let this former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos Laboratories \nplead guilty to a relatively minor charge and go home with a slap on \nthe wrist.\n  I think we all agree that his release is the justifiable thing to do. \nBut it was only a short time ago that the executive branch was claiming \nthat Wen Ho Lee was such a serious threat to American national security \nthat he belonged in solitary confinement and in shackles with \npractically no ability for Mr. Lee to even contact his family. Now, \nafter this long period of time in confinement, he gets a slap on the \nwrist and his freedom.\n  Obviously, the executive branch of Government couldn't back up its \nallegations with proof or this case would not have settled as it did. \nDespite the dire pronouncements made to the public about Wen Ho Lee, \nthe fact is the Government didn't even have a case. It had only \nsuspicions. Mr. Lee has, of course, paid a very high price for the \nsuspicions of some in the executive branch.\n  Maybe because Lee is Asian American, there is not the outcry over the \nloss of civil liberties that there would be had Lee been a member of \nsome other minority group. The same people who speak up against some \nminorities being mistreated because of civil liberties evidently don't \nseem inclined to speak up in the case of an Asian American.\n  Mr. Lee's treatment has caused widespread public outcry. How can this \nhappen in America where we treasure freedom and where the rule of law \nhas been the basis for our country's law going back to the setting up \nof the colonies? How could the government damage the reputation of a \ncitizen by labeling him as a spy for the Communist Chinese, lock him \naway for 9 months of solitary confinement, and then just simply drop \nthe case? Our Government has damaged its reputation by the way it \nhandled the Lee case.\n  The American people are outraged. Pundits and political observers \nhave raised legitimate questions about the abusive way in which Mr. Lee \nwas treated by the executive branch of Government.\n  In the midst of this justifiable criticism, President Clinton decided \nthat it was time for him, as President of the United States, to chime \nin. President Clinton happens to be the Chief Executive Officer of the \ncountry. He thinks, like the rest of us, that the executive branch of \nGovernment may have abused its power in the way it went after Mr. Lee \nand kept him confined for such a long period of time.\n  What troubles me about President Clinton's comments is that he acts \nas if he, as President of the United States, is just some sideline \nobserver who doesn't have anything to do with the way the laws in this \ncountry are enforced.\n  As every high school student learned in their civics classes, the \nexecutive power of the Government is vested in the President of the \nUnited States, article II, section I:\n\n       The executive power shall be vested in the President of the \n     United States of America.\n\n  This is pretty simple language and pretty definitive. These words \nmeans the President is in charge of law enforcement. The President is \nin charge of protecting our national security.\n  So, even if the President delegated some of his power to the Attorney \nGeneral, the President is responsible for what happened to Mr. Lee.\n  I hope the President can just once before he leaves office, and as \npart of his legacy, say he is responsible for what happened under his \nwatch. I would like to have him say: I and the people I appointed are \nresponsible for what happened to Mr. Lee.\n  But, no. He said in his news conference ``they'' did this--``they'' \nheld him; ``they'' had these charges. It was always ``they,'' ``they,'' \n``they.'' I happen to think President Clinton is the chief ``they.'' He \nis above all the rest of the ``theys.''\n\n  It happens that President Clinton seems to think the Justice \nDepartment is some agency of government outside of his control. Surely \nthe President knows better than this. The Washington Post certainly \ndoes. This past Saturday, the Post editorial page commented on the Wen \nHo Lee case:\n\n       President Clinton asks us to see him as one more \n     commentator troubled by the case, rather than as the head of \n     the government that brought it.\n\n  In other words, I think the Washington Post is saying the President \nis, in fact, the chief ``they;'' or he is in charge of all the rest of \nthe ``theys.'' Of course, as far as I am concerned, the Washington Post \nis right on this point.\n  The nation is waiting for real leadership, not another evasion or \nmore misdirection. President Clinton may be an ``artful dodger,'' but \nthis is one dodge that just won't work. The American people elected \nPresident Clinton to be in that office so he could lead, not blame \nsubordinates.\n  The Constitution is crystal clear that the President has the ultimate \nresponsibility of leadership and the ultimate power of our executive \nbranch. It is high time for President Clinton to follow the \nConstitution and take responsibility for the sorry actions that took \nplace in regard to Mr. Wen Ho Lee during this administration.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8642-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8642-S8644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk \na little bit about where we are, where we are going, and what we face \nthis week and the few remaining weeks we have before us. There will be \nsome more Senators to come over to the floor shortly to talk about some \nof the issues we have before us, particularly debt reduction, which we \nare committed to undertake this week, and I think is one of the most \nimportant things we can do. We will be talking, of course, about many \nof the things that are left to discuss.\n  We have done a number of things in this Congress, of course, and we \nhave a number of things yet to do, particularly appropriations. Those \nappropriations need to be finished by the end of the fiscal year which \nis the end of September. So we have a very short time to handle these \nthings. We have worked at it for a good long time. We seem to have had \na repetition of obstructions to moving forward.\n  I hope we are now in a position to go ahead and fund those programs \nthat have been authorized, that are out there for the American people, \nand that we do not find ourselves using this time to begin to insert \ninto these bills all kinds of things that have already been discussed \nand that are intended more to create an issue than they are to find a \nsolution.\n  There have been, of course, a number of very important things done \nthis year; we need to recognize that. I guess people have different \nideas about how many things and what kinds of things. There is a great \ndifference in the view of the direction this Government should take and \nwhat is the role of the Federal Government, whether the Government \nought to tells us what to do or whether, in fact, the Government's role \nis to establish a framework in which we make our own decisions at the \nlocal level, as opposed to being dictated to by the Washington \nbureaucracy.\n  These are some of the big issues. We passed the marriage tax relief \nbill here in the Congress. That would have been largely a resolution to \nan issue of fairness, where two single persons, each earning X amount \nof dollars and paying X in taxes, when they get married, making the \nsame dollars, pay a larger amount of taxes. Unfair? Of course. \nUnfortunately, that bill was vetoed by the President, so we will have \nto take it up at another time. I do not think it will be taken up this \nyear. Obviously, the White House is determined they will not permit tax \nrelief of this kind.\n  We passed the elimination of the death tax. That is very important. \nSome indicated it was only for the very wealthy. Of course that is not \ntrue. We have very many people in my State of Wyoming in the \nagriculture business, small businesses, families that have put \ntogether--sometimes over generations--a business. That business then \nhas to be disposed of because they have to pay 52 percent taxes. That, \nof\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\ncourse, was also vetoed by the President.\n  We did get some tax relief. Very important was elimination of the \nSocial Security earnings test, which eliminates the tax on earnings by \nseniors 65 to 69. Previous to that, seniors in that category lost a \ndollar in Social Security benefits for every $3 earned. Again, I think \nit is largely a fairness proposition and we are pleased that did \nhappen.\n  The digital signatures bill, of course, is very important as we move \ninto a new era in the business activities of our Nation. The digital \nsignatures bill makes it easy for people to have legal protection in \ncontracts of that kind.\n\n  On national security, the Iran Nonproliferation Act was very \nimportant for free trade. It dealt with free trade in the sub Sahara, \nAfrica, and the Caribbean. It is important those things continue to be \ndone. I come from a State where agriculture is very important. Nearly \n40 percent of our agricultural products are sold for export. We find \nourselves dealing with unilateral sanctions, which often limit what we \ncan sell to those people. Then they go somewhere else for it. We made \nsome progress in that area, certainly. I hope we will make some more.\n  We have done a good deal of work on affordable education; education \nsavings accounts. We made available $500-$2,000 in tax relief for \neducation. We need to get that forwarded.\n  Also, with health care, we passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that \nsays you can appeal, but the first appeal goes to a medical \nprofessional and not to lawyers. I think that is the better way to go. \nThe opposition, of course, has seen to it that it ultimately not pass, \nbut it has passed here.\n  We passed bankruptcy reform which provided that if persons were able \nto repay at least a portion of their debt, that was an appropriate \nthing to do.\n  So we have made a substantial amount of progress. We have, I think, \nmany issues we need to discuss that are terribly important. This is a \nplace for decisions on the direction we take, which is what elections \nare about, and the direction that you and I as voters and as citizens \nbelieve the country ought to move. There are legitimate differences. \nThat is really what we deal with. Unfortunately, many times we do not \nget down to what those real differences are but get tied up in other \nthings.\n  On education, for example, I do not think there is a Senator in this \nplace who doesn't believe education is one of the most important issues \nbefore us. Almost everyone in the country thinks that. The question is \nnot that. The question is, What kind of educational support do we \nexpect from the Federal Government? The amount the Government \ncontributes from the Federal level is about 7 percent, but it is \nsubstantial. It deals with certain things such as special education. \nThe real issue has not been that. The real issue is whether the Federal \nbureaucracy should tell the school districts what they ought to do with \nthat Federal money or whether, indeed, we send it there and say they \nmay have unique problems and need to spend their money for different \nthings. The needs in Pinedale, WY, are different than they are in \nPittsburgh, PA. We believe that. That has been the difference. I think \nit is a fundamental difference in government.\n  Social Security--no one would object to the notion we ought to \nstrengthen Social Security. I think everyone would agree with the idea \nwe want Social Security dollars to be safely entrenched. But there are \nsome differences as to how we do that. There is a proposition on the \nfloor that I support--I think it is excellent--that would give a choice \nto younger people. People over 55 or whatever probably would stay the \nsame, but younger people would have an opportunity to invest or have \ninvested in their behalf a portion of those Social Security dollars in \nthe private sector, in equities. They could choose whether it be in \nstocks or whether it be in bonds or whether it be in combination. The \npoint being, if we do not do something about Social Security by the \ntime young people who are now beginning to pay in become eligible for \nbenefits, there will not be any, the demographics have changed so much.\n  We started out with over 20 people working for every 1 drawing \nbenefits. Now we have 3 people working for every 1 who draws benefits; \nit will soon be 2. We have to do something different than what we have \nbeen doing in the past. Obviously, you can raise taxes if you choose. \nThat is not a popular idea. You can lower benefits, again not a popular \nidea. A third alternative is you can increase the return on those \ndollars that you have paid in and are in the trust account, and that is \nthe difference.\n  There is not agreement on that so we have to choose which way we want \nto go.\n  I mentioned the Patients' Bill of Rights. Do you want someone in the \nmedical community making a decision instead of your insurance company \nor do you want to go to court? You get to court, of course, long after \nthe medical decision should have been made.\n  We ought to be doing something to pay down the debt. We talk about \npaying down the debt, but we do not seem to do much on that. There is a \nproposition that I think is great, and that is to set aside, as one \nwould with a house mortgage, money and say we are going to pay down so \nmuch of this $5 trillion every year and it becomes part of the budget. \nIt makes a lot of sense to me. We find opposition to that because \npeople want to spend the money, and if there is a surplus, they think \nGovernment ought to grow and get into many other areas. That is a \nphilosophical difference of opinion.\n  Tax reduction is much the same. When we have a surplus, it seems to \nme if after having funded the programs that have been authorized, after \nhaving done something to strengthen Medicare and having done something \nto begin to pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security, there is \nstill surplus left, let that go. If we leave it here, it will be spent. \nIt ought to go back to the people who paid in those dollars.\n  Again, it is a different view than those who generally on the other \nside of the aisle want more Government, more expenditures, and do not \nagree with that idea. Those are legitimate differences. We have to make \na decision, and we have to move forward. We haven't much time to do \nmany of those things.\n  Some of the questions before us are more parochial, more applicable \nto different parts of the country. I come from a State where 50 percent \nof the land belongs to the Federal Government, so the management of \nFederal lands and Federal resources have a great impact on our lives \nand on our economy.\n  Everyone wants to preserve our resources. They want to take care of \nthe natural resources. Certainly I do. I am chairman of the Parks \nSubcommittee. There is nothing I care more about than preserving those \nresources. At the same time, if we are going to do that, we need to \nhave an opportunity for the owners to have access and to enjoy these \nresources. We also need to have multiple use so we can have hunting, \nhiking, grazing, and mineral production.\n  Those are the kinds of issues with which we need to deal. The \nquestion is, How deeply do we want the Federal Government involved in \nmaking all the decisions in our lives? It is a legitimate difference.\n  We are ready to move forward now. Out of 13 appropriations bills, we \nhave completed 2. We have 11 to go. We will be putting together \nprobably one or two bills at a time. I hope we do not come to the end \nwith a huge omnibus package. That is not good governance. I hope we can \navoid that.\n  If, for example, we are considering the Interior appropriations bill, \nI hope we can get away from talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights \nor minimum wage. Those issues are great issues. We have already dealt \nwith them. We have already voted on them. I think simply to bring them \nup as a blockage to moving forward with what we have to do is a mistake \nin governance. I hope we do not do that.\n\n  I expect the chairman of the Budget Committee to come to the floor \nshortly and talk a little more about the budget, about the surplus, \nabout the prospects of what we are going to do with those dollars; \nwhether we can, indeed, take 90 percent of this surplus and put it into \ndebt reduction and still have about $27 billion or $28 billion to deal \nwith those issues that need to be strengthened, such as Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  We have an opportunity to do those things. I am hopeful that each of \nus as\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\ncitizens and voters of this country will take a look at how we see the \nfuture role of the Federal Government.\n  We need to deal, obviously, with the military. Defense continues to \nbe a most important item. Most people will agree we have not \nfinancially supported the military to the extent it needs to be \nsupported for them to carry out the mission we have assigned. We have \nmade some progress. We have put more money into the military over the \nlast several years, more than the administration has asked for, in \nfact. We need to continue to do that so we can have a safe United \nStates.\n  I hope we can move forward. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss a \nlittle bit of my view of where we ought to go.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I spoke on the floor about how \nstrongly I feel against providing permanent normal trade relations to \nChina. I touched on a number of subjects, including human rights, \nChina's antagonism toward Taiwan, and the threat that it poses to our \nown national security.\n  Unfortunately, over the last 2 weeks I have watched these issues be \nswept under the rug as the Senate has given away its voice on our trade \nrelations with the most populous nation on the globe.\n  But while I expect the Senate will pass this PNTR, I do not intend to \ngo down without one final swing. It is too important for our Nation not \nto sum up why the opponents of PNTR believe it is such a dangerous \nmistake.\n  For the last decade, I have been a vocal opponent of providing most \nfavored nation or normal trade relations to China. For me, it all boils \ndown to putting profits over people. I think that is just plain wrong \nand un-American. But while we were never able to stop Congress from \napproving MFN, at least we had an open and public debate on the issue \nevery year. But by passing PNTR, we will even lose this right.\n  For years we have been able to use the annual debate to discuss the \nwisdom of granting broad trade privileges to Communist China. When the \nstudents were massacred in Tiananmen Square, or when the Chinese \nmilitary threatened democracy in Taiwan, or when the revelations came \nto light about China spreading weapons of mass destruction to \nterrorists, we had a chance in the House and in the Senate to shine the \nspotlight on Communist China.\n\n  By passing PNTR, that spotlight will grow dim and the stick we were \nonce able to wield under the most-favored-nation-status law will now be \nreplaced by a rubber stamp bearing the letters, ``W-T-O.''\n  My opponents on this issue talk as if the American economy will fail \nif we do not pass this bill, that it is so important we should sweep \naside all of the concerns about China and all of the evidence of \nwrongdoing because we should not ``rock the boat.'' That is ridiculous.\n  I say, on something as fundamental as our national security, we \nshould not just say we have to go along to get along. If this is as \nimportant an issue as supporters of PNTR make it out to be--that it is \none of the most monumental votes in years--then we should have done it \nright. Instead, we have seen the deliberate process short circuited by \nblood oaths among Senators to oppose all amendments no matter how \nworthy. We have watched the supporters of PNTR move Heaven and Earth to \navoid a conference with the House.\n  Remember, the Congress of the United States is supposed to be writing \nthis bill, not the business community, not the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and especially not the Chinese.\n  The American people are listening. The cameras are rolling. The \npressure is on to do what is right. But in this instance I think we \nhave failed.\n  But before we hand over the keys of our economic engine, I think it \nis important that we take one last cold, hard look at who is exactly \ndoing the driving. This is China's record.\n  China ships weapons of mass destruction to terrorist nations.\n  China operates one of the most oppressive regimes in the world, \nbrutalizing and slaughtering its own people.\n  China threatens other free nations such as Taiwan and snubs its nose \nat the international community by occupying Tibet.\n  China tried to buy access to our Government through illegal campaign \ncontributions and to influence our own elections.\n  There it is in black and white. But in the name of expediency and \nPresidential legacy, we are about to grant this nation full and open \ntrade relations. I do not care how you spin it, that does not make any \nsense.\n  For over a decade, the supporters of free trade with China have been \nmaking the argument over and over again that China is changing, that \nthings are getting better, and we will soon reap the benefits of free \ntrade with China. All the facts prove them wrong.\n  It has been over 10 years since Tiananmen Square, and the Chinese are \nstill slaughtering their own people. They are still selling weapons to \nterrorists. And they are still bullying other nations and threatening \nthe United States. Nothing is any different with China now. In fact, it \nmight be worse. Those who say otherwise are only fooling themselves.\n  While the annual debates on MFN or PNTR, or whatever you want to call \nit, might not have turned the tide in China, to now provide even less \ndebate and scrutiny can only make things worse for the Chinese people.\n  I think the supporters are right about one thing. The final vote on \nthis bill is going to be one of the most pivotal votes in years, one we \nwill look back upon as a fateful moment in our history. I am afraid \nhistory is not going to be kind to Congress for passing this \nlegislation, for abdicating our role in overseeing trade relations with \nChina.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a sad day in Congress. I am sorry to say we are \ngoing to do the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the Presiding \nOfficer's statement with respect to PNTR. We will have a vote on that \ntomorrow. I share many of the Senator's sentiments with respect to the \nconcerns of the American people about PNTR. My constituents, frankly, \nfrom the correspondence I have received, are overwhelmingly opposed to \nit.\n  I also share the concerns he expressed about some of the remaining \nproblems we will continue to face with respect to China, not only \ncontinuing trade problems but also problems that relate to our national \nsecurity. I would like to discuss some of these remaining concerns and \nhow I have attempted to resolve those concerns which is why, at the end \nof the day, I am going to vote to support PNTR notwithstanding those \nconcerns.\n  But I will continue to urge my colleagues that we be able to address \nboth the continuing trade disputes that will not be resolved by China's \naccession into the WTO and also the national security concerns that \nwill certainly continue to exist after China's accession into the WTO.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate's debate about whether to grant China \npermanent normal trade status comes to a close this week, and a \nlopsided vote in favor of granting such status is anticipated, it is \nimperative for the United States to continue to address numerous \nimportant issues in our country's relationship with China.\n  As I outlined last week, the concerns posed by China's aggressive \nmilitary modernization, threats by its leaders to attack the United \nStates or our ally Taiwan, and its irresponsible proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to rogue nations, \nmust command attention and should\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\nnot be forgotten after passage of this trade bill. I believe the Senate \nmissed an opportunity to address some of these important concerns last \nweek, when an amendment offered by Senator Fred Thompson to impose \nsanctions on organizations in China that engage in the proliferation of \nballistic missiles and nuclear, biological, chemical weapons failed. It \nis also important to take steps to counter China's military moves that \nthreaten the U.S., such as its targeting of nuclear-tipped missiles on \nAmerican cities. Here too we missed an opportunity earlier this year, \nwhen President Clinton decided to delay deployment of a national \nmissile defense system.\n  With regard to Taiwan, I believe it is important that the United \nStates support our long-standing, democratic ally. The communist regime \nin Beijing uses every available opportunity to undermine international \nsupport for Taiwan, and this extends to trade issues as well. Despite \nearlier promises to the United States that it would not block Taiwan's \nadmission to the World Trade Organization, in recent weeks, China has \nnonetheless sought to do just that. I had originally intended to offer \nan amendment to the PNTR legislation that would have conditioned the \nextension of normal trade relations to China on Taiwan entry into the \nWTO, but agreed to withdraw the amendment after receiving assurances \nfrom President Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene \nBarshefsky that the U.S. would insist on this result.\n  I will have more to say about these national security concerns, but I \nwould first point out that China's record on trade compliance must be \nclosely monitored, and the United States must insist on action when \nChina fails to comply with the very set of international trade rules it \nhas agreed to adhere to through the WTO. The United States must also be \ndiligent about efforts to pressure China into drastically changing its \nrecord on human rights, religious freedom, forced abortions and the \nharvesting of baby and adult human organs. It is unfortunate that the \nSenate did not pass a number of other amendments offered or debated \nlast week that sought to deal with these issues.\n  Despite unacceptable behavior by the Chinese government on a range of \nissues, I intend to vote for PNTR for China, because of other benefits \nthis step will bring. Trade with China has become an increasingly \nimportant issue for the United States, due to the expansive growth of \nits economy, and the desire of American firms to compete in the Chinese \nmarket. The United States and China has been negotiating a bilateral \ntrade agreement for twelve years. With the passage of PNTR, and China's \nsubsequent admittance to the WTO, this bilateral trade agreement will \ntake effect.\n  China is the world's fifth largest trading market, and the United \nStates could gain substantially from a lowering of Chinese tariffs on \nU.S. goods and services. Under the negotiated trade agreement, overall \nChinese tariffs on American industrial goods will fall from 24.6 \npercent today to 9.4 percent by 2005--May 2000 report, ``The U.S. \nEconomy and China's Admission to the WTO, Joint Economic Committee. \nArizona, in particular, should benefit. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, Arizona exported $243 million in goods and \nservices to China in 1998, up from $67 million in 1993. Of those \nexports, 58 percent were in electronics and electric equipment; under \nthe trade agreement tariffs on this type of equipment will be reduced \nfrom 13 percent to 0 percent at the time of China's accession to the \nWTO. Over the next five years, tariffs will be significantly reduced on \nbeef, cotton, fruits, and vegetables, all which represent potential \nexport opportunities for Arizona. As tariffs are reduced in China and \ndemand for U.S. goods and services increases there, significant numbers \nof jobs should be created in the United States, particularly in \nArizona.\n  It is also possible, though perhaps not yet probable, that increased \ntrade with the United States could also have a liberalizing effect on \nChina itself, exposing its people to free ideas and making the regime \nimprove its dismal human rights record. PNTR for China, and the \nsubsequent U.S.-China trade agreement, may also increase chances for \neconomic improvements in China. Dismantling state-operated enterprises \nin favor of private sector investment may produce better, higher-paying \njobs for its Chinese citizens.\n  If the United States does not grant PNTR to China and make effective \nthe U.S.-China trade agreement that will benefit U.S. workers and \nbusinesses, I am certain other countries will step in and take \nopportunities away from our U.S. manufacturing and service sectors.\n  As I outlined briefly in the opening of my statement, however, a \nnumber of issues will continue to plague the United States' \nrelationship with China. Trade alone does not define our relationship \nwith China, and as I have stated repeatedly, national security and \nhuman rights issues must continue to command the attention of the \nAdministration and the elected representatives of the American people \nin Congress.\n  China poses a special challenge for America, not merely because of \nits growing economy and increasingly capable military, but because the \npath of its evolution remains unknown. We need to be realistic in our \ndealings with China and take steps to defend our security when \nwarranted.\n  Although China has embraced some elements of a free-market economic \nsystem, the country is still led by a repressive communist regime that \nstill tries to maintain tight control over its people and their \nexposure to Western ideas. The Chinese government has also been hostile \nto the United States in several areas, despite the efforts of the \nClinton Administration to ``engage'' its leaders.\n  For example, China has targeted some of its long-range nuclear-tipped \nmissiles on American cities and has threatened to use them if the U.S. \ncame to the aid of Taiwan. As a commentary in the state-owned People's \nLiberation Army Daily stated in February, ``China is neither Iraq or \nYugoslavia, but a very special country . . . it is a country that has \ncertain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and the \ncapacity of launching a long-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise \nmove to be at war with a country such as China, a point which U.S. \npolicymakers know fairly well also.'' Another editorial published in \nMarch of this year in a different state-owned paper was even more \nblunt, warning that, ``The United States will not sacrifice 200 million \nAmericans for 20 million Taiwanese.''\n  It is important that the United States takes steps to protect \nourselves through the deployment of a national missile defense system. \nWe need to deploy such a system as soon as the technology to do so is \nready, and we should pursue sea- and space-based defenses that offer \ntremendous advantages when combined with the ground-based system \ncurrently under development.\n  We also need to send clear signals to China about our intentions \nbehind the deployment of a national missile defense system and our \ncommitment to our long-standing ally Taiwan. For example, I'm \ndisappointed that the Senate did not pass the Taiwan Security \nEnhancement Act earlier this year. This bill would have increased \ntraining for Taiwan's military officers at U.S. military schools, \npermitted U.S.-flag officers to visit Taiwan, and established a secure \ncommunications link between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries. It was a \nmodest piece of legislation that should have been passed to demonstrate \nour support for Taiwan.\n  Another area where the U.S. needs to stand by Taiwan is in supporting \nits admission to the WTO. I though it was particularly important to \naddress this specific issue during the Senate's consideration of the \nChina PNTR bill in light of recent moves by China to block Taiwan's \nadmission to the trade group.\n  Taiwan has been negotiating to become a member of the WTO since 1990 \nand has met the substantive criteria for membership. Furthermore, based \non its importance to the world economy, Taiwan should be admitted to \nthe WTO. It has the 19th largest economy and is the 14th largest \ntrading nation in the world. Taiwan's economy is also closely linked to \nthe U.S. It is America's 8th largest trading partner and purchases more \nAmerican goods than many of our other major trading partners, like \nmainland China, Australia, and Italy.\n  On several occasions, Chinese officials had assured the United States \nthat China would not block Taiwan's\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nentry to the WTO as a separate entity. According to the Wall Street \nJournal, earlier this month, however, Chinese President Jiang Zemin \ntold President Clinton and a business group in New York that Taiwan \ncould only be admitted to the WTO as a province of China. This \nstatement by President Jiang was particularly concerning since it came \non the heels of other troubling moves by China. On September 7, Chinese \nForeign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said that China wanted its claim to \nsovereignty over Taiwan written into the terms of the WTO's rules, \nstating, ``The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: Taiwan \ncan join WTO as a separate customs territory of China.''\n  Furthermore, the Wall Street Journal reported in July that:\n\n       . . . as WTO staff members draw up the so-called protocol \n     agreements--the reams of paper that define exactly what \n     concessions China will make in order to gain entry into the \n     organization--China is insisting that its claim over Taiwan \n     be recognized in the legal language . . . chief Chinese \n     negotiator Long Yongtu said . . . such a stand ``is a matter \n     of principle for us'' . . . That would upset a consensus \n     within the WTO that Taiwan should be allowed to enter the \n     club as a separate economic area--that is, not an independent \n     country, but also not as an explicit part of China. Some WTO \n     members have argued that Taiwan has long since fulfilled its \n     requirements to join the club and its application has been \n     held up only to satisfy China's demand that Taiwan shouldn't \n     win entry to the organization first.\n\n  In order to help ensure that China lived up to its promises to the \nUnited States, and that Taiwan's entry to the WTO was not unnecessarily \nimpeded, I filed an amendment to H.R. 4444, the bill we are currently \ndebating. The text of H.R. 4444 stated that the extension of permanent \nnormal trade relations to China ``shall become effective no earlier \nthan the effective date of the accession of the People's Republic of \nChina to the World Trade Organization.'' My amendment would have added \none additional condition, stating that permanent normal trade relations \nwith China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date \nof the accession of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan as \nseparate customs territories to the World Trade Organization.''\n  Late last week, I agreed not to offer this amendment because of the \nstrong assurances I received from President Clinton and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Barshefsky that the United States would insist on \nTaiwan's entry to the WTO as a separate entity. As the President said \nin a letter dated September 12:\n\n       There should be no question that my Administration is \n     firmly committed to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I \n     reiterated in my September 8 meeting with [Chinese] President \n     Jiang Zemin . . . Taiwan will join the WTO under the language \n     agreed to in 1992, namely as the Separate Customs Territory \n     of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese \n     Taipei''). The United States will not accept any other \n     outcome.\n\n  Based on this strong, written assurance from the President of the \nUnited States and others provided privately by Ambassador Barshefsky, I \ndecided not to formally offer my amendment for a vote. It is important \nthat Congress and the Administration stand together in insisting that \nChina live up to its promises and in showing support for Taiwan. In \nthis instance, I am pleased we could work together toward that end.\n  Finally, I want to discuss an area where I believe the Senate missed \nan opportunity to address serious concerns about China's proliferation \nof ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction--our failure to \nadopt the Thompson amendment.\n  Over the past decade, China has been the world's worst proliferator \nof the technology used to develop and produce nuclear and chemical \nweapons and ballistic missiles, narrowly edging Russia and North Korea \nfor this dubious distinction. Beijing has sold ballistic missile \ntechnology to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan. It has \nsold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. And it has aided Iran's \nchemical weapons program and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles.\n  Chinese assistance has been vital to the missile and weapons of mass \ndestruction programs in these countries. And because of this \nassistance, the American people and our forces and friends abroad face \na much greater threat.\n  Sadly, the efforts of the Clinton Administration to end Beijing's \nproliferation have not succeeded. Since taking office in 1993, the \nAdministration has engaged in numerous discussions with senior Chinese \nofficials concerning their failure to live up to international \nnonproliferation norms. But it has failed to impose sanctions on \nChinese organizations and government entities, as required by several \nU.S. laws. Time and time again, the Clinton Administration has either \nrefused to follow laws requiring sanctions or has done so in a way \ndeliberately calculated to undermine the intent of the sanctions.\n  For example, the Administration has not imposed the required \nsanctions on China for the sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Despite \nthe unanimous judgment of our intelligence agencies that this sale has \ntaken and incriminating evidence such as photographs of M-11 missile \ncanisters in Pakistan and training exercises by Pakistani troops with \nthe missile, the Administration has said the evidence was not strong \nenough for it to impose sanctions, since it can not be sure the missile \ntransfer actually took place.\n  Another example of the Administration's failure to act concerns the \ntransfer of anti-ship cruise missiles from China to Iran. I would \nremind my colleagues of one example of this danger; in 1987, a similar \nExocet cruise missile killed 37 sailors on the U.S.S. Stark.\n  Iran's possession of this missile was first disclosed in January 1996 \nby Vice Admiral Scott Redd, then-commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. \nAdmiral Redd said the C-802 gave the Iranian military increased \nfirepower and represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the \nU.S. Navy, stating, ``It used to be we just had to worry about land-\nbased cruise missiles. Now they have the potential to have that \nthroughout the Gulf mounted on ships.''\n  According to the Washington Times, in 1995, Defense Department \nofficials recommended declaring that China had violated the Gore-McCain \nIran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, which requires sanctions \nfor the transfer to either country of ``. . . destabilizing numbers and \ntypes and advanced conventional weapons . . .'' Yet State Department \nofficials opposed involving sanctions to avoid damaging relations with \nChina.\n  In his Senate testimony in 1997, Assistant Secretary of State Einhorn \nacknowledged the transaction, stating, ``. . . the question of whether \nchina transferred the C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran is not in \ndoubt.'' He noted that, ``Such missiles increase China's maritime \nadvantage over other Gulf states, they put commercial shipping at risk, \nand they pose a new threat to U.S. forces operating in the region.'' \nBut Mr. Einhorn maintained that the transfer was not ``destabilizing'' \nand thus did not meet the legal requirement for sanctions to be \nimposed.\n  In September 1997, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and \nPacific Affairs Stanley Roth further explained the Administration's \nposition, claiming the C-802 sale ``. . . does not have to be \ndestabilizing if you define it as overturning the ability of the United \nStates to operate in the Persian Gulf. It hasn't done that.'' Mr. Roth \nadded, ``. . . the U.S. Navy tells us that despite the increased threat \nfrom the sale of cruise missiles, it can continue to operate and carry \nout its mission to the Persian Gulf. And so even though [the Navy] is \nexceedingly unhappy with this new development, it is not, on the face \nof it, destabilizing at the point.''\n  Such thinking illustrates how the Clinton Administration has refused \nto implement nonproliferation laws. If the arrival of weapons which \ndirectly threaten the U.S. Navy is not ``destabilizing,'' it is hard to \nimagine what the Administration might find sufficiently destabilizing \nfor sanctions under the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation \nAct.\n  The Senate has specifically addressed the issue of Chinese cruise \nmissile sales. In June 1997, we passed an amendment offered by Senator \nBennett by a vote of 96 to 0, stating: ``The delivery of cruise \nmissiles to Iran is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation \nAct of 1992. It is the sense of the Senate to urge the Clinton \nAdministration to enforce the provisions\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nof the [Act] with respect to the acquisition by Iran of C-802 model \ncruise missiles.'' Despite this unanimous expression by the Senate of \nthe need to enforce the law, the Administration has refused to take \naction in this case.\n  There are many more examples of Chinese proliferation and the \nAdministration's failure to enforce current laws in this area that \nprovide the rationale for the Thompson amendment. In the interest of \ntime, I will not describe them all, but will simply make the point that \nthe Thompson amendment would have helped to combat this deadly trade by \nmaking it clear to China that it would have faced economic penalties \nfrom the U.S. if it continued to proliferate.\n  Mr. President, I would just say in conclusion that trade with China \nis important, and I intend to vote for the PNTR bill. But I believe it \nis imperative that we not forget these important national security \nissues once the debate on PNTR is completed. The challenge before us is \nto deal with China in a way that protects America's national security, \npromotes free trade, demonstrates our support for our democratic ally \nTaiwan, and improves human rights in China. This is a tough job, but \none that I am sure all Senators agree is too important to ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8647-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8647-S8648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter. As I \nbegin, I am reminded of a statement my mother used to make. Actually, I \nrecall my grandmother making this statement.\n  The statement is to ``cut off your nose to spite your face.'' I have \nfound out that actually that phrase can be traced back to the late \n1700s, when our Constitution was created. It essentially means doing \nsomething senseless, frequently out of spite, and which frequently ends \nup hurting the actor. The idea is that you are not happy with your face \nso you are going to cut off your nose. We all understand that that \ndoesn't exactly solve the problem and, in the end, creates a bigger \nproblem than the one with which you started.\n  That phrase is applicable to something our friends of the minority \nare doing with respect to Federal judges. We have heard and have been \nsubjected to a weekly dose of expressions of disappointment by members \nof the minority that the Senate has not confirmed more of President \nClinton's judicial nominees. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nrecently had to respond to that criticism because it had escalated to \nsuch a point that it demanded a response.\n  In fact, not only were members of the Judiciary Committee being \ncritical of the Republican chairman and the Republican Senate for not \nconfirming more judges, but the President and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives chimed in with very, as Senator Hatch called it, \n``reckless and unfounded'' accusations.\n  For example, one Democratic House Member was quoted as saying that \nthe Senate:\n\n       . . . has made the judiciary an exclusive club that closes \n     the door to women and minorities. . . . Its determinations \n     have been made on the basis of racism and sexism, plain and \n     simple.\n\n  Other Democrats have argued that there is a judicial vacancy crisis \nand that ``scores of vacancies continue to plague our Federal courts.'' \nThat is a statement of a prominent member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n  In the face of comments such as this, Senator Hatch had to respond, \nand respond he did. He pointed out that the claims are false, both the \nclaims of the inordinate number of judges being held, allegedly, and \nalso the charge of racism.\n  The Senate considers judicial nominees on the basis of merit, \nregardless of race or gender. As Chairman Hatch pointed out, minority \nand female nominees are confirmed in nearly identical proportion to \ntheir white male counterparts. The Republican Senate is confirming \nnominees at a reasonable rate, about the same rate as has occurred in \nthe past.\n  From statistics I have from the Judiciary Committee, there are \ncurrently 64 vacancies out of the 852-member Federal judiciary, which \nyields a vacancy rates of about 7.5 percent. A good comparison is the \nyear 1994--by the way, at the end of a Democratically-controlled, the \n103rd Congress--when there were 63 judicial vacancies, 1 less, yielding \na vacancy rate of 7.4 percent. By comparison, at the end of the Bush \nadministration, when Democrats controlled the Senate, the vacancy rate \nstood at 12 percent.\n  It is possible to find statistics to prove about anything, but the \nfact is, as the chairman of the committee pointed out, this Congress is \nconfirming judges of the Clinton administration at about the same rate \nas past Congresses, and certainly the vacancy rate is not as bad as it \nhad been at previous times.\n  The important point is that Democrats, members of the minority, who \nare critical of Republicans for not confirming the nominees, need to be \ncareful of this charge because it is they who are now refusing to \nconfirm President Clinton's nominees to the Federal district court. \nThere are currently four nominees who are ready to be brought to the \nfull Senate floor for confirmation. Indeed, all four of these nominees \nwere presented to the minority for their approval. There is no \nobjection on the Republican side.\n  The minority leader, speaking for Members of the Senate minority, \nobjected to the Senate's consideration of confirmation of these four \nClinton nominees to the Federal district court, the only four \ncandidates on whom the Senate can vote. None of the other nominees has \ngone through the committee and is therefore ready for us to act.\n  These are the four nominees currently on the Executive Calendar: \nJudge Susan Ritchie Bolton, Mary Murguia, James Teilborg, and Michael \nReagan. The first three are nominees from Arizona. They were all \nnominated on July 21, 2000, by President Clinton. Michael Reagan of \nIllinois is the other nominee. He was nominated on May 12, 2000.\n  I chaired the hearing for these four nominees on July 25, 2000. They \nare all qualified nominees. I recommended them all to my colleagues on \nthe Judiciary Committee for confirmation. Indeed, they were approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee on July 27, 2000, and sent to the floor for \nconsideration. They were supposed to be confirmed before the August \nrecess. When an unrelated negotiation between Leader Lott and Minority \nLeader Daschle broke down and reached an impasse, floor action on these \nnominees was postponed until this month, when we returned from the \nAugust recess. That is when the minority leader rejected the majority \nleader's request that these four be considered by the full Senate.\n  It doesn't matter to me whether they are confirmed by unanimous \nconsent or by a vote, but in any event, these are the four on whom we \ncan act. They ought to be acted on, and I believe all should be \napproved.\n\n  With respect to the three in Arizona in particular, I note that last \nyear Congress created nine new Federal district court judgeships--four \nfor Florida, three for Arizona, and two for Nevada. There was a very \nspecific reason for this action. There is a huge caseload in these \nthree States. The judges are falling further and further behind, \nprimarily in the State of Arizona; I believe also in Florida. This is \ndue to the number of criminal prosecutions for illegal drugs, alien \nsmuggling, and related cases. All of the new judgeships for Nevada have \nbeen confirmed, and three of the four judgeships for Florida have been \nconfirmed. None of the judgeships for Arizona has been confirmed.\n  It is important that these nominees of President Clinton be confirmed \nby the Senate. They are critical to handling the caseload in the State \nof Arizona.\n  Here is where the old phrase of my mother and grandmother comes into \nplay: cutting off your nose to spite your face. Because some of the \nmembers of the minority party wish we could confirm even more judges, \nthey are holding up the confirmation of these judges. There is nothing \nagainst the qualifications of any of the four. It is just that if they \ncan't have everything their way, then, by golly, nobody is going to get \nanything.\n  It is President Clinton who has nominated these four candidates. It \nis not somebody from Arizona, though Democratic Congressman Ed Pastor \nand Senator McCain and I strongly support these three nominees.\n  One, Mary Murguia, is a career Federal prosecutor. She is currently \nat the\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\nU.S. Department of Justice as the executive director of the Attorneys \nGeneral Association. She would be, incidentally, the first Latino ever \nto be confirmed for the U.S. district court from the State of Arizona.\n  Jim Teilborg is a lifelong trial attorney with enormous experience in \ncourts and would--I think everyone recognizes--make a tremendous \nFederal judge.\n  Judge Susan Bolton is one of the most respected members of the \nArizona Superior Court, the trial court at the State court level, one \nof the most respected judges in the entire State. In fact, I have \nreceived comments from many lawyers who have said: We think your three \nnominees from Arizona are fantastic. We just wish Judge Bolton didn't \nhave to leave because she is so important to the judiciary at the State \nlevel.\n  Judge Michael Regan from Illinois, likewise, has very high \nqualifications. The point is this: These are Clinton administration \nnominees. They are needed to fill important vacancies in the Federal \ndistrict court. Members of the minority have complained incessantly all \nyear long that we need more judges and that the Senate needs to confirm \nthe President's nominees, and they complain when the Senate has taken \nmore time than they thought was warranted to confirm these judges. So \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee acts to put these judges before the full \nSenate, and what happens? Members of the minority object. They won't \nlet the Senate even vote on these four nominees. That is what I call \ncutting off your nose to spite your face.\n  It is obstruction tactics; it is dealmaking at its worst. This is \nwhat people object to when they look at the Federal Government. It \ndoesn't treat these individuals as human beings whose lives and careers \nare on hold. Incidentally, it has happened before. This is not the \nfirst time members of the minority have held up the nomination of a \nDemocratic nominee by the Democratic President. In 1997, Democrats \nblocked the nomination of Barry Silverman to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. He had to wait until the following year to be confirmed. \nAgain, there was a dustup over a nominee from Illinois, as I recall, \nand the point was: If we can't get everything we want, you are not \ngoing to get anything you want.\n  It is not only me and not only the people of Arizona; it is also the \nwill of the President of the United States that is being thwarted. It \nis not as if partisan politics were involved with respect to the people \nbeing nominated because they are Republicans, Democrats, or \nIndependents. In fact, obviously, the majority are Democrats. So you \nhave a Democratic President nominating mostly Democratic candidates for \nthe court, and the Democratic minority is holding them up.\n  One of our distinguished colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, recently said on the \nfloor, ``We cannot afford to stop or slow down judicial nominations.'' \nI agree with Senator Leahy on this point. I hope that he and Senator \nDaschle and the other Senators who have an interest in this important \nsubject will continue to support the confirmations of judges as long as \nwe can and at least support the confirmations of those who the Senate \ncan act on because they are the only ones who have been cleared to this \npoint and, in any event, will recognize the irony in their criticism on \nthe Senate floor for not confirming judges, when it is their action and \ntheir action alone that is preventing the confirmations of these four \nnominations to the Federal district bench. It is time for action. I \nhope my colleagues will quickly clear these four nominees for \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, let me draw your attention to a very \nsignificant event that occurred last week which involved the nuclear \nutilities companies in this country prevailing in the spent fuel claims \ncase. Now, to many, this might not seem to have great significance. \nThose of us on the Energy Committee have gone through a long and \nsomewhat tedious process to try to address the federal government's \nobligation to encourage the Congress, specifically the Senate, to reach \na decision on how we are going to dispose of our high-level nuclear \nwaste, with a recognition that almost 20 percent of the power generated \nin this country comes from nuclear power. As a consequence of that, and \nthe inability of the Government to fulfill its contractual commitment \nto take the waste in 1998, the industry in itself is, you might say, \nchoking on the pileup of nuclear waste that is in temporary sites \naround reactors throughout the country.\n  Evidently, the administration does not value the sanctity of a \ncontractual relationship very highly, because the ratepayers, over an \nextended period of years--several decades--have paid over 17 billion \ndollars into a fund which the Federal Government has managed, and that \nfund was specifically designed to permanently take the waste from the \nutility companies that generate power from nuclear energy.\n  The August 31, 2000 decision was highlighted in The Energy Daily. The \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the power \ncompanies are free to seek damages against the Energy Department for \nits failure to take responsibility for spent nuclear fuel. Undoubtedly, \nthis will ``prompt dozens of new lawsuits seeking billions of dollars \nin claims against the Government,'' industry attorneys indicated last \nFriday.\n  Who is the Government? The Government is the taxpayers, Mr. \nPresident. As a consequence, the inability of the administration to \nmeet its obligation under a commitment--a binding contract--results in \nthe taxpayers being exposed to billions of dollars in damages.\n  The article says:\n\n       The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handed \n     the nuclear industry a sweeping victory Thursday when it \n     rejected a government motion to dismiss a suit brought by \n     utility owners of three nuclear power plants. The government \n     claimed the utilities must first exhaust all administrative \n     remedies available through the DOE before seeking monetary \n     damages in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n       The decision means that nuclear utilities can return to \n     court and will get a chance to prove their damages--to ask \n     the court to determine the amount of damages the government \n     must pay for DOE's failure to begin storing the spent fuel on \n     Jan. 1, 1998.\n       Congress set that date for the federal government to take \n     responsibility for spent nuclear fuel in the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act of 1982, which requires DOE to store the roughly \n     40,000 metric tons of waste generated and now stored at more \n     than 100 U.S. nuclear plants.\n\n  Some of those plants, I might add, are no longer active. They weren't \ndesigned for long-term, indefinite storage.\n\n       Estimates of the potential damages faced by the government \n     as the result of last week's decision vary widely.\n       An analysis performed this year for the Nuclear \n     Energy Institute showed the figure could be as high as $50 \n     billion--costs that will be borne by the taxpayers--but \n     that number is based on a worst-case assumption that the \n     government will never fulfill its obligation, and the \n     utilities' spent fuel will never be stored in a proposed \n     federal level-high waste depository at Yucca Mountain, \n     Nev. [where the Government has already expended over $6 \n     billion.]\n\n  The idea of the facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada was to act as a \npermanent repository for the high-level waste.\n\n       NEI General Counsel Robert Bishop told The Energy Daily \n     Friday that the dozen or so utilities already having filed \n     lawsuits against DOE allege some $5.4 billion in damages \n     resulting from the government's failure to take the spent \n     fuel.\n\n  So we are seeing the suits filed at this early time.\n\n       Bishop acknowledged, however, that the figure could be much \n     higher if, as expected, utilities that thus far have been \n     reluctant to sue the government take advantage of the \n     Thursday decision and pursue their claims in court.\n       ``You are going to see a lot of utilities deciding to do \n     whatever they believe is in their and their customers' best \n     interest.''\n       ``Some may choose to work with DOE as PECO did. Others may \n     decide that it is in\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\n     their best interest to seek relief in federal claims court.''\n       Jerry Stouck, an attorney in the Washington office of \n     Spriggs & Hollingsworth and the lead attorney in the case, \n     represents Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co., Connecticut Yankee \n     Atomic Power Co. and Yankee Atomic Electric Co. He said the \n     government has an easier way to avoid facing dozens of \n     lawsuits from aggrieved utilities.\n       ``The government can mitigate its damages by moving the \n     [spent] fuel,'' Stouck said. ``The government already has \n     indicated it is not going to honor its contract and move the \n     fuel as it is required to do under the law, but they can \n     avoid damages by moving the fuel. They won't avoid all of the \n     damages, but they will mitigate a lot of the damages simply \n     by moving the fuel.''\n       In its ruling, the court concluded that DOE's failure to \n     begin taking used nuclear fuel did not constitute a \n     ``delay,'' as the government had argued, that was resolvable \n     under a standard contract that each utility signed with the \n     department.\n       It said that utilities are not obligated to seek resolution \n     under the contract for damages caused by DOE's failure to \n     perform its contractual obligation. It also stated \n     unequivocally that DOE has breached its obligations under the \n     contracts. And in a telling rebuke of the government's \n     argument, the court made it clear that its decision extended \n     beyond the specific suits brought by the Yankee plants.\n       ``The breach involved all the utilities that had signed the \n     contract--the entire nuclear industry,'' the court said in \n     its 14-page order.\n       The case now returns to the claims court to determine the \n     level of damages DOE must pay.\n  It is my hope that the majority leader, Senator Lott, will have an \nopportunity to bring this matter to the floor again for a vote. I \nadvise my colleagues that we are one vote short of a veto override. \nWith the recent ruling by the court, clearly the Federal Government and \nthe taxpayer bear the responsibility of not taking the nuclear waste as \nindicated by the court order.\n  According to the Department of Justice statement:\n\n       We remain persuaded that the quickest and most efficient \n     way to get relief to those utilities that are incurring costs \n     as a result in our delay in accepting nuclear fuel is direct \n     negotiation between individual utilities and the department. \n     This is evidenced by the settlement agreement that we entered \n     into last month with PECO.\n\n  There you have it. The Department of Justice hopes they can reach \nsome kind of a settlement. But in any event, that settlement is going \nto cost the taxpayers a substantial sum as a consequence of the Federal \nGovernment's unwillingness to honor the terms of a contract made to \ntake that waste in 1998.\n  It is my hope, as chairman of the Energy Committee, to hold a hearing \non this matter because now we have a definitive decision made by the \ncourt and that puts the liability on the taxpayer and the Government. \nAs a consequence, I think it is appropriate that we in this body come \ntogether and recognize our obligation. Our obligation is to override \nthe President's veto and honor the contractual commitments to take the \nwaste.\n  This very important environmental issue affects almost every state in \nthis Nation. On August 31, 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit decided two cases and held that nuclear utilities could \nseek millions of dollars in damages for DOE's failure to accept high-\nlevel waste by January 1998. The court's decision only confirms what I \nhave said on this floor over and over again--the Federal Government has \nbreached it's contract with utilities as a result, the taxpayer is \ngoing to pay. Conservative estimates from the utilities with claims \npending are upwards of $5 billion.\n  In the first case, the U.S. challenged the lower court's finding that \nMaine Yankee, Connecticut Yankee, and Yankee Rowe (all shutdown \nreactors with tons of fuel remaining on-site) were entitled to damages. \nOn appeal the court ruled that the utilities have the authority to seek \ncivil damages from the Court of Federal Claims and rejected the \ngovernment's argument that relief was available through the \nadministrative process.\n  In the second case, the court found that Northern States Power, now \nknown as Xcel Energy, could also seek damages through the Court of \nFederal Claims.\n  Utilities view both decisions as major victories. Not only do they \nnot have to go through the administrative process first, (1) the court \nrejected the distinction between operating and shut down utilities, and \n(2) characterized DOE's failure to accept waste as a breach of \ncontract, thus entitling the utilities to proceed directly to the Court \nof Federal Claims to prove their damages. About a dozen utilities have \nclaims pending that are affected by these ruling.\n  Before this ruling, DOE had been attempting out-of-court settlements \nwith utilities. Only one, PECO, has made such a statement.\n  This court ruling only underscores what I have been saying for \nyears--the Federal Government has breached it's contract and that will \ncost tax payers billions. Since 1982, the Federal government has \ncollected over $17 billion from America's ratepayers in return for a \ncommitment to take nuclear waste from storage sites scattered in 40 \nstates around the country and store it in one, safe central government-\nrun facility, beginning in 1998. Several years ago, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals ruled that this is a legal, as well as moral, obligation. Now \nthe court has ruled that failure to do so is a breach of contract and \nthe utilities may seek damages.\n  I have tried to help the Federal Government out of this situation. \nFor several Congresses, I have worked on various pieces of legislation \ndesigned to keep our nuclear waste repository program on track. This \nCongress we took that legislation, S. 1287, further than we ever have \nbefore. In February, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming majroity--\n64 to 34. And then in March, the House took up the bill and passed it \n253 to 167. From there, this legislation made it up Pennsylvania \nAvenue, to the President's desk, where he vetoed it. Why he did that, I \ndon't know. In light of this recent court decision, maybe that doesn't \nlook like such a good decision after all. Unless of course, the \nPresident is thinking of politics, and not tax payer liability. In any \nevent, the President sent it back to Congress, where, on May 2, 2000, \nthe Senate failed to override that veto. But we didn't fail by much. \nThe actual vote count of 64-35 doesn't tell the whole story. Two \nMembers, who have always been in the ``yes'' camp were necessarily \nabsent. And the majority leader, in a procedural maneuver, switched his \nvote so that if we needed to revisit the issue, that opportunity would \nbe available. So perhaps, we should now avail ourselves of that \nopportunity.\n  Senate bill S. 1287 would help to limit the taxpayers liability for \nDOE's failure to accept waste by permitting the early acceptance of \nwaste at the Yucca Mountain site, once construction is authorized. S. \n1287 provides the tools that will allow the Federal government to meet \nits obligation to provide a safe place to store spent nuclear fuel and \nnuclear waste as soon as possible, while reaffirming our Nation's \ncommitment to development of a permanent repository for our Nation's \nnuclear waste.\n  At the beginning of this session, interim storage legislation, in the \nform of S. 608, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999, was introduced. \nAlthough the legislation had sufficient support to be favorably \nreported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I proposed \nthat the committee consider a new approach to resolving the nuclear \nwaste dilemma that might gain a full consensus and avoid the procedural \ndifficulties encountered by the bill in the past. This approach was \nsupported by the committee, and an original bill, which became S. 1287, \nwas approved by the committee by a bipartisan, 14-6 vote.\n  During committee consideration of S. 1287, we received many \nconstructive comments on how to improve the bill, and a manager's \namendment that reflects many of these were eventually considered and \npassed on the Senate floor. S. 1287, as passed the House and Senate \ncontained the following major changes:\n\n  Adds a savings clause clarifying that nothing in the bill diminishes \nthe authority of any State under other Federal or State laws;\n  Alters one of the milestones and the acceptance schedule for nuclear \nwaste to make them consistent with the schedules contained in the \nDepartment of Energy's Viability Assessment for Yucca Mountain;\n  Clarifies that the Secretary and a plaintiff may enter into voluntary \nsettlements that are contingent upon new obligations being met, \nincluding acceptance of spent fuel under the schedules provided for in \nS. 1287;\n  Adds benefits for local governments in Nevada that adjoin the Nevada \ntest site; and\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\n  Permits EPA to proceed with the radiation standard setting rule. If \nNRC, after consulting with the National Academy of Sciences, agrees \nthat the standard will protect public health and safety and the \nenvironment and is reasonable and attainable, they may do so prior to \nJune 1, 2001.\n  I believe that the issues to be addressed by nuclear waste \nlegislation have evolved and this evolution is reflected in S. 1287. \nThis legislation gives DOE the tools it needs to complete the Yucca \nMountain program, while providing a mechanism to rectify DOE's failure \nto perform its obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  Because DOE has failed to find a way to meet its obligation, our \ncitizens will be left with what remedies the court can devise. After \nthe August decision in the Court of Appeals, it is clear that the \nutilities can now go ahead and prove their damages. What the eventual \ndamages are remains to be seen. This much I can say with some \ncertainty: This remedy is bound to be expensive to the American \ntaxpayer and is unlikely to result in used nuclear fuel being removed \nfrom the over 80 sites where it is stored around the country, in \nfacilities that were not intended for long-term storage. If DOE is \nunable to open the Yucca Mountain repository on schedule, it is \nestimated that total damages from the Department's failure to meet its \nobligation will range from $40 billion to $80 billion. Clearly, such \nstop-gap compensation measures would drain money away from this and \nother Department of Energy programs, stopping all progress on the \npermanent repository. The American taxpayers would lose tens of \nbillions of dollars, and we would still have no idea how we are going \nto get the nuclear waste out of 80 sites in 40 States.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. S. 1287 is the most \nimportant environmental bill we have considered this Congress. The \nalternative is to leave waste at 80 sites in 40 States. S. 1287 also \ngives the Secretary of Energy the ability to settle lawsuits and save \nthe taxpayers from an estimated $40-$80 billion liability. The bill \nwould allow early receipt of fuel once the construction is authorized--\nas early as 2006--assuming DOE can keep the program on schedule. Such \nearly receipt would help mitigate a liability the courts have clearly \nsaid the government has.\n  We have struggled with this problem for many years. The time is now. \nS. 1287 is the solution. Years of litigation to prove damages will cost \nmoney and waste valuable time. Utility consumers have paid over $17 \nbillion into the Nuclear Waste Fund. We must solve this problem. We \ncannot continue to jeopardize the health and safety of citizens across \nthis country by leaving spent nuclear fuel in 80 sites in 40 States. We \nshould move it to one remote site in the desert. If we don't, we risk \nlosing nuclear generation altogether--that's 20 percent of our clean \ngeneration. We cannot afford to do that. Our clean air is too \nimportant. This issue is too important. Let's not ignore reality. It's \ndangerous and it's expensive.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that in February, this body passed by \nan overwhelming majority vote of 64-34 to honor the commitments that \nwere made under the contract to proceed by placing the waste at Yucca \nMountain. The House took up the bill and passed it 253-167. It went \ndown to the White House, where the President vetoed it. Why he did I \ndon't know. I don't know whether they just disregard contracts down \nthere. But now the burden is on the taxpayer. Now the burden is on the \nSenate to rise up and generate a couple more votes and override the \nPresident's veto.\n  Again, we will be holding a hearing on this matter in the very near \nfuture. I encourage each Member of the Senate to recognize his and her \nobligation to honor the terms of the contract, proceed to take the \nwaste, and put it where it belongs, at the site at Yucca Mountain in \nNevada where the taxpayer has already expended some $6 billion to put \nit there.\n  I see other Senators wishing recognition. As a consequence, I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in order to complete our legislative \nagenda in the 106th Congress, our leadership has put forth a very \nsimple concept.\n  For the upcoming new fiscal year that begins in about 12 days, lets \ndevote 90 percent of the surplus to debt reduction. And the remaining \n10 percent can be used for tax cuts and final spending bills.\n  This is a very reasonable and straightforward proposal, and I \ncompliment our leadership both in the House and the Senate for making \nthe proposal to the President last week.\n  I don't quite understand why the White House and some Democrats are \nso negatively excited about this proposal. For some reason, the White \nHouse and congressional leaders are having a great deal of difficulty \nunderstanding a very simple proposal.\n  Indeed, our distinguished minority leader, even said he ``smelled a \nrat'' in this proposal. Why is it so difficult for the White House and \ncongressional Democrats to understand this simple proposal.\n  Maybe it is because they are really not serious about their own \nrhetoric about debt reduction. Maybe this is consistent with their \nblocking not once, but six times our efforts to pass the Social \nSecurity lock box legislation now on the calendar.\n  I am hopeful we will do that, with their help perhaps, in a way we \ncan all agree upon. But we will do it, and we will do it under this 90-\n10 formula.\n  For my friends at the White House and across the aisle let me take \njust a minute to explain this proposal.\n  We first start with the current CBO estimate of the budget surplus \nfor next year--that number today is $268 billion. We are even using the \nDemocrats favorite definition of the surplus, a definition that assumes \nthat appropriate accounts grow by inflation between 2000 and 2001--the \nso-called ``inflated baseline.'' This is not my preferred definition, \nbut it is the most liberal one available from the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  To this $268 billion estimate, we adjust for the net effect of the \nsupplemental that became law after CBO made its summer update. Because \nthe supplemental shifted some spending around, the surplus next year \nincreases slightly to $273 billion.\n  Now, we set aside the Social Security and Medicare HI trust fund \nbalances--we fully protect Social Security and Medicare as we \npromised--those two accounts make up about $197 billion of our debt \nreduction next year.\n  We also set aside $48 billion of the non-Social Security surplus for \ndebt reduction.\n  So we set the Social Security and the Medicare surplus aside, and \nthen we set aside $48 billion more--a rather historic event because \nthat is out of the non-Social Security surplus. Forty-eight billion \ndollars of that will go to debt reduction.\n  In total, $245 billion of next year's surplus is set aside for debt \nreduction. This represents 90 percent of the total surplus next year--\njust do the arithmetic--leaving $28 billion in outlays for the end of \nthe session spending and tax legislation. This $28 billion should allow \nus to finish our work expeditiously. It would allow us to finish the \nappropriated bills that are still pending, fund needed priorities for \nhospital and health providers, for health research, aid to States and \nlocalities that have suffered this summer's fires and droughts, and \nother important and basic needs.\n  The $28 billion should also allow us to provide minimal tax relief to \nAmerican small business and families. This will be a smaller package \nthan we have done before. We will ask the President of the United \nStates whether there is any tax bill that we can send him that he will \nsign. We believe this is a winner, one attached essentially to the \namendment that cleared the floor when we did our minimum wage bill. It \nwas\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nmy amendment. I offered it along with Don Nickles and others to spread \nthe minimum wage increase over 3 years and to provide small business \nand individuals with the kind of tax relief almost everyone agreed we \nshould do.\n  This is the least we can do for the taxpayers, as I see it, following \nboth a vote of the marriage tax penalty and the death. This will not, \nas assumed by the administration, cause irreparable damage to the \neconomy. The Secretary of the Treasury came all the way over here to \nhave a press conference because they were terribly concerned about this \n90 percent to debt service and 10 percent to finish our work idea--the \n90-10 button that is being worn around here. I don't understand how it \nwill cause any kind of damage.\n  How quickly we forget the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman, who \nsaid the first thing we should do with a budget surplus is retire the \ndebt. I can only conclude that the democratic roadblock to this very \nsimple proposition must be, first, they do not want to provide tax cuts \nwhen taxes are at the highest level percentage of the American economy \nsince the Second World War; second, they do not want to apply the \nsurplus to debt reduction.\n  They must have a very large bushel of expenditures they want to make \nat the end of the year that exceed the $28 billion, which is the \nresidue of the 90-10 that will be around for tax cuts, for add-ons to \nappropriations, and for those extreme needs we have in the Medicare \narea with reference to nursing homes, HMO plus, and the like. Those \nwill fit within the $28 billion because we are speaking of outlays--I \nhope everybody understands that--in the year 2001.\n  Maybe this should not come as a surprise to anyone. The President of \nthe United States has put forward an expansive and expensive set of \nbudget proposals, a budget plan that even the Washington Post called a \n``lopsided budget.'' The Financial Times article called it ``a \nmasterpiece of central government planning.''\n  Maybe these are the real reasons why my friends across the aisle \ncannot grasp the simple consent: 90 percent of the total surplus going \nto retiring the debt, and 10 percent being available to finish our work \non appropriations, on the other expenditures, and some tax proposals \nthat should clear.\n  I am prepared to talk to this issue with anyone, anywhere, and to \nproduce the numbers. This is very close to what will happen if we take \nit right, watch our step, do what is needed, but not extravagantly \nspend money. If we try some very simple but needed tax cuts, which \nshould challenge even this President in terms of his veto pen--and \nobviously we are all aware of fixing some Medicare needs, whether they \nare nursing homes that need some additional response from the Federal \nGovernment, whether it be the HMO plus, whether it be the home care, \nwhether it be rural hospitals. Essentially, in the first year they do \nnot cost that much money. They do a considerable amount over 5, but \nactually we believe they will fit within this $28 billion. That is the \n10 percent of the 90-10 formula.\n  I hope everybody will take a look at it. I think it is a good way to \ngo.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Whether it has been flying air support, providing \ntranslators, operating x-ray machines, doing youth outreach, or any of \nthe seemingly endless other operations they participate in, the \nsoldiers and airmen of the National Guard have been aggressively \ninvolved in supporting the counterdrug operations of local, state, and \nfederal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States.\n  Though commissioned in the Field Artillery when he graduated from \ncollege, LTC Lee has significant experience in counterdrug operations. \nOver the past three-years, he has served as the Special Projects \nOfficer in the Counterdrug Directorate, where he has worked closely \nwith Members of Congress and their staffs on how the National Guard can \nhelp stop drug trafficking. As he has done in all his previous \nassignments, LTC Lee distinguished himself as an individual of \nselflessness who possesses a strong sense of service and an unflagging \ndedication to executing his duties to the best of his abilities.\n  LTC Lee not only demonstrated an intimate knowledge of National Guard \nCounterdrug policy and operations, but of the broader efforts of \nfederal and state governments. He always provided clear, concise, and \ntimely information and he has been a true asset to the Guard and to the \nnation's counterdrug operations.\n  I am confident that I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we \nare grateful and appreciative for the hard work of Lieutenant Colonel \nLee during his tenure at the National Guard Bureau Counterdrug \nDirectorate. He is a credit to the National Guard and he can be proud \nof both the record of accomplishment he has created and the high regard \nin which he is held. We wish him the best of luck in his new assignment \nand continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8651-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8651-S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF UKRANIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, as Ukraine approaches its first decade of \nindependence, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there are many \naccomplishments which the people of Ukraine can be proud.\n  For over a millennium, the Ukrainian people have successfully \npreserved and maintained their unique culture, language, religion and \nidentity. Such an achievement stands as an inspiration for free people \neverywhere, and is a testimony to the depth, character and vibrancy of \nthe Ukrainian culture.\n  The November 14, 1999, re-election of Leonid Kuchna as Ukraine's \nPresident is a cause for great optimism. High turnout in this election, \nand a refusal by the voters to return to a Communist past, speaks to \nthe vibrancy of Ukranian democracy.\n  With this election, the Ukranian people chose to move forward with a \nprogram of economic reform. While the transition from a centralized \neconomy to a free-market system has not been easy, Ukraine has been \nblessed with vast natural resources, a sizeable industrial \ninfrastructure and a hard-working and resourceful people that promise \nto ensure Ukraine's economic transformation. The decision, this year, \nby the Supreme Rada to privatize large parts of the Ukrainian economy \nwill further enable this industrious nation to continue with its \neconomic progress.\n  Ukraine's unique geographical location has given it a vital role in \nensuring the peace and stability of not only the region, but of all \nEurope. Ukraine has shown its commitment to a secure Europe by \nproviding troops to the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo, and by seeking \nto enhance its partnership with NATO. By entering into the Status of \nForces Agreement with NATO, and hosting NATO military exercises in \nOdessa, Ukraine has reiterated its commitment to the world's most \npowerful military alliance.\n  At this time when we honor Ukraine's independence, it is only fitting \nthat we laud the many advances made by the Ukrainian people in the\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\npast decade. The advances Ukraine has made today are built upon the \nsacrifices and dedication of countless patriots who have struggled to \npreserve the independence and freedom of the Ukranian people. I am sure \nthat my Senate colleagues would join me in saluting the Ukranian people \nfor their tremendous courage in promoting free and fair markets and \nparticipatory democracy during a difficult transition period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, 1 year ago, 11 terrorists dedicated to the \nviolent pursuit of Puerto Rican independence walked out of prison \nthanks to a clemency grant by President Clinton. Two more of these \nterrorists will be released in coming years. They were all members of \nthe Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN), which has claimed \nresponsibility for 130 bombings in the United States, killing 6 \nAmericans and wounding 84 others.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that those responsible for such deadly \nviolence are living in freedom today, while their victims and their \nfamilies are still suffering. As we reflect on the decision of the \nPresident 1 year ago to ignore this suffering for his personal gain, I \nbelieve it's important to put a human face on the deplorable acts these \nterrorists committed.\n  I'd like to quote from the testimony of a few victims who lived \nthrough some of the 130 bombings these FALN terrorists committed:\n\n       Bill Newhall, FALN victim: On January 24th [1975], I was \n     having lunch with two colleagues, Charlie Murray and Frank \n     Connor and three clients, Jim Gezork, Alex Berger and Dave \n     Urskind. We were seated at a table overlooking Broad Street, \n     about to return to work when a bomb, placed in a doorway next \n     to our table, detonated, destroying our corner with shrapnel \n     and debris. Jim, Alex, and Frank died terrible deaths, barely \n     recognizable to their families. Another man, Harold \n     Sherburne, who was upstairs at the time of the blast, was \n     also killed. Charlie, David and I suffered multiple wounds, \n     many of them from shrapnel. More than fifty other people \n     sustained injuries as well. . . . It is impossible to \n     adequately describe the effects of this savagery on the \n     injured and dead as well as their families.\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\n       This bombing, a terrorist act against unarmed and \n     unsuspecting civilians and its lethal results were followed \n     by many more . . .\n       NYPD Detective Rocco Pascarella, FALN victim: FALN bombs \n     were placed at locations where it was likely that innocent \n     people would be killed or injured.\n       About two weeks prior to December 31, 1982 I had been \n     assigned to the Police Headquarters security detail. . . . It \n     was 9:30 p.m. when my colleagues and I heard a tremendous \n     explosion. At first we thought it was fireworks. But soon \n     after, we were told a bomb had exploded at 26 Federal Plaza \n     which is two blocks from police headquarters. I was directed \n     by my sergeant to search the perimeter of the headquarters \n     building for anything suspicious that might be a bomb. As I \n     approached the rear unused entrance to the building I noticed \n     a lot of debris. As I turned to search, the bomb went off. . \n     . .\n       I suffered the loss of one leg below the knee, severe \n     scarring of my other leg, the loss of hearing in one ear, and \n     the loss of my eyesight to the extent that I am no longer \n     able to drive. I was in the hospital for two months. I \n     underwent six operations for my leg and ears and received \n     over 40 stitches to my face, ears and mouth. I spent a year \n     going through rehabilitation to learn to walk again with my \n     artificial leg and injured right leg. Because of my injuries \n     I have been unable to return to active duty in the police \n     force. I am on an extended medical leave. The pain and trauma \n     of these disabling injuries were multiplied by the suffering \n     it caused my family.\n       Special Agent (Ret.) Donald R. Wofford, FBI: [O]n \n     Wednesday, 12/11/74 . . . an anonymous Hispanic female \n     notified the NYPD that a dead body was located in a building \n     at 336 East 110th Street, Manhattan. A radio car was \n     dispatched and when the investigating patrolman pushed upon \n     an outside door to an abandoned five story tenement located \n     at this address, the explosion occurred, seriously injuring \n     the officer, and ultimately resulting in the loss of his eye.\n       Special Agent (Ret.) Richard S. Hahn, FBI: Between June, \n     1975 and November, 1979, the FALN claimed credit for nineteen \n     bombing and six incendiary attacks in the Chicago area. These \n     included bomb targets such as the woman's washroom in a hotel \n     restaurant, (9/76), the bombing of the city-county building, \n     (6/77), and Sears Tower (10/75).\n\n  Madam President, I don't know how the President of the United States \ncan just ignore the pain and suffering of these innocent Americans. I \ncan't comprehend how we can say that America is tough on terrorism, and \nwill not tolerate such violence, while our nation's leader grants \nclemency to those who commit these horrendous acts. And I don't \nunderstand how his Vice-President can remain silent on this grievous \ndecision as he attempts to earn the trust of the American people. It's \nbeen a year since President Clinton granted clemency to convicted \nterrorists and the Senate and the American people are still searching \nfor the answers to these questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8653-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JAMES H. QUILLEN UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the many achievements of former Tennessee Congressman Jim \nQuillen, and express my support for H.R. 4608 which would designate the \nnew United States courthouse in Greeneville, as the ``James H. Quillen \nUnited States Courthouse.'' As some of my colleagues may know, Jim \nQuillen was Tennessee's longest serving Member of Congress and \nrepresented his constituents with distinction at both the state and \nfederal level of government for 50 years. In 1963, Congressman Quillen \nwas elected to the United States House of Representatives to represent \nthe First Congressional District of Tennessee. After serving for \nthirty-four years, Congressman Quillen retired in January 1997. \nCongressman Quillen worked very hard for the citizens of Tennessee \nthroughout his legislative career, and played a major role in securing \nfunding to build the new courthouse in Greeneville.\n  Over the years, Congressman Quillen developed a reputation as a hard \nworking legislator devoted to the concerns of his constituents. He \nserved 17 terms in the House of Representatives, and in many ways lived \nthe American dream. Born into poverty near Kingsport, he knew the \nhardships that many of his constituents faced, and promised that his \ndoor would always be open to hear their views. Congressman Quillen \nrarely accepted that something could not be done, and distinguished \nhimself early on as a man who could get results. Congressman Quillen \nfought hard to establish a medical school at East Tennessee State \nUniversity, which is now one of Tennessee's leading medical teaching \ninstitutions. He was also instrumental in expanding services at the \nVeterans Administration Medical Center in Johnson City.\n  Congressman Quillen's tireless efforts in the House of \nRepresentatives benefitted the entire nation, and his leadership as \nRanking Member on the House Committee on Rules helped pave the way for \ncritical legislation. During his service on the House Committee on \nRules, Congressman Quillen shaped the course of national policy by \nacting as a ``legislative gatekeeper'' and working with other Members \nto ensure that America's needs were addressed. Congressman Quillen \nnever lost sight of the people he was fighting for, and we should all \nbe proud of his many accomplishments.\n  It is with appreciation for Congressman Quillen's dedication to \npublic service over the past fifty years that we approve H.R. 4608 to \ndesignate the new federal courthouse in Greeneville, which he helped to \nbuild, as the ``James H. Quillen United States Courthouse.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8653-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8653-S8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, on April 11, 2000 the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held a hearing regarding the impact of China's accession to \nthe World Trade Organization, WTO, on the American economy. This was a \nfascinating meeting that covered a wide range of topics from trade \ndeficits and tariff barriers to national security and human rights. \nAfter participating in this hearing, and after months of meetings and \nspeaking with Georgia farmers, small business owners, and workers, as \nwell as conferring with national security experts, I have concluded \nthat, on balance, establishing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) \nwith China--which is necessary for the U.S. to obtain the trade \nconcessions made by China in order to gain entry into the WTO--is in \nthe best interest of both our national security and our economic \nsecurity. Therefore, I plan to support the PNTR legislation that passed \nthe House in May.\n  In the April hearing, General Brent Scowcroft, the former National \nSecurity Advisor to President Bush, stated that granting PNTR to China \nwould be, ``very much in the interest of the United States. This, in my \njudgement goes far beyond American business and economic interests, \nimportant as these are, to key political and security issues.'' Mr. \nPresident, I have just returned from a trip to Japan and Korea where \nthe issue of China PNTR as it pertains to our national security, while \nnot the purpose of my trip, was an important topic of discussion with \nsome of our key allies in the region as well as some of the U.S. \nmilitary's finest leaders including Admiral Dennis Blair and General \nThomas Schwartz--the Commander in Chief of U.S. Pacific Command and the \nCommander in Chief of the U.S. Forces in Korea respectively. After \nthese discussions, I am even more convinced that the Senate should \napprove PNTR as an important national security measure. Admiral Fargo, \nthe Commanding Officer of the CINCPAC Fleet echoed these sentiments \nwhen he mentioned that the ``right answer'' to many of the difficult \nquestions facing us with regard to our strategic interest in the \nregion, including PNTR, ``is to engage China.''\n  While in Japan, I met with Japanese Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono. \nWhen asked, Minister Kono stated that he believes PNTR for China and \nits upcoming membership in the WTO, will help China become a member of \nthe international community and, in so doing, will help stabilize not \nonly the Sino-Japanese relationship--which is a part of our national \nsecurity since we are treaty-bound to defend Japan and because we have \n46,000 troops stationed on Japanese soil--but will further stabilize \nthe entire Asia-Pacific region. I find Foreign Minister Kono's \nsentiments especially significant given the historically difficult \nrelations between these two nations and given the fact that Japan would \nbe a primary beneficiary of trade with China should the U.S. Congress \nnot approve PNTR.\n  Regarding the economic security of the U.S., granting Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations will open up China's market to countless Georgia \ngoods and services, especially for Georgia's emerging high-tech and \ncommunications sector as well as for our largest\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nindustry--agriculture. Earlier this year, Tommy Irvin, Georgia's \nCommissioner for Agriculture, wrote to me that, ``Normalizing trade \nrelations with China will surely aid our farmers and agribusinesses' \nlagging export economy, which . . . has slowed over the past two years \ndue to the economic crisis in Southeast Asia.'' Similarly, Governor Roy \nBarnes has signaled his support for PNTR and its benefits for Georgia.\n  Let me be clear that I do believe that U.S. trade with China, which \nunder our current trade rules accounts for our single largest bilateral \ntrade deficit, has had--and will continue to have, whether or not we \napprove PNTR--a negative effect on some American industries and \nworkers, including some in my state in such areas as textiles and \nmanufacturing. And I would certainly concur that China's labor, \nenvironmental and political rights standards fall far short of those we \nenjoy in the United States.\n  However, it is my belief that the annual vote currently required \nregarding China's Most Favored Nation status has not been an effective \ntool in forcing China to expand political rights or to observe \ninternational rules of free and fair trade. It seems obvious to me that \nboth the Chinese and American leaderships have viewed the threat of not \npassing MFN as just that, a threat, which has never been carried out--\nnot even after the Tiananmen Square massacre. It is important to note \nthat while some Chinese dissidents in the United States have indicated \ntheir strong opposition to PNTR, most human rights advocates who have \nremained in China, the Hong Kong democratic opposition lead by Martin \nLee and the government of democratic Taiwan all support PNTR for China. \nThey believe that China's acceptance of the multilateral WTO as the \narbiter of its international trade polices will, in time, produce a \nsignificant opening up of the Chinese economic, legal and, ultimately, \neven political systems.\n  Again, let's be clear on one point. China's membership in the WTO \nwill happen with or without the support of the U.S. Congress. Should \nCongress not pass PNTR, then businesses in the European Union, Japan \nand other nations will gain the benefits of Chinese trade concessions \nplus fair trade enforcement by the WTO, while U.S. exporters will be \nleft behind.\n  Each trade agreement is different and I am not one who believes that \nso-called free trade is always and necessarily a good thing for \nAmerica. Several months ago, I voted against the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative and the Sub-Saharan African Trade bill because I thought the \nnet effect on the U.S. economy was not going to be positive. In \ncontrast, the trade agreement signed with China in November of 1999--\nwhich is contingent on our approval of PNTR for China--would slash \nChinese tariffs on U.S. goods and services with no concessions by the \nUnited States.\n  While increased trade with China will likely result in a net benefit \nfor the American economy, we must not ignore the possible impact upon \nindustries, such as textiles and auto manufacturing, that have been \nadversely impacted under previous trade agreements such as NAFTA or \nindeed under our current trade policies--including annual MFN review--\ntoward China. Nor should we ignore China's performance on the whole \nrange of issues important to our bilateral relationship, including its \nlabor and environmental standards, its respect for the human rights of \nits own citizens, its involvement in the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and their delivery systems, its relationship with \nTaiwan, and its efforts to promote stability in such key regions as the \nKorean Peninsula and the Indian Subcontinent. We can, and should, \nvigorously defend our national interests in these matters through \ndiplomacy, targeted sanctions, and other appropriate means.\n  However, in my opinion, none of our legitimate concerns about China \nwill be effectively pursued via a continuation of our current annual \nreview of trade relations with that country. There is little evidence \nto suggest that this current policy has produced any appreciable \nmodification of Chinese behavior on trade, human rights or the other \nissues. On the other hand, a vote for permanent normal trade relations \nfor China will, while relinquishing what I regard as an ineffective \npolicy tool, secure greater access to the Chinese market for American \ncompanies, and will make the U.S. a full party to international efforts \nto enforce China's compliance with the terms of the WTO accession \nagreement. And approval of PNTR will in no way prevent the United \nStates from considering other, more effective responses to the actions \nof the Chinese government. Therefore, I intend to vote for PNTR for \nChina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8654-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Bill is a partner in Provider \nInsurance Group, which has offices in Belmont, Brookline and Needham.\n  Bill's impressive career as an independent insurance agent has been \nmarked by outstanding dedication to his clients and his community. He \nbegan his service in the insurance industry with the Independent \nInsurance Agents of Massachusetts, where he served as president. He \nalso represented Massachusetts on the IIAA's National Board of State \nDirectors. In 1980, he was honored with the Mr. Chairman's Award'' by \nthe American Association of Managing General Agents' for his \ndistinguished service as chairman of its Education Committee.\n  Bill was elected to IIAA's Executive Committee in September 1995 and \nwas honored by his peers when they named him President-Elect of the \nAssociation last fall. He will be inaugurated as President next month \nduring the annual meeting in Orlando.\n  As a member of the Executive Committee leadership panel, Bill has \nworked to strengthen the competitive standing of independent insurance \nagents by helping to provide the tools they need to operate more \nsuccessful businesses.\n  Before joining the IIAA's national leadership team, Bill was active \non several of its committees. He served as chairman of the Education \nCommittee for four years, and in 1994 he received a Presidential \nCitation for his work in this area.\n  Bill also has distinguished himself as an active and concerned member \nof his community. He served as president and on the Board of Directors \nof the Boston Children's Service. He also has been active in the \nBelmont Youth Basketball program, the Chamber of Commerce, and the \nBoosters Club. He has served as chairman of the Belmont Red Cross and \nas treasurer of the Belmont Religious Council. Bill is also an elected \ntown meeting member, finance committee member, and registrar of voters \nin Belmont.\n  I am proud of Bill's accomplishments, and I know that he will have a \nsuccessful year as president of the\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nIndependent Insurance Agents of America.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend, Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw, a man whose legend at Colorado State \nUniversity, my alma mater, is among the greatest in the University's \nhistory. ``Fum,'' the school's first All-American, died Wednesday at \nage 73 of complications from a stroke this summer.\n  ``Fum,'' who was large in stature at nearly 6-foot-5 and more than \n200 pounds, was considered Colorado State University's greatest \nathlete, and as a ``gentle giant'' by his wife, Brownie. McGraw became \nsynonymous with the school's athletic department. In addition to his \nsuperior college football career, a two time All-American defensive \nlineman in 1948 and 1949 who led the Rams to their first Bowl game, he \nwas also an All-American in wrestling and competed in the national \ntrack and field championships. As a senior in 1949-1950 he was the \nuniversity's student body president. He graduated with a degree in \nforest management in 1950 and spent five years in the National Football \nLeague. After an amazing college career he starred with the National \nFootball League's Detroit Lions, helping them to win two championships \nand earning All-Pro honors three times as a defensive lineman.\n  ``Fum'' returned to CSU in 1955 as the wrestling coach, also \nassisting with the football and track teams. He was an assistant coach \nwith the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1958-62, returned to CSU as an \nadministrator in 1962, then returned to the NFL as a scout in 1970. \nFinally in 1976 he was back to stay at CSU as the athletic director \nuntil 1986. Throughout his career at Colorado State University McGraw \ntirelessly raised money for the CSU athletic department. He spearheaded \nthe resumption of the football series with the University of Colorado \nand helped initiate the construction of Moby Arena in 1966 and Hughes \nStadium in 1968. His work ultimately led to the school's acceptance \ninto the Western Athletic Conference in 1968. But it wasn't just what \nhe did in athletics that made him so special.\n  Thurman McGraw was the recipient of numerous honors, including \ninduction into the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame and the \nColorado Sports Hall of Fame. In 1997 he and his wife received the \nCitizen of the West Award given annually by the National Western Stock \nShow. ``Fum'' also led the effort to name the university track for his \nformer teammate and friend Jack Christiansen. Last year to honor \nMcGraw, CSU officials commemorated his lifetime of support by \ndedicating the Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw Center. The Thurman ``Fum'' \nMcGraw Center which includes the school's locker rooms, weight training \nand injury rehabilitation facilities, and coaches and staff offices for \nthe athletic department. Two weeks ago, while ``Fum'' was laid up in \nthe hospital, the football team dedicated its game against in state \nrival University of Colorado to McGraw. The Rams upset Colorado 28 to \n24.\n  McGraw would do anything to help the school he adored, the friends he \ncared so much for, and the family he loved so dearly. Thurman ``Fum'' \nMcGraw was and always will remain the essence of Colorado State \nUniversity. He was a hero on and off the field, and a genuine role \nmodel for today's athletes. He will be missed throughout the community, \nbut he will not be forgotten. I offer my thoughts and prayers to those \nclose to Mr. McGraw in this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8655-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8655-S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIAM R. CORSON\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I would like to make a brief \nstatement about a man who in every way embodied the spirit and reality \nof an American patriot. Seldom does one have an opportunity to bump \ninto someone during life's journey who has affected events of our time. \nSuch a man was retired Marine Corps Colonel Bill Corson who passed away \nin July.\n  His passing reminds us all of our own mortality and destiny and how \nimportant it is to live our lives with honor and dignity. That is how \nBill Corson lived his. It was a privilege to know him. I will miss his \nwise counsel and friendship.\n  I first met Bill in 1981 when I was serving as the Deputy \nAdministrator of the Veterans Administration. He was a man who was \ndeeply and unselfishly devoted to his country. Bill left college and \nenlisted in the Marine Corps during World War II. He served in Korea \nand Vietnam. His decorations included the Navy Commendation Medal with \nCombat ``V.'' He spent most of his career on special assignment with \nthe CIA, the White House, the Marine Corps, and the State Department. \nBill went on to teach at the U.S. Naval Academy and write several books \non national security issues.\n  Bill was relentless in the pursuit of meeting the challenges faced by \nthe country he loved so much. He was a man of immense integrity, a man \nof knowledge, a man of ability, a man of compassion, a man of faith, \nwho always gave his country his best. And America is stronger today \nbecause of this remarkable man.\n  He was a friend of mine, and I extend heartfelt condolences to his \nwife Judy and his family.\n  Madam President, I ask that the attached obituary from The Washington \nPost on Bill Corson be printed in the Record.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 19, 2000]\n\n     William R. Corson, 74, Author and Retired Marine Officer, Dies\n\n                            (By J.Y. Smith)\n\n       William R. Corson, 74, a retired lieutenant colonel in the \n     Marine Corps and expert on counterinsurgency warfare who was \n     almost court-martialed for publishing a book that was high \n     critical of U.S. policy in Vietnam, died July 17 at Surburban \n     Hospital. He had lung cancer.\n       For much of his career, Col. Corson was an intelligence \n     officer on special assignment with the CIA and the Marine \n     Corps. He spoke Chinese and specialized in Asian affairs.\n       In 1962, after four years as a liaison officer in Hong \n     Kong, he was assigned to the office of the secretary of \n     defense. This put him in touch with decision-making at the \n     highest level as U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia deepened.\n       He began studying Vietnam in the early 1950s, when France \n     was still trying to hold on to its colonial possession. In \n     1966, he was ordered there as commanding officer of a Marine \n     tank battalion.\n       Early in 1967, he was named director of the Combined Action \n     Program, in which small detachments of Marines served with \n     South Vietnamese militia in villages throughout the country. \n     The purpose of the program was to provide security from the \n     communists and win the loyalty of the people to the Saigon \n     government.\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n       According to an official Marine Corps history, the program \n     was highly successful. Col. Corson was praised by his \n     superiors for his ability to relate to Vietnamese villagers \n     and win their confidence.\n       In 1967, when he returned to the United States, he received \n     another sensitive assignment in Washington, becoming deputy \n     director of the Southeast Asia Intelligence Force in the \n     office of the assistant secretary of defense.\n       But by that time he was convinced that U.S. policies in \n     Vietnam were doomed and he decided to write a book.\n       The book, ``The Betrayal,'' argued that the Saigon \n     government supported by Washington was corrupt and \n     incompetent and that it was perceived by ordinary Vietnamese \n     as being as much of a threat to their well-being as the \n     communists. Unless the United States devised policies to take \n     this into account, the book said, the war would be lost and \n     American servicemen would have died in vain.\n       Publication was set for July 1, 1968, by W.W. Norton and \n     Co. Inc., a month after Col. Corson was scheduled to retire \n     from the service.\n       This brought into play Marine Corps regulation that \n     required officers on active duty to submit statements on \n     public policy to review before making them public. Col. \n     Corson claimed that this did not apply to him because the \n     book would not go on sale until after he had become a \n     civilian.\n       Marine Corps officials responded by having his retirement \n     held up and by taking steps to convene a general court-\n     martial. These plans were dropped on the grounds that they \n     would only serve to draw attention to the book. Col. Corson's \n     retirement went through a month later than originally \n     scheduled.\n       Co. Corson later taught history at Howard University for a \n     year and then wrote several books on national security \n     issues, including ``Promise or Peril,'' ``Consequences of \n     Failure,'' ``The Armies of Ignorance'' and ``The New KGB'' \n     with Robert T. Crowley.\n       He also wrote a column on veterans affairs for Penthouse \n     magazine for several years and was the publication's \n     Washington editor.\n       William Raymond Corson was born in Chicago on Sept. 25, \n     1925. He attended the University of Chicago, but left in 1943 \n     to enlist in the Marine Corps during World War II. After the \n     war, he graduated from the University of Miami, where he also \n     received a master's degree in business and economics. He \n     later received a doctorate in economics at American \n     University.\n       In 1949, Col. Corson was commissioned in the Marine Corps. \n     He served in the Korean War in 1952. From 1953 to 1955, he \n     was a student in the Chinese language course at the Naval \n     Intelligence School in Washington. From 1964 to 1966, he \n     taught a course on communism and revolutionary war at the \n     U.S. Naval Academy.\n       His military decorations included the Navy Commendation \n     Medal with combat ``V''.\n       Col. Corson, a resident of Potomac, was an elder and clerk \n     of session at Harmon Presbyterian Church in Bethesda.\n       His marriage to Charlotte Corson ended in divorce.\n       Survivors include his wife, Judith C. Corson, and their \n     three children, Adam, Zachary and Andrew, all of Potomac; two \n     children from his first marriage, Christopher Corson of \n     Silver Spring and David Corson of Greenville, S.C.; and five \n     grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8656-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3057.

A bill to modify the date on which the Mayor of the District \nof Columbia submits a performance accountability plan to Congress, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\ndistrict of columbia performance accountability plan amendments act of \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto improve upon the District of Columbia's process for measuring and \nreporting on its performance. This legislation derives directly from a \nletter sent to me by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, in which he \nrequested that Congress consider making minor changes to the District's \nreporting requirements so that the city can take one step closer to \nestablishing a system of performance budgeting, in which the city's \nbudget can be linked directly to the performance goals set by the \ncity's agencies. I am pleased that Senator Durbin joins me as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  Similar to the intent of Congress in passing the Government \nPerformance and Results Act of 1993, which re-engineered the management \npractices at federal agencies, the District of Columbia Financial \nResponsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (DCFRMA) mandates \nthat the District begin submitting performance accountability plans to \nCongress preceding each fiscal year. These plans are to establish \nobjective, measurable performance goals for all agencies and \ndepartments within the government of the District of Columbia. The \nlegislation also requires the District to submit to Congress a \nperformance accountability report, following each fiscal year, that \nevaluates the city's ability to meet the performance goals it laid out \nin the performance accountability plan for that fiscal year.\n  For the past three fiscal years since the DCFRMA legislation took \neffect, the performance plans and reports have provided the District \nwith a valuable tool to establish a system of accountability in its \noperations. The Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \nRestructuring, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, has held \ntwo oversight hearings on the District's progress in improving \nperformance, and we are scheduled to hold another hearing in the coming \nweeks to evaluate the District's progress in accomplishing the goals it \nset out in its FY2000 performance accountability plan.\n  Although the performance accountability plan legislation has provided \nthe District with an effective framework for establishing a system of \nperformance budgeting, our bill proposes minor changes to the law to \nimprove the utility and relevance of this strategic planning exercise. \nFirst, current law provides that the performance accountability plan is \ndue no later than March 1st preceding each fiscal year. However, in \norder to tie together the city's budget with the performance goals for \neach year, the Mayor requested that we consider harmonizing the \nsubmission deadline for the performance plan with the city's budget to \nCongress. In order to align the submission requirements, this \nlegislation we are introducing today would change the submission \ndeadline for the performance accountability plan from its current March \n1st deadline, to a deadline that is concurrent with the submission of \nthe District of Columbia budget to Congress. By making this change, we \nhope to align the budget and the performance measures more closely, and \nhelp guide the city toward a system of performance budgeting.\n  The second change made by this legislation is to streamline the \nperformance goal requirements that were initially established in the \nDCFRMA. The current law mandates that, for every goal, the District \nmust establish both an acceptable level of performance and a superior \nlevel of performance. Our bill proposes that the multiple levels of \nperformance goals by replaced by one set of ambitious performance \ntargets. This would clarify the goals District managers are expected to \nmeet and align congressional mandates on the District with what is \nrequired of federal agencies.\n  Senator Durbin and I hope these technical amendments to the \nperformance plan requirements will allow the District to reform its \nmanagement system more efficiently, and the subcommittee intends to \nactively monitor the city's progress in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 358) relative to the death of Murray \n     Zweben, Parliamentarian Emeritus of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise today to inform the Senate of a sad \nloss for our Senate family. Yesterday, Murray Zweben, former \nParliamentarian Emeritus, passed away at Suburban Hospital from a bout \nwith pneumonia.\n  Murray served the Senate for 24 years over the span of four decades. \nHe began this long and distinguished Senate career during the late \n1950's serving as Secretary to the Parliamentarian while attending law \nschool. After clerking for a Federal judge, he returned to the Senate \nin 1963 to fill the vacated position of Second Assistant \nParliamentarian. Murray was promoted to the position of Assistant \nParliamentarian in 1964, where he served under the legendary Dr. Floyd \nRidick for 10 years. In 1975, Murray ascended to the rank of Senate \nParliamentarian, a position that he held until 1981. Two years later, \nhe was honored with the prestigious title Parliamentarian Emeritus. \nAlthough I never had the honor of working with Murray, I am well aware \nof his enormous contributions to this body.\n  A native of New Jersey, Murray graduated from Clarkson College of \nTechnology, and later received his masters degree in education from the \nState University of New York in Albany. After serving his country for 4 \nyears in the Navy, Murray moved to the Washington, DC, area in 1956. In \n1959, he graduated from George Washington University law school, where \nhe served on the law review. After his tenure in the Senate, Murray \nopened a successful private law practice here in DC.\n  Murray is survived by his wife Anne; his five children Suzanne, Lisa, \nMarc, John, and Harry; and five grandchildren. I along with the rest of \nmy colleagues send our deepest condolences to the Zweben family over \ntheir loss.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 358) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, the suspense regarding this particular \nvote is long over, but the date on the effect and implications of PNTR \nin China is really just beginning.\n  My rationale for supporting PNTR differs in some respects from my \ncolleagues, who have mostly emphasized the positive impact on our \neconomy and exports, and it relates to our ability to change the face \nof China--not just economically, but in terms of improving human \nrights, labor standards, and environmental protections, and in ensuring \nthe rule of law.\n  My genuine, and I think realistic, hope is that WTO accession becomes \na means for improving the most repressive aspects of Chinese society, \neventually permitting our two nations to embrace, in a sincere way, the \nsame cause of global security and peace.\n  It will take a concentrated effort by the next President, however, to \ninstitute a policy that uses WTO as a cudgel to aid those who have been \nrepressed, incarcerated, and persecuted in China.\n  I would submit that we need to keep the faith with those brave \nChinese who have risked their lives in the name of freedom--at \nTiananmen and elsewhere--as China adapts its economy to the rules \nrequired of every WTO member.\n  Like the President, I believe the choice between economic rights and \nhuman rights, between economic security and national security, is a \nfalse choice.\n  But I do not believe that the emphasis of American foreign policy \nshould be on engaging and partnering with any Chinese leaders whose \nsole aim is to maintain and promote the power of a bankrupt Communist \nparty.\n  Looking back on the last 30 years, I think it would be fair to say \nthat the current administration has dedicated an extraordinary amount \nof effort and attention toward building a lasting cooperative \nrelationship with China.\n  That is not inconsistent with the policies of Presidents Nixon, Ford, \nCarter, Reagan, and Bush, who appreciated the significance of \nintegrating all aspects of Chinese society into the world community.\n  In this regard I believe that achieving WTO accession is likely to be \nconsidered one of the President's single most important achievements \nduring his time in office.\n  The groundwork was laid during previous administrations, but this \nPresident demonstrated the instinct and diplomatic skill and judgment \nto close the deal.\n  He understood the urgency and necessity of bringing the world's third \nlargest economy into compliance with trading rules that nearly all \nother nations enforce and respect.\n  It is a considerable achievement.\n  The opportunity for foreign equity ownership in China will rise \ndramatically.\n  Many states subsidies will end.\n  China will have to meet international trade norms.\n  If they break the rules, a WTO panel can intervene with punitive \nmeasures.\n  Meanwhile, the United States is not required to change a single \ntariff, lower a particular subsidy, or alter any of our own invisible \nbarriers to trade.\n  This is a win-win prospect for American businesses.\n  China's leader, Jiang Zemin, while visiting the U.N. a few days ago, \nhad some interesting things to say about the future of his country, and \nit relates in part to WTO accession.\n  His calculation, clearly, is that one party rule in China can thrive \nside by side with the economic freedom required by China's membership \nin the WTO.\n  He believes the two are mutually exclusive.\n  Madam President, that seems paradoxical to me.\n  I don't believe it is tenable to argue that, over the long term, \neconomic capitalism and political communism can coexist, let alone \nprosper, in the same sovereign country.\n  And it is my fervent hope that in China the former weakens and \ndissolves the latter.\n  WTO accession for China gets us started in that direction.\n  The legendary Deng Xiao Ping was fond of saying that you should \n``cross the river by feeling the stones.'' I think his successors \napproach WTO with some trepidation, not knowing exactly where those \nstones are.\n  I would assert that we have a key role to play as WTO rules and \nregulations penetrate Chinese society, specifically in assisting and \nsupporting and working with newly economically empowered Chinese \nbusinessmen, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ordinary citizens.\n  With their profits and financial gain they will be in a position to \ncreate the right circumstances for political reform and change inside \nChina.\n  We have a responsibility to do our part in pressuring the regime from \noutside.\n  Our actions and rhetoric matter on everything from human rights to \nTibet to the rule of law.\n  The consequences of failing to ratify PNTR have to be considered as \nwell, and in this case that is why I pledged ahead of time to oppose \nany and all amendments, even though some clearly had merit. As a \npractical matter, at this late date in the 106th Congress if the Senate \nfailed to pass a clean version of PNTR it would risk, at least \nprocedurally, getting a measure passed into law by the end of the \ncongressional session.\n  Moreover, I have no doubt that China would misunderstand the reasons \nfor our inability to pass PNTR, and that would, almost inevitably, \nratchet up tensions between us even further, and it would create \nserious national security problems for us and our Asian allies at a \nminimum. In a larger sense, WTO is about changing the face of China.\n  The economic change will come first, to be sure, but it will lead \ninexorably\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nto changes in these other areas--and in my judgment, it will lead to \npositive changes, from our point of view, sooner than if we were to \nreject PNTR.\n  And to re-emphasize the consequences of failure to ratify, it will \nalso avoid the certain deterioration in our relationship with China \nthat would take place if we rejected PNTR, which, again, would have \nserious and long lasting consequences in our national security \nrelationships among all of the Pacific nations.\n  It has been my position that we ought to seek to maintain and \npromote, on a cooperative basis, our relations with China which \nrepresent a slight nuance of difference from administration policy \ndesigned to engage China strategically as a partner.\n  We share common ground with Beijing on a broad range of subjects, and \nit makes absolute sense to work together to solve problems on the \nKorean Peninsula and the like.\n  But that should not prevent us from recognizing that our values and \nprinciples are so starkly different.\n  Implying somehow that we're partners, or wishing that it were so, \ndoes not speak truth to power.\n  WTO represents an opportunity for the world community to join with a \nnewly empowered economic class in China, and it ought to be treated as \na means for strengthening their hand.\n  The focal point for U.S. policymakers should be to promote, sustain, \nand enforce broad economic freedoms within China.\n  Only then can we make a difference with our overall national security \npolicies, not just through implementation of the WTO that will \neventually lead to the political freedom and liberty that the Chinese \npeople deserve.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/18/senate-section/article/S8665-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
