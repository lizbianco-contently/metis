Mr. President, I rise today to address for a few \nminutes the tax relief package that the Senate passed before the August \nrecess.\n  I had the opportunity during the August recess to travel much of \nArkansas.\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\n I was in 27 counties in Arkansas in about a month. So we were very \nbusy. In each one of those counties there were opportunities for people \nto express their opinions and to talk about issues that were of concern \nto them. We heard much about the farm crisis. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has been very involved in trying to fashion a farm policy that \nis going to allow family farmers to survive, be viable, and has been \nvery involved in the ag policy of this country. We have heard a lot of \nconcerns about agriculture.\n  I also heard a lot about the tax package, and there were a lot of \nquestions. I want to take a few minutes today to talk about what I \nheard and what I shared about the tax relief package that we passed in \nthe Senate and the conference that was agreed upon with the House. I \nthink it is responsible and provides much-needed relief for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I think that is the first thing we have to realize--how much there is \na need for tax relief. People say, well, the economy is booming; we are \ndoing fine; people are fine; no one really wants a tax cut. I think the \nreality is far different.\n  Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest \nlevel in peacetime history--almost 21 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. When you compare that to the 1950s and the Eisenhower years, \nthe tax burden upon the American people measured--there are lots of \nways of measuring ``tax burden,'' but one of the most helpful, I think, \nis in terms of the gross domestic product. At that time, it was about \n15 percent of GDP; it is now 21 percent of GDP. And it took that last \nleap when Congress passed and the President signed the 1993 tax hike.\n  When we are talking in terms of the tax relief package, the $792 \nbillion--and for a farm boy from north Arkansas that is a lot of money, \n$792 billion--it is over 10 years, and when you realize that what we \nare doing is rolling back the tax burden on the American people by a \ngrand total of 1 percentage point of GDP; we would take it from about \n21 percent to about 20 percent, there is nothing draconian--an overused \nword these days--there is nothing irresponsible about the tax relief \npackage that was passed by the House and Senate.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, total Federal \nreceipts amounted to 19.9 percent of GDP in 1998 and will be 20.1 \npercent of GDP in 1999.\n  Now, in Arkansas, that amounts to about $7,352 in taxes per capita, \nin 1998.\n  In a State such as Connecticut, it is about twice that; $15,525 was \npaid in taxes for every man, woman, and child in Connecticut. It was \nBen Franklin who said a penny saved is a penny earned. I think maybe we \ncould adjust that motto and say: A dollar earned is 38 cents spent by \nthe Federal Government. The typical American family sees 38 percent of \nits income paid in taxes, as opposed to 28 percent of its income for \nfood, clothing, and housing and only 3.6 percent that goes to savings.\n  I believe at a time of surplus, it would be unthinkable, it would be \nunconscionable for us not to allow the American people to keep more of \nwhat they have worked so hard to make. As Ronald Reagan once remarked: \nThe taxpayer is someone who works for the Federal Government but \ndoesn't have to take a Civil Service exam. When we think about the \nincreasing percentage of our income going to taxes, that is, \nunfortunately, more true today than it was when President Reagan said \nit. The American people are laboring under a heavy burden of taxation \nand an intrusive Tax Code and tax system.\n  There are many provisions in the tax relief package. I want to \naddress two that are particularly compelling. One is the marriage \npenalty tax.\n  Approximately 42 million American couples, including 6 million senior \ncitizens, must pay an average of $1,400 extra in taxes for simply being \nmarried. The marriage penalty punishes in two ways. It pushes married \ncouples into a higher tax bracket, and it lowers couples' standard \ndeduction. So two married income earners with combined income must pay \ntheir income tax at a higher rate with a lower deduction than they \nwould if they were two single people. It is unfair. It is wrong. Most \nAmericans are absolutely perplexed why such a quirk in the Tax Code \nwould be allowed to continue.\n  Keep in mind, it is not a one-time penalty. Under our tax system, \nmarriage is not a freeway; it is a toll road. For 10 years of marriage, \ncouples must pay an average of $14,000 extra; for 20 years, couples \nmust pay $28,000 extra. The tax relief package that passed would \nfinally achieve equity and fairness by eliminating the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  The other aspect of the tax relief package we passed that I think is \nespecially helpful and important and about which people feel strongly \nin Arkansas is the death tax. Small business owners and farmers can \nlose their lives and all they have saved for their children because of \ndeath taxes. Since the value of a business is added to the estate and \ntaxed after exemption, sometimes as high as 55 percent, many small \nbusinesses and farms must be sold in order to pay the death tax. It is \nwrong. Just as the marriage penalty, it is something we should not \nallow, it is something we should not tolerate, and it is something we \nhave the ability and capacity to change this year. It is a form of \ndouble taxation. The most obvious inequity is the death tax.\n  It also doesn't make a lot of sense. It taxes investment and savings. \nIt taxes the American dream. Part of the American dream is, if you work \nhard and save and invest well and are able to accumulate something in \nlife, you will be able to pass that on to your children and your \ngrandchildren so they can start their lives with better prospects than \nwhat you did. It is not all of the American dream, but it is part of \nthe American dream. The death tax is absolutely contrary to what we \nhold out as being something Americans should strive toward--investment, \nsavings, building for the future.\n  Right now, the survival rate for a family farm from the first to the \nsecond generation is only about 30 percent. The odds are against a \nfamily farmer being able to pass along that farm to their children or \ngrandchildren. I know our farmers are working hard, and these are \ndifficult times for them. We keep having emergency bills to help \nalleviate the problems, but they are kind of a Band-Aid solution. We \nhave one the Senate passed before the August recess.\n\n  Eliminating the death tax is something we can do that will \npermanently benefit agriculture and farmers in this country. Only a \nfraction of 1 percent of small businesses make it through to four \ngenerations. Just as the family farm, which is, in effect, a small \nbusiness, other small businesses are also having a difficult time \nsurviving and certainly being passed on to future generations.\n  Consider the case of Clarence who owns a farming and lumber business \nin North Carolina. He provides jobs to 720 people in his community \nthrough three small farms, a fertilizer and tobacco warehouse, and a \nsmall lumber mill. His family has worked hard for four generations to \nbuild this business to what it is today. All of that may well be lost \nwhen Clarence dies and his family is faced with a huge Government death \ntax bill. Clarence has worked hard to try to reduce the burden of the \ndeath tax. He slowed the growth of his business. He has hired lawyers. \nHe has purchased life insurance. He has established trusts--all with \nthe hope that he could create a plan to enable his children to keep the \nfamily business when he dies. All of that work and planning still may \nnot be enough.\n  Clarence figures that his son will owe the Federal Government about \n$1.5 million upon his death, an impossible amount to pay for a man who \nmakes only $31,000 a year. His son will almost certainly have to sell \nall or part of the business in order to pay the consequences of the \ndeath tax. Over four generations, Clarence's family businesses have \nbeen whittled down to a sliver of what they once were.\n  Then consider the case of Mr. Kennard, whose spirit of free \nenterprise is being stifled by the death tax. He owns a small septic \ntank company in Virginia. He began his business in 1963. Today, he \nemploys 15 people, including his son and daughter who have worked with \nhim since they were teenagers. His son runs one of the businesses and \ntakes home about $30,000 a year, hardly enough to pay the $2 million \nbill the Government will hand him when his father dies.\n  Death should not be a taxable experience. In order to reduce the \nestate tax,\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\nMr. Kennard has stopped expanding his businesses and is considering \ntransferring shares of his business to his children now rather than \nwait until his death. He would like to invest in insurance and put some \nof his money back into the business, but it doesn't make sense when his \nfamily will have to pay exorbitant taxes on any new appreciation. In \nfact, Mr. Kennard may have to liquidate one or two of his businesses in \norder to pay the death tax on the remaining businesses.\n  The tax refund bill would provide relief by lowering the 5-percent \nsurtax on estates and replace the unified credit with the unified \nexemption of $1.5 million. We would ultimately be rid of the death tax \naltogether. It is something we should do. It is something we have \nwithin our power to do. We have passed it. We will send it to the \nPresident. It is our hope, still, that the President will change his \nmind and not veto this very important legislation.\n  There are many other important provisions in the bill as well. People \nsay: Why spend your time on tax relief when the President said he is \ngoing to veto it? Because it is important, because it is the right \nthing to do, because our responsibility to our constituents is not what \nthe President may or may not do. I recall well my early years in the \nHouse when we passed welfare reform and had to send it to the President \nnot once, not twice, but three times, before the President finally \ndecided the American people wanted welfare reform. He signed an \nimportant piece of reform legislation that has transformed welfare in \nthis country and cut the rolls in half in State after State, including \nmy home State of Arkansas.\n\n  I hope the President will reconsider, and I hope the American people \nwill let us and the administration know how important tax relief is. \nWhen they understand what is in it, they do support it. In 27 counties \nin Arkansas, I did hear some concerns, primarily because of the myths \nthat have been perpetrated about this tax relief bill.\n  One of the concerns was the myth that this tax relief bill somehow \ntrades debt reduction for tax cuts. The fact is, the budget and the tax \nrelief bill we passed will reduce public debt by 60 percent and achieve \nover $200 billion more in public debt reduction than the President's \nplan over the next 10 years. It is not a matter of either/or. It is not \na matter of whether you are going to have debt reduction or we are \ngoing to have tax relief. We can and should have both.\n  Another one of the myths people are concerned about, and \nunderstandably concerned, is that somehow, if you pass a meaningful tax \nrelief bill, as we did, it is going to erode and eat into the Social \nSecurity surplus. In fact, that is nothing but a myth. We would lockbox \nSocial Security. We would not touch any of the Social Security \nsurpluses, and we shouldn't. We should not perpetrate the wrong that \nhas been done by previous Congresses by dipping in and using those \nrevenues which are designated and should be designated for Social \nSecurity only.\n  Then there is, perhaps, one of the greatest myths of all; that is, \nthe tax relief bill will primarily benefit the wealthy. This tax relief \npackage would provide broad-based tax relief. It cuts every bracket 1 \npercent. That is not much. But it cuts across the board of tax brackets \nby 1 percent. It doesn't take somebody trained in math to figure out \nthat if you are in the 15-percent tax bracket and you lower it from 15 \nto 14 percent, it is a much bigger personal tax cut than for somebody \nwho is in a lower tax bracket who also sees only a 1-percent reduction \nin taxes.\n\n  The fact is that this tax relief package benefits low-income earners \nin the lowest tax bracket more than any other taxable group. We not \nonly lower the rate, we expand the bracket to include yet more hard-\nworking Americans.\n  In a State such as Arkansas, where we have one of the lowest per \ncapita incomes, lowering the tax by even 1 percent for the lowest tax \nbracket has a significant benefit for hard-working Arkansans and hard-\nworking Americans.\n  One of the other myths I heard while I was traveling across Arkansas \nwas that there was concern that somehow these surpluses might not \nbecome reality. Conservative Arkansans who look at the Congressional \nBudget Office projections a decade out, I think, are right to say: What \nhappens if, in fact, the surpluses don't become reality? Are you going \nto give all of this back in tax cuts? And are we going to go back up in \ndeficit spending?\n  I was glad to be able to report that there was an important provision \nincluding a trigger--maybe it is better to call it a safety valve--that \nensures that if the surpluses do not become reality, the tax cuts don't \nkick in. They don't become reality either. That, I think, is the \nultimate fallback to ensure that we don't return to the big spending, \nred-ink, deficit spending ways of the past.\n  The bottom line is that in Arkansas 683,741 people would have tax \nreductions under this bill. That is, 750 million Americans would see \ntheir tax bills reduced. It is not something targeted for the wealthy, \nbut it is something that would benefit every taxpaying American.\n  Opponents of tax relief insist that money must be left on the table \nin the name of debt reduction. The reality is that if you leave it on \nthe table in Washington, it will be spent.\n  Therein is the great divide philosophically between those who believe \nthe American people can better decide and determine how they ought to \nspend what they have earned and what they have worked for than people \nin Washington, DC--Government officials and bureaucrats in Washington. \nFor those who believe we have to keep that money up here because we \nhave to reserve it on the table for more spending programs because, \ntruly, wisdom is found here inside the beltway, we reject that. I \nreject that.\n  I ask my colleagues to request of the President his reconsideration \nof what is desperately needed for the American people--lowering that \ntax burden from 21 percent to 20 percent. There is nothing too dramatic \nnor too drastic about it, but it is a small step in providing the \nAmerican people the tax relief they deserve and they desire.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank Senator Thomas for providing this time and this opportunity \nto discuss what we have done in the area of tax relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Arkansas stated \nvery clearly the strong feeling that I have received from folks in \nWyoming. As I went around as well, when I first talked about tax \nrelief, people kind of rolled their eyes. But when you start talking \nabout the specifics of it--estate taxes and marriage penalty taxes--\nwhen you talk about the kinds of things that are there to encourage \nretirement funding and educational funding, you really get a great deal \nmore interest in it.\n  I think the Senator pointed out clearly the real philosophical \ndifference. If the money is here, it will be spent for increased \ngovernment and increased programs rather than going back to the people \nwho really own the money.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10745-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I chair the Committee on Aging. We\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nhave been holding some hearings about the nursing home industry over \nthe last several months. I would like to make a comment.\n  First of all, I would like to speak about credibility. It is similar \nto an old maple tree. It takes years to develop, but a big storm can \nwipe it out just like that. I have a story that makes the point.\n  The nursing home industry challenged the credibility of nursing home \ninspectors. The nursing home industry, after this challenge, lost.\n  When I refer to the nursing home industry, I mean the American Health \nCare Association. This group represents the for-profit nursing homes. \nIt has thousands of members across the country.\n  Nursing home inspectors operate in every State. They inspect every \nnursing home that accepts Federal money. The inspectors gauge whether \nnursing homes follow the Federal laws that were passed to protect \nnursing home residents. They evaluate everything from the most severe \nproblems to the most minor problems. The most severe problems include \nmalnutrition, dehydration, bedsores, inadequate medical treatment--\nmatters that can be life-threatening. The most minor problems might \ninclude things such as comfortable lighting and access to stationery.\n  At my request, the General Accounting Office has issued a series of \nreports documenting severe problems in too many nursing homes, thus \npointing up the shortcomings of the inspection.\n  On March 18, when I released one of these reports, the American \nHealth Care Association issued a critical news release. The association \nsaid:\n\n       Inspectors have closed down facilities, without consulting \n     residents and their families, for technical violations posing \n     no jeopardy to residents.\n\n  The association also said:\n\n       Unfortunately, the current Federal inspection system has \n     all the trademarks of a bureaucratic government program out \n     of control.\n\n  These, of course, were very serious charges made by the association \nof nursing homes, and I took those charges very seriously. The Federal \ninspection system is responsible for the welfare of 1.6 million nursing \nhome residents. If that system fails, these frail individuals will bear \nthe brunt. That is something that should concern every one of us in the \nSenate.\n  Following up, I asked the American Health Care Association for proof \nof its claims issued in that news release critical of what the General \nAccounting Office had to say at my behest to study the issue. On May 6, \nI received an information packet from the American Health Care \nAssociation describing 10 examples that the association saw as proof of \noverzealous regulations. I turned this information over to the General \nAccounting Office and asked for its analysis.\n  The GAO did not find evidence of overzealous regulation. In fact, the \nGeneral Accounting Office found just the opposite. There was adequate \ninformation for an objective assessment for 8 of the 10 industry \nexamples. In each of those 8 cases, the General Accounting Office found \nthat regulators acted appropriately.\n  I am not going to go through all eight examples, but I will use \nthree. I think they show that there is a big difference in what the \nindustry presented and what the General Accounting Office found; in \nother words, the industry's accusations that the inspection system was \na bureaucratic thing out of control and that it was based upon just \ntechnicalities was wrong.\n  Example No. 1: The industry complained that a Michigan nursing home \nwas severely punished for providing complimentary coffee to family \nmembers, staff, and residents. The General Accounting Office said that \nthe nursing home inspectors saw two vulnerable residents pulling at the \nspigot of the hot coffee urn. The inspectors believed that the \nresidents were in immediate danger of suffering serious burns from the \ncoffee. Of course, with this, the General Accounting Office agreed.\n  Example No. 2: The industry complained that a California nursing home \nwas cited for bed sores on a resident's foot that predated his \nadmission, and in fact the bed sores were healing. The General \nAccounting Office said the inspector found conditions that actually had \nworsened the bed sores. The resident was wearing leather shoes when in \na wheelchair. His feet were not elevated when in bed. His bedsore \ndressings were changed without proper techniques to prevent infection. \nThere again, the example given by the nursing home association was \nwrong.\n  Example No. 3: The industry claimed that an Alabama nursing home was \ncited for a bald kitchen worker who failed to wear a hair net. The GAO \nreported that the industry did not identify the nursing home involved \nnor provide any documentation; therefore, the General Accounting Office \ncould not assess what had happened.\n  I could go on in more detail from the General Accounting Office \nreport. I have that report here, and I would like to point out to my \ncolleagues that they should look at it, read it. Hopefully, everyone is \ninterested and they will do so. It tells a valuable cautionary tale. \nMembers of Congress, as I felt a responsibility to do, should always \nseek out both sides of every story. Industry associations work hard to \nseek our agreement with their side and, of course, in our system of \ngovernment, and whether individual, or an association of individuals, \nthat is their right. But it is our obligation as representatives of the \npeople to weigh every issue with all the facts at hand. It is equally \nour obligation to consider the credibility of every source.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time for Senator \nThomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator. Certainly, he has been the leader in \nrural health care, which is very important to my State, as it is for \nthe State of the Presiding Officer.\n  I am pleased to have the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, join us \nthis morning for some comments on our future activities. I yield 15 \nminutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want also to join in the Senator's \npraise of Senator Grassley for his leadership on many of the issues \naffecting senior citizens and rural health care in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10746-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10746-S10748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to \nenacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save the Medicare \nsystem for current and future generations. The Republican congressional \nbudget plan has set aside $505 billion over the next 10 years \nspecifically to address domestic issues such as Medicare. Moreover, $90 \nbillion of this amount has been set aside in a reserve fund that is \ndedicated exclusively to strengthening Medicare's financing and \nmodernizing its benefits, including the provision of coverage for \nprescription drugs. Prescription drugs are as important to our senior \ncitizens' health today as the hospital bed was back in 1965 when the \nMedicare program was first created. Medicare clearly should be \nrestructured to reflect these changing priorities.\n  The money to address this challenge has been set prudently aside as \npart of the Republican budget. We have the resources, we have the \ndetermination, and we have the will to address this critical issue. Now \nit is up to Congress to come up with the plan, which I hope our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will help us devise. We need \nto strengthen and modernize this critically important program to meet \nthe health care needs of elderly and disabled Americans into the 21st \ncentury.\n  In addition to addressing the long-term structural issues facing \nMedicare, it is essential that Congress also take action this year to \naddress some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997, as well as regulatory overkill by the Clinton administration, \nwhich is jeopardizing access to critically important home health care \nservices for millions of senior citizens.\n  The growth in Medicare spending has slowed dramatically, and that is \ndue, in part, to the reforms that were enacted as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. While it was Congress' intent in enacting this \nlegislation to slow the rate of growth, it has become increasingly \nclear that the payment policies implemented by the Clinton \nadministration as a consequence of the Balanced Budget Act have gone \ntoo far and that the cutbacks have been far\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\ntoo deep, jeopardizing our seniors' access to critical hospital, \nskilled nursing, and home health care.\n  Nowhere is this problem more serious than in home health care. \nAmerica's home health agencies provide services that have enabled a \ngrowing number of our most frail and vulnerable senior citizens to \navoid hospitals, to avoid nursing homes, and to receive the care they \nneed and want in the security and privacy of their homes, just where \nthey want to be.\n  I have visited with home health nurses in Maine who have taken me on \nhome health visits. I know firsthand how vital these important health \ncare services are to our frail seniors. I know of couples who have been \nable to stay together in their own home solely because of the services \nprovided by our home health agencies. In 1996, home health was the \nfastest growing component of the Medicare budget. That, understandably, \nprompted Congress and the Clinton administration to initiate changes \nthat were intended to make the program more cost-effective and \nefficient.\n  There was strong bipartisan support for the provisions in the BBA \nthat called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for \nhome care. Unfortunately, until this system is implemented, home health \nagencies are being paid under a very flawed interim payment system, or \nIPS.\n  In trying to get a handle on cost, Congress and the administration \ncreated a system that penalizes efficient agencies and that may be \nrestricting access to care for the very Medicare beneficiaries who need \nthe care the most. These include our sicker patients with complex \nchronic care needs, like diabetic wound care patients, or IV-therapy \npatients who require multiple visits.\n  According to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, almost 40 percent of home health agencies indicated that \nthere were patients whom they previously would have accepted for care, \nwhom they no longer serve due to this flawed interim payment system and \nthe regulatory overkill of the Clinton administration. Thirty-one \npercent of these agencies admitted they had actually discharged \npatients due to the inadequate payment system. The discharged patients \ntend to be those with chronic care needs who require a large number of \nvisits and are expensive to serve. Indeed, they are the very people who \nmost need home health services.\n\n  I know that Congress simply did not intend to construct a payment \nsystem that inevitably discourages home health agencies from caring for \nthose senior citizens who need the service the most. These problems are \nall the more pressing because they have been exacerbated by the failure \nof the Clinton administration to meet the original deadline for \nimplementing a prospective payment system. As a result, home health \ncare agencies will be struggling under a flawed IPS system, the interim \npayment system, for far longer than Congress ever envisioned when it \nenacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Moreover, it now appears the savings from the Balanced Budget Act \nwere greatly underestimated. Medicare spending for home health care \nfell by nearly 15 percent last year and the CBO now projects that the \npost-Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health care will exceed $46 \nbillion over the next 5 years. This is three times greater than the $16 \nbillion that CBO originally estimated for that time period. That is \nanother indication that the cutbacks have been far too deep, far too \nsevere, and much more wide-reaching than Congress ever intended.\n  Again, the flaws in the Balanced Budget Act have been exacerbated by \nregulatory decisions made by this administration. Earlier this year, I \nchaired a hearing held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nWe heard firsthand about the financial distress and cash-flow problems \nof very good, cost-effective, home health agencies from across the \ncountry. We heard about the impact of these cutbacks on our senior \ncitizens. Witnesses expressed concern that the problems in the system \nare inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care, particularly \nto chronically ill patients with complex needs. Some agencies have \nactually closed because the reimbursement levels under Medicare have \nfallen far short of their actual operating costs. Many others in Maine \nand throughout the Nation are laying off staff or declining to accept \nnew patients, particularly those with the more serious health problems \nthat require more care and more visits.\n  This points to the most critical and central issue: Cuts of this \nmagnitude simply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting the \ncare that we provide to our senior citizens. Moreover, the financial \nproblems that home health agencies have been experiencing have been \nexacerbated by a host of onerous, burdensome, and ill-conceived new \nregulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration through \nHCFA, including the implementation of what is known as OASIS, the new \noutcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for \nsurety bonds; sequential billing requirements; IPS overpayment \nrecoupment; and a new 15-minute increment home health reporting \nrequirement requiring nurses to act as if they were accountants or \nlawyers, billing every 15 minutes of their time.\n  Witnesses at our hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations expressed particular frustration with what the CEO from \nthe Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, ME, Maryanna Arsenault, termed as \nthe Clinton administration's regulatory policy of ``implement and \nsuspend.'' She and others pointed to numerous examples of hastily \nenacted, ill-conceived requirements for surety bonds and sequential \nbilling. No sooner had HCFA imposed the cost burden of a specific \nmandate on America's home health agencies, than it then had second \nthoughts and suspended the requirements--but only after damage had been \ndone, only after our home health agencies had invested significant time \nand resources they do not have, trying to comply with this regulatory \noverkill.\n  Responding to the excessive regulation of the Clinton administration, \nas well as the problems in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and I have together introduced \nlegislation titled, ``The Medicare Home Health Equity Act,'' which is \ncosponsored, I am pleased to say, by a bipartisan group of 26 of our \ncolleagues. It makes needed adjustments in the Balanced Budget Act and \nrelated Federal regulations to ensure that our senior citizens have \naccess to necessary home health services.\n\n  One of the ironies of the formula enacted in the Balanced Budget Act \nis that it penalizes the low-cost nonprofit agencies that had been \ndoing a good job of holding down their expenses. The program needs to \nbe entirely revamped.\n  The most important provision of our bill eliminates the automatic 15-\npercent reduction in Medicare home health payments that is now \nscheduled for October 1 of next year, whether or not a prospective \npayment system is enacted. I am not overstating the situation when I \nsay that if another 15-percent cut is imposed on America's home health \nagencies, it would be a disaster. It would threaten our ability to \nprovide these services to millions of senior citizens throughout this \ncountry.\n  A further 15-percent cut would be devastating. It would destroy the \nlow-cost, cost-effective providers, and it would further reduce our \nseniors' access to home health care. Furthermore, as I mentioned \nearlier, it is entirely unnecessary because we have already achieved \nthe budget savings that were anticipated in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. We have not only exceeded them, we have exceeded them by a factor \nof three.\n  Our legislation also provides for what we call supplemental \n``outlier'' payments to home health agencies on a patient-by-patient \nbasis. This is needed because there are some patients who are expensive \nto care for because they have complex and chronic health conditions \nthat need a great deal of care. We heed to have a formula that \nrecognizes that there are certain higher cost patients who are higher \ncost in a legitimate sense. It is still far cheaper to treat those \npatients through home health care than in a nursing home or hospital \nsetting.\n  The provision in our bill removes the existing financial disincentive \nfor agencies to care for patients with intensive medical needs. We know \nfrom the recent studies from GAO and the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission that those are the individuals who\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nare most at risk right now of losing access to home health services \nunder the current interim payment system.\n  To decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-\nbeneficiary limits, too many home health agencies have had to \nsignificantly reduce the number of visits, which in turn has increased \nthe cost of each visit. We need to deal with the regulatory issues that \nI have mentioned, including OASIS, surety bonds, sequential billing, \nand the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement. Our legislation \naccomplishes these goals.\n  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1999 will provide a measure of \nfinancial and regulatory relief to beleaguered home health agencies in \norder to ensure that our senior citizens have access to medically \nnecessary home health services.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with the Senate majority leader, \nSenator Lott, as well as Senator Abraham, Senator Santorum, Senator \nBond, and others who have been real leaders in this effort to come up \nwith a solution to this very pressing problem. My hope is that we will \nmake reforming the payment system for Medicare home health services a \ntop priority this fall.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Maine, not only because of the \ngood job she does all across the board but particularly on this matter \nof health care, rural health care. As cochairman of the Rural Health \nCare Caucus, I am particularly interested in those kinds of things. For \nexample, in Wyoming, home health care is so important and sometimes \nquite expensive, particularly because of the amount of miles that have \nto be traveled. But for the patient, and because of the cost, home \nhealth care is the right way to go.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Missouri to talk a little more about \nthe future and our plans with respect to taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine for her \nsensitivity to a crisis which is looming in American health care and \nthat she is willing to constructively deal with that crisis. I thank \nher for her thoughts on this matter and for her cosponsorship of \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10748-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10748-S10749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as we look to the future, most of us, in \nour families, in our businesses, in our civic organizations, in our \nchurches, like to deal with some sort of plan. As a matter of fact, \nthere is a lot of buzz or talk these days about financial planning, \nmaking sure we have the capacity to meet the demands of the future when \nthey come to us and when they fall upon us.\n  It is incumbent on the Congress of the United States to engage in \nsome planning, to take a look at the future and find out exactly where \nwe ought to be going and how we ought to get there, and the things that \nare important and what we ought to do to protect our interests. It is \nwith that in mind that we, the Members of the Congress, are delivering \nto the President a financial plan for the next decade. He will have an \nopportunity to act on that plan this week. That plan has been talked \nabout, the tax relief contained in the plan, but it has not been spoken \nof very generously in terms of the other major features of this \nfinancial plan for America for the next 10 years. I think we can only \nunderstand the plan by looking at it as a whole, understanding what we \nare doing to protect the interests of this country in the years ahead.\n  The first thing I think people want us to start to do is to be more \nresponsible in the way we in Washington handle their money. One of the \nareas of irresponsibility in the past has been the Social Security \ntrust fund. When there has been a little bit more in the trust fund--or \na lot more in the trust fund--than was needed for that particular year, \nMembers of the House and Senate have been a part of budgeting that \nmoney for expenditures not related to Social Security, to support the \noperational costs of Government.\n\n  Americans are duly concerned because they know the reason there is a \nsurplus in the Social Security trust fund is that big bulge of us baby \nboomers are paying in, but they know when this big bulge of baby \nboomers starts to consume instead of contribute to the trust fund, we \nare going to need the surplus. So the first thing we have done in our \nfinancial plan for the future is to put an end to that. We are going to \nstop the practice of spending the trust fund. So the financial plan \nwhich will go to the President this week says $1.9 trillion--trillion \nbeing a thousand billions and a billion being a thousand millions; I \nmean, it is almost impossible to think of it that way--$1.9 trillion is \ngoing to be reserved for Social Security, a major step forward. \nAmericans have a right to expect us to plan to do that and we are doing \nit. That is a big part of the financial plan for the future.\n  No. 2, people say over time most families, most organizations want to \nreduce their debt; they would like to get their debt down to manageable \nlevels. Most of us take 30 years to pay off a home. We have decided to \nstart paying down the national debt. In a part of the plan which I \nthink is very important, we are taking the publicly held debt of the \nUnited States of America from $3.8 trillion down to $1.9 trillion, a \n50-percent decline in the national debt held by the public of the \nUnited States of America. What a tremendous decline in debt. As part of \na rational plan, the debt to the gross domestic product ratio goes from \n43 percent to 14 percent over that 10-year plan we are sending to the \nPresident. First, we protect Social Security. Second, we pay the debt \ndown by 50 percent.\n  No. 3, as the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has \nindicated, we put aside about $505 billion for contingencies over the \nnext 10 years, things we might want to spend money on over and above \nwhat we are spending now. So not only do we have a reservation of $1.9 \ntrillion for Social Security, not only do we cut the publicly held debt \nof this country in half, but we also reserve a half trillion dollars \nfor expenditures we are not now making.\n  It is only in the context of these three items--the saving of the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security; reducing the national \ndebt, the publicly held debt of America, by 50 percent; putting aside a \nhalf trillion dollars for contingencies--that we understand what the \ntax relief is all about. The tax relief is what is left over. Americans \nearn the money. We trust Americans to earn this money; we should trust \nthem to spend it. The question is whether we are going to fund families \nor bureaucracies.\n  We got the President to agree with us on saving Social Security to \nthe extent of putting $1.9 trillion aside, and I commend him for \ngetting there. He wasn't there in his State of the Union Message. I \ncommend the President for being willing to pay down the national debt. \nBut the President, after that, wants to spend so much more of what is \nleft over on more Government programs.\n  Frankly, we ought to be giving a tax relief package, 1 percent, to \nevery bracket. We ought to be doing away with the marriage penalty tax. \nWe ought to allow parents and grandparents to invest money so their \nkids can have money for education, and the growth of that money can \nhave a tax preferred status. We ought to allow people to buy health \ncare in a more tax beneficial way, especially the self-employed who do \nnot get it on their jobs.\n\n  It is with that in mind I think this package is delivered to the \nPresident to say this is a comprehensive financial plan for the future. \nThe tax relief only amounts to 23.8 percent of the total surplus as we \nhave defined surpluses historically because we have been so responsible \nas to set that Social Security surplus aside. It is not part of what we \nwill spend. And we start to knock down the national debt, take down the \npublicly held debt of the country 50 percent in the next 10 years and \nset aside a half trillion dollars for contingencies, and then work on \nabolishing the marriage penalty and tax, saving for education and \nexpanded IRAs, and knocking every tax rate down by 1 percent--a 1-\npercent decline for folks at the top brackets and a 1-percent decline \nfor folks at the bottom brackets.\n  It seems to me that is the kind of plan upon which a nation can march\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nforward. I call upon the President of the United States to reevaluate \nhis position. He has expressed real doubts, serious reservations about \nthis. Seeing it in the context of a financial plan for the future of \nthe United States is to see it as a roadmap to opportunity and success \nand prosperity.\n  I close with this. Because we had the two biggest tax increases in \nhistory in this decade, Americans have paid in far more money than we \nare going to need. It is like going to the grocery store and you hand \nthe man a $10 bill for a $2.45 gallon of milk. You expect change. You \nexpect to get something back when you pay more than is needed for what \nyou have ordered. You would not think much of the grocer who said: I'm \ngoing to give you two more gallons of milk and a pound of bacon, \nwhether you need it or not. That is what has happened. The President \nsaid we have the Government covered, the costs are covered, but they \nhave overpaid. Now we are going to give them a whole bunch more \nGovernment, whether they have ordered it or not.\n  I think we need a little change. Americans deserve some tax relief, \nand I am pleased to have had this opportunity to present this financial \nplan which the President should sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we have used the time that has \nbeen allocated. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes. \nSince I am the only one present, the chances are probably pretty good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased my associates could come \nover this morning and talk about some of the programs that are before \nus, to talk about some of the directions we will be taking. I think \nthere is another area, in addition to what has been talked about, that \nis right before us. We are dealing now with spending. We are now in the \nprocess of finishing the appropriations process. Congress must adopt 13 \ndifferent appropriations bills for future spending of the Government \nand we are in the process of doing that.\n  We also have some budget limitations that we have placed on \nourselves, some caps that we have to honor. We are dealing also with \nemergency spending. We have talked some now about the surpluses that \nhave been available. The surpluses that are available this year, \nhowever, are generally Social Security dollars. But there are $14 \nbillion in the regular budget and those will, of course, be available. \nMost of those have already been set aside as emergency spending.\n  What we have before us is an opportunity to continue to work and \ncomplete this matter of funding the budget for this year. At the same \ntime, we must pass it on to the White House. We must find some \nagreement, either that or have some continuing resolutions that will \nput us into the future or, in fact, we are faced with the possibility \nof the President vetoing the legislation and of having the Government \nshut down, as happened in the past. I hope this will not be the case.\n  I noticed in the paper the other day the President has indicated he \nwould like nothing better than a bipartisan compromise. Hopefully, that \nis what will happen. Yet he has suggested ``if only the Republicans \ncould be a little more reasonable.'' I am not sure that is necessarily \na part of it. Probably his White House aides are happy about this \npartisan combat because, as we know, the last time the Government was \nshut down, the Congress shouldered all the responsibility. I do not \nbelieve that ought to be the case, and hopefully it will not be this \nyear. We are looking forward to working in those areas.\n  In terms of Social Security, there are some changes that need to be \nmade. We are talking about saving Social Security. We ought to do that. \nWe are committed to doing that. The method of doing it currently, of \ncourse, is to put the Social Security surplus in to replace the \npublicly held debt. The fact is, it then becomes debt that has to be \ncovered by the taxpayers when the time comes to use it.\n  We also are looking at a change in the Social Security Act which \nresponds to what is happening with Social Security. The demographics \nare changing. When Social Security started, there were 34 people \nworking for every 1 beneficiary. People paid about $30 a year into the \nprogram. Now there are three people working for every beneficiary, and \nit is moving toward two. They are paying 12.5 percent of up to nearly \n$80,000 into this fund.\n  The fact is, over a period of time, probably in 20 years, there will \nnot be enough money to continue as we have, so we have to make some \nchanges. The choices are very simple ones basically:\n  We can increase taxes. Nobody really wants to do that. The Social \nSecurity tax is the largest tax paid by almost all taxpayers in the \nlower-income brackets.\n  We can reduce benefits. People are not much interested in that.\n  The third alternative, of course, is to increase the revenue that \ncomes from the moneys that are in the trust fund. We are very anxious \nto do that. It also gives an opportunity to take that money when it \ncomes in and put it somewhere other than into additional national debt \nloans and put it into individual accounts that people would have as \ntheir own, to be invested in the private sector for a much higher \nyield.\n  These are some of the things with which we grapple. Certainly, we are \ngoing to be working with the administration to see if we can do \nsomething in that respect. I do not think there is willingness on this \nside to trade off tax relief for increased spending. I hope not, and I \ndo not believe we will do that.\n  On the other hand, we can find, I am sure, agreement in the \nappropriations areas, and we can move forward with that.\n  Mr. President, our time has expired. I see there is a Senator on the \nother side of the isle, so I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

I also want to say to my \ncolleagues, as I see us moving forward over the next couple of days \nthis week, that I do intend to be back on the floor with amendments \nthat relate to how we can get a decent price for family farmers and how \nwe can get some competition and how we can put some free enterprise \nback into the food industry.\n  I am also prepared--and I am sure other Senators would feel the same \nway if they came from an agricultural State--I am also prepared, \nstarting this week and every week, to spend a considerable amount of \ntime before the Senate talking, not so much in statistical terms but \nmore in personal terms, about what is happening.\n  I give, by the way, a lot of credit to Willie Nelson and Neil Young \nand John Mellencamp for putting together Farm Aid. I had a chance to be \nthere yesterday morning with my wife Sheila. It was an important \ngathering. I thank them for bringing some attention to the crisis in \nagriculture and what is happening to family farmers.\n  They are not Johnny-come-latelys. They have been at this for some \ntime. There was a rally this morning, a ``Save the Family Farm'' \ncoalition rally, and then the Farmers Union was meeting with Secretary \nGlickman. I know there are hundreds of Farmers Union members who are \ngoing to be meeting with Republican and Democratic Senators.\n  What everybody is saying right now is, we have this convulsion in \nagriculture. When I was a college teacher in the mid-1980s in \nNorthfield, MN, in Rice County, I did a lot of organizing with farmers. \nI had some friends who took their lives. I am not being melodramatic, \nunfortunately. I was at more\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\nforeclosures than I ever wanted to be. I saw a tremendous amount of \neconomic pain.\n  What we are experiencing now in agriculture in this country is far \nworse. On present course, we are going to lose, as I said last week, a \ngeneration of family farmers. I simply say, in an emphatic way, the \npolitical question for us is whether we stay the course or whether we \nchange course. I do not believe that any Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, who comes from a State like the State of Minnesota and who \nhas been traveling in communities and seeing the pain in people's eyes \nand seeing people who literally are almost at the very end, could not \ntake the position that we have to do something different when it comes \nto agricultural policy.\n  I am not going to be shrill today--or hopefully any other day--but I \nam telling my colleagues, the status quo is unacceptable. It is \nunacceptable. The piece of legislation we passed several years ago \ncalled Freedom to Farm--I believe it's really ``Freedom to Fail,'' \nthough others can take a different position--at minimum has to be \nmodified. If we do not take the cap off the loan rate and we do not \nhave some kind of target price and we do not do something to make sure \nthat farmers have a decent price for what they produce so they can get \nthe cash flow to earn a decent living, they are going to go under. Many \nof them are going under right now as I speak.\n  The second thing I want to talk about is a piece of legislation I \nwill offer this week as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I will \nhave plenty of data. For example, five firms account for over 80 \npercent of beef packing market. That is a higher concentration than the \nFTC found in 1918 leading up to enactment of the Packers and Stockyards \nAct. Six firms account for 75 percent of pork packing. Now we have a \nsituation where Smithfield wants to buy out Murphy. And the largest \nfour grain buyers control nearly 40 percent of the elevator facilities.\n  The legislation I am going to introduce--I am now waiting for the \nfinal draft from legislative counsel--will impose a moratorium on \nmergers, acquisitions, and marketing agreements among dealers, \nprocessors, commission merchants, brokers, or operators of a warehouse \nof agricultural commodities with annual net sales or total assets of \nmore than $50 million. The moratorium would last for 1 year, or until \nCongress enacts legislation that addresses the problems of \nconcentration of agriculture, whichever comes first. I think Senator \nDorgan is working on a similar piece of legislation. I am sure there \nare other Senators who are going to be talking about this.\n\n  Going back to the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, or Senator Estes \nKefauver's work in the 1950s, Congress has said there was a role for \nGovernment to protect consumers and also to protect producers. In fact, \na lot of the history of the Sherman Act and Clayton Act goes back to \nagriculture and the concerns of family farmers.\n  What I am saying in this legislation is, obviously, the status quo is \nnot working. These conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner \ntable. They are pushing family farmers out. There is no real \ncompetition in the food industry any longer. In order for our producers \nto get a decent price, and in order to make sure our producers and \nfamily farmers have a future, in order to make sure the rural \ncommunities of my State of Minnesota have a future, we are going to \nhave to take some action. Our action and our legislation ought to be on \nthe side of family farmers.\n  So I intend to introduce this bill later today. I will also draft \nthis as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I also will be on the \nfloor with other amendments. Unfortunately, the bankruptcy bill applies \nall too well to family farmers in my State of Minnesota and to family \nfarmers all around the country.\n  There are other colleagues who want to speak, so I am going to try to \nconclude in the next 3 or 4 minutes, I say to my colleague from Oregon. \nI will not take a lot of time because we only have an hour and others \nwant to speak as well.\n  But I have had a chance to travel a lot in Minnesota. I have had a \nchance to spend time in other States--in Iowa, in Texas, in Missouri. I \nhave met with a lot of organizers around the country--in the Midwest \nand in the South--and I am telling you that I think rural America has \nto take a stand. I do not care whether we use the language of modifying \nlegislation or amending legislation.\n  I personally thought the Freedom to Farm was really ``Freedom to \nFail'' from the word ``go.'' Others can have different opinions. But \nfor sure, time is not on the side of family farmers. A lot of people in \nMinnesota, a lot of farmers are 45, 50 years old. They are burning \ntheir equity up. They look at me hard, and they say: Look, Paul, do we \nbasically take everything we have and try to keep this farm going? We \nwill. We want to. It has been in our family for four generations. We \nlove farming. But if there is no future for us, tell us now.\n  I do not want to tell family farmers in Minnesota there is no future \nfor them. I do not want to tell our rural communities there is no \nfuture for them. I do not want to tell our country that a few \nconglomerates are going to own all the land. Then what will the price \nbe, and what will be the quality of the food? Will there be an \nagriculture that respects the air and the land and the water and the \nenvironment? I think not.\n  I do not think our country is yet engaged. I hope the national media \nwill cover this crisis. And it is a crisis. I will be coming to the \nfloor of the Senate with longer and longer and longer and longer \nspeeches, backed up by lots of data and statistics of what is happening \nin Minnesota, backed up with a lot of personal stories of hard-working \npeople who have now lost their farms, where they not only live but \nwhere they have also worked. I will have amendments on legislation, in \nan effort to change things for the better.\n  If my colleagues have other ideas about how to change things for the \nbetter, great. Then get out on the floor of the Senate--this week, next \nweek, the following week. Personally, at this point in time, I am \nfocused on family farmers in the State of Minnesota. I am focused on \nour rural communities. I am focused on family farmers and rural \ncommunities all across our country.\n  I intend, as a Senator, to do everything I can on the floor of the \nSenate to fight for people, everything I know how to do to fight for \npeople. I also am going to spend as much time as I can organizing the \nfarmers because I am convinced, I say to Senator Reid and Senator \nWyden, we are going to need farmers and rural people to come and rock \nthis capital before we get the change we need. But we are going to keep \npushing very hard. An awful lot of good people's lives are at stake.\n  I think in many ways this is a question that speaks to what America \nis about as well. I cannot be silent on it. I know of many Senators \nfrom other agricultural States who feel the same way. We have to push \nthis on to the agenda of the Congress, and we have to do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10750-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10750-S10751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President and colleagues, for many months now the \nNation's airlines have been doing their utmost to prevent the Congress \nfrom enacting meaningful customer service protections for airline \ntravelers. The airline industry lobbyists have fanned out across the \nNation's capital telling our colleagues that meaningful protections for \nconsumers--such as the right to timely and accurate information--are \ngoing to increase the costs for airline passengers, reduce service, and \nto hear them tell it, it is practically going to bring about the end of \nWestern civilization as we know it.\n  As part of their campaign to prevent the enactment of enforceable \nlegislation to protect the consumer, the airline industry has made a \nhost of voluntary pledges to improve passenger service.\n  Today, I am releasing two reports, one done by the General Accounting \nOffice and the other done by the Congressional Research Service, that \nshow the voluntary pledges made by the airline industry are worth \nlittle more than the paper on which they are written.\n  Let me be specific.\n  After evaluating the airline industry's proposals, it is clear the \nairline industry provides passengers rights in three categories:\n  First, rights that they already have; second, rights that the airline \nindustry is reluctant to write into the legalese that constitute the \ncontract between the airline and the customer; and finally, their \nrights that are ignored altogether.\n  For example, among the several rights airlines refuse to provide is \ndisclosure about overbooking on flights. If you call an airline this \nafternoon and ask about a particular flight and it is overbooked, the \nairline is not required to tell you that before they take your \nmoney. When I and other advocates for the consumer have asked them to \nprovide just this information--we are not calling for a constitutional \nright to a fluffy pillow on an airline flight but just the information \nabout overbooking--the airline industry simply won't follow through. \nThe fact is, the industry's voluntary pledges are gobbledygook.\n\n  To determine if there was any substance to them at all, I asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service to \ncompare the voluntary pledges made by the industry to the hidden but \nactually binding contractual rights the airline passengers have that \nare written into what are called contracts of carriage. The General \nAccounting Office found that of the 16 pledges the airline industry has \nmade to consumers, only 4 are actually provided in the contracts of \ncarriage. Three of them are mandated already by Federal regulation, and \nmost of them are left out altogether, including informing the customers \nof the lowest fare, informing customers about delays, cancellations and \ndiversions, returning checked bags within 24 hours, providing credit \ncard refunds within 7 days, informing the passenger about restrictions \non frequent flier rules, and assigning customer service representatives \nto handle complaints and other problems.\n  Moreover, the airlines are not exactly tripping over themselves to \nrewrite these contracts of carriage, the actual contract that protects \nthe consumer. When General Accounting Office officials contacted the \nairlines to inquire about actually putting teeth into pledge language, \nthe officials at 10 of the major airlines said they were ``considering \nrevisions'' to their contracts of carriage to reflect at least some of \nthe customer service plans. Even more importantly, if the passenger \nwants to know what their actual contractual rights are to these key \nservices, the airlines have made it very difficult for the consumer to \nfind out. The Congressional Research Service points out:\n\n       Frontline airline staff seems uncertain as to just what \n     contracts of carriage are.\n\n  The Service found:\n\n       Even if the consumer knows that they have a right to the \n     information, they must accurately identify the relevant \n     provisions of the contract of carriage or take home the \n     address or phone number, if available, of the airline's \n     consumer affairs department, send for it, and then wait for \n     the contract of carriage to arrive in the mail.\n\n  As the Congressional Research Service puts it, with their usual \ndiplomacy and understatement:\n\n       The airlines do not appear to go out of their way to \n     provide easy access to these contracts of carriage.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will read the actual specifics included in the \nairlines so-called ``customer first'' pledge. What they will see is a \nlot of high sounding rhetoric about improving service to the \npassengers, but the harsh reality is, it is business as usual.\n  Last year, there were an unprecedented number of complaints about \nairline service. Based on the figures I have just obtained for the \nfirst 6 months of this year, there has been another huge increase, in \nfact a doubling, in the number of consumer complaints about passenger \nservice. It is easy to see why, when you examine how hedged and guarded \nthe airline industry is with respect to actually giving consumers \nmeaningful and timely information that will help them make their \nchoices about travel.\n\n  For example, let us look briefly at the pledge to offer the lowest \nfare available on airline flights. What this means is if a consumer \nuses the telephone to call an airline and asks about a specific flight \non a specific date in a specific class, the airline will tell them the \nlowest fare, as they are already required to do. But not only will they \nnot provide you relevant information about lower fares on other flights \non the same airline, they won't even tell you about lower fares that \nare probably available on their web page. The reason why is simple: \nThey have got you when they have you on the telephone, and they will \nsell you the ticket when it is an opportunity to sell it and they can \nmake money on it. But when it is a chance to help the consumer and the \nconsumer can get a break by knowing about other fares available on the \nweb page, there is no disclosure\n  The purchase of an airline ticket today in America is like virtually \nno other consumer choice. Unlike movie theaters that sell tickets to a \nmovie or a sporting goods store that sells soccer balls, the airline \nindustry provides no real assurance that you will be able to use their \nproduct as intended. Movie theaters can't cancel shows because they \ndon't have enough people for a show, but airlines cancel flights when \nthey don't have enough passengers. The sporting goods store can't lure \nyou in with a pledge to give you that soccer ball at an attractive \nprice and then give you a less desirable product at a greater cost \nafter you get there. But the airline industry can do both of those \nthings. They can make arbitrary cancellations. They can lure you in for \na product and, after they have you, not make it available. The fact is, \nthe airline industry is insisting they ought to be outside the basic \nlaws that protect consumers in every other economic field from coast to \ncoast.\n  I conclude by saying that over the next few weeks the Congress is \ngoing to have the chance to right the wrongs spelled out by the \nCongressional Research Service and the General Accounting Office \nstudies that I release today. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to make sure airline passengers across \nthis country get a fair shake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, I have \nappreciated his presentation. It reminds me of the work he has done \nsince he has been in Congress. We served together in the\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\nHouse of Representatives, and the Senator from Oregon was known in the \nHouse as being someone who dealt with substance. The same tradition \nthat he established in the House, is being carried over to the Senate, \nas indicated by his remarks dealing with airline travel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10752-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMERCIALISM OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a great fan of public broadcasting. I \nlisten almost every day to public radio. I am tremendously impressed \nwith programs such as ``Prairie Home Companion'' and all the news \nstories in the morning that are extremely in depth. With public \ntelevision, we all recognize the contributions made by the series on \nthe Civil War, which is a classic and will continue to be in American \ntelevision. The ``MacNeil, Lehrer News Hour,'' which is now the \n``Lehrer News Hour,'' is the most in-depth news coverage that we have \nany place in America. There are many other programs on radio and on \npublic television which I haven't mentioned that are quite good as \nwell.\n  I am struck by the amount of commercials I endure and we all have to \nendure when we listen to public radio and watch public television. In \nmy estimation, it is out of hand. These commercials are technically \ncalled ``enhanced underwriting.'' You can call them whatever you want, \nbut they are commercials.\n  An article appeared a short time ago in the Washington Post entitled \n``Now a Word About Our Sponsor.'' Critics say public radio's on-air \ncredits come too close to being commercials, and, as indicated in that \narticle, they are absolutely right. People are getting more disturbed \nevery day with commercialism of public broadcasting.\n  I point this out because I am not the only one who has noticed the \nincreasing sponsored announcements. According to this article, one \nsurvey shows a 700-percent increase in corporate funding over the past \n5 or 6 years. It is just not listeners who are noticing the change. If \nI were the owner of a private broadcasting station, I would be up in \narms. And some private station owners are tremendously disturbed about \nthe increasing commercialism of this so-called public broadcasting.\n  Private stations aren't tax exempt like public broadcasting stations \nare. The private stations are now voicing their concerns about the \nexisting uneven playing field. I don't want to sound as though I am \nbeating up on public broadcasting because, as I have indicated in my \nopening statement, I really do like public broadcasting. I enjoy the \nprograms on National Public Radio and public television. I believe \npublic broadcasting should remain just that--public. That means we have \nto do a better job with public funding.\n  We can trace very clearly what has happened to public broadcasting. \nNewt Gingrich, and others with whom he associated, came out with the \nbad idea that they wanted to eliminate public broadcasting. This group \nfound that they could not do that. So, in effect, they cut back the \nfunding and they are strangling public broadcasting to death.\n  Mr. President, we need to do the necessary things to make public \nbroadcasting more public in nature. I believe it is time for us to \ndecide whether we want to have a public broadcasting system or whether \nwe don't want to have one. Either we fund the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting so they can exist, or we end it. I prefer the former. \nTherefore, when the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education marks up its bill--and I am a member of that \nsubcommittee--I plan to offer an amendment to increase the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting appropriation to $475 million. This is $125 \nmillion more than their request. However, I also plan to include report \nlanguage that would encourage public radio and television to scale back \ntheir so-called enhanced underwriting practices and to become, once \nagain, a public broadcasting system that is publicly funded.\n  As long as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is leery of \nCongress cutting their funds or doing away with Federal funds \naltogether, they will begin to sound more and more like private \nbroadcasting stations. The people who run those stations don't like it. \nYou have people, as indicated in the Post article that I referred to \nearlier, who are continually talking about how difficult it is and how \nunfair it is. In this article, the author cites Bob Edwards from the \nNPR Morning Edition, which is a very fine program for news in the \nmorning. He says:\n\n       Underwriting has kept us alive, but there's also a \n     downside. It has cut into our air time. If you have to read a \n     30-second underwriting credit [a commercial], that's less \n     news you can do.\n\n  So as I stated, we have to either make public broadcasting public or \ndo away with it. If we continue the road we are going on, we are going \nto wind up having public broadcasting in name only, and it is going to \nbe unfair that they are competing with the private stations, in which \nwe have people who have invested a lot of money, trying to make money \non an uneven playing field because of the protections public \nbroadcasting have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10752-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10752-S10753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       A DEMOCRATIC PLAN WITH WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN AGREE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had some good news last week when the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, indicated that if the President vetoed \nthe $800 billion Republican tax plan, that would be the end of it.\n  That is good news for the American public on the $800 billion attempt \nto cut taxes in this country because, in fact, it really wasn't a tax \ncutting measure. It was something that would give no immediate relief \nto the American taxpayer. There was relief in the outyears. In fact, \nwhat it would have done is prevent us from directing moneys toward the \ndebt, and the debt of $5 trillion is something we need to address.\n  If the national debt were lowered, it would be a tax cut for \neveryone, rich and poor. We pay hundreds of millions of dollars every \nyear in interest on that debt. If we lower that, it will be good for \neveryone. We are not going to continue to live in this great economy \nwhere everything is looking good, forever. Hard times may lie ahead, \nand I think we will rue the day we didn't use these good times to pay \ndown that debt.\n\n  This massive tax package that was passed on a very partisan basis, \nand then withheld from the American public during the August break so \nthere could be a public relations effort to have the American people \naccept this tax cut, never materialized. The American people would not \naccept it because it was not acceptable on its face. They realized \nthere was no meaningful tax relief in this package. It was more of a \npublic relations ploy. The fact is that there should have been more \nattention focused on paying down the debt and protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We must pay down the debt. That would be a tax \ncut for everyone.\n  We must protect Social Security. The majority touted the Social \nSecurity lockbox in conjunction with the tax cut. But the Republican \nlockbox fails to extend the solvency in the Social Security trust fund \nby a single day, and it includes, in this so-called lockbox, a \ntrapdoor, a loophole, that would allow Republicans to label anything \nSocial Security reform and to raid the Social Security trust fund. \nFinally, the Republican lockbox does nothing to protect Medicare.\n  So by proposing targeted tax cuts toward working families, the \nminority believes our Democratic plan is able to prioritize paying down \nthe debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare while still \nproviding almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts.\n  What would those cuts do? They would increase the standard deduction \nfor all individuals and married couples. They would provide marriage \npenalty relief for those taxpayers who pay more as married couples than \nthey would if they were to file their taxes as two single individuals. \nThey would provide for a long-term-care tax credit to make it easier to \ncare for elderly family members. They would provide for a 100-percent \ndeduction for health insurance costs of the self-employed and include \ntax incentives to build and modernize more than 6,000 schools. That is \nimportant.\n  Clark County, Las Vegas, NV, has the eighth-largest school district \nin America, with over 200,000 schoolchildren. We are having to build \nover a dozen new schools every year. In one year\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\n--and we hold the record--we dedicated 18 new schools in Clark County. \nWe have to build one new elementary school every month to keep up with \nthe growth in Clark County. We need some help to do that. The \nDemocratic tax plan would give us some of that needed help.\n  Also, one of the things we have talked about, which is so important, \nis a tax credit for research and development for high-tech companies. \nThat is part of the Democratic tax plan--something we hope the majority \nleader and others will take a look at and be willing to compromise on. \nDemocrats have been out in front on the issue for a long time. We \npushed hard for a permanent R & D tax credit. The majority talked about \nhow they were in favor of a permanent credit as well, until it came \ntime to actually do it. In the end, the minority, myself included, were \npushing for a ten year R & D tax credit. The majority ended up only \ncommitting to a five year tax credit in their package. Due in large \npart to initiatives like the R & D tax credit, the high-tech industry \nexists and has flourished. Without knowing whether or not that tax \ncredit will be around next year or the year after or the year after \nthat, hinders these companies' long term planning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10753-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ATHLETICS IN NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in Nevada we are very proud of a number of \nthings. We have a beautiful State. We are the most mountainous State in \nthe Union, except for Alaska, with over 300 separate mountain ranges, \nwith 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. Las Vegas, of course, is the \nentertainment capital of the world.\n  We are very proud of our universities for a number of reasons. We \nhave a great engineering program at the University of Nevada, Reno. The \nMackay School of Mines is there, and we are proud of that as well. We \nhave a great school for biological sciences, which has a national \nreputation. At UNLV, we have the finest hotel administration program in \nthe entire country. The universities in Nevada are very proud of the \nfootball teams that we had in the forties and fifties. Since the \nschools have been divided, UNR has been a power in division II \nfootball, and they have played for the national championship. They are \nnow a division I team. UNLV has won national championships in \nbasketball. The UNLV football team has had some bad years, losing \ndozens of games. Last year they didn't win a single game, but this year \nthey were able to beat North Texas State in their first away game.\n  A week ago last Thursday and then this past Saturday, they played \nBaylor. Even though Baylor was favored by a couple of touchdowns, one \nof the most miraculous wins in the history of football at the \nprofessional or college level occurred when Baylor was ahead by four \npoints with less than 10 seconds left. They had the ball inside the 10-\nyard line of UNLV. Rather than take their four-point victory, they \nwanted to run the score up a little bit and go for a touchdown. In the \nend zone there was a fumble picked up by a UNLV defensive back who ran \n101 yards for the touchdown and beat Baylor with no time left on the \nclock. This was tremendous.\n  People are going to be very happy with their new football couch, John \nRobinson, who had a great career before coming to UNLV from the \nUniversity of Southern California and, of course, coaching the Los \nAngeles Rams.\n  We offer our congratulations to John Robinson and UNLV for two \nvictories, which is two more than they had during all of last year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10753-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10753-S10754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO ANDRE AGASSI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the main reason I wanted to talk about \nathletics in Nevada is not because of the team victories that we have \nhad over the years in Nevada but because of a great young man who was \nborn and raised in Nevada who has been part of the Nevada athletic \nscene for some 25 years, even though he is only 29 years old.\n  Andre Agassi and his family have been great for the State of Nevada. \nAndre, when he was a little boy still in elementary school, it was said \nby Poncho Gonzales, who was a tennis great. ``He will be better than I \nsomeday.'' This is when he was a little, tiny boy. Poncho Gonzales was \nright.\n  Andre Agassi has already proven himself to be even greater than the \ngreat Poncho Gonzales. This was certainly the case as proven yesterday \nwhen he won the U.S. Open Tennis Championship.\n  I want to, on the Senate floor, congratulate Andre Agassi on this \nremarkable comeback yesterday in the U.S. Open and, of course, his \ncomeback victory in the French Open.\n  Andre, as I have indicated, is a native of Las Vegas and dominated \nthis summer with 35 victories in 39 matches. That is almost unheard of.\n  Andre Agassi is the No. 1 ranked tennis player in the United States. \nNot too long ago, because of an injury and other problems, Andre Agassi \nwas ranked 141. He is now ranked the best tennis player in the world, \nas he should be.\n  I was watching the tennis matches over the weekend. John McEnroe, one \nof the great tennis players of all time, commenting about Andre Agassi, \nsaid his ability to return service is the best there has ever been in \nthe entire history of tennis. His reputation and his abilities are \nstill being proven. He is getting better with every match he plays.\n  But yesterday he closed out one of the greatest summers in tennis \nhistory. He came up with some of the most impressive shots ever seen in \ntennis in a dominating fifth set to capture his second U.S. Open.\n  Andre has made his place in tennis history. When he won the French \nOpen, he joined Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Don Budge, and Fred Perry as \nthe only men to win all four major tournaments in their career.\n  Andre not only won the French and the U.S. Opens this year, he was \nalso in the finals at Wimbledon, making him the first man since Ivan \nLendl in 1986 to have gone to three grand slam finals in the same year.\n  No man had fought back to win the U.S. Open from a 2-1 deficit in \nsets since John Newcombe did it 26 years ago. But that is exactly what \nAgassi did in a 3-hour and 23-minute match yesterday.\n  The match was only the fifth all-American men's final at the U.S. \nOpen in 32 years. The matchup of these two men who are almost 30-years-\nold, was the oldest since 39-year-old Ken Rosewall lost to 22-year-old \nJimmy Connors in 1974. Even though these two men had not reached the \nage of 30, they played great tennis. They will be talked about as being \nold men at tennis, I repeat, even though they were not even 30 years \nold yet. They set a great example for tennis generally and for American \ntennis in particular.\n\n  I have to agree with Andre when after the match he said, ``I'll tell \nyou what. How can you ask for anything more than two Americans in the \nfinal of the U.S. Open playing a great five-set match?''\n  Andre turned pro when he was 16 years old. We can all remember--I \nshouldn't say ``we can all'' because that was 13 or 14 years ago--a lot \nof us can remember when he turned pro. In those 13 or 14 years, he has \nchanged. He won Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and was the \nNo. 1 player in the world by 1995.\n  But by 1997, Andre had, as I have indicated, come across some tough \ntimes. But he has fought back remarkably well. He finished sixth in the \nworld last year. Earlier this year, he was ranked No. 1. He is now No. \n1 again.\n  In a period of 4 months, he won the French Open--coming back from two \nsets down in the final--reached the Wimbledon final, and won the U.S. \nOpen, a truly phenomenal comeback.\n  Andre deserves to be congratulated not only for his tremendous \ntennis, but for all the great work he does for at-risk youth in Las \nVegas. He truly has put his money where his mouth is.\n  The Agassi Foundation has helped poor kids in Nevada. That is an \nunderstatement. He personally raises millions of dollars. He is going \nto have an event this month. He has gotten some of his friends to come \nfrom Las Vegas. He will raise $3 million at that event, all of which \nwill go into his foundation to help the youth of Las Vegas.\n  His exhibition against Todd Martin yesterday was exciting. Todd \nMartin is a great champion in his own right. His towering stature of 6-\nfoot-6 was as towering on the tennis court. These two men were \ninterviewed after the tennis\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nmatch, and that should certainly be an inspiration to all young people \nwho want to compete because as winner and loser, they both talked as \nwinners and indicated how important it was that they were able to \nrepresent the United States at the U.S. Open.\n  Andre Agassi is good on the court and off the court with the \ntremendous work he has done with the Andre Agassi Foundation. He has \nhelped the youth of Las Vegas by giving them a helping hand in growing \nup to be successful individuals. His foundation even branched out to a \nprogram to help women and children who have become victims of domestic \nabuse.\n  Today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate a great \nAmerican, Andre Agassi, someone who will go down in the annals of \nhistory as a great athlete and who will go down in the annals of \nhistory in the State of Nevada as a good person. Andre Agassi is \nsomeone who is willing to help those who certainly aren't as fortunate \nas he.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRAIG. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment with my \ncolleague from Illinois and my colleague from Oregon that is a win-win \nfor the American taxpayer and the environment.\n  Our amendment reduces the subsidy for the below-cost timber program \nadministered by the Forest Service and for the construction of logging \nroads in our national forests.\n  In addition, our amendment reallocates needed monies to those Forest \nService programs underfunded by the committee, such as road \nmaintenance, wildlife and fish habitat management, and threatened and \nendangered species habitat management.\n  Each year, the American taxpayers spend millions of dollars to \nsubsidize the construction of roads needed for logging on national \nforest lands.\n  The appropriations bill before us today contains over $37 million for \nthe Forest Service to assist in the construction and reconstruction of \ntimber roads in our national forests. This assistance is in the form of \ncontract administration, construction oversight, and engineering, \nplanning, and design work performed by the Forest Service for the \nlogging companies which are merely left with the task of building the \nroads to extract the timber.\n  Our amendment would reduce this subsidy by a modest amount, $1.6 \nmillion, which is the amount the program was increased above the \nadministration's budget request.\n  Similarly, this bill contains $228.9 million for the administration \nof the timber sale program, which is more than $32 million above the \nadministration's budget request.\n  These expenditures for a money losing timber program are an enormous \ndrain on the Treasury.\n  In their most recent Forest Management Program Annual Report, dated \nJuly 1998, the Forest Service acknowledges losing $88.6 million from \ntheir timber program in fiscal year 1997.\n  This was the second consecutive year that the Forest Service reported \na loss.\n  In addition to the reported loss, the $88.6 million figure excludes a \nfull accounting of all costs associated with logging.\n  In past fiscal years, independent analyses estimate the loss from \nbelow-cost timber sales are far greater than those reported by the \nForest Service.\n  The General Accounting Office estimated that the timber program cost\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\ntaxpayers at least $1.5 billion from 1992 to 1997.\n  Our amendment would reduce funding for timber sale management by \n$32.015 million to the level requested by the administration.\n  In spite of the fact that our National Forests supply a mere 4 \npercent of our nation's annual timber harvest, this bill continues to \nreflect the dominance of the timber program at the expense of other \nprograms designed to improve forest health and enhance the public's \nenjoyment of our national forests.\n  More than 380,000 miles of roads criss-cross the national forests. \nThis is a more extensive road network than the National Interstate \nHighway System.\n  The Forest Service estimates that over 80% of these roads are not \nmaintained to public safety and environmental standards.\n  As a matter of public policy, I would argue that it makes more sense \nto maintain the roads we already have than to spend money building new \nroads we don't need.\n  Many scientists have found that road building threatens wildlife \nbecause it causes erosion of soils, fragments intact forest ecosystems, \nencourages the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species, and \nreduces habitat for many animals needing refuge from man.\n  It has been found that when roads wash out they dump rocks and soil \non lower slopes and into streambeds, and even when they remain intact, \nroads act as channels for water and contribute further to the erosion \nof lands and streams.\n  Scientists say that the overall effect is that the streams and rivers \nfill with silt and the shallower waters mean degraded fish habitat and \nmore flooding.\n  In my home state of Nevada, the road network throughout the Lake \nTahoe basin has been identified as a major contributor to the \ndegradation of water quality and decline in clarity of Lake Tahoe.\n  An important component of the Forest Service's road maintenance \nprogram involves the decommissioning of old logging roads.\n  This program has been essential to efforts in the Lake Tahoe basin to \nimprove erosion control and the overall water quality of the lake.\n  The bill before us today cuts the administration's request for road \nmaintenance by $11.3 million.\n  The Forest Service has indicated that their annual road maintenance \nneeds total $431 million per year, and that their backlog for deferred \nmaintenance totals $3.85 billion.\n  The bill before us today provides less than a quarter of the funding \nthe Forest Service requires to address their annual road maintenance \nneeds.\n  Addressing this need would have considerable environmental benefits, \nsuch as reducing erosion from roads and storm proofing existing \nculverts.\n  It is important to remember that the timber industry's responsibility \nfor maintaining logging roads ends with the end of the timber sale, \nleaving all future maintenance costs to the taxpayer.\n  Our amendment adds $5.3 million for important road maintenance \nprojects throughout our national forests.\n  The National Forests include nearly 200,000 miles of fishable streams \nand more than 2 million acres of lakes, ponds and reservoirs that \nsupport hundreds of inland fish species with important recreational, \ncommercial, and ecological values.\n  The inland fisheries habitat management program allows the Forest \nService to protect and restore inland streams and lakes, along with the \nfish and aquatic life they support.\n  The bill before us today cuts the administration's request for this \nprogram by $7 million.\n  Our amendment proposes to restore $3.115 million in funding for this \nprogram.\n  This additional funding would allow the Forest Service to enhance or \nrestore several hundred miles of stream and over 400 additional acres \nof ponds, lakes, and reservoirs.\n  The National Forests also provide critical spawning and rearing \nhabitat for Pacific, Great Lakes, and Atlantic stocks of anadromous \nfish, such as salmon, sturgeons, and lampreys.\n  These stocks contribute significantly to the quality of life, \nrecreational and commercial fishing, and the economy of local \ncommunities.\n  The Interior bill cuts the administration's funding request for \nanadromous fisheries habitat management by $6.4 million.\n  Our amendment proposes to restore $1.6 million for this program.\n  This funding will enable the Forest Service to complete critical work \non over 100 additional miles of anadromous streams and 1,000 acres of \nadditional acres of anadromous lakes and reservoirs, complementing the \nefforts of our state, federal, and tribal partners.\n  The wildlife habitat management program of the Forest Service for \nfiscal year 2000 will focus on prescribed burns to improve wildlife \nhabitat.\n  It will help to develop and protect wetlands and water sources in \narid habitats for waterfowl, quail, and wild turkey, in addition to \nrestoring riparian habitat that benefits big game.\n  The subcommittee cut $5 million from the wildlife program.\n  Our amendment would restore $1.6 million in funding for this program.\n  This funding would provide for an additional 8,000 acres of important \nhabitat improvement, which would benefit both game and nongame species, \nand result in enhanced opportunities for wildlife-related recreation.\n  The activities of the threatened, endangered, and sensitive species \nprogram serve to achieve recovery goals for threatened and endangered \nanimals and plants.\n  The Forest Service has indicated that this program continues to be \nessential to the mission of their agency.\n  The committee cut the endangered species program by $5 million.\n  Our amendment would restore $2 million for this program, which would \nallow the Forest Service to pursue conservation strategies to prevent \nthe need for listing, thereby avoiding the loss of management \nflexibility and increased operating costs once listing occurs.\n   Mr. President, the $20 million our amendment adds to wildlife, \nfisheries, and rare plant habitat management programs would enable the \nForest Service to increase Challenge Cost-Share partnerships with \norganizations throughout the country, enabling the agency to leverage \nfunding, better serve the public, and improve vital habitats for fish \nand wildlife.\n  This funding is an investment for the nation's 63 million wildlife \nwatchers, 14 million hunters, and 35 million anglers who spend \napproximately 127.6 million activity days hunting, fishing, and \nobserving fish and wildlife annually on national forests.\n  This result in local community expenditures of billions of dollars \nand over 230,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\n  One out of every three anglers fish national forest waters \nnationally, and two out of three anglers in the West fish national \nforest waters.\n  That is why our amendment is supported by groups like Trout \nUnlimited, the American Sportfishing Association, and Wildlife Forever.\n   Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to join a strong coalition \nof environmental, hunting, fishing, and taxpayer organizations in \nsupport of the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, I note that my colleague, one of the prime \nsponsors of the amendment, has joined us on the floor. I yield the \nfloor at this point.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Nevada for all his effort in working with me and other colleagues \nfrom the Pacific Northwest on this issue. Folks in your part of the \nUnited States want to be sensitive to environmental values and economic \nneeds in our communities. As a result of recent court decisions and \nother problems, instead of that win-win, we have essentially had a \nlose-lose, where we are not doing what is needed to protect \nenvironmental values; nor are we doing what is needed to protect \ncommunities--particularly rural communities--that have very legitimate \neconomic concerns as a result of having resource-dependent economies.\n  The Senator from Nevada has been working with us. I will begin my \nremarks by saying what we are trying to do in the Bryan-Fitzgerald-\nWyden amendment is incorporate some of the thinking that has been \nbehind what the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gorton, has \ntalked about on the floor and some of what Senator Robb tried to do \nlast week with respect to environmental values. I think if you look at \nthe Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, you will see, to some degree, \nefforts to try to reconcile some of the important points that Senator \nGorton has made and the important points Senator Robb has made that are \nbrought together in our amendment so we can take advantage of an \nopportunity to both improve the environment and move timber more \nquickly from the forests to the mills.\n  When President Clinton took office in 1993, he came to the Pacific \nNorthwest with a promise to help resolve the battle over owls and old \ngrowth. The administration put in place the Northwest Forest Plan which \npromised protection for my State's ancient forests, and also \nsustainable forestry for a State that has long been dependent in rural \ncommunities on forestry for family wage jobs.\n  Over the past few months, the plan, which has already been failing to \ndeliver what it promised, threatened to come completely undone when a \nFederal judge ruled that the Forest Service had failed to conduct \nbiological surveys--an obligation known as survey and management--as \nrequired under the court-approved Northwest Forest Plan.\n  Later this week, in the Forestry Subcommittee, chaired by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Craig, we are going to talk about who exactly is \nto blame for that fiasco. But today, we in the Pacific Northwest are \nleft with dozens of suspended timber sales as a result of the Forest \nService's failure to follow through on environmental protection \nobligations.\n  The Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment would earmark resources for this \ncostly environmental work and place a stringent timetable on the \ncompletion of the surveys' environmental impact statement. Thus, by \nmaking sure these environmental surveys get done, and done quickly, we \nwill help both the environment and timber workers do well.\n  Building on the philosophy that we heard from Senator Gorton, that \nthe program has not worked very well, and what we heard from Senator \nRobb about the importance of environmental values, what Senator Bryan, \nSenator Fitzgerald, and I are trying to do is incorporate some of the \nthinking behind both of those approaches so we can try to put this \nsurvey and management program on track but also bring to it some of the \naccountability that Senators Gorton and Craig are absolutely right in \nsaying has been lacking in the past.\n\n  I have shared, as I say, many of the concerns of the manager of the \nbill. But I don't think we can simply waive survey and management \nrequirements altogether because what will happen is that will lead to a \nfull employment program for lawyers if it were adopted and, even if in \nthe short term, very serious problems because the bill would be vetoed \nby the President if section 329 survived conference in its present \nform.\n  In August of this year, right after the first Northwest Forest Plan \ntimber sales were enjoined, Senator Murray and I sent a letter to Under \nSecretary Lyons asking that the Forest Service and BLM meet with our \noffices to discuss how and why the survey and management requirements \nwere stopping the Northwest Forest Timber Program and what could be \ndone about it.\n  Initially, in the August meeting between agency staff and the \ncongressional staff, held both in D.C. and in my hometown of Portland, \nthe Forest Service stated that $10 million more funding for personnel \nand addressing the scientific issues was necessary in order to get the \nsurvey and management program back on track. So let's be clear; the \nsurvey and management program is an unparalleled undertaking. It is \ngoing to provide new scientific protocols and data that can be useful \nin forests across the country. But it has to be done in a way that \naddresses the legitimate issues with respect to accountability that our \ncolleague from Washington State, Senator Gorton, and Senator Craig of \nIdaho have addressed on this floor.\n  So the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment directs $10 million for \nsurvey and management requirements to help the Forest Service conduct \nsurveys on judicially stalled timber sales for species with known \nsurvey protocols. It will help the Service create protocols for the \nspecies currently lacking such data. This money starts us toward \ncompletion of the environmental scientific work that is necessary to \nmove timber sales toward harvest.\n  During the August meetings, the Forest Service was initially \noptimistic about the time it would take them to complete the \nenvironmental impact statements which they believe will answer the \nquestions with respect to the success of the Northwest Forest Plan. At \nfirst, the Forest Service told me in a draft response to the letter \nSenator Murray and I sent them that the environmental impact statement, \ndraft statement, would be completed this fall, and that the final would \nbe ready early next year. Now the Forest Service is telling us that the \ndraft will be available for public comment by December and perhaps the \nfinal environmental impact statement will be ready in May or June of \nnext year. They have not given us any indication, other than overlap of \nthis work with the holidays, why the timing of the work had to change.\n  The Forest Service has been working on this project since 1997 and \nknew since 1994 that the survey and management requirement was coming \ndown the pike. I certainly wasn't one who succeeded in getting his \nhomework always done on time, but the Forest Service's timetable \nreflects extraordinarily poor planning, by any calculus.\n  It is time for some accountability. We are going to have a chance to \ndiscuss those accountability issues later this week. I note the \nchairman of the Forestry Subcommittee has arrived. He knows I share \nmany of his concerns about the lack of accountability with respect to \nthe Forest Service on survey and management, and in other key areas.\n  The Forest Service needs administrative deadlines to move this \nprocess along. They need to make this environmental impact statement a \npriority and get it done. The Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment states \nthe survey and management draft environmental impact statement should \nbe completed\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\nby November 15 of this year, and the final version of that impact \nstatement should be published by February 14, 2000.\n  Those deadlines also allow for the public a comment period required \nby law, plus some additional time for open and public discussion.\n  This administration for years has been promising Congress they will \nget to work on the Northwest Forest Plan. The time for those empty \npromises is over. This administration needs some direction, and they \nneed the extra money to achieve it.\n  Finally, let me reiterate what I think the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden \namendment does. I say this to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It \nincorporates much of the important analysis done by Senator Gorton and \nSenator Craig with respect to why the survey and management program has \nnot worked and why the administration has dragged its feet on it while \nat the same time trying to incorporate the environmental concerns \nSenator Robb has legitimately addressed to ensure this program gets \ncarried out.\n  Under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, we would add the money \nnecessary to carry it out. But we would finally have some real \naccountability and some real deadlines to make sure these important \nobligations, both in terms of environmental protection and in terms of \nmeeting economic needs of rural communities, are addressed.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides will support it. If we adopt this \namendment, I believe the end result will be healthier forests and a \nhealthier timber economy.\n  I, again, thank my colleague from Nevada for all of his assistance. I \nknow my colleagues from Idaho and Washington as members of our Senate \ndelegation from the Northwest have strong views on this as well. The \nSenator from Idaho knows how much I enjoy working with him. We are \ngetting ready to go forward with our accounting payment legislation \nwhich gives us a chance to break some gridlock in that area. I am \nhopeful as we go forward on this important Interior bill we can also \nbreak the gridlock with respect to survey management and have \nadditional funds that are needed but also additional accountability. \nThat is why I am hopeful my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, as we debate the Interior appropriations \nbill--and now the amendment and the substitute amendment offered by \nSenators Bryan and Wyden--I guess I can say at the outset that the only \nthing I arrive at in trying to consider a $34 million cut in a very \nessential program to the U.S. Forest Service, especially when the \nadvocacy of the cut comes from the two Senators from large public land \nWestern States such as Nevada and Oregon, is ``frustration'' over the \nlack of understanding by a Senator from Nevada who is responsible for \nrepresenting his State which is predominately a public lands State \nwhere grazing on public lands and mining the natural resources from \nthose public lands are two of the primary economies of that State, that \nhe would not be supportive of programs within the U.S. Forest Service \nthat deal with public land resources in an appropriate and responsible \nway.\n  I say that before I get to the specific issues of the amendment \nbecause I find it fascinating that in a publication called ``Public \nLands Forests, What We Get, What We Pay For''--an interesting \npublication from the Political Economy Research Center which deals with \nthe subject that the Senator from Nevada knows a great deal about, and \nin fact knows a great deal more about than I do as the chairman of the \nForestry Subcommittee. That the Tahoe Basin, a beautiful and unique \narea in his State that is being dramatically impacted at this moment by \na lack of forest management in a responsible way as we begin to see a \nrelatively affluent urban interface grow around Lake Tahoe and into a \nforest that is dramatically different than what it was 40, 50, or 100 \nyears ago.\n  Let me quote from this article. I am trying to set a tone for my \nfrustration over why the Senator from Nevada is doing what he is doing \nand the Senator from Oregon would join with him. Let me quote from this \npublication, and the title to the article is called ``One Spark From \nDisaster.''\n  I quote:\n\n       As the road dropped out of the Sierras into the Lake Tahoe \n     basin below, the scenery made an abrupt change from healthy, \n     green forests to dead and dying stands of timber. The \n     congressmen on their way to the June 1997 Presidential Summit \n     on the problems facing the lake and surrounding basin were \n     taken aback by what they saw. Later, during a session on \n     forest health, U.S. Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada \n     exclaimed, ``This fores looks like hell!'' It appeared as if \n     someone had drawn an imaginary line across the landscape and \n     then nurtured the trees on one side, while destroying those \n     on the other.\n\n  What the Senator was experiencing was what many are now experiencing \non a Forest Service landscape across our Nation where we have \nconstantly put out fires over the last 75 to 100 years and have not \ngone in and done selective logging or fuel reduction on our forest \nfloors. We have literally created jungles--jungles that some would like \nto portray as beautiful, sweeping landscaped timbered vistas when it is \nquite obvious they are jungles that in the right environment--and the \nTahoe Basin gets that environment every so often--could explode into \ntotal disaster of the landscape by the kinds of fires California has \nexperienced this year and as have other parts of the country. Those of \nus more to the North in the Pacific Northwest have been fortunate \nenough this year in that our relatively unmanaged forests--and \nmismanaged in some instances--have been wet enough that we haven't had \nthe fire threat.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Ironically, forest management practices on surrounding \n     federal lands have put at risk the very qualities they were \n     supposed to preserve: the integrity of the forest and the \n     clarity of the lake below--\n\n  Talking about the beautiful Lake Tahoe--\n\n       Environmental regulations have delayed some management \n     actions and restricted timber harvests for forest treatments.\n\n  It has resulted, of course, in the situation that I described around \nthe Tahoe Basin.\n  Of course, the reason the Senators from Nevada are appropriately \nconcerned about the Tahoe Basin is not timber production per se because \nI don't think you would view the Tahoe Basin as being an area where you \nwould expect timber production, but it is the recent interfacing of \nresort homes--summer homes, many of them going in the millions of \ndollars--that use Lake Tahoe and find Lake Tahoe to be a marvelous \nplace to live and, of course, coupled with the thousands of tourists \nwho come there on an annual basis to see this tremendously beautiful \nhigh mountain alpine lake.\n  Why, then, would a Senator from Nevada want to cut a program where \nthe money is utilized to do the necessary surveys and the preparations \nfor the kind of fuel unloading or fuel decreases that Tahoe Basin would \nneed because most of our timber sales are no longer green sales, they \nare sales of dead and dying timber. They are sales that are a product \nof forest health and not an ongoing aggressive timber program of the \nkind that brought the environmental outcry of a decade or two ago.\n  I must say the Senator from Oregon has a bit of a different \ncircumstance. He and I joined ranks on the floor last week on a very \ncritical issue. As you know, when this administration came to town a \nfew years ago, they were faced with the situation of a timber industry \nimploding in the State of Oregon, imploding as a result of a spotted \nowl decision that took a tremendous amount of the timbered landscape of \nthat State--both Forest Service and BLM timber--off the table, or at \nleast had locked it all up in the courts.\n  This President, with the right intention--with the right intention--\nwent out to try to solve the problem and basically said: Let me reduce \nyour cut by 80 percent and for the other 20 percent remaining, or \nsomething near that, we will focus all of our intent there, all of our \nenergy, and do the finest environmental assessment possible, and that \nyou will be able to log.\n  We know the court decisions have gone well beyond the intent of the \nEndangered Species Act--reasonable and right surveys--and basically \neven stopped all of that logging.\n  I can understand why the Senator would want to try to divert money to \nsolve his problem. But he also probably\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\nfails to recognize that, in that diversion, he is affecting timber \nsales or timber management programs everywhere else in the country \nbecause while he is supporting taking 34 million dollars out of that \nsales and preparation base and putting some of it over into surveys, he \nis denying the States of Arkansas, Idaho, and others the very resources \nthey need to keep their people working and to keep an industry that is \nnow staggering to stay alive on its feet.\n\n  That is what brings Members to this point. Yes, we come to the floor \nnow after having dramatically reduced these programs in the name of the \nenvironment--and in many instances appropriate reductions--and say we \nhave to notch them down even more.\n  For the next few moments I will talk about the adverse effects on \nrural communities and jobs that the Bryan-Wyden substitute will have. \nThat substitute takes money away from the program that supports good \nfamily jobs. I am talking about good-paying jobs. The two Senators plan \nto redirect funds out of the timber program into wildlife surveys and \nroad maintenance, which I think will be counterproductive because we \nare already putting millions of dollars into that program.\n  For me to oppose their amendment does not mean we oppose the surveys. \nWe know we have ramped up the amount of money that goes into those \nsurveys and, of course, in ramping up the surveys, added costs to every \ntimber sale. Then the Senator from Nevada can come to the floor and \ntalk about these timber sales being too expensive and we ought to \neliminate them. The reason they are expensive is that the court and \nsome in the environmental community are demanding the money be \ntransferred over to do the surveys.\n  It is a Catch-22. We shove these costs off on to the price of a \ntimber sale. We escalate it to the point it is not a cost-effective \ntimber sale. Therefore, we give some Senators a basis to come to the \nfloor and argue we ought to eliminate them because we can't make money \nat them when, in fact, the politics have pushed the cost of the surveys \nwell beyond what would be reasonable, appropriate, and responsible, for \nthe purpose of cutting those trees. That is the ultimate Catch-22 in \nforest management today that has nearly laid the State of Oregon low \nand has dramatically impacted the State of Idaho.\n  Regarding the timber funding and the Forest Service that prepares the \nadministrative forest activities, the committee already has an \nappropriate amount for wildlife and for road funding. Redirecting \nfunds, as I have said, will harm the timber program. It will not be \nconsequence free. It will cost jobs in Arkansas, in Idaho. It could \ncost jobs in other forested States across the Nation where there \nremains a struggling timber program.\n  The President traveled this summer to several sections of the country \nsuffering from poverty. I applaud him for dramatizing where poverty \nstill exists in a country today that is nearly at full employment. It \nis almost ironic that in nearly the same breath it could be said that \nwe are at full employment yet we have in certain areas high degrees of \npoverty. Most of that poverty exists in rural areas today. Most of that \npoverty exists in rural areas where those communities of working men \nand women are tied directly to the public lands and tied to the \nresources of those public lands.\n  Nearly one-third of the counties adjacent to national forests suffer \npoverty levels that are at least one and a half times higher than the \nnational average. Let me refer to a fascinating chart that comes from \nthe U.S. Forest Service's TSPIRS employment figures.\n\n  I refer to the solid bars on this chart showing employment from the \nharvesting and processing of national forest timber between 1989 and \n1997--just over a few years--has dropped from 140,000 working men and \nwomen to 55,500. Let me repeat that. That is more dramatic than any \nother employment sector in our country, except in the making of buggies \nand buggy whips, and no young person on this floor even knows what I am \ntalking about because that industry died a long time ago. In a decade \nwe have lost from a 140,000 high down to 55,000 jobs for working men \nand women. The Senator from Nevada wants to take that down even further \nby the action he proposes today.\n  I am not quite sure I understand why, but let me show the very real \nimpact. I am tremendously familiar with this because not only in my \nlifetime but in my tenure in the Congress, from when I started serving \nin 1981 until today, what I speak of has happened. I have watched it \nhappen. I have been to the locations. I went to Grangeville, ID. I \nwatched grown men sit on stacks of lumber and cry, literally, tears \nrolling down their cheeks because there were no more trees to cut under \nthe Federal forest plan and they had lost their job. The mill was going \nto be unbolted, placed in shipping containers, and sent to Brazil to \ncut the rain forests because the environmentalists decided that the Nez \nPerce Forest in Idaho was no longer producing trees--although it was \ngrowing 10 times more trees than it was cutting.\n  What happened? Here are the very dramatic figures from a tremendously \nnarrow period of time. The State of Washington, 1989 to today, 55 mills \nclosed and the loss of 3,285 jobs; Oregon, 111 mills closed and the \nloss of 11,600 jobs; Montana, 13 mills closed and 1,083 jobs lost; \nIdaho, 17 mills and 707 jobs lost.\n  Let me talk about Midvale, ID, my hometown. If I am a little \nsensitive today, I should be. I used to go to that mill and buy lumber. \nIt employed 45 men. The attitude on the floor is: What is the big deal? \nIt is only 45 jobs. But it was 45 jobs and 45 homes in a community of \n300 people--not 30,000, not 50,000, not 100,000, but a community of 300 \npeople. To lose 45 jobs is to lose a lot. That mill has closed. Why? \nBecause on the Payette National Forest, argumentatively, at least by \nnational forest standards, there were no more trees to cut.\n  That is why I can responsibly and legitimately turn to the Senator \nfrom Nevada today and say: Senator, your bill destroys jobs. Your bill \ndestroys high-paying jobs, $35,000, $45,000, $55,000-a-year jobs for \nmen and women, important jobs in rural communities, in Idaho, Oregon, \nWashington, California, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alaska.\n  In talking of mill closures--and I referred to the dramatic numbers--\nlet me also quote the Western Council of Industry Workers, the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. It is their people, \nin many instances, who are losing these jobs. They say:\n\n       Legislative efforts to reduce funding for forest management \n     programs seriously jeopardize the livelihoods of our members \n     and tens of thousands of forest products workers nationwide. \n     Job loss within our industry has been severe, as the timber \n     sales program has been reduced by 70 percent since the early \n     90s.\n\n  A 70-percent reduction in the timber program, a reduction in jobs \nfrom 140,000 to 55,000, and the Senator from Nevada wants to cut it \neven deeper. It is pretty hard to understand why, especially when you \nlook at the new environmental standards of today and what the Forest \nService is demanding of a timber sale as it relates to the survey and \nthe kind of mitigation plan that comes because of the Clean Water Act \nand the Clean Air Act and, of course, the National Environmental Policy \nAct and the Endangered Species Act and all of those kinds of rules and \nregulations and processes and procedures that by law are required. I am \nnot sure I understand why.\n\n  I do know several years ago the National Sierra Club developed as one \nof their policies, zero cut on public lands. I know that is what they \nbelieve. I know that is what they advocate. I know they are champions \nof this kind of amendment because if you cannot stop logging \naltogether, you stop it a little bit at a time until it is all gone, \neven if the health of the forests are at the point of explosion from \nwildfires like those being experienced in California today, and even if \nthe Tahoe Basin runs at a high risk, with the risk not just to the \ntrees but the loss of hundreds of multimillion-dollar homes where the \nwealthy come to play and reside in the urban/rural interface. That is \nthe issue at hand.\n  I will go on to quote from those men and women who work in the \nindustry. They say:\n\n       More than 80,000 men and women have lost their jobs as that \n     timber program has reduced by more than 70 percent since \n     1990.\n\n  We know that is real. The Senator from Oregon knows it is real. The \nSenator from Idaho knows it is real. I have\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nattended the mill closures. My guess is, so has the Senator from \nOregon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters \nfrom the Western Council of Industrial Workers and the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, opposing reductions \nin the timber program.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Western Council of Industrial Workers, United Brotherhood \n           of Carpenters and Joiners of America,\n                                      Portland, OR, July 19, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 20,000 men and women of the \n     Western Council of Industrial Workers (WCIW), I urge you to \n     oppose any effort to reduce funding for the U.S. Forest \n     Service timber sale and related programs when the FY 2000 \n     Interior Appropriations bill comes to the Senate floor for \n     consideration.\n       Legislative efforts to reduce funding for forest management \n     programs seriously jeopardize the livelihoods of our members \n     and tens of thousands of forest products workers nationwide. \n     Job loss within our industry has been severe as the timber \n     sale program has been reduced by almost 70 percent since the \n     early 1990s. More than 80,000 men and women have lost their \n     jobs due to this decline and further cutbacks in these \n     important programs will only add to the unemployment.\n       Additionally, adequate funding for forest management \n     programs is critical to protect the health of our forests. \n     According to the Forest Service, approximately 40 million \n     acres of our national forests are at high risk of \n     catastrophic forest fire. Active management is the single \n     most effective tool for reducing the risk of wild fires and \n     protecting nearby communities, as well as maintaining forest \n     health and limiting the spread of insects and disease.\n       The WCIW urges you to support land management policy that \n     provides an adequate balance for all concerns--environmental \n     and economic. Please support the current funding levels in \n     the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill and oppose any \n     effort to cut funding for these important active management \n     programs.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mike Pieti,\n     Executive Secretary-Treasurer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             United Brotherhood of\n\n\n                            Carpenters and Joiners of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the United Brotherhood of \n     Carpenters and Joiners of America, I urge your support for \n     the federal timber sale program as the Senate debates the \n     Fiscal Year 2000 Interior Appropriations bill. Additionally, \n     I urge you to oppose any harmful amendment that seeks to \n     reduce timber sale funding.\n       The livelihoods of U.S. forest products workers--including \n     tens of thousands of our lumber, sawmill, pulp and paper \n     workers--rely on Forest Service programs that promote active \n     management. Timber harvests on federal lands have fallen by \n     almost 70 percent over the last decade, resulting in mill \n     closures and job loss. Further reductions in funding for the \n     federal timber sale program will only exacerbate the economic \n     devastation to working families and rural communities. Also \n     reductions in timber supply continue to contribute to the \n     rising U.S. trade deficit in the forest products sector, as \n     wood and paper imports reach record levels.\n       In addition, the health and vitality of our nation's \n     forests are being crippled by crisis. Twenty-six million \n     acres are in jeopardy from insect and disease, while forty \n     million acres are at risk to catastrophic wildfire. Our union \n     supports responsible efforts to protect our forests, \n     including thinning and harvesting to maintain forest health, \n     limit the spread of insect infestation and reduce the risk of \n     forest fires.\n       We must continue our nation's global leadership in \n     environmental stewardship without sacrificing the livelihoods \n     of thousands of working families. The UBCJA urges you to help \n     protect forests, jobs and communities by supporting the \n     current funding levels for the federal timber sale program in \n     the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill and by opposing any \n     effort to reduce funding for this essential program.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas J. McCarron,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Unemployment in rural timber-dependent communities is in \ndouble-digit figures despite rosy employment figures in the rest of \nAmerica. The Senator from Oregon and I visited similar communities--he \nin his State, I in my State--over the August recess. I can go from my \ncommunity of Boise where there is near zero unemployment--it is a \ngrowth community, it is a high-tech community, it is doing very well--\nand I can drive 100 miles to a community that has 14 to 16-percent \nunemployment. Why? That community is right here. That community is \nright here. That is because they were dependent upon the public lands \nand our Government and the politics of the public lands said: Stay off \nthe land. Don't cut a tree. The mills closed or the mill is closing or \nthe mill is at risk. Those people are unemployed.\n  They cannot identify with a job in the high-tech industry. Why? Each \nof them would have to move 100 miles and uproot their family and they \nwould have to be retrained and educated. A 45-year-old man does not \nwant to do that. He cannot understand, if we are growing five times \nmore trees than we are cutting, why we cannot at least create a balance \nin a program that will afford him or his son, who is graduating from \nhigh school and does not want to go on to college, a job in the forest \nproducts industry.\n  While the national average unemployment rate hovers at around 4 \npercent, more than 30 forest-dependent counties have three times that \nrate. Over a dozen forest-dependent counties have an unemployment rate \nof 16 percent. I believe the Bryan amendment will bring even further \neconomic harm to the people of those rural areas.\n  When I first got here in 1981, there was a mantra about the debate on \nthe forest products industry and about forest management: Take away a \nfew jobs and we will replace them. We will replace them with tourism \nand recreation. It was America wanting to go to the public lands to \nenjoy the environment of the public lands.\n  To some extent that has happened but only to a minor degree compared \nto what was projected during the decade of the early 1980s. But \nremember, while some of it happened, the kind of jobs that were created \nwere fundamentally different jobs from those $30,000, $40,000, $50,000-\na-year jobs that I am talking about in the forest products industry. A \nmaid or waitress or a gas station attendant or a tour guide does not \nmake that kind of money. They work at slightly above minimum wage. They \nhave no health benefits. They have no retirement program. Their work is \nseasonal. They are oftentimes out of work 4 or 5 months out of the \nyear. And, yes, they are on welfare. And, yes, they qualify for food \nstamps.\n  I must say these once were the proud men and women of the forest \nproducts industry that we politically destroyed. We politically \ndestroyed it. We are here today for politics. We are politically trying \nto destroy what remains of a responsible way of managing our forests \ntoday, not because it is the right thing to do from a management point \nof view but because it is the right thing to do politically. I know of \nno other reason. I cannot understand why the Senator from Nevada, who \ncomes from the great public land State that he does, would want to turn \nhis back on one segment of the economy of a public land State such as \nIdaho or Nevada.\n  He and I stand arm in arm together on mining issues. I was in Elko, \nNV, last week in a community that 15 years ago was 5,000 people; today, \n25,000 people, not because of the high-tech industry but because of \ngold, gold in the Carlin Trend; mining, high-priced jobs being paid to \nthousands of men and women in the mining industry. So when we battle on \nthat issue, the Senator from Nevada and I stand arm in arm. But when we \ntry to work on a reasonable and responsible forest management plan that \nallows some tree cutting, I am tremendously frustrated the Senator from \nNevada and I cannot stand arm in arm on that issue also.\n\n  It is an issue of jobs. It is an issue of right and responsible ways \nof managing our forests. It is political. I am saddened that it is.\n  The substitute amendment transfers $10 million of the reduction that \nI have talked about, $34 million in timber funds to pay for surveys on \nrare species. I do not think that is responsive to the problem of the \nunreasonable wildlife survey requirements in the President's Northwest \nForest Plan, which we discussed in this body last week.\n  First of all, the Forest Service timber sale budget is what pays for \nthe surveys. Thus, rather than a $10 million increase for this purpose, \nthe net effect of this proposal is a $24 million decrease. So we give \nthem not even a half a loaf. We give them a quarter of a loaf.\n  Second, the Clinton administration has agreed that many of these \nsurveys should not be done; indeed, many cannot be done. That is \nprecisely why the administration is writing an EIS in an\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\nattempt to change these requirements. Unfortunately, timber sales are \nenjoined until the EIS is completed.\n  I happen to agree with the editorial statement this past Sunday in \nthe Portland Oregonian, the largest and most respected newspaper in \nOregon. The Oregonian correctly notes that:\n  The surveys of rare species of animals and plants required in the \nNorthwest Forest Plan are ``technically impossible'' and [they use the \nright word] ``preposterous. . . .''\n  The Senate didn't use the word ``preposterous,'' but last week the \nSenate said no to the judges; they are not going to let the judges in \nthe Eleventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit write policy. That is our \njob. That is what we are elected to do. They are appointed to interpret \nthe Constitution and not to write timber policy. The Oregonian calls it \n``preposterous.'' The Oregonian further describes the requirements as:\n\n       . . . a poison pill--a way to block all logging and prevent \n     the plan from working as it was designed.\n\n  Yet we want to put more money into that. It makes no sense to spend \n$10 million for a prescription for a poison pill or for preposterous \nsurvey procedures. This Congress should not spend 10 cents in what I \nbelieve is a most inappropriate fashion.\n  That is the foundation of the debate as I see it. I believe that is a \nreasonable interpretation of why we are on the floor today. I know of \nno other. At a time when we have reduced the overall timber program in \nthis country by 7 percent, we have reduced employment by almost 50 \npercent, and we have dramatically transformed the rural landscape to \ncommunities of unemployed people and empty homes. That is the policy of \nthis Government at this time. And somehow we want to perpetuate that or \nincrease it? I think not.\n\n  The only explanation possible that I believe is reasonable and right \nis the politics of it. We are on the floor today because the National \nSierra Club and others said we ought not be cutting trees on public \nlands at all, zero, end of statement, not to improve health, not for \nfire prevention, not to create vibrant and youthful stands just do not \ncut them at all; let Mother Nature be our manager.\n  That is not good business. We know that is not good business, \nespecially when man, for the last 40 or 50 years, has put out all the \nfires and not allowed Mother Nature to manage. Now when she has an \nopportunity to manage where there are 50 trees instead of 5--that would \nhave been true 100 years ago--we create monstrous wildfires that not \nonly destroy the stands but scald the land and make it sterile and \nnonproductive for decades to come. That is where man has to step back \nin as a good steward, a right and responsible steward, for all of the \nenvironmental reasons, the water quality reasons, and the wildlife \nhabitat reasons for which we manage a forest.\n  I yield such time as is required to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for \nclearly laying out the issues in this debate, and I associate my \nremarks with his.\n  I rise to strongly speak against the Bryan-Wyden amendment for a \nvariety of reasons but, most importantly, because it simply does not \nsupport healthy and sustainable national forests. Many Senators, I \nsuspect, will speak today claiming this reduction to the Timber \nManagement Program makes sound fiscal and environmental sense.\n  From my perspective as an Arkansan, as a Senator from Arkansas, I can \ntell you that is far from the truth and that there are 35,440 workers \nin my home State who make up the forest products industry who strongly \noppose this amendment. If our forests are not healthy and if we \ncontinue to ignore the problems facing these public lands, we run the \nrisk of jeopardizing these jobs and the future health and \nsustainability of our Nation's forests.\n  During the August recess, I met with the Forest Service on the \nOuachita National Forest in Arkansas. Sometimes our distinguished \nSenators from the West forget that there are national forests all \nacross the South, and in the State of Arkansas, I say to my good \nfriend, the Senator from Oregon, we have two large national forests, \nthe Ouachita National Forest and the Ozark National Forest.\n  In a meeting with the National Forest Service on the Ouachita \nNational Forest last month, I discovered, because of decreasing budgets \nin the timber sales account, they are doing only one-third of the \nvegetation management required by the forest plan. So forgive me if I \nfind it ironic that this second-degree amendment, the substitute \namendment, would shift $10 million from the Timber Management Program \nto the surveys in the Northwest when, in the State of Arkansas, in our \nnational forests, they are only doing one-third of the vegetation \nmanagement required by the forest plan.\n\n  Because of the severe erosion of funding that the Senator from Idaho \nhas alluded to, the forest is unable to achieve the desired future \nconditions required for a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. \nExtremists, litigation, appeals, or lack of public support did not \nbring about this crisis. It is the result of a misguided effort by the \nadministration to reduce timber harvests without taking into \nconsideration the real impacts on the conditions of the forests and the \ncommunities associated with these national forests.\n  The Timber Management Program is funded at a level equal to the \nfiscal year 1999 funding level. There was level funding before this \namendment. Before these additional cuts, there was level funding, no \nincrease, and yet the demands on the program have increased \ndramatically.\n  The program objective for the timber sales program is ``a sustainable \nyield of forest products that contributes to meeting the Nation's \ndemands and restoring, improving, or maintaining the forest ecosystem \nhealth.'' Yet the amendment before us reduces the funding level when \nmore than 40 million acres of our national forests are at high risk of \ncatastrophic fire due to an accumulation of dead and dying trees and an \nadditional 26 million acres are at risk of insect and disease \ninfestation.\n  We have a crisis now; we risk a catastrophe. We have level funding in \nthe appropriations bill before us, and the amendment suggests we should \ncut even further in a program that has not the resources to do the job \nit has been charged with doing as it stands.\n  The addition of Senator Wyden as a cosponsor of the amendment, the \nsecond-degree amendment, only exacerbates the problem that the \nunderlying amendment creates in shifting an additional $10 million out \nof timber management and moving it to the Northwest. This impacts every \nnational forest, every timber management program in the Nation. It \ndilutes what can be done in those areas where they are already \nsuffering, where they are already short to move additional resources \nbecause of the situation faced in the Northwest. I think that is wrong. \nIt is not economically or environmentally advisable.\n  The debate today will speak about doing right by the environment. How \ncan you justify reducing a level-funded program that is dealing with \nmillions of acres of land that are too crowded for new and healthy \ntrees to grow?\n  We will also hear talk today about how the Timber Management Program \nis antienvironmental or environmentally destructive. That is not what I \nhave seen in the management that is being done in the Ouachita, the \nOzark, St. Francis National Forests in Arkansas. Our national forests \nare adding 23 billion board feet each year. While 3 billion board feet \nare being harvested each year, 6 billion board feet die each year from \ninsects, disease, fire, and other causes, and the amendment before us \nwill only make that situation worse.\n  The majority of the timber sales in the program are done for other \necosystem objectives--improving habitat for wildlife, reducing fuels \nthat may increase fire risk, especially in the urban interface areas, \ncombating insect and disease infestations, and improving true growth \nfor future timber.\n  We cannot ignore the contributions that the Timber Management Program \nmakes each year, even if it might sound politically advantageous. The \nbyproduct of a healthy, sustainable timber program is equally as \nimportant as healthy rural communities. The timber sales program \ngenerates regional income of $2 billion--over $2 billion; in fact, $2.3 \nbillion--in Federal income tax receipts. Seventy percent of\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\nthe timber from national forests is sold to small businesses that could \nbe forced to close their doors if we support further reductions to the \nprogram.\n\n  A $1 million reduction in the timber sales program on the Ouachita, \nOzark, or St. Francis National Forests simply means 10,000 acres of \nforest designated for treatment by the forest plan will go untreated. \nThat is what it will mean: a $1 million reduction, 10,000 acres that \nwill go unmanaged, untreated. Perhaps that is the goal. Perhaps that is \nthe backdoor objective of such an amendment. The byproducts--round wood \nand saw logs --will be unavailable. Communities will lose 500 years of \nwork and over $15 million from the local economy.\n  By any reasonable standard, the U.S. forest practices are the best in \nthe world, ensuring forests are regenerated and that water quality and \nwildlife habitat are protected or enhanced. Decreasing this program is \nwrongheaded. It will only set us back environmentally. It will surely \nnegatively impact us economically.\n  I suggest we do the right thing and support no less than level \nfunding for this important program and oppose the Bryan-Wyden \namendment.\n  I thank the chairman. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I yield the chairman of the full \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, such time \nas he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let's start with some facts because what is \nappropriate is to recognize just what the current policy of the \nadministration is towards the U.S. forests managed by the Forest \nService.\n  Clearly, as we look at where we are today, as this chart shows in the \ndark purple, the U.S. Forest Service volume sold, vis-a-vis the annual \nmortality--the annual mortality are those trees that are dead or \ndying--that in the years 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, the \nannual mortality, compared with the volume sold--and that is evident by \nthe green spheres that come up through the chart--the mortality has \nexceeded the commercial volume sold.\n  The suggestion is, what has happened to forest health?\n  You have to manage for forest health based on professionals, \nprofessionals who are trained and have committed their lives to best \nforest management practices.\n  What we have in the debate that is occurring on this floor is a \ndebate over emotions, the emotions over whether timber, trees, a \nrenewable resource, should be harvested or not.\n  We have heard the Senator from Idaho expound a little bit on the \nattitude prevailing in the U.S. environmental groups, and particularly \nthe Sierra Club, which, much to their credit, has come out \nwholeheartedly and said: We want to terminate harvesting in the \nnational forests, all of the national forests.\n  They make no bones about it. That is just a fact.\n  The justification for Senator Bryan's amendment, which would timber \nprogram in the committee bill by $34 million, leads to the \nenvironmental agenda, the agenda of the Sierra Club that wants to \nterminate harvesting in national forests.\n  The amendment isn't what it appears to be. While I am sympathetic to \nmy friend from Oregon and his efforts to redirect $10 million to \nwildlife surveys in the Northwest, I again think we ought to go back \nand recognize where the objection is. The objection comes from national \nenvironmental groups who are opposed to logging in the national \nforests. The policies of the Clinton administration relative to logging \nin the national forests are evident, but the justification to support \nthat is very lacking if we look at the facts.\n  The facts are that there is currently almost 250 billion cubic feet--\nmore than 1 trillion board feet--of volume of standing timber in the \nnational forests. That is a significant amount--250 billion cubic feet \nof volume. The annual growth--that is the growth that occurs every \nyear--is about 23 billion board feet.\n  Do you know what we are cutting, Madam President? We are cutting \nsomewhere between 2.5 and 3 billion board feet. What is the \njustification in the sense of forest management practices and the \nforest health when clearly the forests are not in danger of being \novercut? The regrowth at 23 billion board feet each year, compared with \nthe cut of 2.5 to 3 billion board feet, clearly shows we are growing \ntimber faster, much faster than we are cutting it--in fact, about 7 to \n8 times faster than we are cutting it. As evidenced by this chart, the \nmortality now is exceeding what we are cutting in commercial timber.\n  Good forest management practices would indicate something be done \nabout the dead and dying trees that are infested with the spruce bark \nbeetle and so forth, and that a program be initiated so healthy trees \ngrow back in again. But, again, these decisions are not being made by \nthose responsible for forest health, professional forest managers. They \nare being made by environmental groups, and they are being made on the \nbasis of emotional arguments.\n  You should recognize the reality that timber is a renewable resource \nthat can be properly managed, as evidenced by the existing volume that \nwe have in this country, 250 billion cubic feet in the national \nforests--and I will repeat it again--with 23 billion board feet annual \ngrowth, and the realization we are only cutting 3 billion board feet a \nyear.\n  We certainly need some changes. The changes need to move off the \nemotional arguments and get into what is good for the forests, what is \ngood for the health of the forests. You clear out the diseased trees. \nYou encourage programs that eliminate fire hazards.\n\n  I have worked with Senator Bryan and his colleague from Nevada on \nmining legislation which is important to his State and important to \nWestern States, important to my State of Alaska. I am disappointed that \nhe has seen fit to again take this issue on to reduce by $34 million \nthe Committee's recommended timber program. I recognize that is not a \nbig issue in his State. But I think it basically addresses a policy \nwithin this administration that has prevailed for some time, and that \nis to oppose resource development on public lands, whether it be \ngrazing, whether it be oil and gas leasing, whether it be mining, and \ncertainly in the case of timber.\n  I would like to communicate a little experience that we had in Alaska \nrelative to studies and the resource management associated with the \nwildlife of the forest and to suggest to the Senator from Oregon that \nthese challenges on the adequacy of wildlife studies seem endless. You \nno sooner get a professional opinion on the adequacy or inadequacy of a \ncertain species within the forest, and if it is unfavorable to those \nwho want to terminate logging in the forest, they simply go to a judge, \nget an injunction, and suggest that the study was inadequate and lacked \nthe thoroughness that it needed.\n  Let me tell you a little story about what happened in Alaska.\n  We had the U.S. Forest Service involved in what they called the TLMP, \nthe Tongass Land Management Plan. They spent 10 years to develop a \nplan. They spent $13 million. Previously, we had been cutting about 420 \nmillion board feet a year. The TLMP came down, after this 10-year study \nand $13 million, and cut it, the allowable cut, to 267 million board \nfeet.\n  What happened as a consequence of that? We lost our only two year-\nround manufacturing plants in our State. The Sitka and Ketchikan \npulpmills, the combined workforce, plus those in the woods, amounted to \nsome 3,400 jobs, most of which were lost.\n  What was the forest health issue regarding this reduction? All the \ntimber in the Tongass, as most Members who have been up there know, is \nold growth timber. But what they do not realize is that 30 percent of \nthat timber is dead or dying. It has no other use than wood fiber. So \nit is put in the pulp mills.\n  Without the pulp mills, we have no utilization of that timber. Much \nof those logs are now ground up in chips or exported to Japan or out to \npulp mills in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Let me go back to the Tongass Land Management Plan where they cut the \nsales level from 420 million board feet to 267 million board feet. \nWithin 9 months, the administration, after spending 10 years and $13 \nmillion, decided that volume of 267 million board\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\nfeet was too high. So they cut it arbitrarily, without any public \nhearing, as a consequence of pressure from national environmental \ngroups who used an emotional argument, and also the reality that maybe \nthe easiest place to terminate harvesting in national forests is in \nAlaska. We have two Senators and one Congressman. Alaska is a long way \naway. Nobody can go up and look at it and recognize that we have cut \nless than one-tenth of 1 percent of the Tongass forest in Alaska over \nthe last 40 years and that our regrowth is 10 times what we have \ncut. They want to terminate harvesting, and the Tongass national forest \nin Alaska is a good place to start. So they came back and cut the \nproposed allowable sales level from 267 to 178 million--no public \nhearings, no input, no further studies. They spent, again, 10 years and \n$13 million for the first study, and they weren't satisfied with it.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Oregon, don't be misled by the question of \nthe adequacy of wildlife studies in the Pacific Northwest. On the \ngoshawk, we in Alaska are now under a challenge, on an issue we thought \nwe had behind us because several years ago we had a challenge on a \nthreatened and endangered species, the goshawk. The U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service spent several years working with the Forest Service to \ndo an evaluation, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service came to the \nconclusion that the goshawk was not threatened by the timber harvest \nprogram in the Tongass. We thought we had that issue behind us. We \ndidn't.\n  Environmental groups--from the Southwest, I might add--petitioned the \njudge on the adequacy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service evaluation \nof the goshawk study and the judge said, go back and do it again. If \nyou can't depend on the best experts to come to a conclusion, then this \nis simply an open-ended effort by either bureaucrats, or environmental \ngroups, or both to terminate harvesting in the national forests. That \nis what has happened as a consequence of the attitude of this \nadministration towards timber harvesting.\n  Again, we have 250 billion cubic feet of volume standing in the \nnational forests of the United States. The annual growth is 23 billion \nboard feet. We are harvesting between 2.5 and 3 billion board feet. We \nare regrowing seven to eight times our annual harvest. Yet we have \nthose who would say the forest program is being subsidized. There is no \nrealization of what timber sales and related roads offer in providing \naccess for timber, availability to the public, jobs, payrolls and \ncommunities. The proposal by Senator Bryan would reduce the program \nabout 13 percent below the current 1999 program level.\n  I am pleased the Society of American Foresters opposes the amendment. \nI believe that letter has been introduced in the Record. If not, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Society of American Foresters,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, July 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It has come to our attention that \n     Senator Bryan may offer an amendment or amendments to the \n     Interior Appropriations bill designed to significantly reduce \n     the amount of funding available for the Forest Service Timber \n     Sale program or its Roads program. We believe this would be a \n     mistake.\n       While we are sure that Senator Bryan is well intentioned in \n     his efforts, he may not understand the significant \n     contributions the timber sale program makes to improving our \n     national forests. The Fiscal Year 1998 Report of the Forest \n     Service states ``today, national forest timber sales are \n     designed to incorporate multiple objectives, including insect \n     and disease prevention and control, wildlife habitat \n     management, fuels treatment, and reconstruction or \n     construction of roads needed for long-term access.'' \n     Foresters in the private and public sector design timber \n     sales for purposes in addition to producing timber.\n       There are many examples of timber harvests that benefit \n     other resources. For example, the July 1999, edition of the \n     Journal of Forestry has an article called ``Designing Spotted \n     Owl Habitat in a Managed Forest.'' The article describes how \n     to harvest trees and manipulate the forest for the benefit of \n     spotted owls. Natural resource management professionals can \n     produce forest products and healthy forests; they just need \n     tools like the Forest Service's Timber Sale program to \n     accomplish their goals. We can harvest trees from the forest \n     and still leave behind quality conditions for wildlife.\n       We are also very concerned about a possible reduction in \n     funding for the Roads program. The Forest Service estimates \n     that they have a $10 billion backlog in road maintenance. Now \n     is not the time to reduce funding for these important forest \n     assets that can turn into environmental nightmares without \n     proper design and maintenance.\n       Thank you for your consideration and your support of \n     professional forestry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William H. Banzhaf,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I urge the Congress to support the \nsignificant contribution that the timber program, even though it is in \ndecline, has been making to improve the national forests.\n  Again, recognize that the program is smaller than a few years ago. \nThe Bryan amendment would continue this harmful slide, because the \nultimate objective is to terminate harvesting in the national forests. \nThe redirecting of timber funds to wildlife activities in support of \ntimber still has the same negative effect. That negative effect has \nbeen highlighted by my friend from Idaho, as he discussed the effects \nof a reduction in the timber program.\n  What we are talking about on this chart is that there is more timber \ndying than is being cut. That is the harsh reality of where we are. \nWhat kind of forest management practice is that? It is a \npreservationist practice.\n  What is the role of the Forest Service? Habitat management? Stewards \nof the forest? They are not aggressive in thinning programs, which are \nneeded for the growth of new trees. What the Forest Service has become \nis a custodial management agency. They don't know where they are going. \nThey are torn between past leaders that used to make decisions on the \nbasis of what is best for forest health, and the new generation that is \ndirected to a large degree by national environmental groups that want \nto terminate harvesting in the national forests.\n  It is OK if you are from a State that has large private holdings. \nWashington State has a number of large private land companies. It is OK \nif you have large State-owned forests. But if you are in my State of \nAlaska, where the Federal Government, the U.S. Forest Service--the \nentire Tongass National Forest is owned and managed by the Federal \nGovernment--you have a different set of circumstances. Our communities \nare in the forest. Our State capital, Juneau, towns like Ketchikan, \nWrangell, Petersburg, Haines, Skagway, Sitka, all are in the forest. \nPeople live in the forest. They were under the assumption they would be \nable to work with the Federal Government, when we became a State in \n1959, to maintain, on a renewable basis, an industry base. They \nrecognize that in our case our forest, as an old-growth forest, is in \nthe process of dying. Thirty percent of that timber is dying.\n  I had an opportunity to fly over some of the Northeastern States over \nthe recess, Maine and other areas. I noted that they have a healthy \ntimber industry, managed, if you will, to a large degree through the \nprivate holdings of landowners and corporations and the State. They \nhave jobs. They have pulp mills. They have a renewability. Yet we are \nstrangled by policies that are dictated by environmental groups, that \nare dictated by Members from States who have no interest in the \nnational forest from the standpoint of those of us who are dependent on \nit in the West and particularly in my State in Alaska.\n  Finally, I ask that my colleagues reflect that this amendment would \nreally reduce the tools the Forest Service has available for \nstewardship activities, tools that improve forest health and improve \nwildlife habitat and improve other forest ecosystems as well. Don't be \nmisled by the objective of those who have a different agenda with \nregard to the national forests. Let us recognize that forests live and \ndie. With proper management, they can yield a bounty of prosperity, a \nbounty of renewability. But we have to have the recognition that those \ndecisions with regard to the forest are not going to be made by the \npoliticians in this body. They are going to be made by those \nprofessionals who are prepared to put their reputation behind their \nrecommendations or, for that matter, the other way around, and do what \nis best for the forest. The Bryan amendment certainly does not do this, \nby cutting funding for timber sales and roads, and hence, decreasing \nthe timber program.\n\n[[Page S10763]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, during the course of the debate, the \nSenator from Idaho propounded to the Senator from Nevada a query as to \nhow I could be supportive of this amendment and then made reference to \nthe fact of Lake Tahoe, with all the problems we have in Tahoe. My own \nprevious statements on Tahoe indicated the extent of the devastation \nthat has been caused with dying trees and timber.\n  To suggest that somehow increasing the commercial harvesting of \ntimber would in any way ameliorate the problems we face at Tahoe would \nbe a totally spurious argument. The problems at Tahoe are compounded \nbecause we had a 7-year drought, the most protracted in recorded \nmemory, and as a result, the forest became very vulnerable to \ninfestation from beetles that ultimately killed vast amounts of trees \nin the Tahoe Basin. So adding to the commercial harvest would in no way \nhelp.\n\n  Secondly, with respect to Tahoe, we are reaping a whirlwind of \npractices that involve the extensive cutting of road network to the \nTahoe Basin. The clarity of the lake is declining rapidly. This is a \nlake that Mark Twain rhapsodized about. John C. Fremont, on Valentine's \nDay in 1844, was the first European to see Lake Tahoe, and perhaps that \ndate has some significance because those of us who live in Nevada have \nhad a love affair with Lake Tahoe ever since.\n  The problem in Tahoe is exacerbated because of this road network that \nwas built throughout the basin during a period of intense harvesting in \nthe last century. The timber at Tahoe was used for the great mining \nactivities of Virginia City. But it is instructive and helpful because \nthe primary contributing factor to the erosion that is causing the \ndeterioration of waters and clarity is the runoff from these old roads, \nand road maintenance is what we need so desperately.\n  So I say that my friend from Idaho confuses the issue when he talks \nabout the problems at Tahoe and the thrust of the Bryan-Wyden \namendment, which is simply to take about $32 million from the \ncommercial timber operations and reprogram those into some accounts \nthat include road maintenance and fish and wildlife management.\n  Let me make the point about road maintenance, if I may, again. The \nBryan-Wyden amendment does not eliminate commercial timber sales in the \nnational forests. My friend from Alaska referenced that we should allow \nprofessionals to make the determination as to how much harvesting \nshould occur. That recommendation is included by the managers of the \nForest Service, and they recommended a number of $196 million. That was \nin the President's recommendation.\n  Now, what the appropriators did was, they stripped out $34 million \nfrom road maintenance and fish and wildlife accounts and added that \nback into the timber sales to bring that number up to about $228 \nmillion. My friend from Arkansas was talking about the need for forest \nhealth and to do a lot of things. Those are totally different accounts. \nWe are talking, on the one hand, of reducing to the level of the \nPresident's recommended appropriation the commercial timber sale \naccount of $196 million and to add $32 million to that account. What \nthe appropriators did was to reduce by $11 million the road maintenance \naccount.\n  It is the road maintenance account that helps to alleviate the \nerosion and the other adverse environmental consequences that attach to \nthe neglect of that maintenance. The testimony is that the Forest \nService would need $431 million a year for road maintenance alone, that \nthere is a total backlog of $3.85 billion in road maintenance. By \nrejecting the Bryan-Wyden amendment, you make that backlog even longer \nbecause the appropriators have stripped $11 million from that account.\n  Now, every mile of new construction adds to that backlog because \nunder the law, once the harvesting operation has been completed, the \ntimber harvester has no responsibility for the maintenance of that \nroad. That, then, is left to the Forest Service and the American \ntaxpayer. We already have 380,000 miles in the National forests. As I \ncommented in my opening statement, that is more mileage than we have on \nthe interstate system in America.\n  The things my friend from Idaho was talking about, in terms of fire \nburns and removing dead timber, have nothing to do--absolutely \nnothing--with the commercial timber sale account. Those activities are \nincluded in other accounts, such as the Wild Land Fire Management Act. \nSo I think we have a confusion here as we debate these issues.\n\n  The Bryan-Wyden amendment would simply reduce to the level of the \nprofessional managers' recommendation in the Forest Service the \ncommercial timber sale account of $196 million and would restore, \nessentially, to the environmental accounts and road maintenance \naccounts much of that money that was taken out. That is where the \nmanagement practices need to be addressed. That is the focus. That is \nwhere the environmental problems are --road maintenance and fish and \nwildlife habitat.\n  In effect, what the appropriators did is to strip those accounts and \nreduce them substantially to add to the timber sale account. There is \nno benefit to the environment at Lake Tahoe by increasing the \ncommercial timber sale accounts. That simply does absolutely nothing \nfor us at all. So I wanted to clarify the Record where my friend from \nIdaho has confused it. The Senator from Nevada is being absolutely \nconsistent.\n  I might just say, in terms of the broad public policy, the General \nAccounting Office concluded that, from 1992 to 1997, the commercial \nsales in the national forests have cost the American taxpayer $1.5 \nbillion. So there is another issue out here to be debated in terms of \nthe public policy. The Bryan-Wyden amendment does not eliminate but \nsimply reduces to the level of the Presidential recommendation in terms \nof the appropriation.\n  If the Senator from Idaho were interested in seeing the problems more \nadequately addressed, he would favor reducing the amount of the \ncommercial sales and restoring the $11 million that was stripped from \nthat account. We need far more dollars in the road maintenance account, \nin which the backlog is over $3 billion.\n  So every attempt to reduce the amount of the road maintenance account \nand add money to the new construction account makes the situation much \nworse. I argue that the more prudent and rational public policy is to \ndeal with neglected road maintenance and provide additional money in \nthat account rather than to add to the commercial sale account. I \nwanted to make that point for the record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this has been an important debate--\nimportant for the Northwest and important as it relates to the \ndirection of the Forest Service.\n  I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be \nsurprised to know that I agree with a number of the things they have \nsaid about the Forest Service not knowing where they are headed. \nFrankly, I have made much stronger statements than that in the last few \ndays. It is very clear in the Pacific Northwest that the Forest Service \nis just flailing around.\n  The chairman of our subcommittee and I both read these Oregonian \neditorials talking about blame with respect to gridlock in the forests. \nIn the Northwest, the Oregonian, our newspaper, editorialized that:\n\n       Forest biologists searching for signs of the rare mosses \n     listed above ought to look under the backsides of the federal \n     officials managing the forest plan. That seems a relatively \n     undisturbed habitat.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that those Forest Service officials knew \nfor years they had to go forward with survey and management in a \nresponsible fashion and haven't done so. So I think the comments that \nhave been made by the chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, Senator \nCraig, and the chairman of the full committee, with respect to the \nForest Service not knowing where it is going, are ones that I largely \nshare.\n  But where we have a difference of opinion and where I think the \nBryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden and the substitute help to bring together \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle is that the history of the last \nfew years demonstrates very clearly that just spending more money on \nthe timber sale program\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\ndoesn't help these rural communities either from an economic standpoint \nor from an environmental standpoint.\n  The fact of the matter is, Madam President and colleagues, for the \nlast several years this Congress has authorized a greater expenditure \nfor the timber sale program than the President of the United States has \ncalled for.\n  This Congress has appropriated more funds for the timber sale \nprogram, and the fact is the problems in many of these rural \ncommunities in the West, from an economic and environmental standpoint, \nare getting worse.\n  So I think the notion that throwing more money at the timber sales \nprogram is going to address the needs of these rural communities is not \nborne out by the events of the last few years.\n  What needs to be done--and what Senator Bryan and Senator Fitzgerald \nand I are trying to do--is to put in place a program with real \naccountability.\n  My colleague from Idaho talked about the need for accountability of \nthe Forest Service. The chairman of the full Senate Energy Committee \nhas correctly said more emphasis needs to be placed on oversight. The \nfact of the matter is that under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, \nfor the first time the Congress will put in place a program in the \nsurvey and management area which has essentially shut down the forests \nand that will have real accountability. Under our amendment, the survey \nand management draft environmental impact statement will have to be \ncompleted by November 15 of this year, and the final version of that \nimpact statement would have to be published by February 14 of 2000.\n  That is allowing for public comment. That is accountability. That is \ngiving some direction to the Forest Service on the key issue that has \nin effect shut down the forests in our part of the country.\n  So the choice is, do we do business as we have done in the past, \nwhich is to throw money, for example, at a particular program, the \ntimber sale program, or do we try, as the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden \namendment does, to tie that amendment to dealing with the key concerns \nthat have shut down our forests and put in place real accountability in \nthe process?\n  Beyond that, I think the only other major difference I have, as some \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is that they have \ncorrectly said they don't want the courts to make forest policy. \nSection 329, as it stands in this bill, is a lawyer employment program. \nThis is going to be a huge bonanza for lawyers as it stands in its \npresent form.\n  That is why I am hopeful that colleagues, regardless of how they feel \nabout section 329 in its original farm, regardless of how they voted on \nthe Robb legislation earlier, will see that the approach that Senator \nBryan and Senator Fitzgerald and I are talking about tries to borrow \nfrom the philosophy of both of the approaches that have been debated on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. I happen to agree with Senator Gorton and \nSenator Craig that the survey and management program has not worked. \nThe Forest Service has dawdled. They have known what they were supposed \nto do for some time.\n  We can read editorials to each other for many hours to compete for \nwho is the toughest on the Forest Service. But the fact is they haven't \nknown where they are going, and we are going to try to get them on \ntrack. But this amendment is the very first effort in the Senate to put \nthem on track in a way that locks in the additional money they need \nwith a specific timetable and a blueprint for ensuring accountability.\n  I think for that reason it is absolutely essential that we pass it. I \nthink it will give us an opportunity to go forward in the days ahead, \nwhich is what we are going to try to do in the oversight hearing that \nChairman Craig is holding on Thursday.\n  I am very hopeful that those Members of this body who understand how \nwrong it is for the courts to make forestry policy and how important it \nis to have a balanced approach that will tie additional funding with \naccountability--and a recognition that there is more to this than \nappropriating additional funds for the timber sale program--will \nsupport our bipartisan amendment.\n  I gather we will not have a final vote on this amendment until \ntomorrow, and perhaps we will hear from some additional colleagues. But \nI am very hopeful, regardless of how a Member of this body voted on \nthose Robb amendments or felt about the original section 329, the \nGorton language, that they will see what Senator Bryan and Senator \nFitzgerald and I are trying to do, which is pull together an approach \nthat will give the Forest Service some direction, give them some \naccountability, and do it in a responsible fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oregon. We have \nworked closely together for the last number of months to try to resolve \na variety of timber issues and conflicts that have brought some of our \nrural communities to their knees.\n  Those are communities that not only in many instances have lost jobs \nin the sawmills that I have talked about in my opening comments, but \nthese are communities that also lost their moneys to run their schools.\n  My colleague from Oregon has communities that only go to school 4 \ndays out of 5 days of a week because they have no more money to run \ntheir buses and to keep their schools open. I have communities in my \nState that are now debating over whether to put their money in the hot \nlunch program or athletics and ask all of their high school and grade \nschool students to brown bag all the time.\n  You say: What does this have to do with this debate? What does this \nhave to do with cutting trees in the national forests? It has a great \ndeal to do with these communities that are timber dependent because 25 \npercent of the stumpage fee that comes from a Federal timber sale goes \nto the local communities for their schools, their county roads, and \ntheir bridges.\n  That is historically what we believe is a fair treatment of those \ncommunities that oftentimes house the loggers and the mill employees \nand the executives of the timber companies and the Forest Service but \nhave no private land base because all of the land around them is public \nland, and they should share in the revenue flowing from that public \nland. Those are what we call timber-dependent communities.\n  The Senator and I worked to try to resolve that issue. We are very \nclose to what I think is some tremendously positive and creative \nthinking that results from, hopefully, minds coming together out of \nconflict to bring resolution. I am fearful this amendment does not do \nthat. I say that because while the Senator suggests that he prescribes \ndeadlines by which EISs ought to be done, this administration and this \nForest Service isn't talking anywhere near that. They are suggesting \nthe deadline for a draft EIS ought to be in February and that the final \nought to be in June for the EISs we are talking about for these sales. \nWhether you could expedite that, I am not sure.\n  The one thing we want to be very careful about in light of the \nenvironment in which we are doing these kinds of EIS's and studies is \nthat the work be done right. As the Senator from Oregon and I know, the \njudges and the environmental communities will be like vultures hovering \nover each one of those efforts to fine pick every bone to make sure the \nwork is done well.\n  Accelerating some of those studies could put at risk--I am not saying \n``will,'' but I think we need to be very cautious at this moment as we \ntry to wrestle through this very difficult policy issue between whether \nthe Eleventh Circuit is right or whether this Congress will finally get \naggressive enough to lead in changing the law in a way that we will not \nhave our judges administering forest policy through their own whim, be \nit law, or, in many instances, be it their politics as applied to the \nlaw that causes Eleventh Circuit or Ninth Circuit judges to do what \nthey have done recently that the Senator from Oregon is so worried \nabout, and that I, not only as the Senator from Idaho but as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, literally go \ninto the tank because the Congress of the United States has been \nunwilling to lead in this area and establish well-based policy that we \ncan effectively defend and are willing to defend. That is part of\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nthe problem we are dealing with, and I hope the work of the Senator \nfrom Oregon and me results in that.\n\n  Let me make a final comment to the Senator from Nevada. It was not my \nintent to make an inaccurate statement. As chairman of the Forests and \nPublic Land Management Subcommittee, I have spent the last several \nyears and 45 hearings looking at every aspect of the forest management \nof our country to try to understand it. I have examined, not in person \nand not on the ground, but all the studies of the Tahoe Basin problem. \nI recognize the basin problem is a combination of things, particular to \nforest density, that has resulted in dead and dying timber and drought \nenvironments of the kind discussed. This has created the negative \nhabitat today that changes the character of the lake's water quality \nbecause of the runoff. I also understand that this creates phenomenal \nbug problems with dead and dying trees because the ground cannot \nsupport the base.\n  As the Senator from Nevada and I know in looking at computer models, \nbefore European man came to this continent, many of the acreages we are \ntalking about were sparsely timbered and were much more pastoral. That \nwas partly because of fire moving through the habitat, creating a \nmosaic of young and old alike. The Tahoe Basin changed when we became \nthe stewards of the land and put out the fires.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I both agree on the condition of the \nTahoe Basin. The point I am trying to make: What the Senator is doing \nis, in fact, taking money away from the ability of the Tahoe Basin to \nmanage itself because the Tahoe Basin money is not a single-line item \nissue.\n  Let me explain. The Senator is amending an account that is divided \ninto three categories. I am looking now at Forest Service management \nprogram reports. In the timber revenues and expenses, there are three \ncategories. There is the timber commodity program component, there is \nthe forest stewardship program component, and the personal-use program \ncomponent. Those are the three that make up the account the Senator has \namended.\n  The last report we have is 1997. In that year, in the first account, \nthe timber commodity program account, the Senator is absolutely right, \nthe Tahoe Basin had not one dollar of revenue or expenses because it is \nnot a timber-producing area. In the stewardship area in revenues \nproduced by actions, about $377,000 and $1,383,000 spent on stewardship \nprograms--the very kind the Senator wants to see that begins to change \nthe culture, the environment, of the basin area. There was \napproximately $39 million in revenues from the personal-use program and \nabout $181 million in expenses.\n  I believe I am right. It was not my intent to mislead or to distort \nthe Record. The Senator and I should clarify this. This is the document \nfrom the Forest Service. The account the Senator amends and takes $34 \nmillion from is the account from which the stewardship programs from \nthe Tahoe Basin are funded. There is not a line item specific to the \nTahoe Basin that I know or that we can find in any research. If the \nSenator would clarify that--I think by accident he may well be cutting \nout the very moneys he has fought so hard to get to begin to ensure the \nforest health or the improved health of that basin area.\n  In our stewardship analysis of the basins that are in trouble around \nthe Intermountain West, and primarily the Great Basin environment of \nthe West--because that is where fire is a critical tool--let me read \nagain from the article ``One spark from a disaster.''\n\n       On adjacent lands just above the national forests the trees \n     remain vigorous and healthy with a similar history of early \n     forest clearing followed by fire suppression. These stands \n     have escaped the bug infestation and the high mortality of \n     the lower basin area [which is Federal land]. These privately \n     owned timber lands were intensively managed to ensure vigor \n     and high productivity. Unlike the Federal forest lands, \n     private timberland managers responded to the bottom line and \n     protected their forest assets over time.\n\n  My point is, what the Senator has appropriately advocated in getting \ninto the basin, to change the way it is managed, to bring stewardship \nprograms to do the thinning and to do the selective burn, absolutely \nhas to be done to restore the vigor, to create an ecosystem that is \nless dependent on moisture, so it can handle itself through the kinds \nof droughts that we in the West experience--especially those in Great \nBasin States.\n  If the Senator could clarify that for me, I would appreciate that. It \nis my knowledge at this moment that the account his amendment pulls \nmoney from is the very account from which the stewardship program for \nthe Tahoe Basin finds its funding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I thank the floor manager for an \nopportunity to respond.\n  When one looks at the totality of problems, they are tall: Runoff, \nthe erosion control, and the declining clarity. These are the primary, \nbut not the exclusive, problems in the basin.\n  The roads that were cut through many decades ago are in the road \nmaintenance account. As the Senator understands, there is a new \nconstruction account; there is a road maintenance account. The \nappropriators removed $11.3 million from the road maintenance account. \nFrom our perspective, that is the most serious account reduction that \nwould impact what we are talking about. The road maintenance money \naccount has a backlog: $3.85 billion has been discussed by the Forest \nService, or $431 million. I think it is a matter of priorities. Our \npriority is to get back the road maintenance account money.\n  Indeed, with respect to some of the prescribed burn and other forest \npractices the Senator talks about, I think we are in agreement that \nclearly there are things that need to be done to thin out some of the \nunderbrush. Those are taken care of in other accounts such as wildlife \nfire management and a forest land vegetation program.\n  There are a host of programs that are line item. The two I just \nmentioned, the wildlife fire management account and the forest land \nvegetation management program, are where some of the controlled burns \nand thinning occur. Those are the programs, from our point of view, \nthat have a priority over the Senator's priority which would lead to an \nincreased commercial operation.\n  That is where the Senator from Nevada comes from.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for responding.\n  It is important to understand that one third of that fund still goes \nto stewardship. That is not just commercial activity. That is thinning \nand cleaning.\n  Also, it is important for the Senate and the Record to show we \nincrease road maintenance by $10 million this year over last year. \nThere was a recommendation of $20 million; we increased it by $10 \nmillion. There has been an actual net increase of $11 million, and a \nfair amount goes to the Tahoe Basin.\n  So the Forest Service is responding. We believe the committee and the \nappropriators were responsible, going in the right direction. What I \nthink is important to say is that there were no cuts. We did not cut \nthe program. We raised the program by $10 million. While some suggested \nit ought to go $20 million, it is a net increase over last year's \nfunding level of $10 million.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I can respond briefly--I don't want to get into a \nsemantic game--it is a reduction over what the President recommended, I \nthink the Senator will agree. It is a reduction of $11.3 million over \nwhat the President proposed. It may very well be, as the Senator \nindicates, an increase over what was approved for the last program.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator knows recommendations are recommendations. I \nbelieve his first words were the program has been cut. The program has \nbeen increased by $10 million over last year while some, including the \nPresident, suggested it ought to be increased by more.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think I did use the term ``cut.'' What I meant to say, \nand what I stand by, is the appropriators, in effect, cut this money \nfrom the original appropriation of the President. That represents a \ndifference in priorities, the $431 million annual backlog, with a total \nbacklog of $3.85 billion. It would be the priority of the Senator from \nNevada that the President's recommendation not be reduced as the \nappropriators did, and I appreciate the chance to clarify that point.\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I believe, if I \nunderstand Forest Service accounts accurately, the likelihood of \nincreased stewardship activities in the Tahoe Basin by this amendment \ncould be reduced because of the very character of spreading the money, \nas I think the Senator from Arkansas so clearly spoke to.\n\n  Let me yield such time to the Senator from Montana as he should \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this morning as I returned from Montana \nand I was listening to the local news, I heard a 30-second spot \nadvising folks to call the White House to stand up, to stop this \ndisappearance of the national forest lands. It was paid for by the \nHeritage Forest--some group. We have not been able to run it down yet. \nThe message went on to say we have to stop this because our forests \nwill be gone forever.\n  We can talk about semantics. We can talk about budgets. We can talk \nabout where we apply the money. Let's face it; the $11 million for road \nmaintenance that we increased is mostly being used for road \nobliteration.\n  It seems we fight these little fights every year because there are \nthose who completely do not, and I say this in all disrespect, know one \nwhit about what is a renewable resource and how we are to manage it. It \nseems to me this is the reason a person on his ranch or farm does not \nrun that ranch or farm by a committee. If we did, we would not get a \ncrop in; we would not grow anything, and we sure would not get a crop \nharvested. I would say the good Lord above does have a sense of humor. \nIf you want to look at what a committee does, I always thought a horse \nwas a camel put together by a committee. Everything is an afterthought.\n  Let's dispel some of this myth that seems to be going across our \nland. In the Flathead National Forest alone, we are growing 120 million \nboard feet of lumber a year. The Forest Service, in their plans, only \nplanned to harvest 19 million. Let me tell you, due to laws and \nroadblocks and lawsuits, we will be lucky to cut 6 million board feet. \nThis does not include our wilderness areas or recreational areas. These \nare in managed forest areas. This is about a third of what historically \nhas been responsibly forested and harvested. However, due to litigation \nand other roadblocks, only 6 million will be harvested.\n  We cannot survive with that scenario and neither can the forest. \nUnderstand that. Neither can the forest. It will burn. Trees are \nsimilar to any other renewable crop: they sprout, they grow, they get \nold, and like every one of us in this building, they will die. What \nhappens to them? They hit the forest floor, there is a fuel buildup, \nthere is infestation by the pine beetle, there is dry weather, there is \nlightning, and there is fire. I realize that doesn't mean much to those \nof us who sit in this 17-square miles of logic-free environment because \nwe get our paycheck every 2 weeks. We are very comfortable. But out \nthere, their paychecks stop right then. Their equipment is burned up. \nThe cycle starts all over again. Is that an environmental benefit to \nthis country? I don't think so.\n  We have seen what happened in 1988 in Yellowstone National Park, the \ncrown jewel of all parks, we are told. Fire swept across that park; and \nyou should have seen the water that ran from that park for the next 3 \nyears because there was nothing to hold the soil that had been turned \nsterile by the heat of the fires.\n  So according to the misinformation thrown around by the self-\nproclaimed environmentalists, leaving the land to rot, they believe, is \nbest for the environment; the forests are gone forever whenever they \nare harvested. I wonder if they think it was all a barren land up here \nuntil one Friday we got up and, lo and behold, there was a forest. Just \nlike a bolt of lightning, it was there. When you get a haircut, is that \nhead of hair gone forever? To some it might be. Who knows. But I don't \nthink so. Currently, most of our national forests in Montana, and \nthroughout the West, we face a 25-percent tree mortality in the next 15 \nyears. We will lose 25 percent of our forests just to mortality, \ngetting old and dying.\n  So I am saying land management, proper land management saves our \nforests. I can take you to one of the worst areas there is in the \nForest Service--it happens to be up in northwest Montana--and even the \nforesters themselves will tell you that we are ashamed of the condition \nof this forest. But because of litigation, they are powerless to do \nanything about it. Fuel loads, beetle infestations, it is not a pretty \nsight.\n  It is not a pretty sight.\n  Healthy forests are usually the benefit of good management. \nHarvesting of timber is healthy, and it is all part of management. That \nis aside from the faces of the people who live in these forest \ncommunities. Two weeks ago, we shut down a mill in Darby, MT. We sold \nit at auction. Jobs are gone. A tax base is gone. The ability to build \nroads on private lands, to maintain services, and to build schools--all \nthat revenue is gone.\n  The opponents of timber production would have you believe we still \nclearcut entire forests when we do not do that anymore. They would have \nyou believe we have industrial lawn mowers big enough to mow down the \ngreat redwoods as we clear swaths from seed to seed, and we do not do \nthat anymore. In fact, there are more trees in this country than during \nthe time of Lewis and Clark. It is hard to believe, isn't it? But it is \ntrue.\n  When we put together this appropriation and this budget, there was \nbalance. It brought balance of wildlife, balance of timber and new \ntimber growth, balance of timber that we could harvest for the benefit \nof Americans, for those folks who build homes, and for those folks who \nwork with timber.\n  If one looks across the Nation right now, not many commodities are \nmaking money--gas, oil, no farm commodities. If you look at all the \nlitigation, timber is not making any money either. Anything that comes \nfrom mining is not making any money. Why should we do it? Where would \nthose industries move? What other land on this globe will be devastated \nbecause we are not allowed to manage our renewable resources?\n  I can remember dirt under the fingernails and the ability to produce \na crop every year was pretty honorable. Madam President, 1.5 million \nAmericans provide all the food and fiber for the other 260 million. \nThat is not bad. We do a pretty good job, and we do it under conditions \nthat are getting more and more difficult all the time.\n  Modern forestry, of course, with some rules and regulations passed by \nCongress, is being regulated more and more every day. Environmental \nlaws require foresters to take a look at the impact of what they are \ndoing. It employs independent timber firms that know the land. They are \nharvesting. All of this costs money, and yet they will say below-cost-\ntimber sales. If we lump all the rules and regulations, all the hoops \nwe have to jump through for one timber sale on a forest, it probably \ncould be called a below-cost-timber sale. Those are hoops we have to \njump through. So we increased the budget. It costs more money to \ncomplete a timber sale.\n  We do not clearcut areas with disregard. We spend more time making \nsure everything we do is done in a responsible manner. Dispel the \nmisinformation, get away from the inflammatory words of growing a \ncommodity and harvesting a commodity. In Montana, the people who \nharvest timber are the same ones who come back to hunt and fish. They \ndo it every weekend. They recreate all that same forest.\n  Contrary to the doomsayers, we want our land to be usable. We want \nhealthy wildlife populations, we want clean water, and we want to make \nsure our native fish are healthy.\n  Let's talk about this wildlife habitat. Most of the wildlife habitat \nis found on public land in the summertime. When they have to make it \nthrough the winter, do you know where the deer, the elk, the moose \nwinter? On private lands, in my neighbor's hay meadow. Did you know we \nhave to board up our haystacks in the West or the elk and the deer will \neat all the hay and leave us none for our own livestock? They do not \nwinter on public lands because there is no water and there is no feed. \nIt is covered up. They have to winter on private lands. So are we so \nbad? I do not think so. We would not have it any other way because we \nare all hunters and fishermen and we enjoy the sights\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\nof big game. We want to maintain the habitat. We enjoy seeing those \nelk. We enjoy this season of the year when they start bugling. Go out \nand listen. That is what makes my State worth living in.\n\n  It costs more money and the timber sale budget offers us an \nopportunity to feed our Nation's need for raw materials while employing \nMontanans and making and protecting habitat. We are talking about \nbalance. Someone is buying that lumber or we would not have the demand \nto harvest it.\n  Harvesting a crop is not a sin. To the contrary, it keeps this \ncountry moving forward. It provides the timber to build our homes, and \nit provides the paper that often gets shuffled back and forth in this \ntown. Quite simply, a timber sale budget is essential to America for \nfood and fiber by proud producers. That is what it is all about. They \ndo not like to be lied to. They do not even require much support. They \nask very little. They ask to grow, to plant, nurture, and harvest. That \nis what it is all about.\n  How did those people who work in natural resources and agriculture--\nand this is agriculture in its highest form--who are responsible for 22 \nor 23 percent of the Nation's GDP become bad folks? How did we get that \nway? Because we used the resources around us, and our definition of \nconservation is the wise use of a natural renewable resource. Think \nabout that. Twenty-three percent of the GDP in this Nation is in the \nproduction and the feeding of this country. It is unbelievable how that \ncan be overlooked.\n  I ask my colleagues to contemplate the alternative. Let's say we quit \nharvesting trees in America, and that is what some extremist groups \nwant us to do, or they want to make it so expensive we cannot compete \non the open market. Do you realize that I have mills in Montana that \nare hauling logs 500 miles, out of where? Canada. So is your demand for \nlumber so high that you want to so-called devastate the Canadian land? \nI do not think so.\n  Why do people like to visit States such as Montana? No. 1, we are \nkind of authentic. Because we have done a pretty good job of taking \ncare of it. And it is true of our good neighbors to the west in Idaho. \nIt makes us the friendliest and the nicest people you will ever meet. \nBut our people are starting to get cranky because their livelihood is \nbeing taken away from them, their ability to take care of themselves, \nby the rest of the country in its desire for the food and fiber that it \ntakes for us to subsist.\n  So if you want to see our forests die in front of us, if you want to \nsee our wildlife choked out of its habitat, and if you want to see our \nrural communities die, and to see foreign corporate timber production \nunfettered, fueled by our need for fiber, then vote for the Bryan \namendment. That is what it is all about.\n  But there is balance here. I urge my colleagues to vote to maintain \nthat balance. We believe in the balance of our forest lands and good \nstewardship.\n  If you want to talk about stewardship, we have a stewardship plan \nthat is getting started on a trial basis in Montana that is being \nparticipated in by a lot of people, including very small harvesters. So \nif you say you want a stewardship program, you have one. It is a good \none. It is a dandy. It will work. But we cannot make it work unless we \nhave funds to balance the needs of our forests.\n  I thank the Chair and my chairman and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non or in relation to the pending amendment No. 1623 at 10 a.m., and the \ntime between 9:30 and 10 a.m. on Tuesday be equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will take a very short while.\n  I think the details, the information of this issue have been well \ndiscussed. But I rise in strong opposition to what is being proposed \nbased simply on the health of forests.\n  In Wyoming, of course, we have national forests, as they do in \nPennsylvania and other places. These forests need to be managed. I just \nspent several days in August in Yelowstone National Park. We road for 2 \ndays, and all of it was in burnt forests. I have to tell you, that burn \nwas not even effective because the ground fuel is still there. The \ntrees are dead, but the ground fuel is there.\n  So all I am saying is, you have to manage this resource. Something \nwill happen to the trees. They will either die or they will be \nharvested or they will be diseased. So if we are to have healthy \nforests, certainly they need to be managed.\n  The proponents of the amendment have said the timber program is \nwasteful. It was never intended to operate as a commercial tree farm. \nWe have some numbers as to the resources that are provided for \ncommunities and the Federal Government. They are substantial.\n  I am not inclined to take a great deal of time. The chief of the \nForest Service has stated there are 40 million acres of national \nforests which are at risk, either through fire or infestation. This \namendment would cripple the Forest Service's ability to use the timber \nharvest to promote health. The amendment will crush a program that \nprovides significant economic contributions to both the Federal \nGovernment and the communities. This amendment is wrong. It is \nshortsighted. I question why the Congress would continue to ask the \nagency to manage this land and then take away their ability to do that.\n  So I will end by urging Members not to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If there is no objection, I would like to amend my \nimmediate past unanimous consent request. It was from 9:30 to 10 a.m. \ntomorrow morning equally divided. I ask unanimous consent to amend that \nto be from 9:30 until 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania on \nthis most important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, it isn't often I rise to talk about \nthese kinds of issues because, by and large, these issues generally \naffect the West, and we in Pennsylvania do not have much direct \ninvolvement. But in this case we are directly affected in Pennsylvania.\n  We have a national forest in Pennsylvania, the Allegheny National \nForest. What has been going on in the Allegheny National Forest over \nthe past several years has been a very troubling thing to thousands of \nresidents in my State; it has had a dramatic negative impact on the \nquality of life for the residents in northwestern and north central \nPennsylvania, as the amount of timber harvests have continued to \ndecline.\n  What we have seen, as a result of that, is a real damaging of the \neconomy. It is a very rural area. Most people think of Pennsylvania and \nthink of big cities and factories, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. But \nPennsylvania has the largest rural population of any State in the \ncountry. I repeat that. Pennsylvania has the largest rural population \nof any State in the country.\n  That rural population, by and large, survives on agriculture and off \nthe natural resources, whether it is coal mining or whether it is \nquarrying or whether it is timber or whether it is what we consider \ntraditional agriculture.\n  The Allegheny National Forest is vitally important for several of our \nsmallest counties. We have 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Our smallest \ncounty in population, oddly enough, is called Forest County. Forest \nCounty has about 4,000 or 5,000 people who live there. The biggest part \nof it is the national forest, the Allegheny National Forest. But there \nare other counties surrounding it that have bits and pieces of the \nnational forest in their county: Warren County, McKean County, and Elk \nCounty.\n  In Elk County, PA--aptly named--we have about 600 elk, big ones, that \nhave\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\ncome back over the past years and are thriving in our forests, almost \nto the point of being domesticated in some respects and causing \nproblems. But that is another issue for another day.\n  But those four counties get a lot of revenue because big chunks of \nthem are national forest areas. They get a lot of revenues from the \ntimber sales that principally support their school districts.\n  I spoke to students at the Forest County schools a couple of weeks \nago. The No. 1 issue that the kids asked me about was, what are we \ngoing to do about timber sales? Because they potentially will have to \nclose down one of their schools because of cuts in the Forest Service \nbudget, as well as lawsuits because of the Indiana bat, which, I guess, \nstays up in the Allegheny National Forest for a couple days a year, so \nthere are all sorts of lawsuits tying up the Allegheny National Forest \nin harvesting.\n  The Allegheny National Forest is the single largest area for the \nharvesting of black cherry timber. You look at your black cherry veneer \nand you will see a lot of it comes from the largest black cherry stand \nin the country, which is the Allegheny National Forest.\n  The Allegheny National Forest, by the way, is a profitable forest. \nThey make a lot of money in their timber sales because of high value \ntrades. So they are not losing any money to anybody. They are making a \nlot of money. In fact, the less we harvest, the worse off we are \nfinancially.\n  It has been very deleterious to those counties. I will look at the \ntimber receipts for the past several years. Even last year, which was \nnot particularly a great year, we had $1.6 million for Warren County; \n$1.5 million for McKean County; $1.3 million--$1.3 million for a county \nof 4,000 people is a lot of money.\n  All these other counties range in the area of 20-, 30,000 people; Elk \nCounty, 1.26. All of them, every one of those counties, will have their \nrevenues cut by more than half this year, by more than half because of \nlegal roadblocks and cutbacks in the amount of timber sales as a result \nof Federal legislation.\n  The problems we confront are not just financial in terms of tax \nrevenue. They are financial, but they are also financial with respect \nto our economy. Logging is a very important aspect of the way of life. \nWood products: Because of our high-value black cherry and other \nspecies, we have a lot of high-value processing of that wood, which is \nresulting in very high unemployment. Many of these areas, in this very \nstrong economy, are experiencing double-digit unemployment, and have \nconsistently for the past couple of years.\n  We also have another concern which, again, when you go up and talk to \nthe folks who live around the forests, is almost frightening, the kind \nof misinformation that is out there about our forests and the \nmanagement of the forests.\n  I remember going to Gray Towers, which is outside of Milford, PA. \nGray Towers was the home of Gifford Pinchot, who was the Governor of \nPennsylvania and was a conservationist. Gifford Pinchot went on to be \nthe first head of the U.S. Forest Service around the turn of the \ncentury. The Yale School of Forestry was actually colocated in Milford, \nPA, at Gray Towers, which was the mansion the Pinchot family lived in. \nNow it is a museum dedicated to forestry. I was up there looking at old \npictures of Pennsylvania. It is remarkable. In picture after picture \nafter picture, Pennsylvania was completely clearcut--clearcut.\n  I stood on the front porch of Gray Towers and looked out and saw the \nexpanse. You can see literally for miles. I looked at the picture on \nthe portico of roughly 100 years ago. It literally was stumps of trees \nfor as far as the eye could see. Of course, now it is green as far as \nthe eye can see, full of trees.\n  Pennsylvania is just remarkable. I fly over it all the time in small \nplanes. It is just literally covered with trees, almost all of which, \nif not all of which--because I have been told it was completely \nclearcut--were not there 100 years ago. So the regeneration happens. In \nfact, the Allegheny National Forest is a valuable forest today because \nit was clearcut and because a shade-resistant strain of black cherry \ncouldn't grow in those old forests. In fact, there are areas that are \nnow dedicated to old growth in the Allegheny National Forest that have \na lot less diversity.\n  People are worried about the health of the forest, environmental \ndiversity. You get to some of these old-growth forests. You take the \ncombination of the old growth and the fact that you have less \nvegetation, which puts pressure on your deer and everything else--we \nhave a lot of deer. They completely decimate old-growth forests, where \nit is a desert there because of these high trees. You don't have a lot \nof younger growth. Whatever does crop up, because there isn't much else \naround, the deer take it right out.\n  So we went, in this area called the heart of the forest, when they \ndedicated it to old growth, from 37 varieties of plants down to 4. I \ndon't know about you, but I am not too sure that is protecting the \nenvironment or the health of the environment.\n\n  I am an easterner. I am not one of these guys who understands public \nlands and forests and all that stuff. I grew up around the city of \nPittsburgh and didn't know too much about forests. But I remember \nhearing people say: We have to manage the forest. You say: Forests \nmanage themselves pretty well. What do you mean? Well, yes, forests \nmanage themselves pretty well, but they manage themselves not in a way \nthat you and I would consider them. They manage it through, in a sense, \na boom-and-bust cycle, growth and then destruction and then growth and \nthen destruction. That is pretty much how forests grow if you leave \nthem alone. That is OK, I guess. But it doesn't provide what is, I \nthink, in the best interest of the animal life and the plant life and \ncertainly the community for recreation. The economic resources that are \nderived from the forest are not maximized when you allow this kind of \nwild and unmanaged forest generation and regeneration to occur.\n  I trust the Forest Service. I don't always agree with them, but I \ntrust the Forest Service will work to maintain forests and wisely \nmanage them, using sound science to provide the best environment for \nstable growth of the forest as well as for the indigenous animal \nspecies that are there to feed. It is very serious--it is the No. 1 \nissue in about 5 or 6 counties in my State--that we allow the timber \nharvesting program to continue. It is the economic lifeblood of those \ncounties.\n  I felt compelled to give a little different perspective, as someone \nwho doesn't talk to these issues very much--and maybe it is best I \ndon't--but who has a real sensitivity as to what sounds good. As I have \ntold people about what sounds good in suburban Philadelphia, saying \nleave these trees alone, we love the trees, don't hurt the trees, a \nlittle knowledge is dangerous sometimes and no knowledge is downright \nlethal. And in the case of dealing with forest management, a lot of \nfolks don't have a darn bit of knowledge. And it is killing people. It \nis killing their economy. It is killing their school districts. It is \nkilling the forests.\n  That is not something we should allow to go unchallenged in Congress. \nJust because it makes a good TV commercial, just because it sounds as \nif you care more, you don't care more if you understand the facts \ninvolved in forest management.\n  I am an enthusiastic opponent of this amendment. I must tell you, \nwhen I first got to Congress, I was not. But the more I have learned \nabout forest management and the impact of timber sales on not only the \nhealth of the forest but the health of the economy related to the \nforest, it is an absolute must for me to stand here and oppose this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in the few minutes remaining, I wish to \nadd my voice to those in opposition to this amendment. We thank the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for his sensitivity to these issues.\n  As he correctly said, this amendment could be devastating to the \npeople and to the families who depend on their jobs in many counties \nacross America. I think it is important that we understand this \namendment in the context in which it is being proposed. Federal timber \nsales are in a steep and devastating decline. Since the early 1990s, \nthe timber program has been reduced in America by over 70 percent. \nAlready, more than 75 percent of the National\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\nForest System is off limits to timber harvests. The Federal timber \nsupply has dropped from 12 billion board feet to the 3 billion board \nfeet being harvested today.\n  Both the economic and the ecological context created by this \nreduction are not desirable. More than 80,000 jobs have been lost \nalready, and of the 55,000 jobs that remain, they will be jeopardized \nby this amendment. That represents over $2 billion in employment \nincome, mostly in rural parts of America. The families who depend on \nthose jobs are counting on us to understand this issue and to vote \ncorrectly.\n  It is confounding also that these additional cuts are being \nconsidered at a time when the industry and those working men and women \nwho depend on it have already been deeply hurt by the critical cuts in \nthe timber program.\n  In my home State of Idaho, our rural communities continue to suffer \ndevastating reductions in the 25 percent funds from timber sales. \nSchools are going without needed renovation, and county governments are \ngoing without needed support and jeopardizing their basic services \nbecause of these steep reductions.\n  This amendment is also counterintuitive from an environmental \nperspective. Active forest management, including thinning and other \ntimber harvest, has widely acknowledged benefits. In fact, most timber \nsales are currently designed to attain other stewardship objectives, in \naddition to the sales themselves. Timber sales are the most economic \nand efficient and effective methods available for our managers to treat \nand control many insect epidemics.\n  Madam President, each year the National Forest System grows by 23 \nbillion board feet; 6 billion board feet die naturally. Only 3 billion \nboard feet are being harvested. Tree growth in our National Forest \nSystem exceeds harvest by 600 percent.\n  I stand firmly with those who have cast their opposition today \nagainst this amendment and encourage my colleagues to reject it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10769-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10769-S10771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPLORING THE GRANTING OF CLEMENCY--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise to express my strong opposition \nto the President's decision to commute the prison terms of 16 members \nof the FALN, a Puerto Rican terrorist group. I also strongly support \nS.J. Res. 33, which expresses the Senate's opposition to this misguided \ndecision.\n  There is no question that the President has the Constitutional power \nto do what he did. The President receives thousands of requests per \nyear for a pardon or clemency, and the Department of Justice has a \nstandard procedure under which the Pardon Attorney reviews these \nrequests each year. However, all indications are that the procedures \nwere not followed in these cases, and that these cases were anything \nbut routine.\n  News reports indicate that the Justice Department did not make a \nrecommendation for or against clemency in these cases like it normally \ndoes. There is no excuse for the Department to stand neutral on very \nsignificant requests such as these. Also, the terrorists apparently did \nnot personally take the proper steps to seek the relief, given that one \nof the conditions for clemency was that the prisoners had to sign \nstatements requesting it.\n  Although the White House says the members were not convicted of \ncommitting murder or physical injury, it is clear that these criminals \nwere actively involved in the militant group. Making bombs and \ntransporting firearms designed to carry out the reign of terror, or \ncommitting armed robbery to finance the deeds, is not fundamentally \ndifferent from personally harming innocent victims. They were \nconspirators in the FALN, a terrorist group, and they received stiff \nprison terms for good reasons.\n  News reports indicate that the law enforcement organizations that \nreviewed the issue, including the FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons, \nrecommended against it. Also, law enforcement organizations have \nexpressed strong opposition.\n  The opposition is based on good reasons. America has long had a firm \npolicy of intolerance regarding terrorism. Granting clemency to members \nof the FALN sends the wrong message about America's commitment to \nfighting terrorism. In fact, it sends the wrong message about America's \ncommitment to fighting crime at home.\n  It is telling that the FALN terrorists did not immediately agree to \nthe simple conditions that the President placed on his generous offer. \nIt took them weeks to agree to renounce the use of violence and submit \nto standard conditions of parole. Indeed, some never did. Moreover, it \ndoes not appear that they have even expressed regret or remorse for \ntheir crimes. This is clear from one of the members' appearance on a \nSunday news program, where he refused to express sorrow or regret for \nhis crimes.\n  An obvious question we must ask is whether the President will \ncontinue to grant clemency in a way contrary to American interests. I \nsincerely hope the President will not pardon or commute the sentence of \nconvicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. I sent the President a letter \nlast week asking him to clearly affirm that he will not do this.\n  I hope the Senate today will invoke cloture on the resolution and \nexpress our profound opposition and concern regarding this matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Hispanic whose actions and fate I \nwould like the Senate to focus on for action is Richard Paez. Richard \nPaez has never been convicted of a crime and is not associated with the \nFALN. He is not a petitioner seeking presidency clemency. Rather, he is \na judicial nominee who has been awaiting consideration and confirmation \nby the Senate since January 1996--for over 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The vacancy for which Judge Paez was nominated became a judicial \nemergency during the time his nomination has been pending without \naction by the Senate. His nomination was first received by the Senate \nalmost 44 months ago. This nomination has now been held even longer \nthan the unconscionable 41 months this Senate forced Judge William \nFletcher to wait before confirming his nomination last October.\n  Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate \ncalendar. He was delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a \nconfirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the \nJudiciary Committee in March 1998, his nomination was held on the \nSenate Executive Calendar without action for over 7 months, for the \nremainder of the last Congress.\n  Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his \nnomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee \nuntil late July, when we were able to have his nomination reported \nagain. The Senate refused to consider the nomination before the August \nrecess. I have repeatedly urged the Republican leadership to call this \nnomination up for consideration and a vote. If they can make time on \nthe Senate floor for debate and consideration of a Senate resolution \ncommenting on the clemency grant, which is a power the Constitution \ninvested in the President without a congressional role, the Senate \nshould find time to consider the nomination of this fine Hispanic \njudge.\n  Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a \n``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He has \nserved as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a federal judge for \nfour years.\n  In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to \nprovide legal services and access to our justice system for those \nwithout the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work \nwith the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law \nand Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for nine years should \nbe a source of praise and pride.\n  Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges familiar \nwith his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an \nimpressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, \nthe Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los \nAngeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' \nAssociation; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\n  The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this \nnomination for what now amounts to years.\n  I want to commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \nsteadfast support of this nominee and Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein of California for their efforts on his behalf.\n  Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were \nringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration \nof judicial nomination. He had written: ``Some current nominees have \nbeen waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote \nor a final floor vote. . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation \nto confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for \ninquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' Those words resonate \nwith respect to the nomination of Judge Paez.\n  I trust the American people recognize who is playing politics with \nthe issue of clemency. I disagreed with the President's decision, but \nit was his to make. He says that he granted clemency with conditions \nafter study and based on a sense of proportion and justice. The calls \nfor clemency in these cases came from Bishop Tutu, Coretta Scott King, \nother Nobel peace prize winners, a number of churches and religious \ngroups. It has drawn praise in some circles and criticism in others.\n  I do not agree with the President, but I caution that the \noverreaching by Republican critics in the Congress on this is \nworrisome, as well. To contend that this shows a weakness of resolve \nagainst international terrorism is both wrong and may itself be \ncreating a dangerous atmosphere.\n  We ought to be careful when anyone, let alone the Senate and Congress \nof the United States, start bandying about declarations that accuse the \nUnited States Government of making ``deplorable concessions to \nterrorists,'' ``undermining national security'' or ``emboldening \ndomestic and international terrorists.''\n  Playing politics with this matter and accusing the President of \n``undermining our national security'' or ``emboldening terrorists'' \ncarries significant risks. Could a potential terrorist somewhere in the \nworld believe this political rhetoric and be ``emboldened'' by it? This \nis risky business. I do not believe the short-term political gain to \nthe other party is worth having the Senate endorse a resolution that \nmight itself have precisely that effect.\n  The Senate cannot find time to vote on the nomination of Judge \nRichard Paez or that of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division \nof that of Justice Ronnie White to be a federal judge in Missouri or \nany of the scores of other nominees pending before it. The Senate has \nnot completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that must be \npassed before October 1. The Republican Congress cannot find time to \nconsider campaign finance reform or pass a real patients' bill of \nrights or consider raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or \ncomplete the juvenile crime bill conference, but there is plenty of \ntime for floor debate and on the President's decision to exercise his \nclemency power. The Senate has had three hearings on judicial \nnominations all year and the Republican Congress will have that many \nhearings on the clemency decision this week.\n  In closing, I ask: If the Senate has the time to debate and vote on \nthis resolution, why does it not have time to vote on the nomination of \nJudge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to address Senate Joint \nResolution 33, regarding the President's granting of conditional \nclemency to certain Puerto Rican prisoners.\n  Before addressing the merits of this resolution, I must note that I \nam troubled by the procedure which has been employed for its \nconsideration. Almost two weeks ago, Senator Coverdell announced that \nhe would hold a hearing on President Clinton's decision in the \nTerrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, this \ncoming Wednesday, September 15. Last Wednesday, the Judiciary Committee \nalso gave notice of a hearing on this subject for September 15. \nHowever, notwithstanding these planned hearings, the Republican \nleadership filed this resolution condemning the clemency and scheduled \na vote related to it for today.\n  Holding a vote before the hearings is akin to having the verdict \nfirst, and then the trial.\n  Nevertheless, since we must vote, I will address the merits of the \nPresident's decision, based upon the information which is available to \nme before the hearings.\n  At the outset, let me say that serious, thoughtful people urged the \nPresident to offer this clemency. These people include former President \nCarter; eleven Nobel Peace Prize winners, including Archbishop Desmond \nTutu and Coretta Scott King; and dozens of religious leaders and \norganizations. President Clinton's decision was not a frivolous one, \nnor did it appear from out of thin air.\n  However, that having been said, I believe strongly that the decision \nthe President made was the wrong one.\n  In the post-Cold War era, terrorism presents perhaps the greatest \nthreat to our national security. As Ranking Member of the Terrorism \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I have done what I can to \nassist law enforcement in combating terrorism.\n  These prisoners were terrorists, and granting them leniency is \nexactly the wrong thing to do. We have tried in recent years to send a \nclear, unequivocal message to terrorists: if you plan or commit acts of \nterrorism against the United States, we will find you, hunt you down, \nand punish you severely. Until this point, President Clinton's \nadministration carried this message forward forcefully, including, for \nexample, apprehending and punishing the Oklahoma City bombers and \ntaking retaliatory strikes against Osama bin laden. However, the \nPresident's decision last month undermines this message.\n  Some have described these prisoners as political prisoners. They were \nnot. They were terrorists. Let me describe for a minute some of what \nthey did.\n  These prisoners were members of the FALN, the Armed Forces for \nNational Liberation, which seeks to make Puerto Rico and independent \nnation, through violent means. While some of them will not admit it, \nthis was alleged and proven in the trials against them.\n  According to the FBI, and I quote, ``In the past, Puerto Rican \nterrorist groups struggling for Puerto Rico's independence from the \nUnited States have been responsible for the majority of terrorist \nincidents perpetrated by domestic terrorist groups within the United \nStates.'' The FBI's Terrorist Research and Analytical Center reported \nin 1996 that the ``FALN has been linked to over 130 bombings which have \nresulted in over $3.5 million in damages, 5 deaths, and 84 injuries.''\n  The prisoners who received clemency were active participants in this \ncampaign of terror. For instance, Alejandrina Torres, Edwin Cortes and \nAlberto Rodriguez were convicted of conspiring to, and I read now from \nthe indictment against them, ``oppose by force the authority of the \ngovernment of the United States by means of force, terror and violence, \nincluding the construction and planting of explosive and incendiary \ndevices at banks, stores, office buildings and government buildings . . \n. It was a further part of the said conspiracy that the conspirators \nwould claim credit in the name of the FALN for certain . . . bombings \nthrough either telephone calls or typed communiques.'' This is classic \nterrorist activity.\n  As part of this plot, Torres and Cortes stockpiled dynamite, weapons, \nblasting caps and bulletproof vests. Together with Rodriguez, they \nplanned to bomb U.S. military facilities in the Chicago, cased the \nfacilities, and reviewed a communique to be published in conjunction \nwith the planned bombings. They built bombs containing 21 pounds of \ndynamite. They also planned to use explosives to free FALN leader Oscar \nLopez (who also was offered clemency by the President) from prison, to \nrob a Chicago Transit Authority facility to fund FALN operations, and \nto harbor another FALN leader who had escaped from prison.\n  Four others who were offered clemency were convicted in connection \nwith\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\nthe armed robbery of seven million dollars from a Wells Fargo depot, to \nfund a similar Puerto Rican revolutionary independence group, Los \nMacheteros. This is an organization that ambushed a Navy bus and killed \ntwo U.S. servicemen and launched a rocket attack at the federal \ncourthouse in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.\n  Madam President, building bombs and committing armed robberies on \nU.S. soil are not political acts. They are crimes, plain and simple, \nand these people were appropriately locked up for their offenses. It \nshould make no difference that the prisoners had political motivations \nwhich some may share. Virtually all terrorists are politically \nmotivated, and many justify their acts in the cause of ``national \nliberation.'' But terrorism is a cowardly and evil means to achieve \nsuch ends, which can never be justified, and which must be punished \nharshly.\n  It has been reported that the clemency petition was opposed by the \nFBI and the Bureau of Prisons. The Fraternal Order of Police has \nvehemently condemned this offer, calling it a ``horrendously bad \nidea.''\n  Clemency proponents have asserted that these prisoners harmed no one. \nA former Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted some of these FALN \nmembers counters this assertion, noting: ``A few dedicated federal \nagents are the only people who stood in their way. The conspirators \nmade every effort to murder and to maim. It is no small irony that they \nshould be freed under the guise of humanitarianism.''\n  History has shown us that making concessions to terrorists spurs \nincreased terrorism. The President made the wrong decision. I hope and \npray that his decision will not have this effect, but I fear it will.\n  Despite the flawed procedure, I will vote to proceed to Senate Joint \nResolution 33, and I will subsequently vote for its passage. Terrorism \ndoes not deserve leniency.\n Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the President's ill-considered \noffer of clemency has now been accepted by 12 of the 16 FALN members, \nmany of whom are now back on the street.\n  These are people who have been convicted of very serious offenses \ninvolving sedition, firearms, explosives, and threats of violence. The \nFALN has claimed responsibility for past bombings that have killed and \nmaimed American citizens. I pray that no one else gets hurt.\n  This is yet another example of this Administration sending the wrong \nmessage to criminals--be they foreign spies, gun offenders, or--in this \ncase--terrorists.\n  In this case, it appears President Clinton put the interests of these \nconvicted criminals ahead of the interests of victims, the law \nenforcement community, and the public.\n  I think we need to know: Did Attorney General Janet Reno do her job?\n  Media reports suggest that--notwithstanding the strong opposition of \nprosecutors, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the victims of crime, \nthe Department of Justice and the Attorney General apparently did not \ntake a formal position on the matter even though the Department's own \nrules require doing so.\n  Here we have another example of what people suspect: The Attorney \nGeneral is asleep at the switch while the White House runs the Justice \nDepartment.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee with oversight of the Department \nof Justice, I have requested copies of all relevant documents, \nincluding the Department's memo to the White House. Even our colleague \nSenator Schumer believes we should have these documents. But, so far, \nthe Department has refused to turn over anything.\n  The Department and the Attorney General are hiding behind their \ntired, old ploy of studying whether to assert executive privilege. If \nthe President has confidence that his decision was a just one, then he \nought to be willing to hold it up to public scrutiny.\n  I will hold a hearing on the matter next Wednesday, September 15, at \nwhich time we will hear from the law enforcement community and those \nnegatively affected by this grant of clemency.\n  I believe, Madam President, that our entire nation is victimized by \nterrorism. A bomb at the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City Federal \nBuilding, or a U.S. embassy abroad has an effect on all of us.\n  This clemency deal is an insult to every American citizen. This \nclemency deal is not humanitarian; it is not just.\n  Exactly what is this? A weak moment? Political favoritism? Another \nforeign policy miscalculation?\n  I'll tell you what it is--it is wrong.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in view of the fact that seven of \nour Members are missing, I ask unanimous consent to move the cloture \nvote to tomorrow following the votes at 10:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Under the previous order, \nthere will now be 5 minutes of debate equally divided between the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask if Senator Hutchison would like to \ngo first?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I prefer to reserve my time and \nclose.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, may we have order in the Chamber, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point is well taken. Senators will take \ntheir conversations to the Cloakroom, please.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have taken the Senate's time on this \nmatter. Here is why: I simply care about the Senate too much to see it \nbe a party to a deliberate scheme by just 5 percent of the oil \ncompanies to underpay their royalty payments to our constituents. The \nHutchison amendment allows the situation to continue by stopping the \nInterior Department from fixing it.\n  How do we know taxpayers are being cheated? First, there are many \nwhistleblowers, former oil executives, who say under oath they \nundervalued the oil from Federal lands in order to pay less.\n  Second, settlements are occurring all over the country whereby these \noil companies are paying billions of dollars in back royalties to keep \ntheir cases out of court.\n  Senator Hutchison has said the Interior Department wants to raise \ntaxes on the oil companies. Royalties are not taxes; they are legal \nagreements just as your mortgage or rent is. As USA Today says:\n\n       Imagine if one day you decided to lower your rent by 10 \n     percent. No individual could do that. And yet the oil \n     companies are.\n\n  You may hear all we need is more time, but this is the fourth rider \nthis Senate has passed, although we have never had a vote on it before. \nThis is the first vote. We have already lost $88 million from the \nDepartment of the Interior because of it. These companies should do \nwhat 95 percent of them are already doing, base their royalty payments \non fair market value.\n  Senator Hutchison has said the oil companies are suffering now and it \nis bad timing to fix this. I voted, and most of us did, for a bill to \nhelp the oil companies. That is fine. But royalty payments must be \ncollected and because they are based on fair market value, they do go \ndown when oil prices are depressed. That is a better deal than most \nAmericans get on their mortgages or their rent.\n  You may hear about a court case in California that the oil companies \nwon. But that had nothing to do with Federal oil royalties; it was \nabout State royalties.\n  Finally, the Hutchison amendment is not in the House bill because \nthis is an appropriations bill, and the Hutchison amendment will strip \nanother $66 million out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We \nneed those funds very much. Senator Hutchison says it is just $10 \nmillion. Interior and OMB say $66 million. Regardless, it is a bad \nrider. I hope you will not vote for cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nBreaux.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding. In \njust 60 seconds, it is unfortunate we are voting with a number of \nSenators absent. I guess we will have to do that.\n  The question is, How do we value oil? The law says the companies owe \nthe Federal Government, taxpayers, one-sixth to one-eighth of the value \nof the oil. The problem is, how do you determine the value? It is a \nvery complicated rulemaking procedure that is ongoing to try to \ndetermine what are the legitimate deductions and transportation costs, \nin particular, determining what the fair market value of oil is. We can \nrush this thing through. It will result in years of litigation. Or we \ncan pause for a few moments, which is what we are asking to be done, to \ntry to negotiate out something to which both sides can agree. I think \nit makes more sense to pause for a few moments, get the groups together \nand work it out, rather than run the risk of years and years of \nlitigation. We know what is going to happen then. Nobody is going to \nwin. The American public is not going to win.\n  I urge we support the Hutchison amendment and get it done in a more \nrealistic and fair fashion.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I rise in support of the Hutchison-Domenici amendment \nbecause the MMS's procedures are flawed. Department of the Interior \nemployees involved in the writing of the regulations received $300,000 \neach from a group that had interests contrary to those of the oil and \ngas firms.\n  It is wrong on substance. I will just give one example showing it is \nflawed. A producer from one oil well producing one kind of oil would be \nforced to value his oil ten different ways under this MMS proposal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Hutchison's \namendment to keep the Department of Interior from spending additional \nmoney for one year to implement their flawed oil valuation regulation. \nI am a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Our amendment does two things: First, it puts the Senate on record \nopposing a Value-added Tax proposed by the executive branch. Second, it \nprevents MMS from implementing a rule that is so corrupt the Interior \nDepartment's inspector general and the Department of Justice are \ncurrently investigating $700,000 in payoffs to federal employees \ninvolved in the rule.\n  The CBO scored the impact of this amendment at $11 million. This is \nthe apparent cost of standing up for Congress' constitutional \nprerogative to raise revenues.\n  The domestic oil and gas industry is being driven from our shores. \nDuring the oil embargo in 1973, we imported 36 percent of our oil. \nToday, we import 56 percent of our oil. We will continue to burn oil--\nin fact, we burn a bit more now than we did in 1973. But our own \nindustry is in a death spiral, caused in part by government actions \nlike this. Over 50,000 American families have lost their jobs in the \nlast two years as companies leave the U.S. for foreign shores--foreign \nshores where it's cheaper to drill and governments encourage domestic \nenergy production.\n  Without adoption of the Hutchison amendment, we will be saying: ``Go \nahead. Raise royalties and taxes. We, the U.S. Senate, yield our power \nto the Executive.'' This Senator cannot stand by and watch all power \nflow to the Executive.\n\n\n                      ``Rent-A-Rule''--POGO, etc.\n\n  Neither can this Senator stand aside when there are serious \nallegations of payoffs to government employees involved in the rule.\n  In May of this year, the press began to report that two federal \nemployees--one at the Department of Interior; the other, retired from \nthe Department of energy--had taken $700,000 from a self-described \n``public interest group'' as an ``award'' for their work in the federal \ngovernment on the rule to raise royalty rates on domestic oil \nproducers. This group, the project on Government Oversight, or POGO, \nhas not been very effective in its membership drive--it has only about \n200 subscribers--but it has been very successful attracting trial \nlawyers as board members. In fact, the trial lawyers on its board have \nspent years litigating the very cases on oil value that the proposed \nDOI rule would benefit if the Boxer Amendment is adopted.\n  The inspector general and the U.S. Department of Justice public \nIntegrity Section are investigating these payments.\n  In two letters to the Secretary of Interior, Senators Domenici, \nNickles, and I have asked the Department to withdraw the proposed rule \npending the outcome of the investigations into\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\nwhether the employees can take money for ``fixing'' a rule. The \nDepartment has declined to do so twice.\n  In answering our first letter, DOI said the two had nothing to do \nwith the rule. Senators Domenici, Nickles, and I wrote back, this time \nproviding public documents proving their involvement, and asking them, \nbased upon the evidence, to withdraw the rule.\n  The response to our second letter was to acknowledge that the two \napparently did have some involvement in the rule, but the decision to \nchange the rule was made prior to their official involvement.\n  The Department's argument is misleading. The two federal employees \nworked hand-in-glove with POGO to convince the Department to craft a \nrule to POGO's liking. According to POGO's Executive Director, POGO \neven arranged for the employees to be specifically requested to testify \nbefore a House subcommittee to put pressure on the Department to start \na rulemaking.\n  All the facts suggest that these employees were influential, if not \ninstrumental, in the decision to issue the rule and the content of the \nrule. After influencing the decision to issue the rule, the employees \ntook part in the public comment phase of the rulemaking. In other \nwords, they were up to their elbows in this issue from start to finish.\n  A skeptic could conclude that the employees, working with POGO and \nthe trial attorneys who stood to gain from out-of-court settlements, \nearned their ``rewards.'' POGO, after all, admits they paid them \n$350,000 each. The Department's position appears to be that POGO paid \nthe wrong bureaucrats.\n  The public integrity of the public rulemaking process is at stake, \neven if Secretary Babbitt fails to see it.\n  In our nation, federal employees are not paid to push rule changes \nwhich benefit one party in a lawsuit. This is a dangerous precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we directed the MMS to simplify the \noil royalty payments so that companies would know what their fair share \nis. This is what MMS has come forward with as a simplification.\n  Companies still do not know what they will owe. They want to pay \ntheir fair share. I want them to pay their fair share. Whether they \nhave in the past is not an issue. We are trying to have a fair setting \nof taxes.\n  The question is: Who makes tax policy in this country? Is it Congress \nor is it unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to the people? \nWe are talking about a 1-year moratorium so that this can be worked out \nin a way that is acceptable to Congress.\n  The Senator from California says this only affects 5 percent of the \nproducers. I have a letter from the California Independent Petroleum \nAssociation, representing 450 independent oil and gas producers, which \nsays:\n\n       It is false to claim that this rulemaking only affects the \n     top 5 percent of all oil producers. It affects every \n     California producer on Federal land.\n\n  Madam President, I urge a vote for cloture so we can have a fair up-\nor-down vote on this amendment so that Congress will set the policy of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. By unanimous consent, \nthe mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the \nsense of the Senate that debate on amendment No. 1603 to H.R. 2466, the \nInterior appropriations bill, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and \nnays are required under the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Therefore, there will be no further votes this \nevening, and the next vote will occur at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday in \nrelation to the Bryan forestry amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the confirmation of Maryanne Trump Barry to \nthe Third Circuit--and I predict that she will be confirmed--will bring \nto 15 the total number of federal judges considered by the Senate all \nyear.\n  While I am appreciative of this opportunity to consider this \nnomination, I note that the Republican leadership has chosen to skip \nover the nominations of Marsha Berzon, Judge Richard Paez, and Ray \nFisher to the Ninth Circuit. These nominations have all been on the \nSenate calender for as long or longer than that of Ms. Barry. The \nRepublican leadership has, again, skipped over the nomination of \nJustice Ronnie White for the federal court in Missouri, as well.\n  All of these nominations could and should have been considered before \nthe August recess. Indeed the nominations of Judge Paez and Justice \nWhite, should have been considered when they were first reported last \nyear.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Maryanne Trump Barry to the United States Court of \nAppeals of the Third Circuit.\n  I commend Senator Hatch for moving forward with this nomination. We \nmust ensure that the federal bench is at full strength so that our \ncitizens will receive justice promptly and fairly.

In 1983, she was nominated to a federal district court \njudgeship by President Reagan, and since being confirmed for that post \nshe has compiled an impressive record and become a nationally \nrecognized expert on a wide range of criminal and civil law matters.\n  Her knowledge of criminal law led Chief Justice Rehnquist to appoint \nher to chair the Committee on Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, a position she held from 1993-1996. Additionally, \nthe Federal Judicial Center asked her to make an instructional \nvideotape called ``How to Try a Complex Criminal Case'' and that tape \nis played for all new district court judges at their orientation \nseminar.\n  In the area of civil law, Judge Barry has issued many important \nrulings including a decision that Blue Cross was required to pay for a \nbone marrow transplant for a terminally ill young girl who would have \ndied without the procedure.\n  New Jersey residents are particularly proud of her decision holding \nNew York City responsible and in contempt for failing to obey a court \norder designed to prevent garbage and medical waste from New York's \nFresh Kills Landfill from drifting onto New Jersey's shore. Not only do \nher judicial colleagues hold her in high regard, Judge Barry is also \nwell-respected by the many attorneys who have appeared before her. They \npraise her command of the law, her professional demeanor, and her \nrazor-sharp wit.\n  As a result of her tenure in the U.S. attorney's office, her 16 years \nof outstanding service at the district court level, and her legal \nexpertise, Judge Barry is well-prepared for elevation to the circuit \ncourt. In fact, she has already sat on the Court of Appeals--by \ndesignation--and has written several opinions.\n  Mr. President, I highly recommend Judge Barry for elevation to the \nthird circuit. As some of my colleagues may know, the third circuit is \ncurrently facing a judicial emergency, and the appointment of Judge \nBarry will help.\n  To further address this crisis, I hope that the Judiciary Committee \nwill soon take up the nomination of another excellent candidate for the \nthird circuit, Judge Julio Fuentes. I would also be remiss if I did not \npoint out that the elevation of Judge Barry will create another vacancy \non the District Court of New Jersey, and so it would be essential that \nthe committee move forward with the nomination of Faith Hochberg to \nthat court.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge \nMaryanne Trump Barry's confirmation to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have followed \nJudge Barry's nomination closely as it has moved through the \nconfirmation process. During this time, I have been impressed by her \ncandor, intelligence, and qualifications for the position. She has \nmoved through the process quickly, and I believe the overwhelming \nsupport for her nomination is evidence of her ability to ultimately \nfulfill the obligations of serving on the Third Circuit.\n  Those who know Judge Barry, and have had the pleasure of working with \nher, have spoken openly of her integrity and thorough knowledge of the \nlaw. Some have highlighted her decency, while others have focused upon \nher razor-sharp wit. However, everyone has agreed on one point--Judge \nBarry has developed a reputation as a skilled jurist with a judgment \nand temperament that are highly respected by her peers. The other \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed with this assessment, \nand I was pleased that Judge Barry's nomination was passed out of the \nCommittee by voice-vote on July 29th.\n  For those who are unfamiliar with Judge Barry's distinguished career, \nshe has graduated with Master's and law degrees from Columbia and \nHofstra Universities respectively. Judge Barry first worked for the \nU.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey and quickly rose through the \nranks. She served as Chief of the Appeals Division, and then as a first \nassistant to the U.S. Attorney. At the time, Judge Barry was the \nhighest-ranking female prosecutor in any major U.S. Attorney's Office \nin the country.\n  In 1983, Judge Barry was appointed to the U.S. District Court by \nPresident Reagan. For almost 16 years, she has served as a pragmatic \nand vocal presence on the bench in Newark, New Jersey. As a former \nPresident of the Association of the Federal Bar of the State of New \nJersey, Judge Barry has had a tremendous impact on policy across the \nState. She currently serves on its advisory board, and continues to be \nhighly regarded for her insights and opinions. Judge Barry has \nconsistently impressed me as an extraordinary woman, and one who will \ncontinue to distinguish herself. I urge my colleagues to support her \nconfirmation to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Maryanne Trump Barry, of New Jersey, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10774-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with respect to the Interior \nappropriations bill, there will be a vote on or in relation to the \nBryan amendment and the second-degree Wyden amendment tomorrow morning \nat 10:30.\n  It may well be that that will be the last contested matter in \nconnection with this appropriations bill other than the disposition of \nthe Hutchison amendment. I am not entirely certain of that at this \npoint. But we are close to having agreed-upon managers' amendments both \nwith respect to legislative matters and with respect to money matters, \nwith the exception of the motion to reconsider the invocation of \ncloture.\n  For that reason, this is a notice and a request to Members that if \nthey have other matters they wish debated, or if they have other \nmatters they wish brought to the managers' attention, they should do so \nvery promptly. We will not in the managers' amendment dispose of all \nthe amendments which were reserved, but I think we probably will be \nable to take care of all of those that look as if they would be \notherwise brought up and voted on.\n  We are tantalizingly close to finishing. But, of course, we will not \nfinish or go to third reading under the present circumstances at least \nuntil after disposition of the motion to reconsider the motion to \ninvoke cloture, and that motion will certainly pass, and there will be \nat least one more vote on cloture itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I would just like to comment upon the vote the Senate has just taken \non whether to shut down debate on the Hutchison amendment. I thank very \nmuch those colleagues who voted against that cloture motion. I think it \nis very important that the light and the truth be shone upon this \nmatter. I think the way to do it is to have more discussion.\n  I just want to say to the Senate that when I made my 2\\1/2\\-minute \npresentation, it is always very difficult to say everything in your \nheart in 2\\1/2\\ minutes. But I said the reason I am doing this--there \nis no other reason in the world for me to be delaying a vote on an \namendment--is that I love the Senate too much to see it be a party to \nsuch a scheme by just 5 percent of the oil companies to essentially rob \nthis Treasury of millions and millions of dollars.\n  This is the fourth time that Senator Hutchison has attempted to pass \nthis rider. It never had a Senate vote before. This is the first vote \nin any way about the Hutchison amendment.\n  By the way, I know that some people who voted aye on the cloture \nmotion will vote with me on the substance. I am looking forward to \nthat.\n  But the bottom line is, when we look at this closely, we see a number \nof things--that most of the oil companies are doing the right thing on \ntheir royalty payments. Ninety-five percent of\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\nthem are doing the right thing. They pay the appropriate royalty when \nthey drill on Federal lands, onshore or offshore, and they send that \ncheck over to the taxpayers. You know where the funds go--right into \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund and Historic Preservation Fund to \nbe used for environmental purposes for the upkeep of our parks and for \nthe upkeep of our historical monuments. We all know from both sides of \nthe aisle that we need to do more for our parks and open space.\n  As a matter of fact, there are bipartisan proposals to pass \nlegislation to do that. Yet at the same time, too many people seem \nwilling to shut their eyes to a raid on the Treasury that would lower \nthe revenues to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  You have to ask yourself why the oil companies are so interested in \nthis. I think the answer is in the Record. There have been several \nwhistleblowers who have come forward who have stated in the most \neloquent of terms that when they were working for the oil companies, \nthe companies purposely undervalued the oil so that they could pay \nfewer dollars of royalty payments.\n  As USA Today says, what if we all woke up one day and said: You know, \nI don't think I am paying a fair amount of rent. Forget about the \ncontract I signed with my landlord. I am just going to cut it back.\n  It wouldn't be too long before that tenant was out on the street, and \nrightly so. If he or she signed an agreement, they have to pay it.\n  What if one of us decided not to pay our mortgage and just say, let's \ntake 10 or 20 percent off the top? The answer is, if we did that on a \ncontinual basis, the banker would take over our home, and rightly so, \nbecause we signed an agreement.\n  The oil companies have signed an agreement. They have signed an \nagreement with the Federal Government, and 95 percent of them are doing \nthe right thing, but 5 percent of them are not.\n  The Interior Department wants to make sure that those 5 percent do \nthe right thing by clarifying the rules that govern these royalty \npayments. The Hutchison amendment would stop the Interior Department in \nits tracks from trying to collect the fair royalties.\n  I have used another analogy in this debate before. If somebody came \nrunning through the Senate Chamber with a big sack of money that he had \njust stolen from the Treasury, every one of us on both sides of the \naisle would stop that individual. Frankly, this is no different.\n\n  How do I know that?\n  The whistleblowers have told us so under penalty of perjury that they \nsat around and said: Let's undervalue this oil and ``wait for the day \nof judgment.'' That is what one of the whistleblowers actually said.\n  How else do we know there is cheating going on?\n  Look at all the settlements that the oil companies are agreeing to \nwith the various States all throughout our country on this matter. They \ndon't want to go to court. They are afraid they are going to lose \nbecause the whistleblowers will get out there--because the facts are \nthere. So they are settling for millions of dollars.\n  Ironically, Mr. President, I think I even sent it to your office on \nFriday, two more big oil companies are settling this week for over $100 \nmillion rather than take their weak case to the court.\n  We know that the posted prices they are paying their royalty on are \njust made up and they are far less than the market price.\n  All Interior wants to do is fix the situation.\n  You will hear the argument: It is a bureaucracy run amok. Let me say \nthis: You could say that about anything. But the facts belie that \nstatement because the Interior Department has held many meetings. By \nthe way, they have opened up their rule for further comment.\n  All I want to say to my colleagues by way of thanking them for this \nis that because of your standing with me against this cloture \namendment, it means we are going to continue to have the American \npeople focus in on this scam. When they do, they are going to want to \nknow who stood with them or who stood with the vertically integrated \noil companies that had been getting away with this robbery.\n\n  That is all I want. I don't gain anything out of this. There are lots \nof oil companies in my State. They are not thrilled. This is not \nsomething I do to be popular. But if in your heart you know you are \nright, and if in your heart you don't want to see the Senate associated \nwith this kind of scam, then you have to stand up and be counted. Many \nof my colleagues, including Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator \nWellstone, and Senator Murray, stood with me and entered statements in \nthe Record or stood by my side on the floor of the Senate.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Hutchison, she was the one who wanted a \nvote on Monday originally. The vote was supposed to be held on Tuesday. \nI did not object to an earlier vote. A lot of people came back for the \nvote. Therefore, of course, I insisted we have a vote. We are going to \nhave another vote. This could be from my perspective a very short-lived \nvictory. It is true, they could come up with the 60 votes. But I feel \ngood tonight. We have courage on this floor. This was not an easy vote.\n  Senator Feingold has taken to the floor. He has shown the biggest \ncontributions have come from oil companies. I understand the power of \nthat. I understand that. It is hard to stand up when these 5 percent--\nand they are the big ones, the billion-dollar companies--call you on \nthe phone and say: Come on, this is just a procedural matter, stick \nwith us.\n  What will we have in the end? More delay and a $66 million loss to \nthe Treasury on top of the $88 million we have already lost from the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. I think if the American people will \nfocus on this, they will thank those colleagues who stood with me \ntoday. They are all consumers. They all understand this.\n  There has been a lot of talk on the floor that oil companies are \nsuffering. I was very strongly in support of helping the oil companies \nand the steel companies that were in trouble. I am the first one to say \nwe need to give them help. But don't allow 5 percent to cheat the \ntaxpayers. That is a different issue. The interesting thing about \nroyalty payments is they go down when there is a depression in all \nprices.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if our rent went down if there was a depression \nor we lost our job? Wouldn't it be wonderful if our mortgage \nautomatically went down if there was a recession? That is what happens \nwith these royalty payments. They are very fair. They are based on the \nfair market value of the oil. There is no set price because we want to \nbe fair to the oil companies.\n  It is a privilege to drill on the people's land. It is a privilege, \nwhether it is offshore or onshore. If it is Federal land, the \ntaxpayers, the American people own that land. We want to make sure we \nwork in a cooperative spirit with those who would like to exploit our \nresources. Make sure, at the same time, that they are good corporate \ncitizens. What stuns me about this debate is that 95 percent of them \nare and 5 percent of the oil companies are not.\n  All the Department of the Interior is saying is: Please, let us \nstraighten this mess out with these 5 percent. It is a lot of money to \nthe Treasury, money that is necessary to keep our parks up, preserve \nour remaining open space, invest in our historical monuments that this \ngreat Nation so cherishes. It is a shame to see these 5 percent of the \noil companies--and this is the fourth time this rider is before the \nSenate--walking off with millions of dollars that belong to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Senator Hutchison says the Office of Management and Budget is wrong \nwhen they say it is a $66 million loss. The Interior Department says it \nis a $66 million loss. The CBO tells Senator Hutchison it is about $11 \nmillion. I say it doesn't matter if it is $11 million or $66 million. \nMaybe it is somewhere in between. It is the principle here of millions \nof dollars that belong to the taxpayers not winding up in the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund to take care of our natural resources.\n\n  Whether this is a victory for those who believe in fairness and \njustice and truth, if it is a victory that lasts 24 hours, so be it. To \nme it is an important point. We have made our point. This is not a \ntrivial debate. This is not a trivial argument. As a matter of fact, I \nthink the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, was on the floor and said it \nis a baseless debate. It is far from baseless.\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\n We see that tonight with this vote, however it winds up. This is a \ndivided Senate.\n  Again, I thank the people who stood for fairness, who stood with the \ntaxpayers, who stood with the environment, who stood with those who say \nyou have to be a good corporate citizen. That is all we are saying. We \nexpect our citizens to be good. Boy, if they don't pay their taxes, we \nare after them. And don't have the lawyers that the oil companies have \non their side to drag out these arguments in court, month after month--\nordinary citizens don't have that. If they don't pay their taxes, they \nhave to explain why. If they don't pay their rent, they better explain \nwhy. If they don't pay their mortgage, they better tell the bank why.\n  We shouldn't have a double standard just because an oil company is \npowerful, just because an oil company can give millions of dollars of \ncontributions, just because an oil company is influential. This day we \nstood up for the average person. I hope we do it again. For me, it was \nall worth it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think it is very clear that the \nSenate has seen through all of the rhetoric, through all of the \nhyperbole, and they have made the right decision on this amendment. I \nam very proud tonight that if everyone had been here we would have had \n60 votes for cloture. As it is, we had 55 votes. The clear will of the \nSenate is to do the right thing on this issue--not to be led down a \npath, bringing up issues that are unrelated in order to make a point \nthat isn't relevant to what we are talking about today.\n  The Senate voted, overwhelmingly, to come to closure and take control \nof the tax policy of this country. After all, if the Senate doesn't \nmake the tax policy along with our colleagues in the House, are we \ngoing to let unelected bureaucrats make decisions that will affect our \neconomy, the jobs of thousands of people, possibly sending them \noverseas for foreign jobs instead of American jobs? Our Senate \ncolleagues tonight said the Senate of the United States is going to \nspeak on oil and gas tax policy. We spoke very clearly that we want a \n1-year moratorium. We hope MMS will do the right thing in giving a \nsimple and fair tax that will be paid by the oil companies for the \nright to drill on public lands. That is the issue here.\n  There has been a lot said tonight. First of all, the quote was made \nfrom a USA Today article saying that this would be like a lessee \nsaying: I'm not going to pay $500 a month for this apartment; I'm going \nto pay $400 a month even though I agreed to pay $500 a month.\n  Actually, it is just the opposite. The oil companies have a contract \nwith the Federal Government. They have met all the criteria that the \nFederal Government has put down in order to drill on Federal lands. \nWhat the Senator from California has asked that we do is to allow the \nMineral Management Service to raise the rent on the apartment in the \nmiddle of the month. They are breaking a contract and saying: We are \ngoing to raise your taxes right in the middle of the contract.\n  If we allow that to happen, who will be next? Who is the next person \nwho is going to have a contract and have the price increased in the \nmiddle of the contract? Contract rights are part of the basis of the \nrule of law in this country, and we seem to be blithely going over it \nas if, ``It's a big oil company; we can run over them.'' That is not \nthe rule of law. We should not be raising taxes in the middle of a \ncontract. It is not right and I hope in the end the Senate will prevail \nand we will make the tax policy for this country.\n  No. 2, the Senator from California keeps saying only 5 percent of the \noil companies are going to be affected by the MMS-proposed rule. In \nfact, every company that drills on public lands is affected by this \nruling. I want to put in the Record the letter that was received on \nSeptember 13, 1999, by the California Independent Petroleum \nAssociation.\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison:\n       The California Independent Petroleum Association represents \n     450 independent oil and gas producers, royalty owners, and \n     service companies operating in California. We want to set the \n     record straight. The MMS oil royalty rulemaking affects all \n     California producers on federal land. It is false to claim \n     that this rulemaking only affects the top 5 percent of oil \n     producers.\n       How are California independents affected? The proposed \n     rulemaking allows the government to second guess a wellhead \n     sale. If rejected, a California producer is subjected to an \n     ANS index that adjusts to the wellhead set by the government. \n     Using a government formula instead of actual proceeds results \n     in a new tax being imposed on all producers of federal oil.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            California Independent\n\n\n                                        Petroleum Association,\n\n                               Sacramento, CA, September 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n\nCIPA SUPPORTS YOUR AMENDMENT TO EXTEND ROYALTY RULEMAKING AN ADDITIONAL \n                                  YEAR\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The California Independent \n     Petroleum Association (CIPA) represents 450 independent oil \n     and gas producers, royalty owners and service companies \n     operating in California CIPA wants to set the record \n     straight. The MMS oil royalty rulemaking affects all \n     California producers on federal land. It is false to claim \n     that this rulemaking only affects the top 5% of all \n     producers.\n       How are California independents affected? The proposed \n     rulemaking allows the government to second guess a wellhead \n     sale. If rejected, a California producer is subjected to an \n     ANS index that adjusts to the wellhead set by the government. \n     Using a government formula instead of actual proceeds results \n     in a new tax imposed on all producers of federal oil.\n       It doesn't end, if a California producer chooses to move \n     its oil downstream of the well, the rulemaking will reject \n     many of the costs associated with these activities. Again, to \n     reject costs results in a new tax being levied on the \n     producer.\n       Senator Hutchison, California producers support your \n     amendment to extend the oil royalty rulemaking an additional \n     year. We offer our support not on behalf of the largest \n     producers in the world but instead on behalf of independent \n     producers in the state of California. Your amendment will \n     provide the needed impetus to craft a rule that truly does \n     affect the small producer and creates a new rulemaking \n     framework that is fair and equitable for all parties.\n       Again, thank you for offering this amendment. We cannot \n     allow the government to unilaterally assess an additional tax \n     on independent producers. After record low oil prices. \n     California producers are barely beginning to travel down a \n     lengthy road to recovery. To assess a new tax at this time \n     could have a devastating effect on federal production and the \n     amount of royalties paid to the government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel P. Kramer,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the very \npeople who are affected are from the home State of the Senator from \nCalifornia, the small producers, the independents who do not have the \nluxury of big margins. They are very much affected and very concerned \nabout this rule and what it would do to somebody who has a contract, \nwho says: Pull your truck up and I will sell you 1000 barrels of oil. \nHere is the price, $12 a barrel.\n  And the Government says: No, we will not accept the $12 a barrel, \neven though they are picking it up right there.\n  That is exactly what the MMS rule does. So every independent is \naffected and it is the independents who are having to lay people off in \nthis industry because the oil prices have been so low over the last \nyear that they have not been able to stay in business.\n  Do you know what happens when somebody shuts down? Every family that \nis dependent on employment from that small producer no longer has a \njob, and they may live in a place where it is not easy to find another \njob. The big oil companies just chose to move overseas where they know \nwhat the regulatory environment is. They know it is stable. They do not \nwant to create foreign jobs, but that is what they are forced to do \nbecause it is so hard to do business in the United States and \nespecially when an unelected bureaucracy is able to change the taxes in \nthe middle of a contract. That is just not the American way.\n  I am very proud the people of the Senate spoke clearly tonight, very \nclearly; 55 Members of the Senate voted to make the tax policy in this \ncountry.\n  Congress did hope we could simplify oil royalty rates. We asked the \nMineral Management Service to come forward with a simplified system so \neveryone would know exactly what the price\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\nwould be to drill on Federal lands. Simply, they have failed so far in \nthe proposed rule.\n  This is the diagram of what will happen if this rule goes into effect \nagainst the wishes of Congress that we simplify it so oil companies \nwill know what they owe without question. By the time you go through \nall of this, how could anyone know for sure what they owed?\n  Furthermore, the MMS will not allow the ruling for one company on oil \nroyalty rates and the basis for those rates to apply to any other \nperson who is drilling, unlike the IRS, which will give you a ruling \nletter so you will know this is the precedent, this is the way the IRS \nwill treat this particular fact situation so anyone else with the same \nfact situation can rely on the precedent and can give IRS that ruling \ndocument and know they will be treated the same. That is not the case. \nThe MMS refuses to be bound by the precedents they set themselves, even \nif the facts happen to be the same. That is not sound policy. That is \nnot fair treatment for the taxpayers and the people doing business and \ncreating jobs in our country.\n  The Senate has clearly spoken. The question is, Will the Senator from \nCalifornia let the majority rule? Will the Senator from California say \n55 Members on both sides of the aisle have voted for Congress to set \ntax policy and to require the oil companies to pay a fair price for \ndrilling on public lands? That is the question.\n  The Senate has voted 55, with 5 Members missing--according to the \nvotes that have been taken it will be 60 votes if everyone is here and \nvoting. So we have the vast majority to invoke cloture, and the \nquestion is, Will the Senator from California do the honorable thing? \nShe said earlier in this debate she wanted fair treatment of this \namendment. Fair treatment means an up-or-down vote on the amendment. So \nthe question is, in the face of the overwhelming majority of the Senate \nwho want to do the right thing, who want fair taxation of our oil and \ngas industry, will she let the majority rule? She said, in the \nCongressional Record on September 9:\n\n       Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \n     being so gracious in preserving my rights. My friend from \n     Texas and I feel equally strongly on the point, just on \n     different sides. I think each of us wants to have justice \n     done on the amendment.\n\n  If the Senator from California will stick with her commitment that we \nwould have justice done on the amendment, she will allow the majority \nto rule.

Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was \npleased yesterday when President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia agreed to \nwork with the United Nations to allow international peacekeepers to \nrestore peace and stability to East Timor. The reprehensible wave of \nviolence that engulfed East Timor in the week following the \nannouncement of the August 30 referendum was inexcusable, and demands \nthe harshest condemnation by the international community.\n  But, more importantly, the international community must now work to \nbring an immediate end to the violence in East Timor, protect refugees, \nsafeguard humanitarian aid for displaced persons, and work with \nIndonesian troops already in East Timor to see to it that they fulfill \ntheir mission of protecting the East Timorese.\n  On August 30, close to 98 percent of the eligible voters of East \nTimor went to the polls for the United Nations sponsored vote on East \nTimor's autonomy. This vote was in keeping with the May 5 agreements \nbetween Indonesia, Portugal, and the United Nations regarding the \nfuture of East Timor.\n  On September 4, the Secretary General of the United Nations announced \nthe outcome of the August 30 vote, and the results show that the people \nof East Timor have spoken with a clear voice: 78.5 percent rejected \nautonomy in favor of complete independence from Indonesia.\n  Under the May 5 agreements, if East Timor opted for independence, the \nGovernment of Indonesia committed itself to a process of peaceful and \nconstitutional change, in which the United Nations would oversee the \ntransition to independence for East Timor.\n  Unfortunately, following the Secretary General's announcement of the \nclear, overwhelming, and freely-expressed choice of the East Timor \npeople, anti-independence militias, backed by the Indonesian military \nand police, began a systematic and organized campaign of terror, \nviolence and intimidation in an effort to overturn the will of the \npeople of East Timor.\n  The criminal action undertaken by the militias and their backers in \nthe Indonesian military are reprehensible: mass looting, arson, \nsystematic destruction of infrastructure, and most disturbing of all, \nmurder.\n  According to the United Nations, hundreds, and possibly thousands, \nhave been killed and more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee \ntheir homes. There are also reports of mass killings and a systematic \ncampaign of political assassination.\n  The May 5 Agreements between the Governments of Indonesia and \nPortugal and the United Nations mandated the popular vote on the offer \nof autonomy and clearly delegated responsibility for peace and security \nbefore, during and after the ballot process to the Government of \nIndonesia. And the Government of Indonesia freely agreed to take on \nthat responsibility.\n  Yet, in the face of widespread violence, the Indonesian army and \npolice forces have stood aside and, worse, assisted the anti-\nindependence militias. I, like many of my colleagues, was startled by \nthe Government of Indonesia's unwillingness or inability to control its \nown military forces and police in East Timor.\n  Now that the Government of Indonesia has agreed to work with the \nUnited Nations to restore peace to East Timor, there is much work to be \ndone.\n  First, I am heartened by the willingness of the Australian government \nto lead peacekeeping efforts to restore peace in security to East \nTimor, by the willingness of the states of ASEAN to participate in this \npeacekeeping mission, and by the efforts of the United Nations Security \nCouncil to engage the Government of Indonesia to address these issues. \nThe United States, along with our partners in the United Nations and \nthe international community, must be responsive to these efforts and \nprovide appropriate assistance.\n  Second, I believe that it is essential that the international \ncommunity condemns the acts of violence that have occurred in East \nTimor in the past week--as it has in Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, and \nelsewhere--and urge a complete investigation into any criminal acts \nwith those responsible being brought to justice.\n  Third, now that the Government of Indonesia has agreed to allow \ninternational peacekeepers into East Timor, I am hopeful that it will \ncontinue to work with the United Nations to implement the August 30th \nvote and safeguard East Timor's transition to independence. The United \nStates and the international community must remain engaged and involved \nwith this transition, and strongly encourage the Government of \nIndonesia to make those changes that the people of East Timor in the \nAugust 30 referendum overwhelmingly supported.\n  Lastly, I believe that President Clinton's decision to review U.S. \ninternational financial and military assistance to Indonesia in the \ncontext of the violence in East Timor was wholly appropriate, and that \nJakarta must understand that as much as we value our relations with the \npeople of Indonesia, future U.S. assistance will depend on\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\ntheir continued cooperation with the international community in \nresolving this deplorable situation.\n  Mr. President, the people of East Timor have made their feelings \nclear. They want a peaceful transition to independence. The Government \nof Indonesia has made a commitment that they would grant the people of \nEast Timor independence and oversee a peaceful transition. As the \nGovernment of Indonesia has belatedly recognized, it must live up to \nits commitments. The international community can play a crucial role in \nproviding support and helping guarantee the security of the people of \nEast Timor in this transition to independence. We must not let them \ndown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10778-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EFFECTIVE EXPORT CONTROLS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and \nFederal Services, I wish to call attention to an important briefing \ngiven to Senate staff just prior to the August recess by Administration \nofficials from the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Census Bureau on \nthe new Automated Export System (AES).\n  The AES is a joint venture between the U.S. Customs Service and the \nForeign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau. AES provides for the \nelectronic filing of the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and \nelectronic filing of the outbound manifest. AES is an information \ngateway designed to ensure compliance with and enforcement of laws \nrelating to exporting. It will improve the collection of trade \nstatistics and improve customer service. Its goal is a paperless \nreporting of export information by the year 2002.\n  I believe the AES will become the centerpiece of efforts to improve \nthe effectiveness of the United States' export control program.\n  Last June Senator Thompson, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, held very important hearings on the findings and \nrecommendations of reports issued by the Inspectors General from six \nU.S. agencies involved in the export control process: namely, the \nDepartments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, State, Treasury (U.S. \nCustoms), and the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the critical \nrecommendations made by several of the Inspectors General was that \nlicensing officials should perform ``cumulative effect analysis'' of \nproposed export transactions. The primary tool for this analysis will \nbe information gathered in the AES.\n  Furthermore, the recent report from the Commission to Assess the \nOrganization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of \nWeapons of Mass Destruction, chaired by former CIA Director John \nDeutch, entitled ``Combating Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction,'' also highlighted the AES program as a central tool for \nimproving the overall performance of our export control program. The \nDeutch Report observed that the AES could be used as a tool to identify \ntrends in shipments of otherwise non-strategic items that might be used \nby rogue nations pursuing the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Based upon the Deutch Commission's recommendation, Senator Specter \nintroduced a bill, S. 1372, entitled ``Proliferation Prevention \nEnhancement Act of 1999.'' This bill mandates that U.S. companies \nelectronically files Shipper's Export Declarations (SEDs) through AES \nfor exports of items that are on the U.S. Munitions List of the \nCommerce Control List. I commend my colleague for his efforts to \nimprove the overall effectiveness of our export control program which \nis so essential to preserving our nation's security. I am a cosponsor \nof this legislation and urge its support. Our continued oversight of \nexports of dual-use and munitions list items will help ensure that \nexports do not go awry to rogue nations or individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10778-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10778-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 56\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit herewith a report of the activities of the \nUnited Nations and of the participation of the United States therein \nduring the calendar year 1998.

A bill to assure timely, rational, and complete Federal \nCommunications Commission resolution of all pending proceedings \nreexamining the current radio and television broadcast stations \nownership rules; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 broadcast ownership reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill make federal radio and television ownership rules Y2K compatible.\n  When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 almost four \nyears ago, we recognized that the forty-year-old rules restricting \nbroadcast station ownership were badly outdated and in need of change. \nThey reflected a mass media industry made up of radio stations, TV \nstations, and newspapers--and that's all. None of the dominant new \nmultichannel media like cable TV, satellite TV, or the Internet figured \nin, because they didn't exist.\n  But they exist now, and they have transformed the way Americans get \ntheir news, information, and entertainment. As more and more people \nturn to cable channels and the Internet as their preferred means of \nelectronic\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\ncommunications, the audience and revenues of the big TV networks have \nplummeted, and the number and circulation of daily newspapers have \nspiraled downward.\n  The days when Huntley, Brinkley and Cronkite on the air, and the \nTimes, the Post, and the Tribune at the breakfast table dominated our \nperspectives on the issues are forever gone. In their place are CNN, \nCNBC, MSNBC, and the innumerable web sites available on the Internet.\n  Even more important, Americans today are no longer just passive \nrecipients of the news and views doled out by a handful of powerful TV \nnetworks and daily newspapers. Today, thanks to the Internet, anyone on \nline can pose questions and exchange perspectives with anyone else on \nline.\n  In other words, the days when network news and big-city newspaper \neditors were the dominant opinionmakers are long over. But the \nrestrictive ownership rules that were a product of that time aren't \nover. Like so many federal regulations, they live on, despite the fact \nthat they're as out-of-date as Alice Kramden's ice box.\n  The proliferation of alternative sources of electronic news, \ninformation and entertainment hasn't just made the old ownership rules \nuseless--it's actually made them harmful. Faced with daunting \ncompetition from these new media, broadcasters, and especially \nnewspaper owners, must have the opportunity to realize the increased \noperating economy and efficiency that liberalized ownership rules make \npossible. If we do not allow this to happen, we place the future of \nthese older media in even greater doubt in today's hypercompetitive \nmarket.\n\n  Congress recognized all this when it directed the FCC to review all \nits broadcast ownership rules every two years. Although the Commission \nrecently overhauled some of these rules, it left two others intact--the \nnational network ownership limit and the ban on owning a daily \nnewspaper and a broadcast station in the same market.\n  That's not consistent with what Congress told the Commission to do, \nand it isn't fair. We told the Commission to reexamine all the rules \nprecisely because all the rules, not just some of the rules, have been \nrendered counterproductive by the changes that have taken place in the \nelectronic mass media marketplace. In fact, the rule that's arguably \nthe most hopelessly anachronistic is the newspaper/broadcast cross-\nownership ban--yet the FCC shows no sign of budging on it.\n  Mr. President, this bill corrects this situation. With respect to the \nnational TV ownership limits, it follows the approach Congress used in \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act by raising the national audience reach \nlimitation from 35 to 50 percent, and allows the FCC to raise it \nfurther if the public interest warrants it. It eliminates the \nnewspaper/broadcast cross-ownership ban, but would allow the FCC to \nreimpose it if the Commission can do so by January 1, based on the \nextensive record that has been pending before them for over three \nyears.\n  Mr. President, there are lots of policy cobwebs that have kept these \nrules in place despite the permanent and unmistakable changes the \nelectronic media market has undergone. Some of them spring from the \nnotion that broadcasting, as a free rider on the public's multibillion-\ndollar spectrum, can and should be subject to regulation over and above \nthat of other media. Others are stubbornly ingrained notions of how \npowerful the TV networks and newspapers are. Still others--the least \nworthy--are scars left over from what particular newspapers have had to \nsay on their editorial pages.\n  Nobody is less sympathetic than I am to the fact that broadcasters, \nunlike other users of the public's spectrum, pay nothing for the \nprivilege. But subjecting them to anachronistic, even \ncounterproductive, rules isn't a substitute for lost spectrum revenues. \nAnd remembrances of things past, whether they be the long-gone days of \nnetwork TV hegemony or old stories in the local newspaper, are no way \nto deal with the problems of the present.\n  Uncle Miltie TV ownership rules don't work in a Chris rock media \nmarket. Let's face that fact, shed our outdated notions, and finish the \njob the FCC didn't\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Broadcast Ownership Reform \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contemporary electronic mass media market provides \n     consumers with abundant alternative sources of news, \n     information and entertainment, including radio and television \n     broadcast stations, cable television systems, and the \n     Internet.\n       (2) Due to the advent of digital technology, these \n     alternative sources of electronic news, information and \n     entertainment are converging as well as proliferating.\n       (3) The simultaneous proliferation and convergence of \n     electronic mass media renders technology-specific regulation \n     obsolete.\n       (4) The public interest demands that the Federal \n     Communications Commission reexamine its technology-specific \n     regulation of electronic mass media to assure that it retains \n     its relevance in the face of the proliferation and \n     convergence of electronic mass media.\n       (5) Section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     recognized that there is a particular public interest need \n     for the Federal Communications Commission to periodically and \n     comprehensively reexamine its radio and television broadcast \n     ownership rules, which predate the proliferation and \n     convergence of alternative competing electronic sources of \n     news, information and entertainment.\n       (6) Although the Commission has reexamined and revised its \n     broadcast duopoly and one-to-a-market ownership rules, it has \n     not completed long-pending reexaminations of its national \n     television station ownership restrictions or the newspaper-\n     broadcast cross-ownership prohibition.\n       (7) The Commission's failure to simultaneously resolve all \n     its pending broadcast cross-ownership rules fails to \n     recognize, as Congress did in enacting section 202(h), that \n     the proliferation and convergence of alternative electronic \n     media implicates the bases of the national television \n     ownership rules and the newspaper broadcast cross-ownership \n     rules no less than the bases of the local radio and \n     television station ownership rules.\n       (8) The Commission's failure to simultaneously resolve all \n     its broadcast cross-ownership rules will affect all potential \n     buyers and sellers of radio and television stations in the \n     interim, because the current restrictions will prevent \n     networks and newspaper publishers from engaging in station \n     transactions to the extent they otherwise might.\n       (9) The Commission's failure to simultaneously resolve its \n     pending proceedings on the national television ownership and \n     newspaper/broadcast crossownership restrictions is arbitrary \n     and capricious, because it treats similarly-situated \n     entities--those bound by ownership rules that predate the \n     advent of increased competition from alternative electronic \n     media--differently, without any consideration of, or reasoned \n     analysis for, this disparate treatment.\n       (10) The increase in the national television audience reach \n     limitation to 35 percent mandated by section 202(c)(1)(B) of \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was not established as the \n     maximum percentage compatible with the public interest. On \n     the contrary, section 202(h) of that Act expressly directs \n     the Commission to review biennially whether any of its \n     broadcast ownership rules, including those adopted pursuant \n     to section 202 of the Act, are necessary in the public \n     interest as a result of competition.\n       (11) The 35-percent national television audience reach \n     limitation is unduly restrictive in light of competition.\n       (12) The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restriction in \n     unduly restrictive in light of competition.\n       (13) The Commission's failure to resolve its pending \n     proceedings on the national television ownership and \n     newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restrictions \n     simultaneously with its resolution of the proceedings on the \n     duopoly and one-to-a-market rules does not serve the public \n     interest.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASE IN NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCE REACH \n                   LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Communications Commission \n     shall modify its rules for multiple ownership set forth in \n     section 73.3555(e) of its regulations (47 C.F.R. 73.3555(e) \n     by increasing the national audience reach limitation for \n     television stations to 50 percent.\n       (b) Further Increase.--The Commission may modify those \n     rules to increase the limitation to a greater percentage than \n     the 50 percent required by subsection (a) if it determines \n     that the increase is in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF NEWSPAPER/BROADCAST CROSS-OWNERSHIP \n                   RULE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership \n     rule under section 73.3555(d) of the Federal Communication \n     Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 73.3555(d)) shall cease \n     to be in effect after December 31, 1999, unless it is \n     reinstated by the Commission under subsection (b) before \n     January 1, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\n  S. 1579. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to revise and \nimprove the authorities of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating \nto the provision of counseling and treatment for sexual trauma \nexperienced by veterans; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                  VETERANS SEXUAL TRAUMA TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nSexual Trauma Treatment Act, legislation authorizing a program within \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which will offer \ncounseling and medical treatment to veterans who suffered from sexual \nabuse while serving in the armed forces.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served or \nare currently serving their country in uniform. Countless men and \nwomen, and their families, have served this country with courage, honor \nand distinction. Today, as they have throughout this proud nation's \nhistory, they stand ready to answer the call to duty, and they deserve, \nat the very least, to serve free from the threat of sexual abuse and \nharassment. And yet, an estimated 35 percent of all female veterans \nreport at least one incident of sexual harassment during their military \nservice. That it why I am introducing this legislation today.\n  The Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act, which is similar to \nlegislation introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Gutierrez, will enable former military personnel who \nwere subjected to sexual harassment or abuse while in the military to \nreceive proper medical and psychological care. The legislation does so \nby extending and improving the VA's abuse counseling initiatives.\n  The bill makes permanent a program to require the VA to provide \ncounseling to veterans to overcome psychological trauma resulting from \na physical assault or battery of a sexual nature, or from sexual \nharassment, which occurred during active military service. Under \ncurrent law the program authorizing such counseling expires in 2001.\n  The bill authorizes the program to include appropriate treatment, and \nrequires a VA mental health professional to determine when such \ncounseling and treatment is necessary. Currently, the VA Secretary \nmakes this determination.\n  The bill also calls for the dissemination of information concerning \nthe availability of counseling services to veterans, through public \nservice and other announcements. It also calls for a report on joint \nDOD/VA efforts to ensure that military personnel are informed upon \ntheir separation from service about available sexual trauma counseling \nand treatment programs.\n  Most importantly, the bill eases restrictions under the existing \nprogram. I find it very troubling, for example, that women with fewer \nthan two years of service are not eligible for counseling, even if they \nseparated from the military due specifically to incidents of harassment \nor abuse.\n  According to the DOD, over 5 percent of female active duty personnel \nhave been sexually assaulted while in the service. And a recent survey \nconducted for the Pentagon found that between 1988 and 1995, the \npercentage of active duty women who reported that they had received \nuninvited or unwanted sexual attention stood at 55 percent, while the \npercentage for men stands at 14 percent.\n  The survey also reported that 78 percent of female respondents said \nthey had experienced one or more specific types of unwanted behaviors \nfrom a range of specified inappropriate behaviors.\n  Eighty eight percent of females said the harassment occurred on a \nbase; 74 percent said the harassment occurred at work; 77 percent said \nit occurred during duty hours; 44 percent said that military coworkers \nof equal rank were the perpetrators; and 43 percent said the \nperpetrator was of a higher rank.\n  These findings are very disturbing. The data illustrates just how \nwidespread this problem is, and indicates the need for a program to \ntreat victims upon separation from active duty service. I credit the \nDOD with working to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment in the \nmilitary. However, as long as there is harassment and abuse in the \nmilitary, it is vital that victims have access to counseling while on \nactive duty and after separation from the service as well.\n  We expect active duty servicemen and women to make extraordinary \nsacrifices to safeguard the democracy we cherish. We should not expect \nthem to accept abuse and harassment while they serve.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is aimed specifically at \nensuring that veterans have access to abuse counseling after they leave \nthe military. It has the backing of the VFW, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the American Legion, and AMVETS.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1580. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to assist \nagricultural producers in managing risk, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                risk management for the 21st century act\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and a bipartisan group of 17 of our \ncolleagues--including a majority of the members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, the ``Risk Management for the 21st Century \nAct.''\n  This legislation represents a significant step in improving the risk \nmanagement tools available to producers throughout the United States.\n  In early March, Senator Kerrey and I joined to introduce S. 529, the \n``Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act.'' At the time, we stated \nthat we did not necessarily believe it was ``the bill,'' but that we \nhoped it would serve as the starting point for a discussion that would \nlead to the introduction of a comprehensive piece of legislation to \nimprove the risk management tools available to producers throughout the \nU.S. and which could be supported by a majority of our colleagues.\n  I believe this is that bill. Going back to last fall and through this \nspring and summer, we have been involved in literally hundreds of hours \nof discussions with producers, commodity and farm organizations, \ninsuranceproviders, insurance agents, and Members of the House and \nSenate regarding what needs to be done to improve the risk management \ntools available to our farmers and ranchers.\n  The bill we introduce today is the product of these many discussions.\n  This bill includes many of the provisions included in the original \nRoberts/Kerrey legislation, but it also includes many new provisions \nrecommended during our discussions with Members and agricultural \norganizations. These include:\n  An inverted subsidy structure.\n  An equal level of subsidy for revenue insurance products.\n  APH adjustments for producers suffering multiple years of crop \nlosses.\n  APH adjustments for new and beginning farmers, those farming new \nland, and those rotating crops.\n  Instructions to undertake alternative rating methodologies for low \nrisk producers and regions and crops with low participation percentages \nand to then implement this new rating system. This at the request of \nmany of our southern colleagues.\n  Changes in prevented planting and incentives to encourage producers \nto take additional risk management measures. Similar to car insurance, \nif you take drivers education classes you get an additional discount on \nyour premium. Under our legislation, producers who take additional risk \nmanagement steps will also receive a bonus discount on their premiums.\n  Authority for several pilot programs, placing special emphasis on \npolices to explore coverage for livestock and to expand the quality and \nlevels of coverage available to specialty crops.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the many changes mentioned above, our \nlegislation also provides for major changes in the Risk Management \nAgency (RMA) and the regulatory process governing the crop insurance \nprogram.\n\n  We change the members of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's \nBoard of Directors to include:\n  Four Farmers from geographic regions to be determined by the \nSecretary.\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\n  One member active in the crop insurance industry.\n  One member with reinsurance expertise.\n  The Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the \nUndersecretary for Rural Development, and the USDA Chief Economist.\n\n  Make the FCIC the overseer of RMA.\n  Create an Office of Private Sector Partnership to serve as a liaison \nbetween private sector companies and the FCIC Board of Directors.\n  Allow companies to charge minimal fees to other companies selling \ntheir products, in order to allow the recovery of research and \ndevelopment costs.\n\n  Mr. President, our legislation also focuses on several areas that I \nwant to place special emphasis on because they are areas that I know \nare of interest to many of my colleagues and which some often think \nthose of us in the Midwest and Plains States tend to ignore.\n  The first deals with program compliance. We have heard complaints \nfrom some of our colleagues and specific commodity groups that fraud \nexists in several areas of the country. Let me make clear, Senator \nKerrey and I oppose any attempts to defraud the crop insurance program.\n  To prevent this fraud, the legislation calls for penalties of up to \n$10,000 for producers, agents, loss adjusters, and approved insurance \nproviders that attempt to defraud the program. It also allows for USDA \nto remove producers from eligibility for all USDA programs if they have \ndefrauded the program. Furthermore, agents, loss adjusters, and \napproved companies that do business in the program could be banned from \nparticipation for up to five years if they have committed fraud.\n  Mr. President, these provisions are strong and they are clear--those \nwho attempt to defraud the program and taxpayers will be punished.\n  Mr. President, another concern that Senator Kerrey and I have heard \nrepeatedly is the lack of emphasis and prioritization for specialty \ncrops and development of new crop insurance and risk management tools \nfor these crops. We have included many provisions in our legislation to \naddress these concerns.\n  These specialty crop provisions include:\n  Changes in the Noninsured Assistance Program that we believe will \nmake it easier to obtain assistance and funding through changes in \nwhich commodities can be covered and by allowing payments in some \ninstances irregardless of an area trigger occurring.\n  Several pilot projects geared specifically towards looking at the \nfeasibility of Gross Revenue and Whole Farm Revenue polices that \ninclude coverage for specialty crops.\n  Requiring the newly created Office of Private Sector Partnership to \ninclude staff with specialty crop expertise.\n  Allow RMA to spend up to $20 million per year to create partnerships \nwith Land Grant Universities, the Agricultural Research Service, \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other qualified \nentities to develop and implement new specialty crop risk management \noptions.\n  Requires 50 percent of RMA's research and development funds to go to \nspecialty crop products development. Additionally, 50 percent of these \nR funds must be contracted out to organizations and entities outside \nRMA.\n  Reaffirms the authority of the Specialty Crops Coordinator in RMA. \nThe bill also allows the Specialty Crops Coordinator to make \ncompetitive grants for research and development of new products in the \nspecialty crops area.\n  Contains provisions regarding sales closing dates and the issuance of \nnew polices.\n  Orders the Specialty Crops coordinator and the FCIC to study the \nfeasibility of offering cost-of production, Adjusted Gross Income \n(AGI), quality-based policies, and an intermediate coverage level \n(higher than current CAT coverage) for specialty crops.\n  Requires the Board to annually review and certify that speciality \ncrops are adequately covered. If insufficient coverage is available for \na commodity, the Board can require RMA to undertake R activities.\n  Provides mechanisms whereby the Secretary must take steps to improve \nparticipation in the program when total participation for a crop in an \nindividual state falls below 75 percent of the national participation \naverage.\n  Mr. President, these changes for specialty crops are significant and \nwe believe they give important attention to a group of producers that \nhas often felt neglected in U.S. agricultural policy. I hope that our \ncolleagues will agree and that they will join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n  Mr. President, let me also state that I realize some will argue that \nspecific provisions should have been included in this legislation that \ncurrently are not. I understand these concerns, but as we developed \nthis bill, we had to determine the priorities of each agricultural \nregion and commodity groups. There is something from this bill that all \nof us would like to see included, including Senator Kerrey and myself, \nbut as a whole it is I believe the best package available.\n  I also realize that some in this body claim that crop insurance is \nnot necessary and that we do not need to act on this legislation this \nyear. I could not disagree more.\n  Mr. President, every year our producers put the seed in the ground \nand believe that with a little faith and luck they will produce a crop. \nBut, sometimes the creeks do rise and the multiple perils of drought, \nflood, fire, hail, blizzard, pests, and disease get the better or our \nproducers. They must have the tools to manage these risks.\n  The agricultural and lending communities have spoken loudly, and they \nall have continually expressed the need to improve the risk management \ntools available to producers throughout the U.S. It is time for us to \nmove towards action on this issue. The House Agriculture Committee \napproved legislation prior to the August recess. It is time for the \nSenate Agriculture Committee to do the same. A majority of the \nCommittee has said as much by supporting our legislation.\n  Mr. President, we know there are many disagreements within members of \nthe Senate in regards to specific agricultural policy. In fact, Senator \nKerrey and I have disagreements of our own on the underlying Farm Bill. \nHowever, we all agree that our producers today cannot be successful \nwithout access to new, improved, and adequate risk management tools. \nThis legislation accomplishes these needs, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in working towards an improved crop insurance program and risk \nmanagement tools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10782-1", "month": "09",

Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's \nattention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for \nAssisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week \nto highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service \ncan provide seniors.\n  Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need \nmore assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not \nrequire the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing \nfacilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have \nchosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates \na tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of \nassistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other \nactivities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home.\n  This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``A Community \nof Families'' and I think that is appropriate because assisted living \nencourages the involvement of families in the lives of the residents of \nassisted living facilities, and because this option can mean so much \nfor seniors and their families.\n  Oregon has led our nation in pioneering the concept of assisted \nliving and the state spends more state health dollars to provide \nassisted living services than any other state in our nation. Assisted \nliving has taken different directions in different states and I believe \nproviding these choices for consumers is important to provide security, \ndignity and independence for seniors.\n  Assisted living will become even more important as an option of \nseniors and their families as our nation experiences the tsunami of \naging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support \noptions that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in \norder to assure that they get the level of care that they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10785-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL PAYROLL WEEK 1999\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nNational Payroll Week 1999, which has been designated as September 13-\n17.\n  National Payroll Week was founded by the American Payroll Association \nin 1996 to honor the men and women whose tax contributions support the \nAmerican Dream and the payroll professionals who are dedicated to \nprocessing those contributions.\n  In particular, the Susquehanna Valley Chapter of the American Payroll \nAssociation represents 200,000 residents and 25 businesses in \nPennsylvania. These taxpayers contribute millions of dollars to the \nfederal and state treasuries through payroll taxes each year. These \ntaxes help pay for important civic projects including roads, schools, \ncrime prevention, and national defense. In addition, taxpayers and \npayroll professionals are partners in maintaining the Social Security \nand Medicare systems.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the taxpayers and \npayroll professionals who, through the payment, collection, and \nreporting of payroll taxes, have helped make our nation great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10785-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10785-S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING DR. SUPACHAI PANITCHPAKDI\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Supachai \nPanitchpakdi of Thailand on his selection to serve as Director General \nof the World Trade Organization. Dr. Supachai, Thailand's Deputy Prime \nMinister and Minister of Commerce, has been an unfailing advocate for \nthe principles of free trade and is an excellent choice to lead this \norganization. I am very pleased that our faithful friend and ally, the \nRoyal Kingdom of Thailand, will have one of their citizens guiding an \ninternational organization.\n  The agreement reached will split the next term between Dr. Supachai \nand Michael Moore, the former Prime Minster of New Zealand. As many of \nmy colleagues know, the process for selecting a new Director General \nwas at a standstill for months. Renato Ruggerio of Italy, the first and \nvery successful Director General, finished his term and stepped down at \nthe end of April. Despite the fact that his departure was known well in \nadvance, no consensus on a successor was formed and the post remained \nvacant at a critical time--the Seattle round of trade talks being on \nthe immediate horizon. Most of the countries of Europe and Asia have \nbeen united in their support of Dr. Supachai while the administration \nhas supported Mr. Moore. The agreement reached by the member nations \nwill permit Mr. Moore to serve a three year term to be followed by a \nthree year term for Dr. Supachai.\n  For those of you unfamiliar with Dr. Supachai's work, as Deputy Prime \nMinister and Minister of Commerce, his most pressing responsibility has \nbeen developing policy to guide his country through their current \neconomic challenges. This included taking a significant role in \nshepherding important banking and regulatory reforms through the Thai \nParliament that are important to the sound economic foundation of his \ncountry. The IMF has reported good news for Thailand on the economic \nfront. After experiencing an economic contraction of 8% in 1997, their \neconomy is expected to grow this year by 2-3% with an expected growth \nrate of 5% in 2000. Their currency, the baht, has stabilized and the \ngovernment has rebuilt reserves to higher than pre-crisis levels. This \nis very good news and a positive sign for an economic recovery for all \nof Asia.\n  Dr. Supachai was also one of the architects of the economic policies \nthat led his country to merge as a dynamic economic engine in Asia and \nexperience several years of phenomenal economic growth. As Minister of \nCommerce he has been active in opening the business sector to foreign \nparticipation and improving transparency. He helped create the \ncountry's Export-Import Bank and has worked very closely with the \ncountries of Southeast Asia in creating the ASEAN free trade zone. In \nThailand, he was a strong voice in forging public acceptance of the \nUruguay round of trade talks and guiding ratification of the treaty \nthrough the Parliament. Throughout the economic crisis, Dr. Supachai's \nsupport for free trade has not waivered. His credentials on the issues \nimportant to leadership at the WTO speak volumes.\n  I believe it is important that an individual representing Asia and a \ndeveloping economy has an important role in a prominent international \norganization, as Dr. Supachai will have. There are over 400 million \npeople living in Southeast Asia alone, this region will soon be the \nsecond largest market for our exports. This region and all of Asia are \ngrowing in importance to our economy and security. A strong voice \nrepresenting the Asian economies is overdue.\n  The economic collapse in Asia, Russia and other nations did not \nsimply stifle growth of U.S. exports, it put millions of people out of \nwork in these countries, exacerbated the poverty level and in some \ncases led to social upheaval. Unfortunately, it caused policy makers in \nmany foreign nations to question the pace of globalization and in some \ncases question the wisdom of globalization. Many countries believe that \nthey have little to gain through\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\nexpanding trade and everything to lose and that their stake in trade \nnegotiations is limited. I do not agree. Increasing fair trade has \ncontributed greatly to improving the standard of living of Americans \nand sustaining the growth of our economy and it holds the same \npotential for our trading partners.\n  While this is an unfortunate development, it is not one without a \nsolution. The solution is working with individuals like Dr. Supachai \nwho believe in expanding trade and working to improve the role and the \neconomies of developing nations. Rather than being an after thought, we \nmust begin to work with more nations if more are to believe that they \nhave a role in globalization. For the global trading structure to \nsucceed and prosper, all countries must have faith in the trading \nsystem and faith that trade deals are being reached to the benefit of \nall member nations rather than just the most powerful. Dr. Supachai is \nuniquely suited to facilitate such change and his increased role in the \ninternational stage is a very positive development for the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Finally, I believe the people of Thailand could have been treated \nbetter by the United States in this process. They are our good friends \nand faithful allies. We on the other hand were slow in selecting a \ncandidate and did not do a good job in forging a compromise. Despite \nDr. Supachai's strong advocacy of the principles of free trade, we \nactively worked against him. Fortunately, groups such as the US-ASEAN \nBusiness Council and companies like Boeing were outspoken on Dr. \nSupachai's strong record on trade issues. This lack of leadership does \nnot enhance the credibility of the WTO and needlessly strains \nrelationships with our friends. But I am confident that the new \nleadership, Mr. Moore and Dr. Supachai, can overcome these obstacles \nand look forward to working with them on these issues.\n  So once again, I congratulate Dr. Supachai on his appointment. He is \nvery strong on promoting expanded trade and I am confident that a \nleadership role for a representative of a Southeast Asian nation is a \npositive development for the World Trade Organization. I would like to \ncommend the people of Thailand for their persistence and not backing \ndown in their support of their candidate. I would also like to \ncongratulate Mr. Moore and wish him the best; he is taking control of \nthe organization at a critically important time. I look forward to \nworking with both of these gentleman on the issues that are important \nto advancing free and fair trade around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/13/senate-section/article/S10786-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE ARAB AMERICAN CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY CENTER, HOUSTON, TEXAS.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.
