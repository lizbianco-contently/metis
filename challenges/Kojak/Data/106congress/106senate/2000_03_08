Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I appear \nhere today with my friend and colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, to present to the Senate the\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nconference report on the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization measure. The compromise reached in this legislation is \nnot only fair but constructive. It will provide necessary increases \nespecially in capital funds for our aviation infrastructure and does \nprovide a reasonable balance with the needs of that system and our \nlimited Federal resources.\n  I went to the conference committee on this bill with a unique \nperspective because I sit on the Budget and Appropriations Committees \nas well as serving as the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. My \nduties on these committees allowed me to see the hard choices that must \nbe made to stay within our tight budgets.\n  The final agreement reached with Chairman Shuster in the House \nensures the trust fund revenues will be used for aviation spending. I \njoined Senator Domenici in supporting the Senate position on this \nissue, a position that allows for expenditure of these revenues for \ntheir intended purposes without tying the hands of the Appropriations \nCommittee. That was an integral part of the final passage, and I \ncommend Senator Domenici for his hard work on this issue, together with \nthe tremendous contributions we received from Senator Stevens.\n  One issue with which I have some reservations is amending the Death \non the High Seas Act. I am pleased that the resolution amends the \nstatute to bring the anachronistic law more up to date by allowing the \nrecovery of certain types of non-economic damages. The resolution \nremoves the cap on these damages contained in the Senate bill. I am \nalso pleased that we have clearly retained the prohibition on punitive \ndamages, which are not designed to compensate and which are so often \nabused. I think the resolution is good insofar as it reflects the \nSenate approach of keeping most aviation accidents on the high seas \nwithin the statute, thereby providing some semblance of certainty and \nuniformity. I have reservations, however, about the change demanded by \nthe House conferees retroactively to change, from three to twelve \nnautical miles, the distance from the U.S. shore at which the Death on \nthe High Seas act applies. Those who have wanted to take commercial \naviation accident cases on the high seas out of DOHSA altogether have \nargued that this will cure the unfairness of different recoveries based \non the chance of the accident happening over land or over the high \nseas. I have strongly disagreed with that proposition. Eliminating \nDOHSA leaves you with a dizzying array of State, Federal, foreign, or \nperhaps, no, law about which lawyers can fight endlessly, further \npostponing recovery. I trust those who have demanded that we complicate \nthe federal law retroactively to take TWA Flight 800 litigation out of \nthe coverage of DOHSA have fully considered the effects of that change.\n  My concerns with this issue are balanced with the positive aspects of \nthis bill such as the removal of slot restrictions at Chicago O'Hare, \nWashington National, and the two New York airports. These provisions \nwill improve competition, reduce fares, and provide additional service \nto small communities.\n  Another provision which will stimulate competition and help to bridge \nthe funding gap that currently exists is an increase in the cap on the \npassenger facility charge. This provision gets to the heart of my \nguiding philosophy, which is to give local officials more decision-\nmaking power.\n  Although I favor an increase in the cap on the PFC, I realize that \nthis is just one piece of the puzzle. We must look at the issues of our \nnational aviation system in a larger context if we are going to meet \nthe capacity demands of the 21st century. We cannot rely on unlimited \nfederal funding to solve all of our problems. We must stretch our \nfinite resources as far as possible.\n  A prime example of this is the modernization of the air traffic \ncontrol system. This process has been ongoing for more than 15 years. \nWe can no longer allow the program to continue the ``stops and starts'' \nof the past. Improvements must get on track, or, as the National Civil \nAviation Review Commission warned us, the growing demand for air \nservices combined with outdated equipment will soon bring gridlock and \nserious concerns about safety.\n  The Federal Aviation Commission needs to spare no effort over the \nnext few years to modernize the air traffic control system. All of this \nneeds to be done right, and be done now, to ensure continued safety and \nefficiency in the aviation industry.\n  Reforming the way in which the Federal Aviation Administration does \nbusiness, and ensuring it is as efficient as possible, is a positive \nfirst step. This bill contains provisions, which I worked on with \nSenator Rockefeller, to move the Federal Aviation Administration in the \ndirection of being a more business-like entity. Positive reforms, not \njust increased funding, are integral to achieving our goal.\n  Although these reforms are a positive first step, I will continue to \nexplore other possible options such as corporatization of the air \ntraffic control system as the 2nd session of the 106th Congress \ncontinues. I believe we can learn from the work of countries such as \nCanada, New Zealand, and Australia, which have moved to privately run \nsystems. The concerns of general aviation will be of paramount \nimportance to me as this debate continues, and I welcome the input of \nall interested parties.\n  In summary, this agreement will allow both sides to reach our common \ngoal, which is to ensure that we continue to have the safest, most \nefficient aviation system well into the 21st century.\n  I would like to take a minute to thank the Senate staff who worked \ntirelessly on this issue: Aviation subcommittee staff, Ann Choiniere, \nMike Reynolds, Sam Whitehorn, and Julia Krauss ably tended the \ntechnical provisions of the bill. Wally Burnett with Senator Stevens, \nand Cheryle Tucker with Senator Domenici were vital in negotiations \nover budgetary issues.\n  I also thank Jim Sartucci and Keith Hennessey from Senator Lott's \nstaff for assisting with the final negotiations.\n  Last but certainly not least are my own staff members. I thank Jeanne \nBumpus for her diligent efforts on the Death on the High Seas Act, and \nBrett Hale, who is with me today, and who left his name out of these \nprinted remarks. He deserves thanks for the hundreds and hundreds of \nhours he has put in on this bill from beginning to end.\n  Finally, as I began, I want to say it has been a great pleasure to me \nto work with my friend from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, whose \ninterest in this subject is very high and whose competence in coming up \nwith correct answers is equally high.\n  This bill is a true partnership, and I have enjoyed working with him \non coming up with these solutions on that score.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of the major issues included in the \nFAA conference report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Summary of Major Issues Included in the FAA Conference Report\n\n\n                        length of authorization\n\n       4 years (2000-2003) except Research title.\n\n\n                           aip authorization\n\n       $2.475 billion in 2000.\n       $3.2 billion in 2001.\n       $3.3 billion in 2002.\n       $3.4 billion in 2003.\n\n\n                           F authorization\n\n       $2.68 billion in 2000.\n       $2.66 billion in 2001.\n       $2.799 billion in 2002.\n       $2.981 billion in 2003.\n\n\n                             faa operations\n\n       $6.6 billion in 2001.\n       $6.886 billion in 2002.\n       $7.357 billion in 2003.\n\n\n                      re (3 year authorization)\n\n       $224 million in 2000.\n       $237 million in 2001.\n       $249 million in 2002.\n\n\n                    passenger facility charge (PFC)\n\n       House provision, but would allow FAA to approve a PFC only \n     up to $4.50. Basically, it increases PFCs by $1.50. Medium or \n     large hub airports charging the higher PFC must give back 75% \n     of their entitlement.\n\n\n                        airline customer service\n\n       Plans to be submitted to DOT which in turn transmits a copy \n     to the authorizing committees.

The Conference also added a reference \n     preventing discrimination against the handicapped as one of \n     the responsibilities of the DOT consumer office. The DOTIG \n     final report will also include a comparison of the customer \n     service of airlines that submitted plans to DOT with those \n     that did not submit such plans.\n\n\n  commission to ensure consumer information and choice in the airline \n                        industry (Travel Agents)\n\n       Establishes a commission to study the financial condition \n     of travel agents, especially small travel agents. The \n     Commission should study whether the financial condition of \n     travel agents is declining, what effects this will have on \n     consumers, if any, and what, if anything, should be done \n     about it.\n\n\n                           slots in new york\n\n     New York specific provisions\n       Slot restrictions are eliminated after January 1, 2007.\n       In the interim, DOT is directed to provide exemptions to \n     any airline flying to the 2 New York airports if it will use \n     aircraft with 70 seats or less and will (1) provide service \n     to a small hub or non-hub that it did not previously serve, \n     (2) provide additional flights to a small hub or non-hub that \n     it currently serves, or (3) provide service with a regional \n     jet to a small hub or a non-hub as a replacement for a prop \n     plane.\n       DOT is directed to grant exemptions to new entrant and \n     limited incumbents for service to New York.\n       Exemptions are only for Stage 3 aircraft.\n     General Provisions\n       DOT must act on slot exemption requests within 60 days. \n     Exemptions may not be bought, sold, leased or otherwise \n     transferred. For purposes of determining whether an airline \n     qualifies as a new entrant or limited incumbents for \n     receiving slot exemptions, DOT shall count the slots and slot \n     exemptions of both that airline and any other airline that it \n     has a code-share agreement at that airport. The maximum \n     number of slots or slot exemptions that an airline can have \n     and still qualify as limited incumbent is raised from 12 to \n     20.\n\n\n                        slots at chicago o'hare\n\n     Chicago specific provisions\n       In addition, slot restrictions at Chicago are eliminated \n     after July 1, 2002.\n       On July 1, 2001, slot restrictions will apply only between \n     2:45 pm and 8:14 pm. DOT is directed to provide exemptions \n     from the slot rules to any airline flying to Chicago O'Hare \n     airport if it will use aircraft with 70 seats or less and \n     will (1) provide service to a small hub or non-hub that it \n     did not previously serve, (2) provide additional flights to a \n     small hub or non-hub that it currently serves, or (3) provide \n     service with a regional jet to a small hub or non-hub as a \n     replacement for a prop plane.\n       DOT is also directed to grant 30 slot exemptions to new \n     entrants and limited incumbents for service to Chicago. These \n     new entrant exemptions must be granted within 45 days.\n       Slots will not longer be needed in order to provide \n     international service at O'Hare. However, the Secretary may \n     limit access in those cases where the foreign country \n     involved does not provide the same kind of open access for \n     U.S. airlines. DOT is prohibited from withdrawing slots from \n     U.S. airlines in order to give them to foreign airlines. Any \n     slot previously withdrawn from U.S. airlines and given to a \n     foreign airline must be returned to the U.S. airline. Slots \n     held by U.S. airlines to provide international service can be \n     converted to domestic use.\n       Exemptions are only for Stage 3 aircraft.\n     General Provisions\n       Same as described above for New York.\n\n\n            slots and the perimeter rule at reagan national\n\n       DOT is directed is grant 12 slot exemptions within the \n     perimeter, and 12 slot exemptions outside the perimeter. \n     These slots could go to more than one airline.\n       Exemptions must be for flights between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. \n     There can be no more than 2 additional flights per hour.\n       Of the flights within the perimeter, 4 must be to small \n     hubs or non-hubs and 8 must be to medium, small or non-hubs. \n     All requests for exemptions must be submitted within 30 days \n     of enactment. 15 days are allowed to comment. After that, 45 \n     days are allowed for DOT to make a decision.\n       Ten percent of the entitlement money at Reagan National \n     Airport must go to noise abatement. Priority shall be given \n     to applications from the 4 slot-controlled airports for noise \n     set-aside money. DOT shall do a study comparing noise at \n     these 4 airports now as compared to 10 years ago.\n       The definition of limited incumbent air carrier includes \n     slots and slot exemptions held or operated by that carrier. \n     However, slots that are on a long-term lease for a period of \n     10 years or more, being used for international service, and \n     that the current holder releases and renounces any right to \n     subject to the terms of the lease shall not be counted as \n     slots either held or operated for the purposes of determining \n     whether the holder is a limited incumbent.\n       Exemptions are only for Stage 3 aircraft.\n\n\n                                  mwaa\n\n       Extends the deadline for reauthorizing MWAA from 2001 to \n     2004. Also eliminates the requirement that the additional \n     federal Directors be appointed before MWAA can receive AIP \n     grants or impose a new PFC.\n\n\n                                 dohsa\n\n       The territorial sea for aviation accidents is extended from \n     3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. The affect of this is \n     that DOHSA will not apply to planes that crash into the ocean \n     within 12 miles from the shore of the U.S. The law governing \n     accidents that occur between a 3 nautical miles and 12 \n     nautical miles from land will be the same as those that now \n     occur less than 3 nautical miles from the land.\n       For those aviation accidents that occur more than 12 miles \n     form land, the DOHSA will continue to apply. However, in \n     those cases, the Act is modified as in the Senate bill \n     except that there is no $750,000 cap on damages.\n\n\n                            Unruly Passenger\n\n       Imposes fine of $25,000 on a person who assaults or \n     threatens to assault the crew or another passenger, or poses \n     a threat to the safety of the aircraft or its passengers. \n     Also requires the Justice Department to notify the House and \n     Senate authorizing Committees within 90 days as to whether it \n     plans to set up the program to deputize local law \n     enforcement.\n\n\n                         animal transportation\n\n       Modifies the Senate provision to ensure that airlines will \n     continue to be able to carry animals while information is \n     collected to determine whether there is a problem that \n     warrants strong legislative remedies. Toward this end, \n     scheduled airlines will be required to provide monthly \n     reports to DOT describing any incidents involving animals \n     that they carry.\n       DOT and the Department of Agriculture must enter into a MOU \n     to ensure that DOA receives this information. DOT must \n     publish data on incidents and complaints involving animals in \n     its monthly consumer reports or other similar publications.\n       In the meantime, DOT is directed to work with the airlines \n     to improve the training of employees so that (1) they will be \n     better able to ensure the safety of animals being flown and \n     (2) they will be better able to explain to passengers the \n     conditions under which their pets are being carried. People \n     should know that their pets might be in a cargo hold that may \n     not be air-conditioned or may differ from the passenger cabin \n     in other respects.\n\n\n                       national parks overflights\n\n       Commercial air tour operators must conduct commercial air \n     tours over national parks or tribal lands in accordance with \n     applicable air tour management plans (ATMP). Before beginning \n     air tours over a National Park or tribal land, a tour \n     operator must apply to the FAA for the authority to conduct \n     tours. No applications shall be approved until an ATMP is \n     developed and implemented. FAA shall make every effort to act \n     on an application within 24 months of receiving it. Priority \n     shall be given to applications from new entrant air tour \n     operators. Air tours may be conducted at a park without an \n     ATMP if the tour operator secures a letter of agreement from \n     the FAA and the park involved and the total number of flights \n     is limited to 5 flights in a 30 day period.\n       FAA in cooperation with the Park Service shall establish an \n     ATMP for any park at which someone wants to provide \n     commercial air tours. The ATMP shall be developed with public \n     participation. It could ban air tours or establish \n     restrictions on them. It will apply within a half a mile \n     outside the boundary of the park. The plan should include \n     incentives to use quiet aircraft.\n       Prior to the establishment of the ATMP, the FAA shall grant \n     interim authority to operators that are providing air tours. \n     This interim authority may limit the number of flights. \n     Interim operating authority may also be granted for new \n     entrants if (1) it is needed to ensure competition in the \n     provision of air tours over the park and (2) 24 months have \n     passed since enactment of this Act and no ATMP has been \n     developed for the park involved. Interim operating authority \n     should not be granted to new entrants if it will create a \n     safety or a noise problem.\n       The above shall not apply to the Grand Canyon, tribal lands \n     abutting the Grand Canyon, or to flights over Lake Mead that \n     are on the way to the Grand Canyon.\n       FAA shall establish standards for quiet aircraft within 1 \n     year or explain to Congress why it will be unable to do so. \n     Quiet aircraft may get special routes for Grand Canyon air \n     tours and may not be subject to the cap on the number of \n     flights there.\n       Air tours over the Rocky Mountain National Park are \n     prohibited.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the words of my friend from the State \nof Washington are not justified except if they are returned to him and \nto his staff.\n  The process of working legislation is extraordinary. This has been a \nvery long process, more or less a 2-year process. Working with Senator \nSlade Gorton from the State of Washington over the years has been a \ngreat privilege for me and continues on this bill, which is the Wendell \nH. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, which \nis a long title, but we had to give it a long title in order to be able \nto give it an acronym, which is FAIR-21. FAIR, that is what the bill \nis.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n Wendell Ford, should he be listening, should be very proud.\n  We have had half a dozen temporary extensions on this bill. It has \nbeen 2 years in the making. When Senator Gorton talks about the \nenormous number of hours spent by Sam Whitehorn of the committee staff, \nKerry Ates of my own staff, and members of his own committee and \npersonal staff, he is exactly right. It has been an extraordinary and \nfrustrating process but a successful one.\n  There are many Members of the Senate and the House to thank. It was \none of those situations where you had the authorizing committees, the \nbudget committees, the appropriations committees, in both Houses, \ncoming to an agreement--which is very rare in something of this sort, \nand all in a fairly short period of time. Frankly, including obviously \nSenator Gorton, I think I really want to thank the majority leader, \nSenator Trent Lott, for stepping in in a most remarkable way, most \nforcefully, at a critical time, to bring the parties together and make \nsure we pushed toward a solution.\n  In the end, I think we have achieved a bipartisan House-Senate \ncompromise of which I, for one at least, am very proud. We have a final \nbill that will set us on an entirely new path in terms of the FAA, and \nin a larger sense for aviation in this country, which has enormous \nimpact. For the aviation community, and those of us who work with \nthem--and I thank them for their help on this bill, also; not all of \nthem being happy about all aspects of it, but that is in the nature of \nthings--hopefully this good economic news, of the passage of this bill, \nis, however, entirely overshadowed by fear that most of us have about \nthe state of our system as it is now, of our aviation system \nparticularly in regard to air traffic control and other matters in our \ninfrastructure.\n  At current levels, our system is already so overburdened we are \nsuffocating from congestion and delays. The country suffers through it. \nIs there a popular uprising? There does not seem to be one. But the \nfact is, it is a suffocating situation, a dangerous situation. We are \nincreasingly concerned about safety, with every single reason to be, \ngiven the doubling of the number of air passengers and many more cargo \nplanes and passenger planes to be built in the future. Whatever you see \ntoday, try to double it in your mind and then figure the same number of \nrunways. How on Earth are people going to accept a situation where \ndelays are growing longer and it becomes more dangerous unless we do \nsomething about it? This bill does. Delays have increased by 50 \npercent. Today, one in four flights is delayed more than 15 minutes. \nThat is not what passengers want. That is not what airlines want.\n  To be very blunt about it, if there is no change in the way we are \ndoing business, we will come to a situation before the year 2015 where \nthere will be, somewhere in this world, a major airplane crash every 7 \nto 10 days. That is the course. It is a terrible course, a dangerous \ncourse, and one which this Congress cannot allow to go on and which \nthis Congress, in fact, with this bill, does a great deal about.\n\n  We have fallen behind. Unless we get started immediately in the \neffort to modernize our air traffic control system, to fix our \nairports, we stand a very good chance of never being able to catch up, \nnever catching up to the curve, much less getting ahead of it. That is \nfundamentally what this bill, FAIR-21, is about.\n  It is about fixing the system. It is about trying to get ahead of the \ngrowth curve with our most significant increase ever in airport and air \ntraffic control funding, and some fundamental reforms in the way we do \nbusiness in our system. It is about improving safety and service for \nthe traveling public and supporting aviation employees under great \nstress in their challenging jobs. Senator Gorton and I have each seen \nthat on many occasions. These people work under incredible tension all \nthe time. They work with very old equipment.\n  It is about increasing competition. It is about giving a leg up, \nfinally, to small communities such as I have in my State, as does \nSenator Gorton, as does every Senator in his or her State--small \ncommunities that were left behind when we did airline deregulation 20 \nyears ago.\n  So, FAIR-21, this bill, will provide $40 billion for the FAA in \nfiscal year 2001 until fiscal year 2003. It is a 25-percent increase in \ntotal aviation funding. The key investments will be fixing aviation \ninfrastructure, to wit, airport funding will increase by 33 percent, \nand air traffic control modernization funding will increase by 40 \npercent. That is so desperately needed. FAA funding operations will \nalso increase by approximately 15 percent over the same period. We are \nbeginning to nudge into the area to start fixing our problems.\n  This bill represents the will of the Congress, hopefully, and the \nwill of the American people, to take a dangerous situation and start to \nfix it. For the very first time, FAIR-21 establishes that all revenues \nand interest paid into the aviation trust fund by airline passengers, \nlo and behold, will be spent on aviation. That seems quite fair to me. \nThat means that $33 billion of the $40 billion will be guaranteed from \nthe trust fund, not taken off-budget, which this Senator would have \nliked to have seen but was not going to happen; so not taken off-budget \nbut protected through points of order and with a strong commitment from \nthe Appropriations Committee to fully fund all accounts. This was part \nof the magic of the process that Senator Trent Lott, Senator Gorton, \nand others worked out to make people satisfied.\n  All told, this represents--and my colleagues should hear this--the \nbiggest total increase in aviation investments ever. I know few \nproblems receive that kind of boost unless the Congress perceives there \nis a crisis. What we learned over recent years about aviation was that \na crisis was coming. I am thankful we have the foresight to take action \nnow.\n  To move beyond the funding issue for a moment, I want to point out a \nfew of the key aviation law and policy changes contained in this bill \nwhich I think are very helpful and good:\n  Whistle-blower protection for aviation and airline employees who \nreport safety problems;\n  A $1.50 increase on the cap of the passenger facility charge for \nairport projects, which is enormously helpful to local airports;\n  An Air Service Development Program, with grants up to $500,000 each \nfor innovative efforts to improve air service in small communities; in \nother words, small communities can do something and get a match;\n  A ban on smoking everywhere, even internationally;\n  Easing of the slots rule at O'Hare, LaGuardia, and Kennedy Airports. \nThis carries with it some controversy. Compromises were made. Not \neverybody was happy. But resolution was reached;\n  New criminal background checks and training for airport security \npersonnel as the pressure on all of that continues to increase;\n  Increased funding for the essential air service program is enormously \nimportant in my State of West Virginia and every single area where \nthere are rural airports. The State of the Presiding Officer has its \nfair share of those;\n  Finally, new and increased penalties for airline customer service \nviolations. That goes along with the effort Senator Gorton and I led to \nhave a passenger bill of rights, which the airlines could have first \ncrack at, which seems to be working out very well but, on the other \nhand, we are watching very closely.\n  We have had a lot of time to work on this bill and, in my view, it \nhas gotten better and better during the process and reached a crescendo \nin the last several days. It is a bold conference report designed to \nprotect our future. I hope my colleagues will join me and the Senator \nfrom the State of Washington in sending this bill to the President.\n  So much of the work is done not just by Senators willing to \ncompromise and House Members willing to compromise but, most \nimportantly, by staff who worked through the night often to make sure \nthings came out very well.\n  When we began the effort to enact meaningful legislation to address \nthe needs of our air transportation system, we knew it would be a \ndifficult process. Even anticipating that, I can tell you that it has \nbeen more difficult than any of us could have imagined.\n  This bill has been more than two years in the making, with nearly a \nhalf-dozen temporary extensions in the process. There are many Members \nin\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nthe Senate and House to thank for all of the hard work and effort it \ntook to bring this to a conclusion. Members on and off the conference \ncommittee have really rolled up their sleeves to work out a very \ndifficult compromise. And above all others, the majority leader stepped \nin during these critical and delicate last few months to push us toward \na final solution.\n  In the end, we've achieved a bipartisan, House-Senate compromise that \nI am very proud of. We have a final bill that I believe will set us on \nan entirely new path for the FAA and aviation.\n  Aviation in this country is at a crossroads. Aviation is a critical \nengine of economic development at the national and local levels, and it \nhas the potential for unprecedented and incomprehensive growth over the \nnext decade.\n  The travel and tourism industry employs 1 in 17 Americans.\n  Air travelers spend over $500 billion each year in the U.S. and \ngenerate more than $70 billion in federal, state and local taxes.\n  Aviation is the only U.S. industry that has consistently enjoyed a \npositive trade balance.\n  By 2009, enplanements are projected to increase to 1 billion people, \nfrom 650 million in 1999.\n  In many respects this is good news--it is one of the great success \nstories of our booming economy. Yet, for the aviation community and \nthose of us who work with them, this good news is entirely overshadowed \nby fears about the state of our system. At current traffic levels, our \nsystem is already so overburdened that we are suffocating from \ncongestion and delays, and we are increasingly concerned about safety.\n  Almost every week, another red flag goes up about the looming crisis \nin aviation.\n  Scheduled flying times have increased 75 percent on the top 200 \nroutes in the nation.\n  Delays have increased by 50 percent, and today one in four flights is \ndelayed more than 15 minutes, at a cost to the economy of more than $4 \nbillion.\n  Recent data shows a rise in runway incidents (so-called runway \nincursions), and we read too often about near-misses in the skies.\n  If there is no change in the current accident rate before the year \n2015, there is expected to be a major airline accident somewhere in the \nworld every 7-10 days.\n  Yet, from 1998 to 1999, the FAA had to reduce safety inspections by \n10 percent and cut 5 percent of its security staff.\n  All of us--the airlines, the airports, and the Congress--have had a \ndifficult time keeping up with the pace of growth. The result is that, \nas a nation, we've fallen behind. Unless we get started immediately in \nthe effort to modernize our traffic control system and fix our \nairports, we may never catch up.\n  That's fundamentally what this bill, FAIR-21, is all about. It's \nabout fixing the system and trying to get ahead of the growth curve--\nwith our most significant increase ever in airport and air traffic \ncontrol funding and some fundamental reforms of our system.\n  And it's about improving safety and service for the traveling public; \nsupporting aviation employees in challenging jobs, increasing \ncompetition, and giving a leg up finally to small communities who were \nleft behind in airline deregulation twenty years ago.\n  FAIR-21 will provide $40 billion for the FAA for FY 2001-2003--a 25 \npercent increase in total aviation funding. The key investments will be \nfixing aviation infrastructure--airport funding will increase by 33 \npercent and air traffic control modernization funding will increase by \n40 percent. FAA operations funding also will increase, by approximately \n15 percent over the same period.\n\n  For the first time, FAIR-21 establishes that all revenues and \ninterest paid into the aviation trust fund by airline passengers will \nbe spent on aviation. That means that $33 billion of the $40 billion \nbill will be guaranteed from the trust fund--not taken off-budget but \nprotected through points of order and with a strong commitment from the \nAppropriations Committee to fully fund all accounts. The remaining $6.7 \nbillion would come from the General Fund, subject to appropriations.\n  For fiscal year 2001, the bill fully meets the President's budget \nrequest for FAA operations and air traffic control equipment, and it \nexceeds the President's budget request for AIP by $1.2 billion.\n  All told this represents the biggest total increase in aviation \ninvestments ever. I know that few programs receive that kind of boost--\nunless a crisis exists. What we have learned about aviation is that a \ncrisis is coming. And I'm thankful we have the foresight to take action \nnow.\n  To move beyond the funding issue for a moment, let me also highlight \na few of the key aviation law and policy changes contained in this bill \nthat I think are particularly important. I am very pleased that the \nbill contains: whistleblower protection for airline and aviation \nemployees who report safety problems; a $1.50 increase in the cap on \nthe passenger facility charge for airport projects; an Air Service \nDevelopment program, with grants of up to $500,000 each for innovative \nefforts to improve air service in small communities; a ban on smoking \non all flights to and from the U.S., including international flights; \nan easing of the slot rules at O'Hare, LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports; \na focus on reducing the number of runway incursions that can result in \nserious accidents; new criminal background checks and training for \nairport security personnel; increased funding for the Essential Air \nService program; and new and increased penalties for airline's customer \nservice violations.\n  We have had a lot of time to work on this bill, and in my view it has \ngotten better and better. It is a bold conference report designed to \nprotect our future, and I hope my colleagues will join me in sending it \non to the President for his signature.\n  Before we end the debate this morning, I want to say a few things. \nAgain, all of the staff from the Commerce Committee, my office, the \noffices of the other conferees, and the House staff, deserve our \nthanks. They spent months working on this bill. In fact, this bill was \nstarted almost 2 years ago. Countless hours, late nights, lots of \nmissed family events. We owe all of them our thanks.\n  I also want to thank, and I know Senator Hollings and others share \nthis, Hans Ephramson-Abt. Many of you probably have encountered him. He \nis a gentleman, first and foremost, who has worked for years to help \nthe families of victims of aviation disasters. The conference report \nchanges the liability laws for accidents offshore, preserving the \nability of people like the children of Montoursville, PA, who vanished \nin the TWA flight 800 tragedy. Hans lost his daughter, Alice, on KAL \n007, shot down off of Korea in September 1983. He has done a great \nservice in helping others, and for that we all owe him a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Finally, I want to say that we have had a long debate over the last \nseveral years about FAA reform. For now, that issue has been resolved. \nOver the next several years, working with Administrator Garvey, or her \nsuccessor, we will look at other ways to improve the FAA. Today, the \nbill before you does many creative things for the FAA--giving it the \ntools to be more business-like, but retaining its crucial role as \nsafety arbiter. The bill, for example, gives the FAA the ability to \nenter into long-term leases for satellite communications services, \nsomething that will save the FAA money. It establishes a public-private \nfunding mechanism to expedite the installation of air traffic control \nequipment, with the priorities set by the private sector. It structures \nthe FAA after corporate models, establishing one person to be \naccountable for air traffic control operations and plans. It \nestablishes a Board to oversee those activities. The FAA, because of \nactions led by the Commerce Committee and Senator Lautenberg, today has \nprocurement and personnel flexibility that no other governmental agency \nhas. We have achieved a lot over the last several years, and with this \nbill, continue to make progressive changes to the FAA, without \ncompromising safety. I know that there are some in the Administration \nthat are not satisfied, and probably will never be satisfied, but this \nis a good bill and one that will do a lot for our aviation system. I \nurge my colleagues to fully support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more complete listing of staff who \nspent months working on this bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            democratic staff\n\n       Kevin Kayes, Moses Boyd, Sam Whitehorn, Ellen Doneski, \n     Julia Krauss, Jonathan Oakman, and Carl Bentzel.\n\n\n                            republican staff\n\n       Mike Reynolds, Ann Choiniere, Scott Verstandig, Jim \n     Sartucci, Keith Hennesy, Brett Hale.\n\n\n                              budget staff\n\n       Bill Hoagland, Cheryl Tucker, and Mitch Warren.\n\n\n                          appropriations staff\n\n       Wally Burnett and Peter Rogoff.\n\n\n                         house republican staff\n\n       Jack Shenendorf, Roger Norber, Sharon Barkaloo, Chris \n     Bertram, Dave Schaeffer, Adam Tsao, Rob Chamberlin and David \n     Balloff.\n\n\n                         house democratic staff\n\n       Dave Hymsfeld, Ward McCarriger, Stacy Soumbeniotis, Tricia \n     Loveland, Paul Feldman, who left last November, and Collen \n     Corr.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield the floor, Mr. President, and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, how much time do the proponents have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 5 of those minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the conference report before us has been \na long time in the making. It is a comprehensive bill that successfully \naddresses many important aviation issues. Not the least of these is the \neventual elimination of the so-called slot rules at three of our \nnation's airports, O'Hare, Kennedy and LaGuardia. It also adds \nadditional slots at Reagan Washington National Airport. I support these \nmeasures.\n  I congratulate Senator McCain, the Senate Commerce Committee \nChairman, Senator Gorton, the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, Senator \nHollings, the full committee ranking member, and Senator Rockefeller, \nthe subcommittee ranking member, for their efforts to bring about good \npublic policy. This has not been an easy conference, and all of you \nhave put forth a tremendous effort to see that it was concluded \nsuccessfully. I wish to also thank their staffs.\n  I also express my thanks and admiration to my good friend, Senator \nDomenici, our Budget Committee chairman. Of all the issues before the \nconference, the resolution of the budget issues was the most trying and \ncomplex. Senator Domenici and his staff worked tirelessly to seek a \nfair and adequate solution to this problem.\n  I express my admiration for my friend and colleague, Senator Stevens, \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Stevens \nhas played a key role in reaching an agreement on spending.\n  The phase-out of the slot rule at O'Hare and LaGuardia will open a \nnew era in aviation. Because it is a phase-out and not an immediate \ntermination, that era should also give smaller airports a better chance \nfor a piece of the economic pie at the national and international \nlevels.\n  While e-commerce may be all the rage currently, people still need to \ntravel for business purposes. Direct human contact is still the premium \nway to do business, and air travel is the fastest way to accomplish \nthat over long distances and tight time frames.\n  This compromise follows the direction which my Iowa colleague, \nSenator Harkin, and I set forth early in the debate on the slot rule. \nWe looked at the needs of the airports in Iowa, and came to the \nconclusion together that it was time for a change if our State was to \nmaintain its economic momentum in the national and international \nmarketplace. Iowa does not have a major hub airport that guarantees \nlow-cost or frequent flights. Like most States, we have smaller \nairports that are greatly affected by the traffic into and out of the \nmajor hub airports. In this case those airports are O'Hare and \nLaGuardia.\n  Our solution was to phase out the slot rule. The first step was to \nimmediately give increased access to the hub airports by turboprop \naircraft and regional jets. These are the aircraft that primarily serve \nour smaller airports. Giving them time before the slot rule is lifted \nfor large airport-to-large airport competition should give the smaller \nairports time to establish the economic and market base needed to \njustify service. Otherwise, we would only see increased flights between \nmajor cities, to the exclusion of smaller airports.\n  We received the support of a large number of Senators who were also \nconcerned about the future of their small hub and nonhub airports. \nTogether, all of us have been able to accomplish what was unthinkable \njust several years ago, the eventual elimination of the slot rule at \nthose two airports. I deeply appreciate their faith and support to \naccomplish this.\n  I also thank President Clinton for having the foresight and courage \nto recommend the elimination of the slot rule at these airports. He \ngave a legitimacy and momentum to the debate that would not have \nexisted otherwise.\n  The States attorneys general, lead by Iowa Attorney General Tom \nMiller, also played a significant part and should be thanked.\n  Not everyone is entirely happy with the compromise solution in this \nconference report. I look upon that as ratification that it must be a \npretty good compromise. I truly feel that the airlines were treated as \nfairly and equally as possible.\n  Our Nation's airports will be receiving additional funds for their \ncapital needs under this legislation. I know that these funds are much \nneeded and will be put to good use. Iowa's airports have rehabilitation \nand expansion plans that will be enhanced by these additional funds. \nThis includes increased disbursements from the Airports and Airways \nTrust Fund and the increase in the passenger facility charge, PFC. It \nis important to note that the PFC will not increase at an airport until \nlocal authorities have approved an increase. It is entirely within \ntheir realm to grant or deny this increase at the local level.\n  However, I must again warn the Federal Aviation Administration that \nmore money will not cure all of the problems facing the FAA and the \naviation industry. Fundamental reform of the way the FAA does business \nand on a cultural level is necessary if we are to truly make the \nadvances which are needed.\n  As a budget conferee, I believe the budget compromise is the best we \ncan do at this time. I shall work with Chairman Domenici to secure the \nnecessary funds through the budget process.\n  The biggest disappoint to me is the inclusion of a civil fine against \nairline employee whistle-blowers. While I am very pleased that whistle-\nblower protection has been extended to the aviation industry, I feel \nthat it is flawed due to the civil penalty. Such a penalty does not \nexist in other whistle-blower statutes. I will work to correct this \nsituation.\n  Whistle-blower protection adds another, much needed, layer of \nprotection for the traveling public using our Nation's air \ntransportation system. I am pleased to have worked with the Association \nof Flight Attendants AFL-CIO on this important, ground breaking \nlegislation. They have worked tirelessly on this provision, and I know \nthey will continue to work with me to correct this flaw. I call upon \nthe airlines to do the same and seek the help of the public, also.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked \nso hard to get this bill to this point. It is not fun to oppose \nsomething that was reported out of the conference committee with such \nstrong support.\n  But I have a different responsibility given the fact that I serve \nboth as the ranking member of the Budget Committee and the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. In my view, this bill \nrepresents a missed opportunity to fully address the financing needs of \nour Nation's aviation system.\n  To the degree the bill actually guarantees any real funding \nincreases, it does so in a manner that I consider grossly unbalanced. \nMr. President, if\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nyou ask the average Senator if they are willing to fund aviation at the \nexpense of the Coast Guard, I guarantee you they would say no. If you \nasked each Senator whether they were willing to fund aviation at the \nexpense of Amtrak, I guarantee you most would say no. If you asked the \naverage Senator whether or not they were willing to fund aviation at \nthe expense of our federal highway safety efforts, they would say: \nCertainly not.\n  But if this conference agreement becomes law, we run the very real \nrisk of cutting back funds for NHTSA, the National Transportation \nSafety Board, Amtrak, the Coast Guard, and other areas just to boost \nfunding for two aviation capital accounts by almost $2 billion next \nyear. And those two aviation accounts don't even finance the core \noperations of the air traffic control system--the area where the FAA is \nfacing its most difficult challenges.\n  Our national transportation system needs investments in several \nareas, not just aviation. Look at what is happening with the Coast \nGuard. All of us salute the Coast Guard. We saw in the papers just \nyesterday that they do not have enough people to monitor cruise ships \nthat are dumping their waste in the oceans. They do not have enough \nmaintenance funding to keep their aircraft in the air. They do not have \nenough people to monitor the attempts by illegal immigrants to enter \nthis country. They don't have enough money for pollution control, for \nfisheries enforcement, and for recruiting. But I don't hear my \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee, who have jurisdiction over the \nCoast Guard, advocating for a Coast Guard ``guarantee.''\n  Mr. President, throughout my entire Senate career, I have led the \nfight for increased investment in transportation. My support for \ntransportation started when I served as the Commissioner of the Port \nAuthority of New York/New Jersey. At that time, I learned that you \ncan't ignore the needs of one transportation mode in favor of another. \nInvestments need to be made in a balanced way if you are going to avoid \ngridlock. You can't ignore the rail system or the highways to focus on \naviation. You need to keep your eye on safety, not just construction. \nThe requirement to reauthorize our aviation laws presented this \nCongress with a great opportunity to address the financing of our \nnation's aviation system in a comprehensive and bipartisan manner. \nUnfortunately, this bill misses the mark.\n  This Conference Agreement took so long to produce because so many \nMembers wanted to provide big funding increases for aviation without \npaying for them. Mr. President, the simple fact is that the revenue \nstream to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is not adequate to fund the \nsubstantial funding increases for aviation that many members want. \nBecause of that basic fact, the aviation conferees have been haggling \nfor the last year over methods to develop a new mousetrap to produce \nthose funding increases without adequate revenue. Over the last week, \nthe Majority Leader and the majority members of the conference \ncommittee reached the agreement that is currently before us. It seeks \nto guarantee a 64 percent increase in airport grants, and a 30 percent \nincrease in modernization funding. These so-called ``guaranteed'' \nincreases come at a time when the Republican Majority is debating among \nitself whether to impose a hard freeze on discretionary spending at the \ncurrent year's level, or provide for a minuscule 2.4 percent increase. \nThe arithmetic is simple. The $1.9 billion or 47 percent increase that \nthis bill seeks to ``guarantee'' for airport grants and modernization \nwill either require cuts in the rest of the Transportation Department \nor the rest of the discretionary budget.\n\n  I understand that the Chairman of the Budget Committee was a party to \nthese negotiations. I am told that he is prepared to state that the \nBudget Resolution that he will propose fully funds the needs of these \nso-called aviation guarantees. While I have great respect for the \nBudget Committee Chairman, I have to say that I would like to know \nwhere the funding is coming from if he plans to impose a freeze on \ndiscretionary spending. That should be a concern to all Members, \nwhether they care about the Coast Guard, Amtrak, education, health \ncare, veterans benefits, agriculture, or anything else.\n  Mr. President, one of the areas that will face greater budget \nausterity as a result of these so-called ``guaranteed'' increases is \nthe operating budget in the FAA. The operating account pays for the \noperations of the air traffic control system. It pays the salary of \nevery air traffic controller and every aviation inspector. It pays for \nsecurity at our airports. It pays for the publication of every safety \nregulation. Three quarters of the operations budget goes just to pay \nthe salaries of the people that keep the system safe every day. This \naccount is where the FAA faces the most severe funding shortfall. So it \nis absurd that we are now going to pass a bill that will boost capital \nfunding while subjecting the operations budget to even greater \nausterity. Due to existing shortfalls in its operating budget, the FAA \njust canceled all training activities except introductory training for \nair traffic controllers for the remainder of the year. We also have \nproblems with new state-of-the-art equipment sitting in warehouses \nbecause the FAA doesn't have the operating funds to install them. There \naren't even adequate operating funds to train our air traffic \ncontrollers how to use the equipment. FAA has had to delay the \ncertification of new aircraft and new equipment. Those delays are \nhurting our U.S. aircraft manufacturers. The number of aviation safety \ninspectors is being allowed to trickle down and FAA can't afford to \nhire new inspectors to replace them. With that backdrop, the Republican \nConferees on this bill produced a conference report that loaded all of \nthe so-called ``guaranteed'' funding increases on capital investment \nprograms and ignored the operations budget. Just two days ago, the FAA \nreleased its updated forecast for future aviation traffic. That \nforecast indicates that domestic airline traffic will increase more \nthan 60 percent through 2011. That increased traffic will also put \nincredible pressure on the operation budget of the FAA. We will need \nmore safety and security inspectors, not less. We will need better \ntrained controllers and more of them. But the bill before us ignores \nthose needs. This bill is simply lopsided and unbalanced. And in time, \nMr. President, I believe the Members championing this bill will realize \nthat they made a mistake. In fact, they may realize it sooner than they \nthink.\n  I am not sure, in the end, that all of these ``guaranteed'' funding \nincreases will materialize. The point-of-order in the Senate that \nprotects these funding guarantees is a 50-vote point-of-order. It will \nrequire 51 votes to waive that point-of-order. We all know that it is \nimpossible to do anything in the Senate without 51 votes. So fiscal \nreality may require the Senate to revisit these guarantees sooner \nrather than later. It will only require a simple majority of the Senate \nto do so.\n  Maybe that will not happen for a year or two. Maybe it will happen \nlater this Spring. In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Senate \nTransportation Appropriations subcommittee, I will manage only one more \nTransportation Appropriations bill. But I promise that I am not going \nto silently watch the Amtrak budget, the Coast Guard budget, or the \nFAA's own operations budget get ravaged to pay for the so-called \n``guarantees'' provided in this bill. I will see to it that every \nMember here will have the opportunity to vote on whether we should shut \ndown Amtrak lines, tie up Coast Guard ships, or lay off aviation \ninspectors, in order to pay for these guarantees.\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, this bill represents a missed opportunity. \nThis bill missed the opportunity to provide momentum for funding \nincreases in the FAA across-the-board to address all the agency's \nshortfalls, including the operations budget. By loading all of the so-\ncalled guaranteed funding on the capital accounts, it becomes plain as \nday, that the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is not adequate to fund all \nof our aviation needs. It will only be a matter of time before we have \nto consider a tax increase or new user fees in order to truly meet all \nof the FAA's needs.\n  Mr. President, this bill is shortsighted. It was produced in the back \nroom without Minority Members present, and I do not believe it \nrepresents a sustainable aviation policy for our nation. The funding \nprovisions in this bill may not even be sustainable for the coming \nfiscal year. For that reason, I cannot support this bill.\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I intend to use my leader time for \npurposes of making a couple of statements this morning. I would like \nfirst to voice my support for the conference report to H.R. 1000, \nwhich, as has already been noted, is the Wendell H. Ford Aviation \nInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.\n  I hope our former colleague, Senator Wendell Ford, a dear and very \nspecial friend of mine who served as chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee's Aviation Subcommittee for many years, is \nwatching because this truly is a tribute to his dedication not only to \naviation but to his country and to the Senate for a long time. It is a \nvery appropriate designation for this legislation.\n  The conference report we are considering today will help repair our \naviation system for the skyrocketing number of passengers who will \ntravel in the 21st century. It is also a fitting tribute to Senator \nFord's vision that he expressed to us on many occasions as he was \nleading us on this and many other issues.\n  I thank as well the majority leader, Senator Lott, for his \npersistence in providing leadership on this matter and in getting us to \nthis point. I think the credit also must go to our distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member. It is clear they have the \nchemistry and the working relationship it takes to accomplish something \nof this complexity, and I pay tribute to both of them for their efforts \nand for their arduous work in getting us to this point. We ought to be \ncelebrating this morning the accomplishments of something that many of \nus have been hoping to achieve for a long period of time. Were it not \nfor their leadership and support, it would not have happened.\n  I have been reminded oftentimes of the movie ``Groundhog Day'' with \nBill Murray, with the Senate waking up once a year to consider the same \nFAA reauthorization bill. The Senate first began considering this bill \nin 1998 and passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act, in September of that year. \nAlthough there was overwhelming support for that legislation in the \nSenate, House and Senate negotiators could not agree on a multiyear \nbill at that time.\n  Last year, the Senate passed S. 82, the Air Transportation \nImprovement Act of 1999, in October. As my colleagues have recalled, \nthis legislation was almost identical to the FAA reauthorization bill \nwe approved the year before. Again, there was overwhelming support for \nthe legislation in the Senate. However, House and Senate negotiators \ncould not agree on a multiyear FAA reauthorization bill, just as they \nwere unable to do the year before.\n  As the Senate has considered and reconsidered the FAA reauthorization \nbill in recent years, the FAA has been operating for the most part \nunder short-term extensions. I have mentioned on many occasions my view \nthat this is no way to fund such an important Federal agency. Short-\nterm extension after short-term extension disrupts long-term planning \nat the FAA and airports around the country that rely on Federal funds \nto improve their facilities and enhance aviation safety. The only thing \nworse than passing a short-term extension is allowing funding for FAA \nprograms to lapse altogether. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the \nCongress did when the House again refused to consider the 6-month \nextension the Senate passed on November 10 of last year. For the last 4 \nmonths, funds for airport improvement projects have been tied up \nbecause Congress has been unable to forge an agreement on the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  So today we begin to rectify that mistake and prepare for the \nincreased demand that will be placed on our aviation system in the 21st \ncentury. This bill will authorize approximately $40 billion for \naviation programs over the next 3 years. In fiscal year 2001, the bill \nwill authorize $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion over current \nlevels. In the next fiscal year, it will enhance aviation safety by \nauthorizing $3.2 billion for airport improvement projects, $3.3 billion \nin fiscal year 2002, and $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2003.\n  It will also allow airports to increase passenger facility charges \nfrom $3 to $4.50. This PFC increase is expected to generate $700 \nmillion for much-needed construction projects that will improve \nairports in South Dakota and around the country, in every State.\n\n  The conference report to the FAA reauthorization bill also includes a \nnumber of provisions that would encourage competition among the \nairlines and ensure quality air service for communities. For instance, \nit would authorize funding for a 4-year pilot program to improve \ncommercial air service in small communities that have not benefited \nfrom deregulation.\n  Specifically, the bill calls for the establishment of an Office of \nSmall Community Air Service Development at the Department of \nTransportation (DOT) to work with local communities, states, airports \nand air carriers and develop public-private partnerships that bring \ncommercial air service including regional jet service to small \ncommunities.\n  We have often commented on how critical the Essential Air Service \nProgram has been to small communities in South Dakota and around the \ncountry in their efforts to retain air service. The Small Community \nAviation Development Program would give DOT the authority to provide up \nto $500,000 per year to as many as 40 communities that participate in \nthe program and agree to pay 25 percent in matching funds. In addition, \nthe legislation would establish an air traffic control service pilot \nprogram that would allow up to 20 small communities to share in the \ncost of building contract control towers.\n  I am hopeful that South Dakota will have the opportunity to \nparticipate in the Small Community Aviation Development Program. I \nthink it is one of the better features of this legislation. I commend \nmy colleagues for their inclusion of it.\n  Mr. President, I know some of our colleagues may oppose this bill \nbecause it would increase the number of flights at the four slot-\ncontrolled airports. The proposal to increase the number of flights at \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport has been particularly \ncontroversial, and I would again like to commend Senator Robb for being \na strong advocate for his constituents in northern Virginia.\n  I know some of our colleagues on the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation will also oppose this bill because of the budgetary \ntreatment of the aviation trust fund. I understand their concerns and \nlook forward to working with them to ensure that Amtrak, Coast Guard, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board, and FAA operations are \nadequately funded.\n  Although there may be different provisions in this bill that each of \nus may find objectional, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and \nReform Act for the 21st Century. Spring is just around the corner, and \nwe cannot afford to delay construction on airport improvement projects \nany longer.\n  It is unfair to FAA, it is unfair to airports in South Dakota and \nthroughout the country, and it is unfair to passengers who rely on the \naviation system for their travel needs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the conference report to the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues, especially the chairman and ranking \nmember, for their work on this bill. I hope we can pass it this \nafternoon on a bipartisan basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1254-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1254-S1255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATIONS OF MARSHA BERZON AND RICHARD PAEZ\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, among the constitutional responsibilities \nentrusted to the Senate, none is more critical to the well-being of our \ndemocracy than providing advice and consent on Presidential \nnominations. Later on today, we take up that solemn responsibility in \nconnection with two very distinguished judicial nominees, Marsha Berzon \nand Judge Richard Paez.\n  Let me commend the majority leader for his commitment to the Senate, \nand to these nominees, that we would take up these nominees for \nconsideration and ultimately for a vote on confirmation before the 15th \nof March. We\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nwould not be here were it not for the fact that he persisted and that \nhe was willing to hold to the commitment he made to us last year.\n  Both nominees have waited an extraordinarily long time for this \nconsideration. Marsha Berzon, a nominee for the Ninth Circuit, has been \nkept waiting for a vote more than 2 years. Judge Paez, another Ninth \nCircuit nominee, has waited for more than 4 years. That is longer than \nany Federal court nominee in history--a statistic that should shame the \nSenate.\n  Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon are both exceptional legal minds and \nremarkable people. But before I discuss their qualifications, I wish to \nsay something about the context in which these nominations are being \nconsidered. Since the 106th Congress convened in January, the President \nhas nominated 79 men and women to fill the vacancies on the Federal \nbench. Without exception, these nominees have come to us with the \nhighest marks from their peers. Yet of the 79 nominees, only 34--fewer \nthan half--were confirmed last year, and only 4 have been confirmed so \nfar this year.\n  Looking at those figures, one might assume we have no pressing need \nfor Federal judges. In fact, just the opposite is true. Today, there \nare 76 vacancies on the Federal bench. Of those 76 vacancies, 29 have \nbeen empty so long they are officially classified as ``judicial \nemergencies.'' The failure to fill these vacancies is straining our \nFederal court system and delaying justice for people all across this \ncountry.\n  This cannot continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist warns, ``Judicial \nvacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice.''\n  The Ninth Circuit court, to which both Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon \nhave been nominated, is also one of our Nation's busiest courts. It has \nalso been hardest hit by our neglect. More than 20 percent of the Ninth \nCircuit bench is vacant. This is a court that serves almost 20 percent \nof the United States.\n  Procter Hug, the Chief Justice of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwas appointed in 1980 when the court had 23 active judges and a \ncaseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with six vacancies, the Ninth Circuit \nhas 22 active judges to hear more than 9,000 appeals. They have one \nfewer judge today than they had 20 years ago--with 300 percent more \ncases.\n  So I thank my colleagues for finally coming together to address this \nurgent question. The failure to fill Federal court vacancies harms \nplaintiffs and defendants alike. Both are forced to wait too long for \njustice. The failure to fill Federal court vacancies also imposes heavy \nand unjustifiable burdens on judicial nominees and their families. Can \nany of us imagine what it would be like to be kept waiting more than 4 \nyears, as Judge Paez has? What would it be like to be unable to make \npersonal or professional plans for 4 years? I have met Judge Paez, and \nI have to tell you, I am amazed by the dignity and grace he has \nexhibited during this ordeal. Perhaps that is not surprising, though, \nfrom a man lawyers routinely rate as exceptional in both his judicial \ntemperament and his command of legal doctrine.\n  For a long time, those who opposed Marsha Berzon and Judge Paez would \nnot say why. Now some of them say the problem isn't with the nominees, \nthe problem is with the court itself. The Ninth Circuit, they claim, is \na ``rogue'' circuit. They claim the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate by \nthe Supreme Court is too high. They argue, therefore, that we should \nrefuse to confirm anymore Ninth Circuit judges. We should just let the \nvacancies go unfilled.\n  The fact is, the Eleventh, Seventh, and Fifth Circuits all have a \nhigher rate of reversal than the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is \ncompletely within the mainstream of prevailing judicial opinion.\n  Even if that were not the case, this Senate has no right to attempt \nto punish the citizens who rely on the Ninth Circuit in this manner. \nNor do we have the right to try to influence the independence of the \ncourt in this way. That is unconstitutional.\n  Our responsibility under the Constitution is to vote on whether to \nconfirm judges. It is not our responsibility, and it is not our right, \nto try to influence or intimidate judges after they are confirmed.\n  As we consider the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, let us remember that these votes are not a referendum on the \nNinth Circuit, or on President Clinton.\n  And they should not be about partisan politics. These votes are about \ntwo people. Two distinguished and inspiring Americans who are eminently \nqualified for the bench.\n  Richard Paez has been a judge for 18 years. He is the first Mexican-\nAmerican ever to serve as a federal district judge in Los Angeles. He \nwas confirmed by this body in 1994; that vote was unanimous.\n  Judge Paez has received the highest rating the American Bar \nAssociation gives for federal judicial nominees. He has worked for the \npublic good throughout his career, working first as a legal aid lawyer, \nand then, for 13 years, as a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge.\n  In his current position, as a United States District Judge, Judge \nPaez has presided over a wide variety of complex civil and criminal \ncases. For his work, he has garnered bipartisan support, and the \nsupport of such law enforcement organizations as the Los Angeles County \nPolice Chiefs' Association and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  Time and again, on the bench he has demonstrated the qualities that \nare essential to a strong and respected judicial system--wisdom, \ncourage, and compassion. We need judges like Richard Paez on the bench. \nWithout public servants like him, this system fails.\n  Marsha Berzon is equally qualified.\n  She is a nationally known and extremely well regarded appellate \nlitigator with a highly respected San Francisco law firm. She is also a \nformer clerk for the United States Supreme Court. She has served as a \nvisiting professor at both Cornell Law School and Indiana University \nLaw School. She is a widely recognized expert in the field of \nemployment law--an area of the law that requires the increasing \nattention of our federal judiciary.\n  She has argued four cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, \nand has filed dozens of Supreme Court briefs on complex issues. To \nquote my friend Senator Hatch, her ``competence as a lawyer is beyond \nquestion.''\n  Ms. Berzon also has the support of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, business and Republican leaders. She enjoys a reputation \namong colleagues and opposing counsel for being a fair-minded, well \nprepared, and principled advocate. I have also met Ms. Berzon, and I \nfind her temperament and seriousness well-suited for the job she has \nbeen nominated to fill.\n  The federal judiciary has been described as ``the thin black line \nbetween order and chaos.'' I have faith that Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, once confirmed, will live up to that challenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1255-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1255-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WENDELL H. FORD AVIATION INVESTMENT AND REFORM ACT FOR THE 21ST \n                 CENTURY--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my friend from New Jersey for yielding time.\n  Mr. President, for the third time in as many years, I am forced to \nexpress in this Chamber my strong opposition to a congressional \nproposal to meddle with Virginia airports. I will have to oppose the \nFAA conference report, most of which I strongly support and I believe \nis long overdue because it breaks a promise to the people of Northern \nVirginia--a promise that Congress would permit us to manage and develop \nour own airports.\n  While I will again vote against this bill to protest congressional \ninterference in the operation of Virginia's airports, I would like to \nmake clear that I fully support FAA reauthorization and release of the \nairport improvement funds. In fact, as someone who has long believed \nthat we need to substantially increase our investments in \ntransportation, I commend the conferees for crafting a conference \nreport which does just that.\n  Under this bill, annual funding for many airports in Virginia will \nnearly\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\ndouble, providing for critical safety improvement and expanding airport \ncapacity. Nonetheless, I will have to vote against the bill.\n  By forcing additional flights on Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport, this measure breaks the 1986 agreement among the Congress with \nVirginia and the local governments to leave National Airport alone and \nto get Congress out of the business of managing airports.\n  Even at the time of the 1986 agreement, however, there was skepticism \nthat Congress would keep its word. In the words of then-Secretary of \nTransportation William Coleman, ``National has always been a political \nfootball.'' Perhaps he should have said: National will always be a \npolitical football. I hope that is not the case. But I am dubious.\n  While I worked hard to oppose the addition of slots and expanding the \nperimeter at National, I am not going to engage in any purely dilatory \ntactics because I believe these issues should be decided on the merits. \nIn this case, I believe the merits are simple and compelling.\n  Increasing slots at National creates delays for the majority of the \npeople who use the airport and undermines the quality of life in \ncommunities that are near the airport.\n  People have a right to expect their Government to keep its end of the \nbargain. By injecting the Federal Government into the running of the \nairports once again, this bill scuttles an agreement we made with this \nregion more than a decade ago and breaks a promise to the people who \nlive here.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time remaining on the side of those in \nopposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I recognize the leader's time has been \nutilized and not counted against the time prior to going into morning \nbusiness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the managers are finished and \nmorning business is taken up, I be allowed 10 minutes to introduce a \nbill.\n  I yield for my friend from South Carolina who is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman, \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) reauthorization bill, appropriately known as the \nWendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st \nCentury, or FAIR-21. This legislation rightfully deserves this title \nfor two basic reasons: it represents a fair compromise and it honors \nthe former Chairman and later ranking Member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, Senator Ford.\n  Before commenting on the substantive provisions of the conference \nagreement, I think it is essential to commend those who are responsible \nfor achieving the compromise we have before us. However, because of the \nnumber of individuals who have been instrumental in forging this \nagreement, engaging in this exercise is sort of like the Academy Awards \nshows, where the winner gets to list all of the people he needs to \nthank in 30 seconds. I believe FEDEX had a commercial a few years ago \nwith a fast talking person, and I shall try to do the same here. First, \nI wish to commend Chairman Shuster, Congressman Oberstar, and Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton for their unflagging leadership in reaching this \nagreement. I should note that Senator Lott left no stones unturned to \nmove this bill. As well, Senators Stevens and Domenici played pivotal \nroles. All of the Conferees and their staff did their part to \naccomplish an enormous task. After much hard work and many long hours \nwe have a good, strong bill, which addresses many of the most critical \naviation issues facing us today --the proper funding for the \nmodernization of our air traffic control system and airport \ninfrastructure.\n  Before explaining a little about the bill, I want to address one of \nthe concerns that has been raised. I know that Senator Lautenberg has \nconcerns about this bill and what it means for other programs. The \nreality is that for years we have underfunded the FAA, despite the fact \nthat the Airport and Airways Trust Fund has acummulated an uncommitted \nsurplus, approximating $7-8 billion per year. The surplus is currently \nat $13 billion. Essentially, we have used those monies to meet other \npriorities. Today, we end that game, by making sure that all monies in \nthe Trust Fund go to aviation. We also recognize that if more is \nneeded, and it will be, then the general fund will be called upon. Bear \nin mind that the FAA and its ATC system provide services not only to \nthe commerical and general aviation fleets, but also to our military. \nThe FAA also plays a key role in our national security by keeping our \nskies and airports safe.\n  We know that when the Trust Fund was created in 1970, it was intended \nsolely for modernization/capital improvements. The preamble to the \nstatute was as valid then as it is today--it reads ``That the Nation's \nairport and airways system is inadequate to meet the current and \nprojected growth in aviation. That substantial expansion and \nimprovement of airport and airway system is required to meet the \ndemands of interstate commerce, the postal service and national \ndefense''. In fact, to clarify that it was intended for capital only, \nCongress in 1971 deleted the phrase ``administrative expenses'' as an \neligible item for spending. During the first years of the Trust Fund, \nwith one year's exception, no Trust Fund monies were spent on the \ngeneral operations of the FAA. In 1977, Congress allowed left over \nfunds to be used for salaries and expenses of the FAA. Today, we are \nreturning to the original intent--monies first for capital needs, with \nany remaing funds to be used for other expenses. If a general fund is \nneeded, then it will be subject to appropriations.\n  We have little choice. There is no question we must invest in our \nfuture. We must expand the system to keep it safe, and to make it more \nefficient. There is one other point--modernization of the ATC system \ninvolves not only Federal spending, but also a committment from the \nprivate sector. As we move to a satellite-based system, the air \ncarriers and general aviation must make an investment in new technology \nin the cockpit. Finally, it is my understanding that the Transportation \nfunction 400 numbers in the Budget resolution will reflect the \nagreement reached here today, which should quell some of the concerns \nof my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Aviation is an integral part of the overall U.S. transportation \ninfrastructure and plays a critical role in our national economy. Each \nday our air transportation system moves millions of people and billions \nof dollars of cargo. The U.S. commercial aviation industry recorded its \nfifth consecutive year of traffic growth, while the general aviation \nindustry enjoyed a banner year in shipments and aircraft activity at \nFAA air traffic facilities. Continued economic expansion in the U.S. \nand around the globe will continue to fuel the exponential growth in \ndomestic and international enplanements.\n  The FAA is forecasting that by 2009, enplanements are expected to \ngrow to more than 1 billion by 2009, compared to 650 million last year. \nDuring this time, total International passenger traffic between the \nUnited States and the rest of the world is projected to increase 82.6 \npercent. International passenger traffic carried on U.S. Flag carriers \nis forecast to increase 94.2 percent. These percentages represent a \ndramatic increase in the actual number of people using the air system.\n  More people, more planes, more delays. Those are the headlines we \nknow are coming. We know today that the growth in air travel has placed \na strain on the aviation system and our own nerves as we travel. In \n1998, 25% of flights by major air carriers were delayed. MITRE, the \nFAA's federally-funded research and development organization, estimates \nthat just to maintain delays at current levels in 2015, a 60% increase \nin airport capacity will be needed. As many of you may know, and \nperhaps have experienced first hand, delays reached an all-time high \nthis summer. These delays are inordinately costly to both the carriers \nand the traveling public; in fact, according to the Air Transport \nAssociation, delays cost the airlines and travelers more than $4 \nbillion per year.\n\n  We cannot ignore the numbers. These statistics underscore the \nnecessity of\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nproperly funding our investment--we must modernize our Air Traffic \nControl system and expand our airport infrastructure. Gridlock in the \nskies is a certainty unless the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system is \nmodernized. A system-wide delay increase of just a few minutes per \nflight will bring commercial operations to a halt according to the \nNational Civil Aviation Review Commission and American Airlines. \nAccording to a study by the White House Commission on Aviation Security \nand Safety, dated January 1997, the modernization of the ATC system \nshould be expedited to completion by 2005 instead of 2015.\n  FAIR 21 would authorize the Facilities and Equipment (ATC equipment) \nat $2.660 billion, $2.914 billion, and $2.981 billion for FY01-FY03, \nrespectively. This represents a 30% increase in funding. For the first \ntime ever, FAIR 21 links the spending in the Facilities and Equipment \naccount and the Airport Improvement Program to the monies in the \nAirport and Airway Trust Fund.\n  As our skies and runways become more crowded than ever, it is crucial \nthat we redouble our commitment to safety. Passengers deserve the most \nup to date in safety measures. FAIR-21 ensures that there will be money \navailable to pay for new runway incursion devices as well as windshear \ndetection equipment. The bill requires all large cargo airplanes \ninstall collision avoidance equipment. In an effort to support the \nongoing improvements at civil and cargo airports, FAIR-21 increases \nfunding for the improvement of training for security screeners. We also \nhave provided whistleblower protection to aid in our safety efforts and \nprotect workers willing to expose safety problems.\n  FAIR 21 will allow airports to increase their passenger facility \ncharges from $3 to $4.50. This is a local choice and it is money which \nan airport can use to encourage new entry, particularly at the 15 \n``fortress hubs'' where one carrier controls more than 50% of the \ntraffic. Logically, the air fares for the communities dependant upon \nthese hubs are much higher than usual. If given a choice, perhaps we \nwould have broken up the hubs. Instead, we have used the power of the \ndollar and a half to require these hubs to develop ways to allow new \ncarriers to expand as to create the possibility of lower fares to \nplaces like Charleston, SC. The extra buck and a half will go to expand \ngates and terminal areas, as well as runways at these facilities.\n  Since 1996, we have struggled with how to develop meaningful reform \nof the FAA. We have met the majority of the suggestions with the \nexception of the recommendations to establish a fee system and to set \nup a private corporation to run air traffic control. Instead, we chose \na more prudent path. The 1996 reauthorization bill established a 15 \nmember Management Advisory Committee (MAC) appointed by the President \nwith Senate confirmation but no one has yet to be named. Jane Garvey, \nthe FAA Administrator, is doing a wonderful job, but she could have \nused some help. To avoid this in the future, FAIR-21 establishes a \nsubcommittee of the MAC to oversee air traffic operations with the \nappointments being made by the Secretary of Transportation rather than \nthe President. The bill also establishes a position for a chief \noperating officer. Combined with other measures, and the funding \nlevels, we are on the right track.\n  I wish to say a word about our controllers, technicians and the FAA \nworkforce. I know that the bill as crafted does not guarantee a general \nfund contribution to pay for the operations of the FAA. However, it \nshould be acknowledged that these folks work hard every day to keep us \nflying safely. The safety of the nation is in their hands. They deserve \nour support.\n  Finally but not least, in terms of Death on the High Seas, after much \ninput from the families of the victims of many of the air tragedies, we \nhave clarified the law and extending the borders of the United States \nto 12 miles off shore for the purpose of determining claims. In the \ncase of an accident occurring 12 miles or within the shore, the Death \non the High Seas Act shall not apply. Rather, it is state, federal, and \nany other applicable laws which shall apply. Death on the High Seas \nshall apply only outside of 12 miles off shore.\n  Mr. President, let me commend Mr. Shuster, the chairman on the House \nside. He stuck to his guns.\n  It has been a long struggle in the open and in the dark. I only \nmention that because my colleague from New Jersey said this thing was \nall agreed to in the dark. We have been in the dark and in the open and \neverything else for 2 years on this struggle.\n  Mr. Shuster stuck to his guns, whereby those air travelers who obtain \nthe taxes that go into the airport and airways improvement fund are \nfinally being assured that money is going to be spent on the airport \nand airways improvement.\n  Right to the point: We owe some $12 billion right this minute for \nairport taxes that have been used for everything from Kosovo to food \nstamps, and everything else but airport and airways improvement.\n  In fact, we now have some $l.95 billion to be expended this fiscal \nyear, 2000. We were unable to get those moneys, although they were in \nthe fund, supposedly--IOU slips, if you will. We are now able to spend \nthose moneys.\n  I have the same misgivings the ranking member of our subcommittee has \nabout the shortfalls in the operating budget. That is due to so-called \n``unrealistic spending caps.'' That is a budget problem--not this \nbill's problem. There is a problem with unrealistic spending caps.\n  There is state-of-the-art equipment sitting in warehouses, and that \nis because we have been playing a sordid game of trying to call a \n``deficit'' a ``surplus'' and grabbing any and all moneys we can to \nplay a game to make it look as if we are reducing spending. The fact is \nthe President submits his budget, and we in the Congress--this \nRepublican Congress, if you please--have been increasing spending over \nand above what President Clinton has asked for during the past 7 or 8 \nyears. We are not willing to pay for it. So we rob Social Security. We \nrob the retirement of the military and civil service. We robbed the \nhighway funds, up until we finally got that straightened out under the \nleadership of Mr. Shuster. Now we can hold onto our airport moneys and \ndo the job that is required of us.\n  I want to say to everyone involved that this has been a good 2-year \nstruggle to get us where we are. It is a good bill. It was developed in \na bipartisan way, with every consideration given to not only the budget \nproblems and concern the Senator from New Jersey has, but also my \nconcerns about overall air traffic.\n  We are moving finally in the right direction. I hope everybody will \nvote in support of the conference report.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                     amtrak and coast guard funding\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for joining me in this important discussion today. I thank him \nfor the vital role he played in shepherding the FAA authorization bill \nthrough the conference committee. We have been without an authorization \nbill for too long and this bill is a critical step in ensuring our \nskies are absolutely safe and less congested. But, as the majority \nleader well knows, aviation is not the only important piece of \ntransportation funding this bill may affect. I believe that my friend \nagrees with me that, as important as aviation is to our country, \nfunding for Amtrak and the Coast Guard are also crucial, and in \nenacting this bill, we by no means intend to give short-shrift to those \nparts of our transportation budget. Isn't that right, Mr. Majority \nLeader?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Massachusetts \nfor raising this issue here today. And he is absolutely right. Aviation \nis not the only transportation account that may be impacted by this \nbill. And it was certainly not the intention of the conferees to in any \nway restrict funding for the Coast Guard or Amtrak.\n  The conference report includes a provision which reserves Airport and \nAirways Trust Fund revenue and interest spending for aviation programs \nwith a majority point of order. Additionally, under another majority \npoint of order, the provision requires the authorized levels of funding \nfor the Airport Improvement Program and the Facilities and Equipment \naccounts to be fully funded before the Operations and Research and \nDevelopment accounts are funded. While this latter provision is\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nnot a statutory guarantee that general revenue will be spend on \naviation programs, it is a significant incentive. The bill thus \nprovides a reasonable assurance that aviation appropriations will reach \nauthorized levels, which would result in an approximately $2 billion \nincrease in aviation funding for fiscal year 2001.\n  My good friend from Massachusetts is concerned that spending for \nother transportation priorities may be decreased as the appropriations \nprocess increases aviation spending. Let me assure my good friend that \nI expect adequate funding for the Coast Guard and Amtrak, as these \ntransportation priorities are important to the Nation and to my home \nState of Mississippi. I intend to work with the chairmen of the Budget \nand Appropriations Committees to ensure the Transportation \nAppropriations account is increased so that these aviation program \nincreases do not come at the expense of other transportation programs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am gratified to hear the majority \nleader's commitment to Amtrak and the Coast Guard, as well as his \nintention to work with the chairmen of the Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees to fully fund transportation needs at least for FY 2001, and \nhopefully beyond. Both Amtrak and the Coast Guard are absolutely \nnecessary to my constituents. I would like to say a few words about the \nimportance of Amtrak nationwide. This country needs to include \npassenger rail as part of its transportation mix in the 21st century. \nWe have done a good job ensuring our highways and, now, our skyways get \nthe funding and attention they deserve. Amtrak also needs some of that \nattention. Passenger rail is critical if we are going to reduce \ncongestion on our highways and in the air, as well protect our \nenvironment. People need a choice in transportation, and high speed \nrail especially can be a viable option for many, not only in the \nNortheast, but along corridors throughout the country.\n\n  On January 31, 2000, Amtrak launched Acela Regional--the first \nelectric train in history to serve Boston and New England. This is \nliterally a dream come true for all of us up and down the East Coast \nwho care about jobs, the economy and traffic congestion and the \nenvironment. And in its first few weeks of operation, I understand that \nbookings on Acela Regional are up as much as 45 percent over the \nNortheast Direct line. This will be extremely helpful in my home state \nof Massachusetts, as well as in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, \nPennsylvania and Maryland, where airport and highway congestion often \nreach frustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, \nthe fewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways.\n  Amtrak is not the only transportation priority we need to fully fund. \nThe Coast Guard performs a number of critical missions for our country \nincluding search and rescue, environmental protection, marine safety, \nfisheries enforcement, and drug trafficking. I can't imagine any of our \ncolleagues arguing that any one of these missions is unimportant or \nshould be less than fully funded. Perhaps my good friend will expand \nupon the importance the Coast Guard's many missions.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \naddress the needs of the Coast Guard. In a typical day the Coast Guard \nwill save 14 lives, seize 209 pounds of marijuana and 170 pounds of \ncocaine, and save $2.5 million in property. The Coast Guard's duties \nhave also grown, as there are more commercial and recreational vessels \nin our waters today than ever before in our Nation's history. \nInternational trade has expanded greatly, and with it maritime traffic \nhas increased in our Nation's ports and harbors. Tighter border patrols \nhave forced drug traffickers to use the thousands of miles of our \ncountry's coastlines as the means to introduce illegal drugs into our \nNation. The Coast Guard currently faces a number of readiness \nshortfalls as it struggles to keep up with the increasing demands \nplaced upon this service. In order to continue this valuable service to \nour Nation, the Congress must provide the funding to address personnel \nshortages and to repair or replace the Coast Guard's aging ships and \naircraft. I am confident that with an increase in the transportation \nbudget, we can protect the Coast Guard and Amtrak, as well as make the \nimprovements air travel so desperately needs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his helpful \nreassurances. We have the same goal, and that is to have a safe, \nefficient transportation system that includes rail, aviation, and \nmaritime sectors. His intention and willingness to make this happen \ngives me every confidence that it will happen.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today will take \naction on the H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and \nReform Act for the 21st Century. The Federal Aviation Administration \nhas been without a long-term authorization for some time, and airports \nin my state need to be able to move forward with construction projects \nsoon.\n  There are three components of this bill that I strongly support: the \nincrease in funding for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the \nbudgetary treatment of the Aviation Trust Fund, and a provision to \nstabilize essential air service (EAS) in Dickinson, North Dakota.\n  I am very pleased that this conference report provides for $3.2 \nbillion in 2001 for the AIP program, and that funding will increase by \n$100 million each year. As air travel continues to increase, it is \nimportant that we invest in our nation's airports to ensure the safety \nof the traveling public and expand capacity for the future. This \nprogram provides federal grants for airport development and planning \nand these dollars are usually spent on capital projects supporting \noperations such as runways, taxiways, and noise abatement. This \nsubstantial increase in funding will go a long way in maintaining the \nquality of air travel in North Dakota and across the country.\n  In addition to the increase in funding, the fact that we now have \nlong-term FAA reauthorization instead of the extensions our airports \nhave been operating under is an important improvement. Short-term \nextensions had the effect of leaving airport managers and community \nleaders unable to develop and move forward with airport improvement \nprojects. Because in North Dakota the construction season is short, the \nability to plan and schedule projects is critical to maintaining our \nstate's aviation system.\n  Secondly, this conference report contains a very important provision \nfor Dickinson, North Dakota. This legislation will allow this small \ncommunity to retain essential air service without paying a local share. \nCurrently, Dickinson and Fergus Falls, Minnesota are the only \ncommunities with this requirement. EAS is vital to smaller communities, \nand the difficulties encountered by many of the communities in \nretaining EAS warrant increased federal attention. The report also \nrequires the Department of Transportation to report on retaining \nessential air service, focusing that report on North Dakota. This is an \nextremely serious problem in my state and I believe it needs greater \nattention. The residents and businesses of small communities, \nespecially in a rural state like North Dakota, depend heavily on this \nservice and we need to find a way to consistently serve these small \nmarkets.\n  Finally, I am pleased that conferees agreed to budgetary guarantees \nof increased funding for aviation. The conference report provides for a \nbudget point of order against any legislation that fails to spend all \nof the Airport and Airways Trust Fund (AATF) receipts and interest, and \ndoes not appropriate the total authorized levels for capital programs \n(AIP and Facilities and Equipment). After allocations to the capital \nprograms occur, remaining AATF funds can be used for general \noperations, and can be augmented by monies from the general fund.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important and long \noverdue legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FAA/AIP \nreauthorization conference report, H.R. 1000. I commend Senators \nHollings, Rockefeller, Gorton, and McCain for their efforts.\n  This measure would lift the High Density Rule at several of the \nnation's slot controlled airports, including Chicago's O'Hare \nInternational Airport. I support this conference report with the \nunderstanding that it puts safety above\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nall other issues and keeps a watchful eye on noise levels and the \nenvironment around these airports.\n  This conference report also significantly increases funding for the \nEssential Air Service and Airport Improvement Programs, ensuring that \nIllinois airports will be able to complete important infrastructure \nprojects as well as gain greater access to valuable markets.\n  I fully understand that some opponents are attempting to portray a \nHigh Density Rule lift as a safety issue. I agree that safety must be \nparamount. The FAA is and always should be the final arbiter of safety. \nAnd no matter what Congress does today, the FAA will continue to have \nthe authority to regulate air traffic and ensure that passenger and \ncommunity safety is never at risk.\n  Last fall, I received a letter from FAA Administrator Garvey, which \nsays in part, ``Let me assure you that if the High Density Rule is \nlifted at Chicago or any other airport, safety will not be \ncompromised.'' The Administrator goes on to say, ``The FAA does not \ncontrol aircraft at high density airports any differently than at any \nother commercial airport. We will continue to operate these airports \nusing all appropriate procedures and traffic management initiatives for \nthe safe and expeditious handling of air traffic. Safety is always our \nhighest priority.''\n  The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and specifically the \nChicago controllers support lifting the slot restrictions at O'Hare. \nNATCA believes that O'Hare can handle the increased traffic without \nsacrificing safety. I have had the opportunity to meet with the \ncontrollers about this issue, and I believe they bring a unique and \nimportant perspective to this debate.\n  It also should be noted that a 1995 U.S. Department of Transportation \n(U.S. DoT) study concluded that lifting the High Density Rule would \nhave no impact on safety because air traffic control is implemented \nindependently of the slot restrictions.\n  Thus, the claim that this would undermine safety is unfounded.\n  I also take exception to the notion that Congress is getting ahead of \nthe FAA. Federal transportation officials have believed for some time \nthat the High Density Rule is outdated and inefficient and not an \nappropriate safety mechanism. And our colleagues in the House voted \noverwhelmingly last year to lift the slot restrictions, with the \nsupport of the FAA.\n  Government reports tell us that O'Hare has been surpassed by \nAtlanta's Hartsfield International Airport as the world's busiest. This \nraises the obvious question: if airports such as Atlanta and Dallas/Ft. \nWorth and LAX in Los Angeles can operate safely and efficiently without \nslot restrictions, why can't O'Hare?\n  The High Density Rule or slot restrictions were developed in the \nlate 1960s, to mitigate delays. However, with the dawn of state-of-the-\nart air traffic control systems and improved flow control procedures, \nthe High Density Rule has outlived its usefulness.\n\n  Instead, the High Density Rule artificially limits access to O'Hare \nand adversely affects smaller communities. In Illinois, three downstate \ncommunities have totally lost service to O'Hare--Decatur, Mt. Vernon, \nand Quincy--and one city, Moline, has already experienced a carrier \nleaving solely because of the slot restrictions.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, Capital Airport has been battling for \nyears to attract and retain adequate service to O'Hare. Today, there \nare more Chicago passengers than seats available.\n  When we look for this reason, all runways lead to the same place--the \nHigh Density Rule. Carriers choose to move commuter operations to \nDenver and Dallas/Ft. Worth rather than deal with the slot restrictions \nat O'Hare. Communities pay the price through loss of access to key \ndomestic and international markets, lost jobs, diminished tourism and \nstagnant economic development.\n  Bob O'Brien, the Capital Airport Executive Director of Aviation, \nwrites, ``The inability for the Springfield community to adequately \naccess Chicago and connect to other locations in the country or the \nworld impacts the movements of goods and services and, consequently, is \na major detriment to the retention and attraction of businesses. The \ngrowth and viability of the local Springfield community is at risk. * * \n* While our country's aviation system is among the best in the world, \nit is compromised by an artificial `choke point' known as the High \nDensity Rule.''\n  I would like to ask, why is it that we should maintain a ``choke \npoint'' at a city which serves as the transportation hub of the nation?\n  Mark Hanna, Director of Aeronautics at Quincy's Baldwin Field, \nwrites, ``* * * Quincy community leaders believe the removal of the \ncurrent slot restrictions at O'Hare is critical in continuing this \nvital service between Quincy and Chicago. * * * With your support of \nproviding relief from the current `High Density Slot Rule' at O'Hare, \nwe can maintain this valuable air service and increase its \nmarketability.''\n  Julie Moore, President of the Metro Decatur Chamber of Commerce says, \n``That (O'Hare) air service is essential to the economic growth and \nstability of our area.''\n  I understand the frustration that passengers have with flight delays. \nAs a frequent flier, going into or through O'Hare twice a week, I \nexperience it often. Will lifting the High Density Rule make the planes \nrun on time? Of course not. But will it worsen the delays? Not \nnecessarily. The FAA is working with its air traffic controllers and \nthe airlines to implement both short-term and long-term ways to reduce \ndelays in the air and on the ground including giving more authority to \na nationwide Command Center to control flow of aircraft and attempting \nto decrease so-called ground-stops.\n  With regard to noise, according to data reported in U.S. DOT's 1995 \nstudy, the increase in population around O'Hare affected by noise due \nto lifting the High Density Rule is very small when compared to the \ndecrease due to the transition to an all Stage 3 fleet in 2005. After \nlifting the High Density Rule and shifting to a Stage 3 fleet, the \npopulation exposed to very high noise levels should decrease. \nElimination of the High Density Rule also will provide scheduling \nflexibility to the airlines and in so doing could reduce nighttime \nnoise.\n  At my insistence, the conferees have included several provisions that \nwill study the noise levels at the nation's slot-controlled airports \nand compare them to pre-Stage 3 aircraft noise levels around these same \nairports. The Secretary of Transportation also is required to study \nnoise, the environment, access to underserved communities, and \ncompetition at O'Hare. Finally, O'Hare and the other slot-controlled \nairports will receive priority consideration for Airport Improvement \nProgram funds for noise abatement and mitigation. This will help \nimprove and expand soundproofing efforts and noise monitoring.\n\n  Both U.S. DoT's 1995 study and a 1999 GAO review found that the High \nDensity Rule creates a barrier to entry and restricts airline \ncompetition at the affected airports. According to GAO, fares are \nhigher at airports under the High Density Rule than at unrestricted \nairports. U.S. DoT concluded that lifting the high density rule would \nresult in lower air fares and more competition.\n  According to a report conducted by Booz-Allen-Hamilton, allowing \nO'Hare to fully develop would contribute $26 billion annually to the \ngreater Chicago economy. On the other hand, artificial constraints on \nO'Hare's capacity could cost the region $7 billion to $8 billion.\n  Mr. President, the High Density Rule has had more than 30 years to \nproduce results. However, the only tangible results I've experienced \nare artificial barriers to access and competition. I don't take lightly \nthe arguments raised by opponents of this amendment. In the past, I \nhave supported compromise language that would offer some limited \nexpansion of O'Hare. However, opponents have rejected even the \nintroduction of one new flight at O'Hare. I believe this position is \nunrealistic and unfair to downstate Illinois communities that \ndesperately need Chicago O'Hare access. I will hold the FAA, the \nairlines and these airports accountable to improve safety, reduce \ndelays and achieve greater access for underserved markets while \nstriving to protect the environment and limit airport noise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, after months of negotiation, we have \nreached an agreement and completed work on the Aviation Investment and\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nReform Act of the 21st Century, the so-called AIR-21.\n  AIR-21 is a fair bill. It reflects a compromise on many of my \nconcerns about the budgetary treatment of our federal aviation \naccounts. It also reflects some of my commitments, one of which is to \nincrease investment in aviation programs. I am a strong proponent of \nsafety, and this bill increases funding for safety programs, including \nfunds for air traffic control modernization. In addition, and very \nimportant to the State of New Mexico, many of the programs within this \nbill focus on and support small or rural airports. Finally, each of \nthese accomplishments are realized while budgetary discipline is \nmaintained.\n  In 2001, a total of $12.7 billion is authorized for aviation \nprograms. This represents an increase in budget resources of $2.7 \nbillion over the 2000 levels. This is extremely generous to the FAA. In \nfact, it exceeds the President's 2001 budget request by $1.5 billion. \nOver the 2001 through 2003 time period, AIR-21 authorizes nearly $40 \nbillion.\n  Before I outline the budgetary compromise, I would like to thank all \nthe Conferees--I especially appreciate the work and support of Senators \nStevens, Gorton, Grassley, Burns, Lott, and Lautenberg on the budget \nissue. In addition, I applaud the leadership that Senators Gorton, \nLott, and McCain took on this bill.\n  One very controversial issue had to do with the correct budgetary \ntreatment for aviation programs. The provision contained in AIR-21 \nrepresents a compromise--both sides had to come together for this deal.\n  Similar to my offer last fall, AIR-21 guarantees annual funding from \nthe Airports and Airways Trust Fund equal to the annual receipts \ndeposited into the Trust Fund plus annual interest credited to the \nTrust Fund, as estimated in the President's budget.\n  Based on the President's FY 2001 Budget, $10.5 billion will be \nappropriated from the Trust Fund in 2001 for aviation programs. In \naddition, just over $2 billion can be provided from the general fund. \nFor 2001 through 2003, over $33 billion will be guaranteed from the \ntrust fund for aviation programs, and more than $6 billion can be \nprovided from the general fund.\n  Further, the budget compromise provides that the Trust Funds will \nfirst be available to fund the capital accounts--for airport \nimprovement program grants and facilities and equipment, including the \nair traffic control modernization programs.\n  Before I finish, let me take one minute to discuss what this bill \ndoesn't do. AIR-21 does not take the Airports and Airways Trust Fund \noff-budget. AIR-21 does not establish a budgetary firewall between \naviation programs and other discretionary programs. Further, it does \nnot lock-down general fund tax receipts for aviation programs. Finally, \nit does not put FAA funding on auto-pilot and take the appropriators \nout of the process.\n  In this way, budgetary discipline has prevailed and appropriate \ncongressional oversight is maintained. This is good policy for the \nAmerican people and the flying public.\n  Finally, this bill contains essentially, for the next three years, a \nFederal mechanism not entirely unlike what has existed since the \nAirports and Airways Trust Fund was established in 1972. As we move \ninto this new century, it may be that this funding mechanism and the \ncurrent government structure is not the most efficient or effective way \nto provide the investments and services for this industry in the \nfuture.\n  For example, at least 16 countries have taken action to respond to \nthe pressures that increasing enplanements have had on a system already \nstressed by capacity constraints and increases in and longer delays. \nThese countries realized something that was made clear in a joint \nBudget and Appropriations Committee hearing on February 3--that \nincreased funding levels will not solve the problems of our outdated \nair traffic control system and will not make the system efficient.\n  Recognizing this, these countries have fundamentally reformed and \nrestructured their air traffic control systems. Most recently Canada \ncreated a very successful nonprofit, private air traffic control \ncorporation sustained by user fees. Reformed air traffic control \nsystems have been successful. They have brought about major gains in \nefficiency, reduced flight delays, reductions in operating costs, and \nprogress in technological upgrades. All of this was accomplished \nwithout compromising safety.\n  Although this bill provides funding for FAA for three years, it is my \nhope that we will continue to seriously evaluate and consider whether \nservices can more effectively and efficiently be delivered with a \nchange in structure--so that the gains realized in Canada, Britain, \nGermany, Switzerland, and New Zealand can be achieved in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Aircraft Safety Act \nof 2000 is included in the conference report on the Air Transportation \nImprovement Act, H.R. 1000. This measure is needed to safeguard United \nStates aircraft, workers and passengers from fraudulent, defective, and \ncounterfeit aircraft parts.\n  The problem of fraudulent, defective, and counterfeit aircraft parts \nhas grown dramatically in recent years. Since 1993, the Federal \nAviation Administration received 1,778 reports of suspected unapproved \nparts, initiated 298 enforcement actions and issued 143 safety notices \nregarding suspect parts. Moreover, the aircraft industry has estimated \nthat as much as $2 billion in unapproved parts may be sitting on the \nshelves of parts distributors, airlines, and repair stations, according \nto Congressional testimony.\n  Because a passenger airplane may contain as many as 6 million parts, \nthe growth of bogus aircraft parts raises serious public safety \nconcerns. And even small bogus parts could cause a horrific airplane \ntragedy. For instance, on September 8, 1989, a charter flight carrying \n55 people from Norway to Germany plunged 22,000 feet into the North Sea \nafter a tail section fastened with bogus bolts tore loose.\n  Given this potential threat to public safety, comprehensive laws are \nneeded to focus directly on the dangers posed by nonconforming, \ndefective, and counterfeit aircraft parts. But no such laws are on the \nbooks right now. In fact, prosecutors today are forced to use a variety \nof general criminal statutes to bring offenders to justice, including \nprosecution for mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements and \nconspiracy. These general criminal statutes may work well in some \nsituations in the aircraft industry, but often times they do not.\n  The Aircraft Safety Act would provide for a single Federal law \ndesigned to crack down on the $45 billion fraudulent, defective, and \ncounterfeit aircraft parts industry. The Act focuses on stopping bogus \naircraft parts in three ways.\n  First, our bipartisan bill adds a new section to our criminal laws \ndefining fraud involving aircraft parts in interstate or foreign \ncommerce for the first time. The section sets out three new offenses to \noutlaw the fraudulent exportation, importation, sale, trade, \ninstallation, or introduction of nonconforming, defective, or \ncounterfeit aircraft parts. Under the new statute, it is a crime to \nfalsify or conceal any material fact, to make any fraudulent \nrepresentation, or to use any materially false documents or electronic \ncommunication concerning any aircraft part.\n  Second, our bipartisan bill strengthens the criminal penalties \nagainst aircraft parts pirates. A basic 15-year maximum penalty of \nimprisonment and $500,000 maximum fine is set for all offenses created \nby the new section. This is needed to end the light sentences that some \naircraft parts counterfeiters have received under the general criminal \nstatutes. In fact, in a 1994 case, a parts broker pleaded guilty to \ntrafficking in counterfeit aircraft parts, but only received a seven-\nmonth sentence. Fraud involving aircraft parts is a serious crime that \ndeserves a serious penalty.\n  Third, our bipartisan bill provides courts with new tools to prevent \nrepeat offenders from re-entering the aircraft parts business and to \nstop the flow of nonconforming, defective and counterfeit parts in the \nmarketplace. Under the new statute, courts may order unscrupulous \nindividuals to divest themselves of interests in businesses used to \nperpetuate aircraft fraud. Courts may also, under the new statute, \ndirect the disposal of stockpiles and inventories of defective and \ncounterfeit aircraft parts to prevent their subsequent resale or entry \ninto commerce.\n  Indeed, Attorney General Reno, Defense Secretary Cohen, \nTransportation\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nSecretary Slater, and NASA Administrator Goldin wrote to Senator Hatch \nand me urging that Congress adopt this legislation. They wrote: ``If \nenacted, this bill would give law enforcement a potent weapon in the \nfight to protect the safety of the traveling public.'' As a result, the \nAircraft Safety Act is endorsed by the Department of Justice, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Transportation and the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration. I ask unanimous consent, that this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, and I offered the Aircraft Safety Act as an \namendment during Senate consideration of S. 82, the Senate companion \nbill. Our amendment was accepted by unanimous consent. I thank Senator \nMcCain, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator \nHollings, the Ranking Member of the Committee, for holding the Senate \nposition in conference with minor revisions and, thus, including our \namendment in the final bill.\n  I look forward to President Clinton signing the Aircraft Safety Act \nof 2000 into law as part of the conference report on the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act, H.R. 1000.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Office of the Attorney General\n\n                                                    Washington, DC\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is proposed legislation, ``The \n     Aircraft Safety Act of 1999.'' This is part of the \n     legislation program of the Department of Justice for the \n     first session of the 106th Congress. This legislation would \n     safeguard United States aircraft, space vehicles, passengers, \n     and crewmembers from the dangers posed by the installation of \n     nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit parts in civil, \n     public, and military aircraft. During the 105th Congress, \n     similar legislation earned strong bi-partisan support, as \n     well as the endorsement of the aviation industry.\n       The problems associated with fraudulent aircraft and \n     spacecraft parts have been explored and discussed for several \n     years. Unfortunately, the problems have increased while the \n     discussions have continued. Since 1993, federal law \n     enforcement agencies have secured approximately 500 criminal \n     indictments for the manufacture, distribution, or \n     installation or nonconforming parts. During the same period, \n     the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received 1,778 \n     reports or suspected unapproved parts, initiated 298 \n     enforcement actions, and issued 143 safety notices regarding \n     suspect parts.\n       To help combat this problem, an interagency Law \n     Enforcement/FAA working group was established in 1997. \n     Members include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); \n     the Office of the Inspector General, Department of \n     Transportation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; \n     the Office of Special Investigations, Department of the Air \n     Force; the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Department \n     of the Navy; the Customs Service, Department of the Treasury; \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the \n     FAA. The working group quickly identified the need for \n     federal legislation that targeted the problem of suspect \n     aircraft and spacecraft parts in a systemic, organized \n     manner. The enclosed bill is the product of the working \n     group's efforts.\n       Not only does the bill prescribe tough new penalties for \n     trafficking in suspect parts; it also authorizes the Attorney \n     General, in appropriate cases, to seek civil remedies to stop \n     offenders from re-entering the business and to direct the \n     destruction of stockpiles and inventories of suspect parts so \n     that they do not find their way into legitimate commerce. \n     Other features of the bill are described in the enclosed \n     section-by-section analysis.\n       If enacted, this bill would give law enforcement a potent \n     weapon in the fight to protect the safety of the traveling \n     public. Consequently, we urge that you give the bill \n     favorable consideration.\n       We would be pleased to answer any questions that you may \n     have and greatly appreciate your continued support for strong \n     law enforcement. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised us that, from the perspective of the Administration's \n     program, there is no objection to the submission of this \n     legislation proposal, and that its enactment would be in \n     accord with the problem of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n                                                 Rodney E. Slater,\n                                      Secretary of Transportation.\n                                                 William S. Cohen,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n                                                 Daniel S. Goldin,\n                                              Administrator, NASA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased with the provisions of \nthe conference report concerning slots that provide for a two-step \nprocess for the elimination of airline slots, landing and take off \nrights at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. Senator Grassley and \nI proposed a similar method for the elimination of slots at those three \nairports over a year ago.\n  I am very pleased that we have been able to work closely with \nChairman McCain, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hollings, and others on \nthe development of this proposal. I am proud of the support that we \nhave received from a majority of the attorneys general led by Iowa's \nown Attorney General Tom Miller. The U.S. Department of Transportation \ndeserves special praise for its initiative calling for the elimination \nof the anticompetitive slot rule that was the starting point of our \nproposal. Chairman Shuster and the House also deserve considerable \npraise for their proposal to eliminate the slot rule at these airports \nlast June.\n  I want to especially commend Chairman McCain and his staff for \nworking so closely with us on this issue. He held a field hearing in \nDes Moines on April 30 last year to hear firsthand how the current \nsystem effects small and medium-sized cities. He has worked hard to \nmove forward a proposal which I believe will significantly increase \ncompetition. That was not an easy task.\n  I also want to especially thank Senator Rockefeller and his staff for \ntheir considerable efforts. Both Senators have shown a keen interest in \nthe problems unique to smaller cities where adequate service is the \nparamount issue.\n  The phasing out of the slot requirements at these airports is an \nimportant step toward eliminating a major barrier to airline \ncompetition. And, by doing so in this two step process mitigates \nagainst some of the long-term effects of the government-imposed slot \nrule. Under current rules, most smaller airlines have, in effect, had a \nfar more difficult time competing, in part because of the slot rule.\n  The conference report allows small airlines to expanded access to all \nfour slot controlled airports to some degree. Not as much as our \noriginal proposal. I would have liked to have seen a longer phase in of \nthe rule at O'Hare and broader provisions for limited incumbent--that \nis newer and usually smaller airlines to provide additional, often \ncompetitive service which will hopefully result in lower fares and \nimproved service in many markets. The final provisions are not as broad \nas Senator Grassley and I initially proposed. But they are a genuine \nand substantial improvement. This will help stimulate increased \ncompetition and lower ticket prices. Unfortunately, at LaGuardia, \nsmaller airlines will not be able to establish service between their \nhubs and LaGuardia. The number of flights to O'Hare by newer airlines \nis limited. But, the measure provides some real opportunities to newer \noften low cost carriers during the phase in period.\n  The measure allows a carrier to establish new service to O'Hare \nwithout any restriction starting  in May so long as the new service is \nwith aircraft with fewer than 70 seats. Cities like Sioux City in Iowa \nand other small and medium sized cities around O'Hare will hopefully be \nable to see service to O'Hare, important to many businesses and those \ncities economy. And, an airline can also increase the frequency of \nservice to smaller cities so long as aircraft with fewer than 70 seats \nare used. Recently, Burlington IA, was facing the loss of an important \nround trip to O'Hare purely because of the slot rule. The Quad Cities \nlost service by American Airlines last year because, in part, a limited \nnumber of slots were available. There is some chance that both \ndecisions may be reversed now that slot restrictions will no longer \nimpact those decisions.\n\n  Timing of service to smaller cities will be more efficient and \ncarriers will be able to increase their frequency. I am very pleased \nthat the conferees approved a two for one rule, giving an additional \nslot to airlines that upgrade an existing round trip turbojet service \nto smaller cities with a regional jet. This provides an incentive to \nprovide improved service to smaller cities when it makes sense to do \nit.\n  In the final step, after a shorter period than I would like at O'Hare \nand a longer period than I think is best at\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\nthe New York Airports, the slot rules would be ended at O'Hare, \nKennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. In both cases I am hopeful that \ncompetitive airlines might get a change to establish a foothold and \nsmaller cities would have established better service that will continue \nin the long term.\n  Access to affordable air service is essential to efficient commerce \nand economic development. Americans have a right to expect it. Airports \nare paid for by the traveling public through taxes and by fees charged \nby the Federal Government and local airport authorities.\n  Unfortunately, when deregulation came along in 1978, there was no \neffective framework put in place to deal with anticompetitive \npractices. Many of these practices have become business as usual. The \nresult has been increased air fares and decreased service to mid-size \nand small communities.\n  The slot rule, originally put in place because of the limitations of \nthe air traffic control system has been an effective competition. The \nDOT, improperly, I believe, literally gave the right to land and take \noff to those who used these airports on January 21, 1986. That \neffectively locked in the current users of those airports and locked \nout effective competition. It gave away a public resource. Finally, \nthis bill phases out the slot rule and its anti-competitive effects and \nits negative effects on smaller communities.\n  Lastly, I wanted to say a few words about the budget. Our airways \nsystem has some very real problems. Capacity is limited. There are many \npressure points that create bottlenecks, slowing down traffic. We need \nmore gates, more runways and taxiways. We need better equipment and \ncomputers as well as additional flight controllers in order to increase \nthe capacity of the system at a number of points. Long delays at our \nnations airports decrease the efficiency of our entire economy. This \nbill does provide for considerable increases in funds.\n  While many very necessary things are costly, some of the things that \ncan be done with the airways systems do not cost large sums. For \nexample, if pilots received written comments from flight controllers \nrather than verbal commands, the efficiency of the system would improve \nand the chance of errors would decrease. But, the culture of the system \nis slow to change. This step is now moving toward a multiyear test and \nthen a multiyear implementation. Changes like this one should be \nimplemented more quickly.\n  If we are able to provide the considerable increases in funding the \nairways system needs and for which this bill provides, we must see \nreasonable levels of funding for domestic discretionary spending over \nthe coming years or the sums provided in this measure are not likely to \noccur.\n\n\n          los angeles tech department of professional aviation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I wish to enter into a colloquy with the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. The Department of Professional Aviation at Louisiana \nTech is one of the University's most successful departments. With the \nexpansion of the aviation industry in this nation, the University has \nbeen in the process of expanding the physical infrastructure for the \nDepartment of professional Aviation.\n  A new $6 million instructional facility has recently been constructed \non the campus and the University will also construct a new flight \noperations facility at Ruston Regional Airport. While the State of \nLouisiana and the University have financed the cost of building these \nnew facilities, the University is hopeful that it can receive federal \nassistance for the purchase of newer and safer equipment, such as new \nsingle-engine aircraft, a multiengine training aircraft, and a \nmultiengine turbine simulator.\n  As we consider this FAA reauthorization bill, I would like to know \nwhether this is something that would be appropriate for receiving \nfinancial support from the FAA in the form of competitive grant funding \nas part of its university research and air safety programs? I hope that \ngrant funding for this project can be obtained from the FAA.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the gentleman's comments and want to work \nwith him and the FAA on this project. Let me say to the gentleman that \nI will work with him to determine what options may be available to \nLouisiana Tech with respect to this matter.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I appreciate that clarification.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the \nSenate. Although I will vote in support of the bill, I feel compelled \nto express my reservations concerning the mandatory budgetary \nprovisions that are included in this conference agreement. It should be \nunderstood by all here today that these provisions should not be used \nto reduce funding for other essential transportation programs, most \nimportantly Amtrak.\n  I realize the importance of passing this legislation that provides \nnecessary funding for aviation programs over the next three years. This \nbill has been a long time coming and I understand it has been carefully \nand diligently crafted between the conferees. I believe we need \nadditional funding for the improvement of our airports and to permit us \nto take advantage of the best technologies to improve passenger safety.\n  However, I don't believe that other transportation programs such as \nAmtrak should suffer as a result of the budgetary agreement that has \nbeen included in this bill. I have long been a supporter of Amtrak and \nam dedicated to making sure that the Federal Government lives up to its \npromise to provide Amtrak with sufficient support to preserve passenger \nrail service in this country and enable Amtrak to reach operating self-\nsufficiency. Because of this I want to make it clear that I'm voting \nfor this FAA reauthorization bill with the understanding that the \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott, and the Minority Leader, Senator \nDaschle, have made assurances that they will protect Amtrak from \nbudgetary threats that may follow from this legislation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am very supportive of the conference \nagreement provisions which allow exemptions to the current perimeter \nrule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. I commend Chairman \nMcCain and leadership on creating a process which I believe fairly \nbalances the interests of Senators from States inside the perimeter and \nthose of us from western States without convenient access to Reagan \nNational.\n  I have been involved and supportive of the effort to open up Reagan \nNational since the legislation was first introduced. While I would have \npreferred to eliminate the perimeter rule altogether or have more slots \navailable for improved access to the West, the final agreement includes \n12 slots. I want to reiterate that these limited exemptions must \nbenefit citizens throughout the West. Having said that, this same \nlimited number of exemptions must not be awarded solely or \ndisproportionately to one carrier or one airport. I expect that the DOT \nwill ensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from these 12 \nslots. I am particularly concerned that small and mid-size communities \nin the West, especially in the northern tier have improved access \nthrough hubs like Salt Lake City.\n  These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule from hubs like Salt \nLake City will improve service to the Nation's capital for dozens of \nwestern cities beyond the perimeter--while ensuring that cities inside \nthe perimeter are not adversely impacted by new service. This is a fair \nbalance which is consistent with the overall intent of the bill to \nimprove air service to small and medium-sized cities.\n  Throughout this bill, the goal has been to improve air service for \ncommunities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to \nthe extent of larger markets. The provision relating to improve access \nto Reagan National Airport is no different. Today, passengers from many \ncommunities in the West are forced to double or even triple connect to \nfly to Reagan National. My goal is to ensure that not just large city \npoint-to-point service will benefit, but that passengers from all \npoints west of the perimeter will have better options to reach \nWashington, DC, via Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This \nprovisions is about using this restricted exemption process to spread \nimproved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few \nlarge cities which already have a variety of options.\n  Let me be clear, according to the language contained in this \nprovision, if\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\nthe Secretary receives more applications for additional slots than the \nbill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based on quantifying \nthe domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must consider and ward \nthese limited opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest \nnumber of cities to the national air transportation network. In a \nperfect world, we would not have to make these types of choices and \ncould defer to the marketplace. This certainly would be my preference. \nHowever, Congress has limited the number of choices thereby requiring \nthe establishment of a process which will ensure that the maximum \nnumber of cities benefit from this change in policy.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and his \ncolleagues for their efforts to open the perimeter rule and improve \naccess and competition to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. As \na part of my statement I would like to include in the Record a letter \nsent to Chairman McCain on this matter signed by seven western \nSenators.\n  There being no objection, this letter was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: We are writing to commend you on your \n     efforts to improve access to the western United States from \n     Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. We support \n     creating a process which fairly balances the interests of \n     states inside the perimeter and those of western states \n     without convenient access to Reagan National.\n       These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve \n     service to the nation's capital for dozens of western cities \n     beyond the perimeter--while at the same time ensuring that \n     cities inside the perimeter are not adversely impacted by new \n     service. This is a fair balance which is consistent with the \n     overall intent of the bill to improve air service to small- \n     and medium-sized cities.\n       The most important aspect of your proposal is that the \n     Department of Transportation must award these limited \n     opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest \n     number of cities to the national transportation network. In \n     our view, this standard is the cornerstone of our mutual goal \n     to give the largest number of western cities improved access \n     to the Nation's capital. We trust that the Senate bill and \n     Conference report on FAA reauthorization will reaffirm this \n     objective.\n       In a perfect world, we would not have to make these types \n     of choices. These decisions would be better left to the \n     marketplace. However, Congress has limited the ability of the \n     marketplace to make these determinations. Therefore, we must \n     have a process which ensures that we spread improved access \n     to Reagan National throughout the West\n       We look forward to working with you as the House and Senate \n     work to reconcile the differences in the FAA reauthorization \n     bills.\n           Sincerely,\n     Orrin G. Hatch.\n     Robert F. Bennett.\n     Larry E. Craig.\n     Conrad Burns.\n     Craig Thomas.\n     Mike Crapo.\n     Max Baucus.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1000, the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act. This measure will enhance the safety \nand efficiency of our air transportation system, upon which the island \nstate of Hawaii depends upon so much. I am especially supportive of \ntitle VIII, the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, title VIII of H.R. 1000 establishes a comprehensive \nregulatory framework for controlling air tour traffic in and near units \nof the National Park System. This legislation requires the Federal \nAviation Administration, in cooperation with the National Park Service \nand with input from stakeholders, to develop an air tour management \nplan, known as ATMP's, for parks currently or potentially affected by \nair tour flights.\n  The ATMP process evaluates routes, altitudes, time restrictions, \nlimitations on, and other operating parameters to protect sensitive \npark resources and to enhance the safety of air tour operations. An \nATMP could prohibit air tours at a park entirely, regulate air tours \nwithin \\1/2\\ mile of park boundaries, regulate air tour operations that \naffect tribal lands, and offer incentives for the adoption of quieter \nair technology.\n  H.R. 1000 also creates an advisory group comprised of representatives \nof the FAA, the Park Service, the aviation industry, the environmental \ncommunity, and tribes to provide advice, information, and \nrecommendations on overflight issues.\n  Through the ATMP process, this bill treats overflights issues on a \npark-by-park basis. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, the \nlegislation establishes a fair and rational mechanism through which \nenvironmental and aviation needs can be addressed in the context of the \nunique circumstances that exist at individual national parks.\n  I am pleased that this procedural approach, in addition to \nrequirements for meaningful public consultation and a mechanism for \npromoting dialog among diverse stakeholders, mirrors key elements of \nlegislation, the National Parks Airspace Management Act, that I \nsponsored in several previous Congresses.\n  Mr. President, adoption of this bill is essential if we are to \naddress the detrimental impact of air tour activities on the National \nPark System effectively. Air tourism has significantly increased in the \nlast decade, nowhere more so than over high profile units such as the \nGrand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, and Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes \nnational parks. A 1994 Park Service study indicated that nearly a \nhundred parks experienced adverse park impacts, and that number has \ncertainly increased since then. Such growth has inevitably conflicted \nwith the qualities and values that many park units were established to \npromote.\n  Air tour operators often provide important emergency services while \nenhancing park access for special populations like the physically \nchallenged and older Americans. Furthermore, air tour operators offer \nan important source of income for local economies, notably tourism-\ndependent areas such as Hawaii. However, unregulated overflights have \nthe potential to harm park ecologies, distress wildlife, and impair \nvisitor enjoyment of the park experience. Unrestricted air tour \noperations also pose a safety hazard to air and ground visitors alike.\n  It is therefore vital that we develop a clear, consistent national \npolicy on this issue, one that equitably and rationally prioritizes the \nrespective interests of the aviation and environmental communities. \nCongress and the Administration have struggled to develop such a policy \nsince enactment of the National Parks Overflights Act of 1987, \nCongress' initial, but limited, attempt to address the overflights \nissue. Title VIII of H.R. 1000 will finish where the 1987 act left off, \nproviding the FAA and Park Service with the policy guidance and \nprocedural mechanisms that are essential to balance the needs of air \ntour operators with the imperative to preserve and protect our natural \nresources.\n\n  Mr. President, the overflights provisions of this bill are the \nproduct of good faith efforts on the part of many groups and \nindividuals. They include members of the National Parks Overflights \nWorking Group, whose consensus recommendations from the underpinnings \nof this legislation; representatives of air tour and environmental \nadvocacy organizations such as Helicopter Association International and \nthe National Parks and Conservation Association; and, officials of the \nFAA and Park Service.\n  However, title VIII is above all the product of the energy and vision \nof Senator John McCain. As the author of the 1987 National Parks \nOverflights Act, Senator McCain was the first to recognize the adverse \nimpacts of air tours on national parks, and the first to call for a \nnational policy to address this problem. Since then, he has employed \nhis moral authority and legislative skills to advance a constructive \nsolution on this subject. For his leadership in writing this bill and \nfor his long advocacy of park overflight issues, Senator McCain \ndeserves our lasting appreciation.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to have worked closely with Senator \nMcCain over the last few years to formulate an overflights bill that \npromotes aviation safety, enhances the viability of legitimate air tour \noperations, and protects national parks from the most egregious visual \nand noise intrusions by air tour helicopters and other aircraft. Left \nunchecked, air tour activities can undermine the very qualities and \nresources\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nthat give value to a park. I believe that the pending measure \nreasonably and prudently balances these sometimes opposing \nconsiderations, and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, Mr. President, I would like to \nrecognize the staff of the Commerce Committee for their hard work in \nputting this legislation together. Ann Choiniere deserves mention for \nher day-to-day management of the overflights issue. I would also like \nto recognize former members of my own staff, Kerry Taylor, Bob Weir, \nSteve Oppermann, and John Tagami, who made important contributions to \nthis issue. Steve in particular has served as an expert resource whose \ntireless, and largely unheralded contribution has shaped the \noverflights debate in a major way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport on Federal Aviation Reauthorization. I am pleased that \nCongressional negotiators have reached an agreement providing needed \nresources and investment for the federal aviation programs, while \nmaintaining budgetary discipline.\n  The final agreement maintains the FAA on-budget status but insures \nthat the money in the Trust Fund will be spent only on aviation \nprograms. The agreement provides a strong and enforceable guarantee to \nensure that FAA appropriations will be no less than the amounts paid \nannually into the Trust Fund. The final agreement also permits the use \nof general funds for aviation programs subject to the normal \nappropriation process. This combination of Trust Fund and general fund \nrevenue will help to ensure that much needed construction and \nmaintenance are carried out as part of our nation's aviation program.\n  Part of the agreement reached by the conferees includes a provision \nwhich addresses what I believe is a complicated and growing problem--\nflight delays and cancellations.\n  The problem is not that delays and cancellations occur. Airlines must \nmaintain a tight schedule and that schedule can be greatly affected by \nweather or equipment problems.\n  For travelers, it is a mystery whether these delays and cancellations \nare caused by weather, equipment problems, or economic convenience. \nNobody knows. The airlines don't have to tell you. After you finally \nreach your destination, there's a good chance that you'll never know \nwhy you were stranded thousands of miles from home or why you missed \nthat important business meeting.\n  But flights also are canceled or delayed for economic reasons, not \njust mechanical or weather-related problems. And when these economic \ndelays and cancellations occur, it's usually rural America that gets \nthe short end of the stick. For instance, if there are 40 people in \nDenver waiting for a flight to Billings, MT and another 120 waiting to \ngo to San Francisco but only one plane is available, the flight to \nBillings will be canceled. For the Airlines, its simple. It costs less \nto put 30 people up in a hotel and send them on to Billings the next \nday than it does to send 120 California-bound people to a hotel.\n  That is wrong. If flights are canceled for economic or other reasons, \npassengers deserve to know the truth. It will also allow them to shop \naround for the airline that has the best performance record. When you \nonly have a couple of flights into a town, as is the case with much of \nrural America, cancellations are not just an inconvenience. There is an \neconomic impact as well.\n  As my home state of Montana, and our neighbors in North and South \nDakota, Wyoming and Idaho can attest, what business is going to \nrelocate to an area where flight service is not reliable?\n  Right now, Montana's economy needs work. Our state ranks near the \nbottom of per-capita individual income. Other measures of economic \nprogress are also pretty low. Reliable air service doesn't guarantee \neconomic growth. But without it, workers and employers alike have a \ndifficult burden to bear.\n  That is why I am pleased that the conference report contains a \nversion of my amendment to require air carriers to more fully disclose \nthe cause of delays. The conference report creates a task force that \nwill modify Airline Service Quality Performance Reports to reflect the \nreasons for such delays and cancellations, such as snow storms, \nmechanical difficulties or economic reasons, like the one I just \nmentioned. This task force will consist of representatives of airline \nconsumers and air carriers.\n  Currently, the ten largest airlines have to report monthly to the \nDepartment of Transportation all flights that are more than 15 minutes \nlate to and from the 29 U.S. airports that make up at least 1 percent \nof the nation's total domestic scheduled-service passenger \nenplanements. This statistic includes cancellations. My provision will \nbroaden this reporting so that more passengers will have this \ninformation.\n  I realize that simply reporting the reason will not stop the practice \nof delaying flights or canceling them for economic reasons. Airlines \nare a business. An industry. As such, they must make business decisions \nthat will keep their operation in the black.\n  But, if airlines have to start reporting the reasons for missed \nconnections and disrupted lives, consumers can start making their own \nchoices about which airline to fly. In the end I hope this information \nwill lead to more dependable service around the country, but especially \nin rural America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the conferees for their hard work \nand diligent effort to accommodate the wide range of interests on this \nlong-awaited legislation.\n  I take this opportunity to make my position on the FAA conference \nagreement perfectly clear. There are three areas which I want to \naddress. First, I am grateful to the conferees for the inclusion of my \namendment delinking federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds to \nReagan National and Dulles International Airports to the confirmation \nof federal appointees to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority \n(MWAA). This provision ensures the release of $144 million to allow for \ncritical safety and modernization plans to go forward. Second, I want \nto express my regret that the provision raising the Passenger Facility \nCharges (PFC) was included as part of the conference agreement. Lastly, \nit was my strong preference that no new additional flights be allowed \ninto and out of Reagan National Airport. Despite my opposition, it was \nthe will of the Congress to increase the number of slots at Reagan \nNational. I will continue to oppose any increase in the number of \nflights at Reagan National.\n  I am pleased with the inclusion of my amendment to give Reagan \nNational and Dulles International Airports equitable treatment under \nFederal law that is enjoyed today by all of the major commercial \nairports.\n  As you know, Congress created the MWAA Board of Directors and charged \nthe Senate with the duty of confirming three federal appointments. In \naddition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the appointees, the \nstatute contains a punitive provision which denies all federal AIP \nentitlement grants and the imposition of any new passenger facility \ncharges (PFC) to Dulles International and Reagan National if the \nappointees were not confirmed by October 1, 1997.\n  As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement \ngrants for construction at the two airports and from approving any PFC \napplications, these airports have been denied access to over $144 \nmillion.\n  These are funds that every other airport in the country receives \nannually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and \nsafety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the \ncountry, the full share of federal funds have been withheld from Dulles \nand Reagan National for nearly three years.\n  These critically needed funds have halted important construction \nprojects at both airports. Of the over $144 million that is due, \napproximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects \nand $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs.\n  I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional \nduties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal \npositions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link \nthe Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to \noperate airports.\n  This amendment would not remove the Congress of the United States, \nand particularly the Senate, from its advise-and-consent role. It \nallows the\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nmoney, however, which we need for the modernization of these airports, \nto flow properly to the airports. These funds are critical to the \nmodernization program of restructuring them physically to accommodate \nsomewhat larger traffic patterns, as well as do the necessary \nmodernization to achieve safety-most important, safety-and greater \nconvenience for the passengers using these two airports.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is aimed at ensuring that necessary \nsafety and service improvements proceed at Reagan National and Dulles \nand I am pleased with its inclusion.\n  Secondly, I wanted to express my profound regret that the conference \nagreement includes any increase in PFC charges.\n  The current PFC cap is set at $3 per airport and passengers can \neasily pay a total of $12 in taxes on a round trip flight. Already, \nairline passengers are subjected to a 7.5% federal excise tax, the \n$12.40 per passenger excise tax on air passenger arrivals, as well as \nthe 4.3 cents per gallon Aviation Trust Fund tax on aviation jet fuel. \nAirline passengers can pay as much as 40% of their total ticket cost \njust in taxes.\n  Providing better airport facilities is imperative but raising PFCs in \norder to guarantee a revenue stream for aviation is like flying a jet \nplane with less than adequate destination fuel. You'll get off the \nground but it will come at great cost.\n  Lastly, the conference agreement includes a provision that will allow \nfor an increase of 12 flights at Reagan National Airport. The original \nSenate language included an unacceptable and astonishing number of 48 \ntakeoffs and landings. I fought very hard to stem the tide as I had \ninnumerable environmental, clean-air and local control concerns and am \nappreciative the conferees agreed to scale back the number of \nadditional slots to a less egregious number. In crafting this \nagreement, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate not to open \nfuture discussion on this matter without appropriate deference being \nmade to my constituents in Virginia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nhighlight an important provision in the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization conference report which provides more equitable \ntreatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation \ndisasters.\n  The devastating crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17, \n1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps the community hardest \nhit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and 5 \nadult chaperones who were participating in a long-awaited Montoursville \nHigh School French Club trip to France.\n  Last Congress it was brought to my attention by constituents, \nincluding parents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800, that \ntheir ability to seek redress in court was hampered by a 1920 shipping \nlaw known as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally \nintended to apply to the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of \njumbo-jet passengers who have perished during international air travel.\n  The Death on the High Seas Act states that where the death of a \nperson is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring more \nthan one marine league--three miles--from U.S. shores, a personal \nrepresentative of a decedent can only sue for pecuniary loss sustained \nby the decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. \nTherefore, the families of the victims of aviation accidents, such as \nTWA 800, Swissair 111 and EgyptAir 990, all of which occurred more than \nthree miles offshore, were precluded from recovering non-pecuniary \ndamages such as loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how \ngreat the wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane \nmanufacturer.\n  In the 105th Congress Representative McDade and I introduced \nlegislation to remove the application of the Death on the High Seas Act \nfrom aviation incidents. Our legislation was not enacted into law, and \nin the 106th Congress, Representative Sherwood and I again reintroduced \nthis measure. The House bill, H.R. 603, passed by an overwhelming \nmargin and was incorporated into the House FAA reauthorization bill. \nThe Senate version of the FAA bill included a provision allowing \nvictims' families to recover non-pecuniary damages, but with a cap of \n$750,000, which I opposed.\n  On October 18, 1999, I was successful in convincing 15 of my \ncolleagues to join me in a letter to Chairman McCain urging the Senate \nto accept the House provision in conference. Representative Sherwood \nand I also worked closely with Chairman Shuster and his staff to press \nour case before the conferees.\n  I am very pleased that the final provision agreed upon in the FAA \nreauthorization conference report accomplishes the primary goal of our \nfree-standing legislation by extending the territorial seas of the \nUnited States from three to twelve miles for the purpose of aviation \naccidents after July 16, 1996. This effectively removes TWA 800--which \ncrashed roughly ten miles offshore--from coverage under the Death on \nthe High Seas Act. In addition, while the Death on the High Seas Act \nwill still apply to other aviation accidents which occurred beyond \ntwelve miles, such as Swissair 111 and EgyptAir 990, non-pecuniary \ndamages will now be recoverable for the first time.\n  Our success in this matter would not have been possible without the \nwork of many, and I would particularly like to recognize the efforts of \nHans Ephraimson-Abt, Frank Carven and Will and Kathy Rogers, all of \nwhom have lost loved ones as a result of tragedy in international air \ntravel. These individuals first brought this issue to my attention and \nserved as able advocates. I would also like to thank Dan Renberg and \nMark Carmel of my staff, who worked tirelessly on behalf of all the \nvictims' families. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues, \nChairman Shuster, Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings and Senator Gorton \nfor working with Representative Sherwood and myself to address this \nmatter.\n  This issue is not about large damage awards. It is about ensuring \naccess to justice and clarifying the rights of families of victims of \nplane crashes. While nothing can ever completely take away the pain and \ngrief felt by those who lost loved ones in these tragedies, I am \nhopeful that the victims' families are comforted with the knowledge \nthat some measure of fairness has been restored and the American civil \njustice system is now more accessible.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of \ntoday's passage of H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment \nand Reform Act for the 21st Century. Today is a great day for rural \nAmerica's air passengers. This legislation will bring much needed air \nservice to under served communities throughout the Nation. It will also \ngrant billions of dollars in federal funds to our Nation's airports for \nupgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP).\n  Senator Slade Gorton, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nSubcommittee on Aviation, is to be commended for his superb leadership \non this complex and contentious measure. My friend and colleague from \nthe State of Washington proved himself pivotal earlier during floor \nconsideration of the Senate bill and during the conference with the \nother body on this bill. Together with Chairman Domenici, Chairman \nStevens, and Senator Hollings, their joint efforts moved this bill to \ntoday's passage.\n  Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of H.R. \n1000. Citizens of small and under served communities can look forward \nto the day when they no longer have to travel hundreds of miles and \nseveral hours to board a plane. This legislation provides incentives to \ndomestic air carriers and their affiliates to reach out to these people \nand serve them conveniently near their homes. Many Americans will be \nable to travel a reasonable distance to gain access to our Nation's \nskies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go.\n  Mr. President, I also applaud the hard work of Senator Frist of \nTennessee, Senator Abraham of Michigan, and Senator Ashcroft of \nMissouri, all members of the Senate Commerce Committee. Their \ndedication to the flying public helped move the FAA conference when \nagreements on contentious aviation issues were not met. They understand \nthe delays, inconvenience, and headache their constituents must endure \nwhen flying--they get it. I firmly believe that without the engagement \nof these three gentlemen the Senate would not be voting on H.R. 1000\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\ntoday. The people of Tennessee, Michigan, and Missouri should be \nextremely proud of their representation in Washington.\n  The major policy changes in H.R. 1000 led to hard fought, but honest \ndisagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of Chairmen \nDomenici, Stevens, and Shuster, as well as House Ranking Member \nOberstar, as they diligently advocated for their committees' \njurisdictions. One thing was abundantly clear during the FAA \nconference--my colleagues recognized our Nation's aviation needs and \nmade significant commitments to increase aviation funding. This honest \ndebate and willingness to work together to achieve common goals is what \nmakes it exciting to serve in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of my colleagues. Since 1995, the \nRepublican majority has made infrastructure a top legislative priority. \nTwo years ago, my friends in the House and Senate successfully led an \neffort to boost the amount of federal funding for highway construction \nand improvements. History will reflect that this Congress also deeply \ncared about our Nation's infrastructure. One of the main components of \nH.R. 1000 directs the expense of all Airports and Airways Trust Fund \nrevenue and interest on aviation needs. Trust Fund revenue and interest \nmeans that America's airports will get the improvements they \ndesperately need to take our aviation infrastructure into the 21st \nCentury.\n  Mr. President, no legislative initiation is ever possible without the \ndedicated efforts of staff, and I want to take a moment to identify \nthose who worked hard to get FAA legislation through conference and to \nthe Senate for approval.\n  From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation: \nMarti Allbright; Lloyd Ator; Mark Buse; Ann Choiniere; Julia Kraus; \nMichael Reynolds; Scott Verstandig; and Sam Whitehorn.\n  From the Senate Committee on the Budget: Beth Felder; Bill Hoagland; \nMary Naylor; Barry Strumpf; and Cheryle Tucker.\n  From the Senate Committee on Appropriations: Wally Burnett; Paul \nDoerrer; Peter Rogoff; and Mitch Warren.\n  The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senators: \nChrystn Alston; Kerry Ates; Rich Bender; David Broome; Bob Carey; Steve \nBrowning; Jeanne Bumpus; John Conrad; Margaret Cummisky; Brett Hale; \nKeith Hennessey; Ann Loomis; Randal Popelka; Mitch Rose; Lisa \nRosenberg; Greg Rothchild; Jim Sartucci; Lori Sharpe; Brad Van Dam; and \nAndy Vermilye.\n  Mr. President, these individuals worked very hard on H.R. 1000, and \nthe Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's small communities are a step closer to \nreceiving long-sought air service. Also, America's airports will be \nenhanced. This is good for all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think we are quite close to the end of \nthis debate. I wish to make only a few remarks, primarily in response \nto those of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, who spoke in \nopposition.\n  One reason this bill has taken so long to come before the Senate in \nthe final conference report was an objection I shared with the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the majority leader to \ncreating a new entitlement.\n  I do not believe, in the ultimate analysis, this bill does create a \nnew entitlement. It does say that all of the money collected by the \naviation passenger tax that has long been statutorily earmarked toward \naircraft, airport, and airline purposes ought to be spent on that \npurpose. It does effectively guarantee that trust fund will be spent \nfor the purposes it was created. That, it seems to me, is a good thing \nrather than a bad thing.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is correct in saying we will be required \nin the future, as I think we ought to be, to appropriate general fund \nmoney for aircraft purposes in the broadest sense. I suppose one can \ncall that a subsidy to air travel.\n  The Senator speaks of Amtrak. My figures indicate that the roughly 20 \nmillion Amtrak passengers each year are subsidized by the general \ntaxpayer to the extent of $28 per passenger per trip. Even if one \nassumed this bill would essentially require spending $2.5 million a \nyear on the Federal Aviation Administration in general fund moneys over \nand above the trust fund, and even if we attributed every one of those \ndollars directly to the passengers of commercial aircraft, which of \ncourse we should not, that would be roughly $4 a passenger, or one-\nseventh the amount of subsidy to rail passengers.\n  The bottom line is that the Appropriations Committee still retains \nauthority to shift funds among various capital accounts that are within \nthe trust fund and still allow for a direct appropriation of whatever \namount the Senate desires for general fund purposes. It will make it \nmore difficult not to come up to authorized levels, but it does not \nmake it impossible.\n  We all agree that the needs of our air transportation system are \nemergent and are large. This bill represents a major step forward to \nfunding an adequate amount and will still allow judgments to be made \nbetween various forms of transportation and other needs of the country \nin an appropriate fashion.\n  This is a good bill, and I believe it ought to be passed with an \noverwhelmingly affirmative vote.\n  Has a rollcall vote been ordered on final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I think it appropriate to ask for 2 minutes prior to the \nvote at 5 p.m. for summary conclusions on the bill, 1 minute on each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State has 2 \nminutes remaining; the Senator from West Virginia has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I only make a couple of comments. I \nindicated this is the largest increase in aviation spending in history. \nI did that out of a sense of pride because of the urgency of the \nsituation we face. This is not money which is being spent for the sake \nof money; it is money being spent so we will not walk into the disaster \nwe are now headed towards.\n  I remind my colleagues--the delays, the near misses, the pressure, \nthe outdated equipment, the insufficient time for preparation at work, \nsalaries, money for various purposes--we cannot take an air traffic \ncontrol system or modernize an FAA in the way they want to do it, we \ncannot pay the many thousands of people who work to keep it safe in \nthis country, without spending money.\n  It has been said a number of times that the number of people who will \nbe flying in this country will be a billion in less than 10 years. \nCargo traffic on a worldwide basis, as well as in our country, will \nincrease exponentially. The number of planes flying in the skies will \nincrease by at least 50 percent in less than 10 years. Think about \nthat. We have the same number of runways; we have 20- to 30-year-old \ncomputers trying to figure out what altitudes the planes are flying and \nfigure out how to separate them; we look at all the different tracking \nsystems we have in our aviation system and we would be embarrassed to \nhave that equipment in our own Senate offices. It is a crisis. \nTherefore, it is a priority. We are talking about the saving of \nAmerican lives and lives across the world. Money must be spent.\n  It is not that other transportation is any less important. This \nSenator benefits enormously from the services of Amtrak. An airplane \ncrash does something to the Nation's psychology. It can take 2 or 3 \nyears for an airline to recover from an instant which costs lives. The \neconomic impact and, most importantly, the human impact and the \npressure on people who run the\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\naviation system to prevent these things from happening, to have safe \nskies, is absolutely overwhelming. It is something which is not \nrecognized sufficiently by the American people and which we are, \nhappily, recognizing in this bill.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Transportation is happy with this \nbill and will recommend to the President that he sign it. Jane Garvey, \nthe FAA Administrator--somebody in whom I have an enormous amount of \nconfidence, who has run Boston's airport by herself and knows the \nsituation cold--is very much in support of this.\n  After all, we have not taken anything off budget. The aviation trust \nfund is still on budget. We have not built any firewalls. We have acted \nin a responsible fashion. However, we have applied more money because \nthis is a particularly special crisis which, thank heavens, after a \nnumber of years, Congress has finally recognized.\n  In my earlier remarks, I failed to mention Bud Shuster in the House, \nthe chairman of their committee, and Jim Oberstar, dear friends of many \nyears. What they and their colleagues have done is extraordinary. I \nthink we have a superb bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is, as in \nall things, the result of compromise. I think, generally speaking, we \nhave a bill of which to be extremely proud. I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia believes that very strongly.\n  Unless there are others who wish to speak, I hope our colleagues will \nvote to pass this conference report when the time comes this afternoon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that uses the time of all the \npeople who wish to speak on the conference report. I ask unanimous \nconsent debate, other than the 2 minutes at 5 p.m., be concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, I have come to the floor repeatedly over \nthe last few months to talk about the importance of prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare for the Nation's senior citizens. Today I want \nto focus on how the absence of this coverage essentially undermines our \nentire health care system.\n  What we are seeing is that every day, in the United States, senior \ncitizens who are ailing from a variety of health problems end up \ngetting sicker because they are not able to afford their prescription \nmedicine. Very often these seniors end up being hospitalized and \nneeding vastly more expensive medical services that are made available \nunder what is called Part A of the Medicare program.\n  Today, I want to describe a case I recently learned about in \nHillsboro, OR, because it illustrates just how irrational, how \nextraordinarily illogical, it is to have a health care system for the \nNation's senior citizens that does not cover prescription drugs.\n  An orthopedist from Hillsboro, OR, recently wrote me that he actually \nhad to hospitalize a patient for over 6 weeks because the patient \nneeded antibiotics that they were not covered on an outpatient basis.\n  Here you had a frail, vulnerable older person. The physician, and all \nthe medical specialists involved, believed that person could be treated \non an outpatient basis with antibiotics, but because there was not \nMedicare coverage available on an outpatient basis--because there was \nnot the kind of coverage Senator Daschle has been talking about and \nSenator Snowe and I have made available in the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan \nlegislation--because that coverage was not available to the senior \ncitizen in Hillsboro, OR, that older person had to be hospitalized for \nover 6 weeks.\n  Here is what the doctor said to me:\n\n       This method of treatment [the preferred outpatient method \n     of treatment] is cost effective and is preferred by patients \n     and doctors. In this case, the patient is condemned to spend \n     6 weeks in the hospital solely to receive intravenous \n     antibiotics. To me, this seems like a tremendous waste of \n     money and resources. The patient would be better at home.\n\n  What this case illustrates is exactly why we need, on a bipartisan \nbasis--the Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach; our colleagues may \nhave other ideas on how to do it--but this is a case study on why it is \nso important to cover prescription drugs for older people under \nMedicare.\n  We are not talking about some abstract academic kind of analysis that \ncomes from one of the think tanks here in Washington, DC. This is a \nphysician in Hillsboro, OR, who had to put a patient, an older person, \nin a hospital for 6 weeks because they could not afford to get their \nmedicine on an outpatient basis.\n  A lot of our colleagues are here on the floor who are on the Commerce \nCommittee. We look at technology issues at that Committee. The irony \nis, we can save money, again, through the use of new technology in \nhealth care.\n  The kind of treatment that would have been best for this older person \nin Oregon would have been through an electronic delivery system the \nolder person could have used on their belt for a relatively short \nperiod of time had Medicare covered that prescription the older person \nneeded. But because that person could not get coverage for the \nantibiotics and use that electronic delivery system on an outpatient \nbasis, which they could wear on their belt, they had to go into a \nhospital for 6 weeks.\n  Colleagues, we are going to hear a lot over this break from senior \ncitizens and families about the importance of this issue. I intend \ntomorrow, again, to come to the floor and discuss this matter. Senator \nDaschle has made it very clear to me, and talks about it virtually \nevery day, that he wants to have the Senate find the common ground. He \nwants Senators to come together and deal with this on a bipartisan \nbasis. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach. Our colleagues have \nother bills.\n\n  The point is, let us make sure, in this session of Congress, that in \nArkansas, in Washington, and in the State of Nevada, we do not have \nolder people hospitalized unnecessarily for 6 weeks because we have not \ncome together as a Senate to make sure they can get those medicines on \nan outpatient basis.\n  Science has given us cost-effective, practical remedies for these \npeople in need, remedies that will reduce suffering and will reduce \ncosts to taxpayers.\n  Let us come together, on a bipartisan basis, to make sure we do not \nadjourn without adding this important benefit to the Medicare program.\n  As I have made clear, I intend to keep coming back to the floor of \nthe Senate until we, on a bipartisan basis, as Senator Daschle has \nsuggested, come together and get this important job done.\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am here to address the issue of pipeline safety, an \nissue that people in most communities, cities, and towns do not concern \nthemselves with unless, regretfully, a tragedy occurs, such as the one \nthat took place in Bellingham, WA, last June.\n  The devastating liquid pipeline explosion that rocked the city of \nBellingham and took the lives of three young boys rightfully served as \na wakeup call and focused our attention on the need for pipeline safety \nreform. While pipelines continue to be the safest means of transporting \nliquid fuels and gas, and though accidents may be infrequent on the \nmore than 2 million miles of mostly invisible pipelines in the United \nStates, Bellingham has shown us that pipelines do pose potential \ndangers that we ignore at our peril.\n  In testifying on the Bellingham incident before a House committee \nlast fall, I commented that while Congress had an obligation \nsubstantively to revise the Pipeline Safety Act in response to the \nclarion call for Bellingham, proposals for specific changes to the law \nseemed premature at that time. State and local officials in Washington \nState, as well as citizens groups, environmentalists, and various \nFederal oversight bodies, were just beginning to examine the accident \nand its causes.\n  The Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, has primary \njurisdiction over this bill in the Senate, and last year I implored the \nchairman, Senator McCain, and other committee members to make the \nreauthorization a top priority. Last week, at my request, the Commerce \nCommittee scheduled the first Senate hearing on the topic of pipelines.\n  The field hearing to address the Bellingham incident and the State's \nresponse to it will be held in Bellingham, WA, next Monday, March 13.\n  I encourage my colleagues from the Senate Commerce Committee to come \nto Bellingham next Monday to hear firsthand testimony from the families \nof the victims and from local officials whose lives have been \ntransformed by this tragedy. Theirs is a story which compels us to \naction. The families and the community will never forget what happened \nlast June 10, nor should we in Congress. It is our duty to take the \nlessons learned in Bellingham and adopt tougher safety measures that \nwill allow us to prevent future tragedies.\n  This hearing will, I hope, serve as guide as we debate the \nreauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act. And while a number of the \nstudies and operational reviews commissioned after the accident are \nstill incomplete, including those of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, on the cause of the accident in Bellingham and the report of the \nGeneral Accounting Office as to the performance of the Office of \nPipeline Safety, other reviews are complete.\n  Primary among these is the report of the Fuel Accident Prevention and \nResponse Team, a task force convened by Governor Gary Locke and charged \nwith reviewing Federal, State and local laws and practices affecting \npipeline accident prevention and response. A significant contributor to \nthis report was Mayor Mark Asmundson of Bellingham, whose efforts to \nlearn from, educate others about, and rationally apply the lessons of \nthat tragedy have been commendable.\n  The Fuel Accident Team recommended changes in law and practice at the \nFederal, State, and local levels. It revealed that there is a lot that \ncan be done by State and local officials that is not being done, \nparticularly in the area of emergency preparedness, public education, \nand adoption of appropriate set-back requirements to keep development \naway from lines. The Fuel Accident Team also found, however, that at \nleast with respect to interstate pipelines, State and local officials \nare limited by Federal law from regulating many of the safety aspects \nof these lines, and that only the Federal Government can adopt or \nenforce requirements for inspection, emergency flow restriction \ndevices, operator training, leak detection, corrosion prevention, \nmaximum pressure, and other safety measures relevant to the safe \nconstruction, maintenance, and operation of pipelines.\n  While there may be good arguments that pipelines should be managed \nsystemically and why inconsistent State standards could erode rather \nthan promote safety, these arguments are fatally undermined by the \nabsence of meaningful Federal standards. To tell State and local \ngovernments, as the Pipeline Safety Act effectively does, that they \ncannot require internal inspections of pipelines passing through their \ncommunities, under their schools and homes and senior centers, when a \nFederal requirement for internal inspections is years overdue, strikes \nme as the worst kind of Federal conceit.\n\n  Amending the Pipeline Safety Act to relax Federal preemption and \nallow States to exceed minimum Federal safety standards was the first \nrecommendation of Washington's Fuel Accident Team. Despite this \nrecommendation, I understand that the administration's proposal for the \nreauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act will move in exactly the \nopposite direction, that is, it will propose to eliminate even the \nvague authority under which the Office of Pipeline Safety has appointed \nfour States as its agents for purposes of inspecting interstate liquid \npipelines.\n  The purported reason for further disempowering States is, I \nunderstand, OPS's perception that a system of inconsistent standards is \nunsafe, OPS's perception that a system of inconsistent standards is \nunsafe, and that States already have their hands full with regulating \nintrastate pipelines, which are far more extensive than interstate \nlines. But what if the States disagree with this attitude, which, in \nthe absence of meaningful Federal standards is tantamount to saying \nthat ``no standards are better than anything States can come up with''?\n  Yes, the interstate nature of some pipelines gives the Federal \nGovernment the option of regulating them and preempting States from \ndoing so. If the Federal Government is not going to do its job, \nhowever, why should we prevent States from assuming responsibility for \nsomething as important as pipeline safety?\n  To its credit, in response to the Bellingham incident the Office of \nPipeline Safety has proposed to complete a rulemaking on ``pipeline \nintegrity'' by the end of this year. This rulemaking, years overdue, is \nnot only supposed to address requirements for internal inspection and \nthe use of emergency flow restriction devices in highly populated and \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, but to adopt a systemic approach to \npipeline safety that focuses not just on specific tests but on making \nsure that pipeline operators are accurately assessing risks, collecting \nand properly analyzing relevant data, and exercising sound judgment. \nFollowing the June 10 accident last year, the city of Bellingham \nconditioned the resumption of operations of a portion of the pipeline \non the Olympic Pipe Line Company's adherence to certain process \nmanagement standards borrowed from OSHA regulations applicable to oil \nrefineries. This emphasis on a process management approach is, I \nbelieve, sound and should, I believe, be incorporated into any new \nFederal safety standards.\n  Once meaningful Federal standards for pipelines are in place, debate \nabout\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nwhether or not safety is advanced by allowing States to adopt and \nenforce stricter, but inconsistent standards, can begin. Even then, \nhowever, and certainly until then, I support the proposals in the \nlegislation cosponsored in the House and Senate by all of the \nWashington delegation members to prescribe procedures for States to \nassume greater authority in the regulation of pipeline safety. Both \nH.R. 3558 and S. 2004 would permit States to apply for more regulatory \nauthority from the Department of Transportation, which is charged with \nreviewing the proposals to ensure that states have the necessary \nresources and that the Balkanization of pipeline regulation will not \ndegrade safety.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues from Washington to \nensure that the following principles, many of which are reflected in \nthe current S. 2004, are contained in the reauthorization of the \nPipeline Safety Act.\n  First, I support efforts to allow States greater authority to adopt \nand enforce safety standards for interstate pipelines, particularly is \nlight of the absence of meaningful Federal standards. This increase in \nauthority should be accompanied by an increase in grants to States to \ncarry out pipeline safety activities.\n\n  Second, I agree with Senator Murray that we need to improve the \ncollection and dissemination of information about pipelines to the \npublic and to local and State officials responsible for preventing and \nresponding to pipeline accidents. We also need to ensure that operators \nare collecting information necessary accurately to assess risks and to \nrespond. The public should be informed about where pipelines are \nlocated, what condition they are in, when they fail--we need to lower \nthe threshold for reporting failures--and why they fail. We should \nensure that relevant information is gathered and made available over \nwidely accessible means like the Internet.\n  Third, in addition to providing an explicit mechanism for States to \nseek additional regulatory authority over interstate pipelines, Federal \nlegislation should adopt some mechanism for ensuring that meaningful \nstandards for pipeline testing, monitoring, and operation are adopted \nat the national level. Congress has directed the DOT to do some of this \nin the past. But as the Inspector General noted, some of the \nrulemakings are years overdue. To the extent that lack of funding can \naccount for some of the delay we should ensure sufficient \nappropriations to allow OPS to complete the necessary rulemakings and \ndevelop the technology needed to conduct reliable tests of pipelines.\n  While I am reluctant to have Congress, rather than experts, prescribe \nspecific testing and monitoring requirements, and while I fully \nappreciate the need for flexible testing regimes that recognize the \ndifferences among pipelines facing variable risks as well as the need \nfor dynamic standards that advance with knowledge and technology, I am \nsympathetic to the position that specific mandates may be necessary in \nthe face of inaction on the part of OPS. Congress has repeatedly asked \nOPS to conduct rulemakings and been ignored. As a consequence I can \nunderstand those who have lost patience and are prepared to put \nspecific testing and operational prescriptions into Federal statute.\n  In addition to ensuring that OPS complies with years-old statutory \nmandates, I support the Inspector General's recommendation that OPS act \nupon, either to reject or accept, the recommendations of the National \nTransportation Safety Board. I don't pretend to know whether NTSB's \nrecommendations, that have been accumulating for years, will advance \nsafety. It is unacceptable, however, that OPS should simply ignore \nthem.\n  Fourth, I have heard from citizens' groups who support the creation \nof a model oversight oil spill advisory panel in Washington State. I \nsee a real value in creating such a body, and empowering it with \nmeaningful authority to comment on and influence State and Federal \naction or inaction. Such an advisory panel can continue to focus needed \nattention on the issue of pipeline safety when the painful memory of \nJune 10 begins, for many, at the same time mercifully and regretfully, \nto fade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is a rule that is both arcane and archaic. It is \nanticompetitive and unnecessary. The so-called perimeter rule is a \nrule, enacted by Congress in 1986, that precludes any flight \noriginating at Washington National Airport, the region's most popular \nairline destination for the Nation's Capital, from flying nonstop more \nthan 1,250 miles from the Nation's Capital. That also includes any \ninbound flights to Washington National from a point that originates \nmore than 1,250 miles from the Nation's Capital.\n  This perimeter rule was enacted by Congress in 1986. It might have \nhad some historical justification. The origin of the rule is based upon \nan attempt to force additional air traffic into Washington's Dulles \nAirport, which is some distance from the Nation's Capital and not as \nconvenient. Whatever the historical rationale may have been, I think \nanyone who has used Washington's Dulles Airport in recent years, as I \ndo frequently, would testify that it is a fully operational airport \nwith a multibillion-dollar expansion and much traffic.\n  Today, the so-called perimeter rule is defended on the basis of noise \ncontrol in Northern Virginia and the surrounding area. That was not its \nhistorical justification. Now, the effect of the so-called perimeter \nrule is to preclude direct flights, nonstop, into Washington's National \nAirport from most of the country and all of the West.\n  As a historical insight, the original perimeter rule was 750 miles. \nThen, when Russell Long became chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, his congressional district was in New Orleans, and the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair will not be surprised to learn that \nthe perimeter rule had some flexibility then, and the length was \nextended so one could fly nonstop to New Orleans. And later, when, I \nbelieve, Jim Wright became the Speaker, his congressional district was \nthe Dallas-Fort Worth area, so it was extended to 1,250 miles, its \ncurrent length.\n\n  My point is, there is nothing sacrosanct about this rule. It makes no \nsense in terms of safety. The Federal Aviation Administration has \nconcluded there is no safety issue involved, and the GAO has repeatedly \nasserted that the effect of the rule is anticompetitive and it has the \neffect of driving prices up.\n  Now, the debate in this Chamber frequently echoes back and forth \nabout Government interference in the marketplace, meddling, arbitrary \nrules that restrict entry, rules that make it difficult for the private \nsector to respond to the market. I can't think of a better example of \nthat than this so-called perimeter rule.\n  For that reason, I am particularly pleased to support this conference \nreport because one of the features in the conference report modifies \nthe perimeter rule. It doesn't eliminate it in its entirety, but it \ndoes permit 12 slots that would be authorized to fly beyond the 1,250-\nmile perimeter, and that means cities such as Las Vegas and other major \nmetropolitan areas in the West will be able to compete for those \nroutes.\n  It also contains a provision that specifically recognizes new \nentrants into the market. Many will recall that the underlying premise \nof the deregulation of the airline industry assumed there would be a \nnumber of new entrants into the market. Unfortunately, by and large, \nthat has not occurred. New entrants have had a particularly difficult \ntime entering into this market. It is a very competitive market, and \nindeed the survivability of those new entrants has been very limited. \nSo this particular provision repeals, in part, the perimeter rule to \npermit 12 flights to fly beyond the 1,250 miles and to originate from a \ndistance beyond that, thereby making nonstop service to the West a \npossibility.\n  It is my hope that among the communities that would be considered \nwould be Las Vegas, which is rapidly\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\nexpanding its air service. The community's lifeblood is dependent upon \ntourist travel. A great percentage of that is airline service, and a \ndirect, nonstop service flight to one of the largest metropolitan areas \nin the country, the Washington metropolitan area, would have an \nenormously powerful potential for new business for our community.\n  So it is my hope that colleagues will support the conference report. \nI am not unmindful of the fact that there are controversial provisions \nin it. But the modification of the perimeter rule is an important step \nin the right direction. I salute the conferees for following the lead \nof the Senate Commerce Committee, which specifically included, at the \nrequest of myself and others, the modification of the perimeter rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1270-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue I have \nraised several times on the floor. I am hopeful that this year, this \nbody, will get a chance to deal with the marriage penalty tax \nelimination.\n  Mr. President, Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Ashcroft, and I \nhave been pushing for some period of time for the elimination of the \nmarriage penalty tax; and it is truly that--a penalty tax on marriage. \nThis body will have a chance to address this issue shortly. The Finance \nCommittee of the Senate will consider this issue in the near future. \nThey will be marking up the bill to eliminate one area of the Internal \nRevenue Code where the marriage penalty tax occurs. It will then come \nbefore this body, I am told, I believe the leader wants it scheduled \nbefore April 15.\n  There will be Members who will try to block this bill, with issues \nthat are extraneous to the marriage penalty. They will be able to add \nthings to it, or filibuster the marriage penalty tax elimination. I \nhope they think about what they would be doing in stopping the \nelimination of the marriage penalty tax. Before they take actions to \nblock this important issue, I hope they just pause and say maybe I will \ntry to amend my issue onto another bill; this one is too important. I \ndon't think we need to be blocking it.\n  Just in looking at the marriage penalty tax, I hope people recognize \nthe extent of its involvement and intrusion on married couples across \nthe country. I have a chart up here to which I will refer a number of \ntimes. It shows the number of married couples affected by the marriage \npenalty tax across the United States. This is it. The chart represents \nmarried couples, and we don't know how many children are in these \nfamilies who are also effected. We are talking about 25 million \nAmerican families who are affected across the country by this penalty. \nIn Kansas, we have 259,904 couples who are penalized by this marriage \npenalty tax.\n  Again, for those who haven't been following the debate, all our \nproposal would do is level the playing field. It would say that if you \nare married, a two-wage-earner family, you will pay the same in taxes \nas if you were two independent people living together; we are not going \nto punish you, or fine you, or penalize you for being married.\n  The average tax these 25 million American couples pay additionally \nfor the privilege of being married is $1,480. That is a lot of money. \nThat is a lot of money to a lot of people. I hope we cut the tax and \nsend that back to the married couples across this country and say we \nare not going to penalize you anymore. That is what we are seeking for \nthis body to pass.\n  The House of Representatives has already done good work in this area. \nThe House of Representatives has passed a bill to provide marriage tax \npenalty relief for America's families in the 15-percent marginal tax \nbracket and to eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard \ndeduction.\n  I think the House bill is a good starting point for our discussion of \nthe marriage penalty reduction and elimination. Doubling the standard \ndeduction, increasing the width of the 15-percent bracket, and fixing \nthe earned-income tax credit where the marriage penalty exists will \neliminate or reduce the marriage penalty for all families. It still \ndoesn't get rid of it. The Marriage Penalty appears in over 60 \ndifferent places in the Tax Code.\n  Down the road I hope we can get to a discussion of sunsetting the \nentire Tax Code and going to a flatter, fairer, and simpler system. I \nknow the Presiding Officer has led the charge on doing precisely that. \nIt is clearly something we need to do for the country, for the economy, \nand for the people, so many of whom, labor under this Tax Code in fear \nthey are going to be found to have done something wrong when they are \ntrying to be good, law-abiding citizens. But that is a debate for \nanother day.\n  Right now we are trying to get at one issue. The National Center for \nPolicy Analysis says the highest proportion of marriage penalties \noccurred when the higher-earning spouse made between $20,000 and \n$75,000. Clearly, we need to make marriage penalty elimination a \npriority for all families, not only a few.\n  Consider that--making between $20,000 and $75,000. You are looking at \na two-wage-earner family, probably with a child, or two or three \nchildren, who can't afford to be penalized by this $1,480. They are \ncurrently being penalized under the Tax Code.\n  We see the numbers up here. We know the full extent of this.\n  I want to read--because I think these are so touching and important--\nstatements of people who are impacted by this. We continue to collect \nthese statements and letters from people because now people are \ncalculating their marriage penalty tax. I hope in the next week or so \nto have a chart saying: OK. As you are watching this on TV, figure your \nmarriage penalty. Have this as one spouse's income; there is another \nspouse's income; and here is where it meets. That is your marriage \npenalty, the tax you pay. The average is $1,480. Some pay more, some \nless; letting people know this is what they are penalized and this is \nthe tax they are paying.\n  Listen to some of the stories from people around the country. This is \nChristopher from Fairfield, OH. This family said:\n       One of the biggest shocks my wife and I had when deciding \n     to get married was how much more we would have to give to the \n     government because we decided to be married rather than live \n     together. It does not make sense that I was allowed to keep a \n     larger portion of my pay on a Friday and less of it on a \n     Monday with the only difference being that I was married that \n     weekend.\n\n  That is to the point.\n  This is from Andrew and Connie from Alexandria, VA.\n\n       We grew up together and began dating when we were 18. After \n     dating for three years we decided that the next natural step \n     in our lives together would be to get married. I cannot tell \n     you the joy this has brought us. I must tell you that the tax \n     penalty that was inflicted on us has been the only real \n     source of pain that our marriage has suffered.\n\n  I wish all marriages could be like that--that the only source of pain \nis the Tax Code. Is that a pain we should inflict on them? Is that \nsomething we should do to this married couple? They say: We are getting \nalong pretty good. The only real pain is the Federal Tax Code and the \ntax penalty we are paying.\n  I don't think that is a good signal to send.\n  This is Andrew from Greenville, NC, who writes:\n\n       It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy \n     against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. I also \n     feel it is unfortunate that it seems to hit young struggling \n     couples the hardest.\n\n  That is probably the biggest point. If you have a combined income \nwith the top wage earner making between $20,000 and $75,000--these are \nyoung married couples; they are struggling with a lot of issues, \nstruggling with financial issues--and you lob on top of that a tax \npenalty, that really hits them, and particularly a lot of couples \nduring the early years with young children.\n  This is Thomas from Hilliard, OH, who says:\n\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another \n     example of how in the past 40 years the federal government \n     has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental \n     institutions that were the strength of this country from the \n     start.\n\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\n\n  This is Sean from Jefferson City, MO:\n\n       I think the marriage penalty is a major cause of the \n     breakdown of the family here in the U.S. . . . [Ending it] \n     would do a lot to cut down on the incidence of cohabitation \n     by unmarried couples and give more children two-parent \n     families where there is a real commitment between the \n     parents.\n\n  I don't know if I would go as far as what he said--that this has been \nthe major cause of the breakdown of the family in the United States. I \ndon't think that is the case. But it is the wrong signal for us to \nsend. We send signals all the time across the country of what we think \nis good and what we think is wrong.\n  Welfare reform: When we went through that fight--it was a very \nimportant fight--we decreased the welfare rolls in the country by 50 \npercent. We sent a signal that we think it is good to work. That is a \ngood signal.\n  We should eliminate the marriage penalty tax. That is a statement \nabout what we think is good. People are married and they shouldn't be \ntaxed and penalized for that.\n  According to a recent Rutgers University study, the institution of \nmarriage is already having problems in the United States and is in a \nstate of decline. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages per \nthousand adult women declined by almost 43 percent. That impacts and \nhurts a lot of children. Not that single parents don't struggle \nheroically to raise children; they do many times very successfully. But \nthat family can have a bonded relationship. Studies are showing again \nand again that the most important place we can put that child is in a \nloving relationship between two married people.\n  I am going to continue to come down to the floor regularly raising \nthis issue because this body will have a chance to vote on this issue \nin dealing with the marriage penalty tax. I believe there are Members \non both sides of the aisle of goodwill who want to see this marriage \npenalty tax eliminated. I don't think the penalty makes much sense to \nmany Americans at all.\n  I hope as we start to engage this debate, in this body, that Members \non both sides of the aisle will stand up and say: Yes, this is an \nimportant issue. We are not going to load it down with a lot of \namendments. We are not going to load it down with a lot of extraneous \nissues. It passed the House. If it passes this body, we can get it to \nthe President for his signature. It is an important signal to send \nacross the country, and we are not going to block it.\n  There are a lot of ways in this body that you can block something--\nthat you can put it forward and say you are for it but you are blocking \nit. I hope this would be one that we could say we are going to pass for \nthe 25 million American married couples.\n  For those in South Dakota, 75,114 are penalized, and for those in \nNevada 146,142 are penalized--I see my colleagues from South Dakota and \nNevada--I hope they can say to them: We shouldn't be penalizing you.\n  We have the wherewithal to change this, and let's change it.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I hope we will have a vote on a \ntrue marriage penalty tax bill before April 15 comes and goes. There \nwill be other of my colleagues on the floor later on to address this \nissue as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1271-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1712, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1712) to provide authority to control exports, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Gramm is not here. The manager of \nthe bill for the Democrats, Senator Johnson, has graciously consented \nso that I can say a word or two about this legislation.\n  I rise to speak about an issue that is of particular interest to me \nand our national economy. The issue I wish to discuss is export \ncontrols. As I stated previously, it is critical that the Congress \nsupport the engine of our thriving economy while still protecting the \nintegrity of our national security.\n  Today in America consumer confidence is at a record high. \nUnemployment is at a 30-year low. New home sales set a record last \nyear. The rate of inflation is less than 2 percent. The stock market \nhas been surging, and corporation profits are better than analysts \ndreamed.\n  It was announced last month that we are experiencing a record 107 \nmonths of economic expansion. This is all proof that Congress and the \nadministration has done a stellar job in steering the country in the \nright direction. And yet, thus far, we have been unable to pass \nlegislation to update our export controls. The Bureau of Export \nAdministration and the Defense Department are still conducting business \nunder cold war era regulations. The economic and political world has \nchanged dramatically. That is why I am so pleased that this bill has \ncome to the floor today.\n  Last year, I met with Senators Gramm, Enzi, and Johnson, in my \noffice, to discuss export controls. They informed me that The majority \nleader pledged to them that the Export Administration Act would come to \nthe floor before the end of 1999.\n  Everyone tried, but as happens a lot of times at the end of the \nsession, it was unable to be brought to the floor. That is not because \nthe Senators I visited with--Enzi, Gramm, and Johnson--didn't try. \nThese three Senators, for whom I have the greatest respect, have all \nworked hard and in good faith to bring all parties to an accommodation.\n  When this bill passed out of the Banking Committee, it had the full \nsupport of the committee and the business community, while still \nprotecting our Nation's national security. I am afraid with the \naddition of many of the amendments in the so-called managers' package \nthat this bill is losing support both from the business community and \nthe national security interests. I hope we can work something out and \nnot have to adopt the managers' amendment as it is written.\n  In January of last year, along with the distinguished majority \nleader, I, Senator Daschle, and a group of Senate Democrats, got \ntogether to form a high-tech working group. This group came about \nbecause we as Democrats realize the importance of high tech to the \nNation's economy. Senator John Kerry, through his leadership capacity, \nhas worked very hard in this regard.\n  We also recognize that Congress can have a large impact on the \ngrowth, or potential growth, of this sector of our economy. Our initial \ngoal was to educate our caucus on the high-tech issues. Because of the \ngeneration gap between those who run this industry and most Members in \nthe Senate, this took a little time. However, we got to speed very \nquickly. We toured sites all over the United States, including high-\ntech sites in Maryland, Virginia, and Silicon Valley.\n  As with many issues, I often hear that Congress would best serve the \npublic and industry by doing nothing at all. One of the areas most \nbelieve we can be of help is in the area of export controls of high-\nperformance computers. There are currently a number of U.S. products \nthat cannot compete with national competitors due to export control \nlimitations, not because of national security interests but because of \nthe slow review process here in Congress.\n  In June of 1999, and then in January of this year, with the urging of \nSenator Daschle, myself, and other Senators, the administration agreed \nto ease the level of controls which were referred to as MTOPS--million \ntheoretical operations per second.\n  We, as well as those in the computer industry, were elated. There is \na 6-month congressional review period for raising the level of MTOPS. \nThe Banking Committee bill reduces the review from 180 to 60 days. By \nthe Senate Banking Committee agreeing to the shortened review period of \n60 days, the committee recognized a few important things:\n  No. 1, 180 days is too long for an industry whose success depends on \nits ability to beat its foreign competition to the marketplace;\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\n  No. 2, a shorter time period gives the Congress adequate time to \nreview the national security ramifications of any changes in the U.S. \ncomputer export control regime.\n  While this is a good step in the right direction, I, along with \nSenators Bennett, Daschle, Kerry, Murray, Bingaman, Kennedy, and Boxer, \nbelieve that further reduction of this to 30 days makes more sense.\n  The high-performance computers we are talking about have a 3-month \ninnovation cycle. Therefore, if 60 days are taken up in Congress, on \ntop of the turnaround time for new regulations at the administration, \nthe innovation cycle is long overdue.\n\n  There is no precedent for such a long review period. Even the sales \nof items on the munitions such as tanks, rockets, and high-performance \naircraft only require a 30-day review period. The reality of the \nsituation is that by limiting American companies to this degree we are \nnot only losing short-term market share, but we are allowing foreign \ncompanies to make more money and, in turn, create better products in \nthe future. This could lead to the eventual loss of our Nation's lead \nin computer technology, which has propelled the United States to the \ngood economic standing we see today.\n  This amendment is critical to our Nation's economy and the success of \nour high-tech industry.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2883\n\n (Purpose: To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     year 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance \n                               computers)\n\n  Mr. REID.

I recognize the leader has said there will be no votes on \nthis bill today; therefore, I will ask for the yeas and nays at such \ntime as the leadership determines it is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in the absence of Chairman Gramm and \nChairman Enzi, in order to expedite consideration of this very \nimportant legislation, I will go forward with a brief discussion and my \nview of the Export Administration legislation.\n  I rise today in support of the Export Administration Act. I have \nworked closely on export control issues with Senators Enzi, Gramm, and \nSarbanes, and I am pleased that we have reached consideration of this \nimportant issue by the full Senate. There are several different \nclassifications of exports. Items which can have both civilian and \nmilitary applications are considered to be dual-use technology, and \nthose goods are governed by the EAA.\n  There have been numerous attempts to reauthorize the EAA in the years \nsince it expired in 1990. It is unfortunate that this legislation has \ngone unauthorized for most of this decade, and I strongly urge the \nCongress to not forgo this opportunity. Reauthorization becomes even \nmore critical as legal challenges to the continued reliance on the \nexpired EAA through emergency powers winds its way through the courts. \nAfter ten years of congressional silence, I am fearful that one of \nthese challenges will ultimately succeed, leaving us without any \ncontrol over sensitive dual use technologies. At that point, even \ntechnology which is universally agreed to be dangerous could be freely \nexported to countries considered to be direct threats to the United \nStates. Reauthorization of the EAA in of itself adds a tremendous \ncomponent to our national security.\n  I want to especially thank Chairman Enzi for his work on this issue. \nWithout his hands-on leadership, we frankly would not be at this point \ntoday. S. 1712 is a testament to Mike's hard work and the widespread \nsupport this bill enjoys derives from Chairman Enzi's commonsense \napproach to issues.\n  I want to note the important roles played by Banking Committee \nChairman Gramm and Ranking Member Sarbanes of Maryland. We have had \nconstructive participation across the board, and that bipartisan \ncooperation has brought us to this point. That spirit contributed to \nthe unanimous 20-0 vote in support of S. 1712 in the Banking Committee.\n  We had a simple goal when we embarked on this effort: reduce or \neliminate controls on items that do not have security implications and \ntighten controls on items that raise security concerns. While most \neveryone can agree on these principles, it is much more difficult to \ndraft the language to accomplish that end.\n  We worked very closely with concerned Senators, the national security \nestablishment, the administration, and the impacted industries. I \nbelieve we addressed the major concerns of each entity. We increased \nthe penalties, making violators of export control laws pay a real \nprice. We made the foreign availability and mass market standards a \ntrue measure of what items could be accessed regardless of U.S. \nsanctions, and provided for those items to be decontrolled.\n  S. 1712 strengthens our national security. For the first time, the \nDepartment of Defense will have unilateral appeal rights if it \ndisagrees with an approved export. Penalties move from $10,000 per \nviolation to up to $1 million per violation.\n  At one of our eight hearings on this bill, we heard from \nRepresentatives Cox and Dicks on the Cox Report relative to exports to \nthe People's Republic of China. We directly incorporate fifteen of the \nCox Report recommendations in our bill to enhance national security. I \nmight add that reauthorization of the EAA is one of the specific \nrecommendations from the Cox Report.\n  America benefits when our businesses prosper. Exporting technology \nhas long been an American success story. The technology field will lead \nour economy into the next century. But, new technologies could prove \ndangerous in the wrong hands, and our national security depends in part \non limiting access to certain technologies. That is the balance we seek \nto strike, and I believe S. 1712 does that.\n  I look forward to a vigorous debate of these important issues. \nPassage of this EAA bill will make a significant contribution to our \nnational security and will help bring transparency to our export \ncontrol system. I encourage my colleagues to join this bipartisan, \nbalanced approach to these critical issues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1272-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1272-S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE AMERICAN ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is about to engage in a debate \nabout our Nation's budget for the next fiscal year which begins in \nOctober. When one tries to measure the values of politicians and \npolitical parties, the first place to look is how they spend money. \nSpeeches are one thing, but the way we spend our money really explains \nwho we are and what we value.\n  There is a real difference of opinion now between Democrats and \nRepublicans about how we are going to spend our money in the next \nbudget. On the\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\nDemocratic side, we happen to believe we have a strong story to tell \nthe American people about the progress that has been made in America \nunder the Clinton-Gore administration for the last 7 years. In fact, a \nmonth or so ago, we completed the longest economic expansion in the \nhistory of the United States of America.\n  It is every political party's dream to be able to stand in this \nChamber and say what I just said. Under the leadership of President \nClinton and Vice President Gore, America is moving in the right \ndirection. We are creating more jobs, and we are solving problems that \npeople thought were intractable and insolvable not that long ago.\n  Take a look at the record from 1993 to the year 2000. We turned a \nrecord deficit of $290 billion in 1992 into a surplus of $176 billion \nin the year 2000. We have seen a paydown in our national debt. We have \nhad 107 consecutive months of economic growth, and many new jobs and \nnew houses and new businesses have been created.\n  Take a look at what they said was going to happen. These are the \nexperts who tell us what we can expect. They said in 1993 that we were \ngoing to have a debt increase. They projected it at $761 billion over \nthe last 2 years. In other words, more red ink, more need for us to \nborrow money and pay interest on it.\n  What happened instead under the leadership of this President? We \nended up with a surplus. We actually paid down the debt of this country \nby $140 billion.\n  There are a lot of young people who come to Washington, DC, to visit \nthis Capitol and to see their Government in action. I say to these \nyoung people, the best thing we can do for you is to continue on this \ncourse. Once this debt starts to go away, the need to pay interest on \nit goes away as well.\n  We collect $1 billion a day in taxes from families and individuals \nand businesses just to pay interest on old debt. We are moving in the \nright direction. America should not change course. We must keep \nexpanding this economy and creating opportunity.\n  Take a look at what has happened between the end of 1992 and 1999. \nMore Americans owned homes. This is the American dream, and the dream \nhas gotten better for millions of Americans because the economy is \nstrong and interest rates are under control and inflation is in check.\n  Take a look, as well, at the incomes of Americans across many groups. \nThose at the lowest income level all the way to those at the highest \nincome level have seen a steady increase in inflation-adjusted income \nduring the period of the Clinton-Gore Presidency. More people are \nbuying homes, and income levels are going up for virtually every group \nacross America.\n  Take a look at the tax burden, too, because many people on the \nRepublican side will say taxes have gone up. They have not. Take a look \nat the median income for a four-person family and the percent of taxes \nthey are paying: 16.8 percent in 1992, 15.1 percent in 1999. The tax \nburden for the typical family in America has gone down.\n\n  Of course, it is good news when it comes to employment. We have the \nlowest unemployment rate in 30 years: 7.5 percent when the President \ncame to office, now down to 4.2 percent.\n  The problem most American businesses tell me about when I visit them \nis: We need to find skilled workers; we have job opportunities; we need \nthe workers to fill them.\n  Now what are we going to do? We are going to debate a budget \nresolution in the Senate and the House where the Republicans will come \nforward and say we need to change all this; we need to try a different \napproach; things are not working as well as they could.\n  I think we ought to let history be our guide, and it is suggesting to \nus that we are on the right path, we are in the right direction, and we \ndo not want to change course and go out on a risky venture.\n  The real question now is whether the Republican leadership in the \nSenate will come forward with a budget that has a tax cut proposed by \ntheir likely candidate for President, George W. Bush from Texas. It is \na substantial tax cut and one, from my point of view, which goes too \nfar and threatens the viability of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Take a look at what the tax cut means. The Bush tax cut which was \nproposed during the course of his campaign--and I am sure it will be \nthe centerpiece of his campaign from this point forward--says that if \nyou happen to be in the top 1 percent of American earners with an \nincome above $300,000 a year, your cut is $50,000 each year. Not bad. \nIn the 60-percent range, with income below $39,000, the George W. Bush \ntax cut is worth about $29 a month.\n  Does it make sense that we would jeopardize the growth of our \neconomy, keeping our debt under control, paying it down, creating jobs, \nnew businesses, and home ownership to give a tax cut of $50,000 a year \nto the richest people in America? The Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Alan Greenspan, said: Don't do it; it doesn't make sense; it is \nrisky; it is dangerous.\n  I hope we do not. But the Senate and House Republicans will present \ntheir budget, and they will tell us whether they stand behind Governor \nGeorge W. Bush and their tax cut proposal or they want to stand behind \nthe plan that has brought the economic prosperity we enjoy today.\n  The President has come forward with a responsible budget. It pays \ndown our national debt, it creates targeted tax cuts, and if we are \ngoing to take some of our surplus and give it to American families, it \nprovides we do it for things they need: A $3,000 long-term care tax \ncredit for the fastest growing group of Americans, those over the age \nof 85, to help the sons and daughters of those who are in older age \nsituations to pay for their long-term care; expanded educational \nopportunity--we need a new college opportunity tax cut. This is going \nto help people across the board, regardless of income; A deduction of \ncollege expenses so that young people can go to school, improve their \nskills, and add to our economy and their lives.\n  Marriage penalty relief is something I think should be done on a \nbipartisan basis. The President proposes it; money for new accounts, \nretirement, and expanding the earned income tax credit.\n\n  This is the bottom line: In a matter of a few hours, the Senate \nBudget Committee, under the leadership of Senator Domenici, will come \nforward with a budget, and we will be able to see for the first time \nwhether or not the Republicans on Capitol Hill support George W. Bush's \ncall for a tax cut, a tax cut that has been branded unwise by Chairman \nGreenspan and one that, by any modest projection, is going to invade \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  It will be a test to see what the real issue of this campaign will \nbe: Whether the congressional Republicans back Mr. Bush's idea and want \nto venture out on some risky and perhaps dangerous venture that could \njeopardize the growth in our economy or they want to stay the course on \na responsible, fiscally disciplined approach that has come forward in \nthe last 7 years.\n  The American people are going to have a clear choice. If every \nelection is a pocketbook election, we on the Democratic side welcome \nit. America's pocketbooks are better now than they were 7 years ago. We \nbelieve Americans want to continue this progress and move forward, \naddressing those people in America who have not benefited from this \neconomic expansion, addressing serious challenges such as expanding \neducation and health care, and doing it in a fiscally sensible way so \nthat at the bottom line, on the last day, in the final chapter, we can \nsay to the next generation of Americans: We paid down this debt, we \ngave you a strong America moving forward, and now it is your chance to \ntake over.\n  That is the best thing we can do, and we do not want to jeopardize \nthat by giving tax cuts to wealthy people, spending money we do not \nhave, and ignoring the reality of the progress we have made over the \nlast 7 years.\n  I can recall when President Clinton came forward with his budget \nproposal in 1993 that started us on this path of economic expansion.\n  We could not get a single Republican vote to support it--not one in \nthe House or the Senate. In fact, Vice President Gore cast the deciding \nvote for the President's budget plan. Not a single Republican Senator \nwould support it. Thank goodness the Vice President was there to do it.\n  When he cast that vote, we not only won on that issue, the American \npeople won. We embarked on a course which has really given America a \ngreat opportunity. This is an optimistic and forward-looking Nation \nnow.\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\n  This Presidential campaign, and all of those who are candidates in \ncongressional elections, will now put to the test the question as to \nwhether or not we are going to continue this course of moving forward \nwith the progress in our economy.\n  To the naysayers who claim to have a better idea, I suggest that \nhistorically there has never been a period of greater economic \nexpansion in this country. We want it to continue. We will see this \nRepublican budget tomorrow and find out whether the leaders, the \ncongressional leaders on Capitol Hill, want to continue this course \nthat really moves America forward or if they want some risky new \nventure that includes the Bush tax cut.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the high \ngasoline prices that every one of our constituents is finding at the \ngas pump today and about the rise in home heating oil prices my friends \nfrom Maine and Vermont were talking about that are hurting their States \nso much.\n  In fact, I commend Senator Murkowski for holding a hearing today in \nthe Energy Committee to talk about this issue and what we can do to \naddress it. I was slated to be one of the people testifying at the \nhearing, but because I was visiting with education leaders from my \nState, I could not be there and missed the hearing.\n  I want to speak on this issue because this is a crisis coming down \nthe road. For the people in Maine and Vermont, it is here already. But \nfor our constituents who are going to try to take vacations this \nsummer, it is going to hit them right between the eyes because gasoline \nprices at the pump are going up, and I see no relief in sight.\n  The common refrain today is, the United States has no energy policy. \nThat is not really accurate. The United States does have an energy \npolicy, and it is the wrong one. Our policy is to restrict domestic \nexploration, and in those areas where exploration is permitted, there \nare punitive taxes and regulations on producers.\n  The result is that at periods of low prices, such as we had last \nyear--prices on which a small producer cannot break even--those \nproducers leave the business and they do not come back.\n  The fact is, when it comes to our most precious commodity, we do not \ncontrol our own destiny. We are seeing our Energy Secretary going hat \nin hand to foreign countries and saying: Please, produce more oil.\n  Worse, we had plenty of opportunity to address this crisis. It did \nnot just happen in a vacuum. In 1998 and 1999, crude oil prices hit \ntheir lowest point in decades: $9 a barrel, $8 a barrel. Hundreds of \nthousands of small wells shut down, and thousands of jobs were lost. Of \ncourse, it made us more vulnerable because we lost the production. We \nhave ignored this cycle since the oil price shock of the 1970s. Our \ndependence on oil from foreign countries is now at 55 percent.\n  Energy-producing and energy-consuming States share two interests: \nMaintaining a large and reliable source of energy in our own country, \nand reducing volatility in oil and gas prices.\n  Unfortunately, the measures proposed by this administration to \naddress the current crisis in home heating oil will not address either \nof these priorities. There is talk about increased funding for the \nEnergy Department Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps \nhomeowners make their homes more efficient. Others support an increase \nin the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to provide \nheating assistance to low-income families. We are discussing a \ntemporary adjustment of EPA sulfur content limits in home heating oil. \nI have seen requests for additional appropriations for the Coast Guard \nicebreaking efforts in waterways. We are even considering getting the \nFederal Government into the price-fixing business by releasing oil from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  These are stopgap measures. But the most important thing is, if we \nenacted all of them, it would not solve the problem. We need a policy \nthat encourages domestic production that is sustainable when prices go \nbelow break even.\n  While the problem is fairly localized now, we are going to see long \ngas lines this summer or we are going to see people not taking their \nsummer vacations.\n  Instead, we need the quick fixes--we need to address some of those \nareas that need fixing right now for low-income families--and we need \nan energy policy that goes along with it that will sustain domestic \nproduction through the busts we have seen in the last 2 years. We need \nprice stability.\n  The first step toward breaking that cycle is a simple one: \nUnderstanding that cold Vermont households and out-of-work Texas \nwildcatters are two sides of the same coin--our overdependence on \nforeign energy sources.\n  At the heart of our growing dependence on overseas sources has been \nthe steady decline in the number of small producers. Wildcatters--small \nproducers--once drilled more than 9,000 wells a year. Last year, there \nwere 778. You wonder why we have an oil shortage? Many of these wells \nare so small that once they close, they cannot be reopened; it is not \nfinancially sound to do so.\n  What are we talking about? What is a wildcatter? A wildcatter is a \nperson who has a well that produces 15 barrels or fewer a day. There \nwere close to 500,000 such wells across the United States. Together, \nthose wells, at just 15 barrels a day, have the capacity to produce 20 \npercent of America's energy needs. This is roughly the same amount of \noil that is imported from Saudi Arabia. During last year's oil price \nplummet, more than one-fourth of these small wells closed, most of them \nfor good. We have it within our capacity, in our country, to produce \nthat 20 percent of the oil that is consumed here, which is the same \namount we are importing from Saudi Arabia.\n\n  The overwhelming majority of producing wells in Texas are these \nmarginal wells. In fact, marginal wells account for 75 percent of all \ncrude production for small independent operators, up to 50 percent for \nmidsized independents and 20 percent for large companies. So even the \nmajor companies can make a go of it with the small wells if we do not \nsaddle them with so many costs that it is not financially feasible.\n  A more sensible energy policy would be to offer tax relief to \nproducers of these smaller wells; that would help them stay in business \neven when prices fall below break even.\n  For 2 years I have been working with my great cosponsors--Senators \nDomenici, Nickles, Breaux, and Landrieu--on legislation that would \nprovide incentives to these small producers. When they can stay in \nbusiness during these low prices, supply will go up and we will not see \nthat supply shortage causing high price spikes.\n  I think our legislation provides a quite reasonable tax credit: A $3-\na-barrel tax credit for only the first three barrels of daily \nproduction in one of these small wells. We offer similar credits for \nsmall gas wells.\n  The marginal oil well credit would be phased out when prices of oil \nand natural gas actually go up. For oil, it would phase out at $14 to \n$17 a barrel. We are not talking about having tax credits today when we \nare paying $30 a barrel for oil; we are talking about tax credits when \nthe price falls below break even. At 14 to 17 barrels a day, a small \nproducer can make it. So when the price goes up, the tax credit goes \nout. The tax credit is only for the first three barrels in a well. A \ncountercyclical system such as this would keep these producers alive \nduring these record-low prices. They are not grabbing when the price is \n$20 a barrel; they are trying to stay in business and keep those jobs \nwhen the price goes below break even.\n\n  There is another benefit to encouraging marginal well production. It \nhas a multiplier effect. In 1997, these low-volume wells generated $314 \nmillion in taxes paid to State governments. These revenues were used \nfor State and local schools, highways, and other State-funded projects.\n  Another part of our plan is to offer incentives to restart inactive \nwells by\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\noffering producers a tax exemption for the cost of doing so. So going \nin and trying to reopen a well that has been capped, which is very \nexpensive, could be done with a tax exemption for the expenses of doing \nit, and that would ensure greater oil availability and increase Federal \nand State tax revenues. Everyone would win--more jobs, more tax revenue \nfor our States, and, most importantly, more domestic oil.\n  Actual results have shown that this can work. In my home State of \nTexas, a program similar to this has met with huge success. Over 6,000 \nwells have been returned to production, with State tax abatements \ninjecting $1.6 billion into the Texas economy in a year. Think what we \ncould do nationwide.\n  A recent study by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission \nexamined State incentive programs and found that the average program \nattracts $1.1 billion in investment over its lifetime, with over $50 \nmillion in net tax collections typically associated with each \nincentive. That incentive will create 6,000 jobs and $16 billion in \nimpact for the States.\n  There is more to do. We should look for ways to reduce the cost of \nexcessive regulation on our domestic producers. This was what the fight \nwe had last year over MMS royalty valuation was about. Some said it was \na giveaway to big oil. It wasn't. It was about keeping costs low so we \ndon't push more producers out of business. Maybe those paying record \nprices for home heating oil and gas today have a different perspective \non that issue now. The MMS is going to release its new oil royalty \nvaluations tomorrow, and I challenge everyone to see if they raise the \nprice of drilling for oil on public lands. If they do, the President is \njust saying, yes, we are going to continue that policy to try to keep \ndomestic production down so we can be held by the throat by OPEC \ncountries.\n  The overlapping regulations that govern exploration and production \nand refinement add $4 to $5 a barrel to the cost of oil. Compare that \nwith the overall cost of production in Saudi Arabia, including capital \nand labor, of $2 to $3 a barrel. Is it any wonder that oil companies \nare drilling in Saudi Arabia instead of in our country, providing jobs \nfor our citizens?\n  Our fight last year on MMS was over the opposition to adding yet \nanother complicated scheme of rules and further raising the cost of \nproduction. When gas prices were low, few Senators were listening. In \nfact, the major television networks weren't listening either. They were \npretty brutal during that debate. Today we are seeing the results of \nthat brutality.\n  We don't have to be at the whim of market forces. We don't have to be \nout of control of our own domestic oil production. What we need is to \nbe part of the price setting, not the price taking. We must increase \nour domestic oil supply.\n\n  This is something we can all rally around. I will work with the \nNortheastern Senators to get quick fixes to their problems. I will work \nwith all of the Senators whose constituents are going to be affected by \nhigh gasoline prices. But let us not do a quick fix without also having \na longer term fix that would keep our jobs in America, that would keep \nour oil prices stable, that would keep the revenue coming into our \nStates for schools and highways at a time when prices go below break \neven. We can have a win for everyone, if we can pass legislation that \nwill provide help for everybody and provide a stable oil supply for our \ncountry. We have the opportunity to create a domestic policy for oil \nand gas in this country that makes sense and will benefit all of our \nconstituents. Let us take that chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I, first of \nall, state how appreciative I am of the work done by Senator Johnson \nand Senator Gramm, the chairman of the Banking Committee. I feel badly \nthat we are not going to be able to go forward on this legislation.\n  We are going to agree to the unanimous consent request, but not \nbecause this bill shouldn't be considered. We should be legislating on \nit today. It is important legislation. It is being held up on the other \nside of the aisle. This is legislation that the high-tech industry \nfeels confident should be passed.\n  I simply say that the cold war is over, but the high-tech war is just \nbeginning. We need to be the winners of that war.\n  The minority is reluctantly agreeing to this unanimous consent \nrequest. We hope the rest of the day and tomorrow can be used in a \nconstructive fashion. We hope the chairman of the Banking Committee can \nuse his experience--he certainly has experience; he proved that when he \nwas in the House of Representatives, and here--to be able to get the \nwarring parties together and move this legislation forward.\n  We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me give a word of explanation. First of \nall, let me make it clear that it is my intention as a person who has \nconcurrence in this decision not to bring the bill back up through this \nprocedure, nor will I support it being done unless there is an \nagreement among the parties. Obviously, I would have a right to file \ncloture on the motion to proceed at some point.\n  Let me explain what has happened. We have for the last 3 weeks been \ntrying to work out concerns about a very tough, very important, and \nvery complicated bill. America has two competing interests. On the one \nhand, we want to produce and export items that embody high technology \nbecause that is the fastest growing industry in the world. We are the \nworld leader in the high-tech industry, and it creates the best paying \njobs in America.\n  We have that as one objective. On the other hand, we want to prevent \ntechnology that has defense and security implications from falling into \nthe hands of those who might use that technology against the United \nStates of America and our interests. Between these two interests, there \nis competition and friction. These are very complicated and very tough \nissues.\n  In the last 3 weeks, roughly half a dozen Members of the Senate have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nworking to bring to the floor and pass a bill that passed the Banking \nCommittee 20-0 and that would do something we have not done since 1990: \nto set in place a new permanent law to protect America's access to the \nhigh-tech world market and at the same time protect our national \nsecurity.\n  We thought yesterday that we had reached an agreement in principle \nthat would allow us to bring the bill to the floor. The problem with \nreaching agreements in principle is that, as one of my famous \nconstituents once said, the devil is in the details. We found ourselves \ntoday thinking we had such an agreement but having great difficulty \ngetting the language to comport to what each individual felt the \nprinciple to be. Under those circumstances, I thought good faith \nrequired that the bill be pulled down. So we pulled the bill down, and \nit will not come up under this consent agreement unless an agreement is \nworked out among the parties that were engaged in this negotiation.\n  I think we all agree that no one acted in bad faith, but what \nhappened was, on a very complicated and very important matter, agreeing \nin principle is not agreeing to the details.\n  We are hopeful that in the next few days we might still work out \nthese details. If we do, then we will go to this unanimous consent \nagreement and bring the bill back up. If we don't work out those \ndifferences, we will not.\n  Before I yield the floor, because I know the distinguished Senator of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee wants to take the floor, I will make a \ngeneral point.\n  We started dealing in export control in 1917 with the Trading With \nthe Enemy Act. We then had the Neutrality Act in 1935, and, with the \nbeginning of the cold war, the Export Control Act became law in 1949. \nWe were in a life and death struggle with the Soviet Union. There was \nan ``evil empire.'' There was a cold war. We won the cold war, and \nexport control on a multilateral basis played a key role in that \nvictory.\n  In those days, two things existed which no longer exist. One was that \nthe United States had a virtual monopoly in high technology. Indeed, we \nwere the world's undisputed leader in technology. Virtually, every area \nin the world had been decimated by World War II, and we stood supreme. \nSo technology was an American monopoly.\n  Second, in 1949, most of the new technology was driven by defense \nresearch. Our legitimate concern, life and death struggle concern, was \nthat this defense research embodied in American industry would end up \nleaking abroad where it could threaten American national security.\n\n  By 1990, our consensus had started to fade on the Export \nAdministration Act, and while for two brief periods--from March 1993 \nthrough June 1994, and from July 1994 to August 1994--we had temporary \nsolutions, since 1990 we have had no permanent law to protect American \nnational security.\n  Today, the world is very different. We have won the cold war. Today, \ntechnology is driven by private industry. Today, it is not defense labs \nthat are generating the new technology that drives American business, \nit is American industry.\n  We had set out in our export law the number of MTOPS, millions of \ntheoretical operations per second, that a restricted computer could \nemploy, thinking we were protecting what we then called supercomputers. \nNow, any schoolchild with a computer has the technical capacity, or can \nget it, and exceed that limit. The number of MTOPS is doubling every 6 \nmonths.\n  So we were faced with a decisive question: Can we pass a law and \ncontrol this technology? We could pass a law and stop it in the United \nStates, but it would occur elsewhere in the world.\n  What we ultimately have to decide is: Is our security tied to our \nbeing the leader in technology, or is it tied to our ability to hold on \nto the technology we have and not share it with anybody?\n  I believe in the end that American security is tied to our leadership \nin technology. I believe that we have put together a good bill. There \nis a debate about the details, and there are legitimate differences. As \nThomas Jefferson once said: Good men with the same facts are prone to \ndisagree. I have seen nothing in my political career or personal life \nto convince me that Jefferson was wrong about much of anything, but he \nwas certainly not wrong about this.\n  We have put together a bill that we believe meets national security \nconcerns. But trying to deal with concerns about Presidential powers \nand waivers is extremely complicated. Yesterday we reached an agreement \nin principle. There was the nucleus of the agreement, but getting to \nthe details this morning proved more difficult than we anticipated. To \nbe absolutely certain that everyone's rights are preserved, and to be \ncertain we are dealing in good faith, I concluded--and all of the \nmembers of the negotiation agreed--that the bill should be pulled down. \nAs a result, I pulled it down.\n  I am hopeful that perhaps as early as tomorrow these differences can \nbe worked out. I don't know whether they can or they can't. I believe \nAmerica would be richer, freer, happier, and more secure if they could. \nIf they are not worked out, it won't be because I didn't make the \neffort. I want it to be worked out. I hope it can be. Whether it can be \nor it can't be, I want to be certain that we are dealing in good faith \nand that we are dealing with each other on that basis.\n  I think we have preserved that here today. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' help. Someone could have done mischief by objecting; my \npreference was to go back to the status quo, but we couldn't do that. \nWe have achieved the same result with this agreement, and I thank my \ncolleagues for agreeing to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1276-S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE RADICAL AGENDA OF CEDAW\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, earlier this morning I was thinking about \n20 years ago when a delightful young lady Senator from Kansas served in \nthis body, Nancy Kassebaum. She was a lady in every respect, and I miss \nher to this good day.\n  I was thinking about Nancy because today is International Women's \nDay. The radical feminists are at it again. They have chosen once again \nto press their case for Senate ratification of the United Nations \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen, and that has the acronym of CEDAW.\n  Let's examine this treaty which women organizations--including some \nof the more liberal women in Congress--are so eager to have approved by \nthe Congress and reported out, first of all, by the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, on which I am chairman. They put out a press release \nyesterday that they were going to picket me. I guess they were going to \nscream and holler at me as they tried to do not long ago, which suits \nme all right because I have been screamed and hollered at before by the \nsame crowd.\n  ``This urgently needed'' treaty, as they describe it, has been \ncollecting dust in the Senate archives for 20 years. It was submitted \nby President Carter to the Senate in 1980. In these years since \nPresident Carter sent it to the Senate, the Democratic Party controlled \nthe Senate for 10 of those years and the Democrats never brought it up \nfor a vote.\n  Indeed, in the first 2 years of the Clinton administration, when the \nDemocrats controlled not only the Senate but the White House, the \nDemocrats never saw fit to bring this radical treaty up for a vote. \nThey were silent in seven languages about it.\n  Now, suddenly, 20 years later, they demand to be given urgent \npriority in the recommendation of this treaty, and that it be \nconsidered first by the Foreign Relations Committee and then by the \nSenate.\n  I say dream on because it is not going to happen. Why has CEDAW, the \nConvention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \nnever been ratified? Because it is a bad treaty; it is a terrible \ntreaty negotiated by radical feminists with the intent of enshrining \ntheir radical antifamily agenda into international law. I will have no \npart of that.\n  Let me give a few examples of the world in which the authors and \nproponents of this treaty would have all live. Under this treaty, a \n``committee on the elimination of discrimination against women is \nestablished with the\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\ntask of enforcing compliance with the treaty.''\n  Mr. President, how about a few excerpts from the reports that the \ncommittee has issued? They provide a telling insight into the hearts \nand minds of the authors who wrote this treaty in the first place.\n  What do they propose? They propose global legalization of abortion. \nThe treaty has been intended, from the very beginning, to be a vehicle \nfor imposing abortion on countries that still protect the rights of the \nunborn. For example, this committee has instructed Ireland a country \nthat restricts abortion, to ``facilitate a national dialogue on * * * \nthe restrictive abortion laws'' of Ireland and has declared in another \nreport that under the CEDAW treaty ``it is discriminatory for a \n[government] to refuse to legally provide for the performance of \ncertain reproductive health services for women''--that is to say, \nabortion.\n  Another issue: Legalization of prostitution. In another report issued \nin February of, 1999, the CEDAW committee declared:\n\n       The committee recommends the decriminalization of \n     prostitution.\n\n  They even called for the abolishment of Mother's Day. The CEDAW crowd \nhas come out against Mother's Day--yes, Mother's Day. Earlier this \nyear, the committee solemnly declared to Belarus its ``concern [over] \nthe continuing prevalence of * * * such [stereotypical] symbols as a \nMother's Day'' and lectured Armenia on the need to ``combat the \ntraditional stereotype of women in `the noble role of mother.' ''\n  There are not enough kids in day care, they claim.\n  The committee informed Slovenia that too many Slovenian mothers were \nstaying home to raise their children. What a bad thing for mothers to \ndo--think of it--staying home with their children. This committee \nwarned that because only 30 percent of children were in day-care \ncenters, the other 70 percent were in grave danger of, now get this, \n``miss[ing] out on educational and social opportunities offered in \nformal day-care institutions.''\n  Another thing, mandating women in combat. Boy, they are hot to trot \non that. In a 1997 report, the CEDAW committee mandated that all \ncountries adopting the treaty must ensure the ``full participation'' of \nwomen in the military, meaning that nations would be required to send \nwomen into combat even if the military chiefs decided that it was not \nin the national security interest of, for example, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This is the world that the advocates of this CEDAW treaty want to \nimpose on America. That is why they are picketing my office right now, \ndemanding the Senate Foreign Relations Committee consider this treaty \nand report it out to the Senate for approval.\n  I say to these women who are picketing my office: Dream on. If its \nauthors and implementers had their way, the United States, as a \nsignatory to this treaty, would have to legalize prostitution, legalize \nabortion, eliminate what CEDAW regards as the preferable environment of \ninstitutional day care instead of children staying at home.\n  This treaty is not about opportunities for women. It is about \ndenigrating motherhood and undermining the family. The treaty is \ndesigned to impose, by international fiat, a radical definition of \n``discrimination against women'' that goes far beyond the protections \nalready enshrined in the laws of the United States of America. That is \nwhy this treaty was publicly opposed in years past by, as I said \nearlier, Nancy Kassebaum and many others, who felt as I did then, and \nstill do, that creating yet another set of unenforceable international \nstandards would dilute, not strengthen, the human rights standards of \nwomen around the world.\n  We need only to look at the conditions of women living in countries \nthat have ratified this treaty, countries such as Iran and Libya, to \nunderstand that Nancy Kassebaum was right in her opposition to the \nTreaty on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. \nThe fact is, the United States has led the world in advancing \nopportunities for women during the 20 years this treaty has been \ncollecting dust in the Senate's archives. I suspect that America will \ncontinue to lead the way, while the CEDAW crowd and the treaty sits in \nthe dustbin for a few more decades to come. If I have anything to do \nwith it, that is precisely where it is going to remain.\n  I do not intend to be pushed around by discourteous, demanding women \nno matter how loud they shout or how much they are willing to violate \nevery trace of civility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi very much. I do \nwish to make a couple of comments in response to the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, the Senator from Texas.\n  First of all, I appreciate his taking the bill down and giving us an \nopportunity for further discussions and negotiations. Apparently, there \nare still some items on which some Members are trying to come together. \nI must say, and have said to my friends, Senator Gramm and Senator \nEnzi, that my concern goes deeper than some of the details we are \nworking on right now. Unless some very substantial changes can be made, \nwhich I do not anticipate, I could not support the bill. I will not be \nthe one standing in the way of proceeding on the bill, but I reserve \nall my rights as we proceed and discuss it. It does need full \ndiscussion. It is a very serious matter. I am afraid it has not yet \ngotten the attention it deserves. We will have some amendments, \nhopefully, to improve the bill as we go along.\n  I agree with my friend from Texas that it is a different time. We are \nnot in the cold war anymore. No one can put the technological genie \nback in the bottle. But our export policies have quite adequately taken \nthat into consideration. In fact, many on this side of the aisle, \npeople around the country, have been quite critical of this \nadministration because of the liberality or the looseness of the export \ncontrols that we are operating under now, under Executive order. As we \nknow, we have not had a reauthorization of the Export Administration \nAct since 1994. We have been operating basically on Executive orders. I \npersonally feel the Executive orders we are operating under with regard \nto our export controls are too loose and need tightening.\n  We saw what happened with regard to the exporting of our satellite \ntechnology and the Hughes and Loral situation that is under \ninvestigation by the Justice Department right now, where we got the \nChinese to send our satellites up in orbit but apparently in the \nprocess gave the Chinese some very sophisticated technology that would \nassist them with regard to their missile program. So Congress reacted \nto that.\n  The Commerce Department had, previous to that, transferred the \njurisdiction of satellites from the State Department to Commerce. It \nwas all under Commerce. We took a look at that and said that does not \nbelong in Commerce. Commerce has a legitimate concern about trade and \nexports for sure, but that is not the only concern. When you are \nexporting materials that have national security significance, so-called \ndual-use items that might be militarily significant to countries that \nyou do not want to be helping, then the State Department needs to be \nconcerned, too. So Congress insisted that jurisdiction be brought out \nfrom Commerce and given back to the State Department.\n  We have also seen what the administration has done with regard to \nhigh-performance computers. They reassess the situation every 6 months. \nThey are increasing the MTOPS level for the export of high-performance \ncomputers to\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\ncountries such as China and other third-tier countries at a very brisk \nrate. The MTOPS level has gone from 2,000 in 1996 to 12,500 for \nmilitary, as we speak. The anticipation is that the MTOPS level will \ncontinue on apace very significantly.\n  Now we have an amendment this morning, as I understand it, that would \ncause that review to happen not only every 6 months but every 30 days. \nThe Department of Commerce would be looking at our high-performance \ncomputers and whether or not we ought to reassess sending more \ncomputers, something that we have had the dominant position on \nthroughout the world, something the Chinese, until recently, had no \nindigenous capability of developing. We continue to supply them. We \ntake into consideration things such as the abilities of foreign \ncountries.\n  My point is, the Department of Commerce is hardly being guarded as \nthey establish their policies of exports as far as high-speed computers \nare concerned. Many people, including myself, are concerned that they \ngo too far and too fast because we do not know what the Chinese, for \nexample, are really doing with them. We are told they have clustered \ntogether computers of lower MTOPS levels and have come up with \nsomething much, much more significant than what, perhaps, we think they \nhave.\n  We were told by the Cox commission that the Chinese are using our \nhigh-performance computers for their simulations for their nuclear \nprogram. We were told that they use our high-performance computers to \nassist them in their biological and cryptology programs.\n  The cold war is over, and the last time we reauthorized this act, \nJimmy Carter was in the White House. Indeed, the cold war has come and \ngone, but we have new challenges on the horizon. We do not have the old \nSoviet Union anymore, but we do have the Chinese who, the Rumsfeld \ncommission tells us and the Cox commission in great detail explains to \nus, are very aggressively attempting to get their hands on our \ntechnology.\n  We know about the situation in Los Alamos. We know about their \nendeavors, as far as their commercial enterprises around the country. \nThey tell us, in addition to that, they are feeding off our technology \nthat we are exporting to them to use in the most troublesome manner, as \nthey continue to be one of the world's greatest proliferators of \nweapons of mass destruction. It is not just what they are doing in \nChina, but it is what they are doing around the world.\n  We have every reason to be extremely concerned about our export \npolicies in light of these developments. We were warned by the Rumsfeld \ncommission that we are facing a threat such as we have never faced \nbefore in this Nation with regard to these rogue nations and their \nincreasing capabilities. We were warned by the Deutch commission. We \nwere warned by the Cox commission. We were warned by at least two \nrecent national security estimates in terms of the capabilities of \nthese rogue nations. They all say they are getting much of their stuff \nfrom the Russians and the Chinese.\n  This is the backdrop against which we are considering reauthorization \nof the Export Administration Act. My concern is not that we are \nreauthorizing and taking a look at it, it is that we are looking at it \ntotally from the wrong direction. We should be looking at ways of \ngetting more training for our people who are serving as export \nlicensers. We need to do more on end users. We do not know when we send \na high-speed computer or high-performance computer to China what \nhappens to it.\n  Up until 1998, the Chinese would not even let us check on end users. \nOut of 600-some computers we have sent over there, we have had one end \nuser check.\n  According to the Cox commission, in 1998, we got an agreement with \nthe Chinese to check with the end users, but the administration will \nnot release that agreement. The Cox commission says they have seen it--\nthey cannot release it--but it is totally inadequate. This is the \nbackdrop against which we are considering reauthorizing the Export \nAdministration Act.\n  What do we do with this bill, S. 1712? The bill does some good \nthings, I think. There are some provisions in it that move in the right \ndirection, but they are fairly minimal. In many important respects, it, \nfirst of all, further incorporates into law things this administration \nhas been doing by Executive order and then creates new legal \ncategories, all of which liberalize or loosen export controls.\n  It creates a category with regard to foreign availability. Foreign \navailability is taken into consideration now by the Department of \nCommerce in making its decisions as it increases these end-top levels. \nThey take that into consideration. What this bill will do is put it \ninto law and set up a technical group within the Department of Commerce \nto make a determination if there is foreign availability, and, if so, \nlickety-split, it does not matter what the end-top level is at Commerce \nwhen that happens, it goes out the door.\n\n  We have seen from hearings in our committee that there is sometimes \ngreat disagreement as to whether or not there is foreign availability \nwith a certain item. It is not just strictly a green-eyeshade matter of \nphysics; it is something that ought to be considered very carefully and \nshould not be left up to the unilateral discretion of Commerce.\n  This bill gives Commerce more discretion than it has ever had before. \nWe have been very critical of the practices of the Department of \nCommerce in this administration in times past. I suggest we consider \nvery carefully whether or not we want to give even more authority to \nthe Department of Commerce as we move forward.\n  Another category is created out of whole cloth: mass marketing. That \nis not in common practice now; that is not in current Executive orders \nnow. It basically says if it is mass marketed in this country, even if \nit is not in another country, the assumption is they are eventually \ngoing to get it, so let's send it to them, taking into consideration \nthe advantage we might have of at least having a delay as we consider \nour policies in this Nation, such as the National Missile Defense \nProgram or things of that nature.\n  We are creating mass marketing. We are creating foreign availability. \nWe are creating embedded components: No matter if a component is \ncontrolled, if it is part of a larger component, and it is only so much \nof the value of that larger component, you look at the value and not \nthe inherent nature of the component itself. That is not right. We \nought to look at the component, and if it is controlled, it ought to \nremain controlled whether it is in a larger item or not. It is another \ncategory where we are taking additional items out of control.\n  Each of these things can be and, I assure you, will be debated in \nsome detail as to whether or not it is good policy, but I think there \ncan be no argument on two points: First, there is greater discretion in \nmany respects in the Department of Commerce and in the Secretary of \nCommerce. Second, this bill tips the scales in favor of more exports. \nThat is the reason we are doing it.\n  I personally have not heard any complaints--maybe there are \ncomplaints out there; I do not say there are not--from exporters who \nare not getting things through fast enough. Maybe we need more people. \nMaybe we need more folks handling the paperwork. Whatever. I do not \nargue that point.\n  I do not hear any hue and cry that we are not shipping dual-use \npossibly militarily significant items out fast enough. But one could \nlook at this bill and assume that is the underlying motivation, that we \nbelieve we need to loosen up the export controls a little bit.\n  It is an honest disagreement. My friends have worked very hard on \nthis. They have tried to be as accommodating as they know how, but we \napproach this from a fundamentally different vantage point.\n  I look forward to the discussion when we get on the bill. I thank the \nChair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as you can tell from the discussions that \nhave gone on today, this is not the simplest bill that has ever come \nbefore Congress. There are a lot of complexities. There are still, \nobviously, a lot of misunderstandings about what is in the bill.\n  There is increased money for enforcement, increased people for \nenforcement, a tie-down on how we check on end users. But I do not want \nto get into\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\nthose very stimulating, exciting details right now. I want to make some \nmore general comments so that my colleagues and other people who are \ninterested in this bill have some idea of why we are having the \ndifficulties we are having.\n  I am one of those people who agrees--and I think Senator Thompson \nagrees--that the system is broke. I thought we were going to have a \ndebate today on how Congress can fix it because Congress is quickly \nrealizing that we are sacrificing national security and impeding export \ngrowth at the same time. We have a chance to fix that problem with this \nbill or to let it remain broken for about 18 months, at a minimum.\n  If we do not debate this before the budget and appropriations bills \ncome up, which will be the agenda for the rest of this year, we will \nnot be able to debate it until the nominations of a new administration \nhave been completed and those people understand this difficult area.\n  In January of 1999, I became the chairman of the Banking Subcommittee \non International Trade and Finance. Shortly thereafter, this issue was \nthrust into prominence. It was disclosed that China had access to \nUnited States military secrets, and the congressional Cox commission \nemphasized the problem with the release of their classified report.\n  I also found out the Export Governing Act had expired in 1994. That \nwas the Export Administration Act of 1979. Our country was operating \nunder emergency Executive orders to keep any semblance of security at \nall.\n  I had a briefing on and read the classified Cox report. I was \ndismayed.\n  I followed the history of export licensing and found out there had \nalready been 11 attempts to renew the Export Administration Act. All \nhad gone down in flaming defeat. I read the documentation on the failed \nbills. I am always amazed at how much documentation there is of what \nhas been done in Congress.\n  Several people who had tried to rescue the failed bills are still \naround. I visited with them. I made several trips downtown to see how \nthe committee process of export licensing works at the present time. I \ndrafted a bill. I began working with the ranking member of my \nsubcommittee, Senator Johnson of South Dakota. Without his cooperation \nand interest, and without the dedication and involvement of his staff, \nwe would not have gotten to this point today.\n  We looked at the problem. We searched for the difficulties. We \nestablished some goals. We began to meet with anyone and everyone. We \nmet with all the agencies involved. We met with companies. We met with \nindustry groups. We met with any Senator willing to give a few minutes \nor a long period of time. I was amazed at how many were interested.\n  This bill has an interesting constituency. There are two main groups. \nNeither group has the votes to pass the bill, but each of them has the \nvotes to kill the bill.\n  Of course, everyone knows it is easier to kill a bill than it is to \npass a bill. To kill a bill, you only need one negative vote anywhere \nin an 11-step process, and it is dead. You just have to be able to get \na majority confused enough at one point to get a negative vote. But to \npass a bill, you have to have a positive vote at each one of those \nplaces and get the signature of the President. So it is 11 times easier \nto kill a bill than it is to pass one.\n  At just one single step for each of the previous 11 attempts at this \nbill, there was a perception that each of the previous bills that were \nattempted was either too strong for national security or too easy for \nimports. The trick on this bill has been to maintain a balance.\n  Along the way, I found that most of the provisions are not in \nconflict--the goals are just different--and the difference has been \nperceived as a counter to each other's interest. I know we can have a \nvigorous export economy and protect the national security.\n  I appreciate the confidence shown by Senator Gramm. He has given \nSenator Johnson and me a free rein to go after a solution. He has \nallowed the flexibility to review many unusual solutions. Senator \nSarbanes has provided a quiet leadership of fatherly questioning and \ndirection. I appreciate the hours my fellow Senators have taken to \nexplore this national problem and review this proposed solution.\n  Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and a \nranking Banking Committee member, was a big contributor and adviser \nbefore the bill even came up in committee. Senators Warner, Thompson, \nHelms, and Kyl have spent countless hours in the last 3 weeks ironing \nout difficulties. I have to mention Senator Cochran. He is a warrior of \npast battles, and he has been a tremendous help. Meetings I have been \nin during the last year were often so educational that I sometimes \nthought maybe I ought to be paying tuition.\n  Industry needs reliability and predictability. Industry needs to be \nable to make it to the marketplace at least at the same time the \ncompetitor does; for the sake of the United States, I hope they can \nmake it a little bit ahead of the competitor.\n\n  For our national security, we need to be sure items that can be used \nagainst this country do not fall into the wrong hands.\n  We formed a tough love partnership in this bill that achieves both \ngoals. Teamwork in the bill was begun by higher penalties for \nviolations.\n  I would like to use an example of a conviction that has happened with \nMcDonnell Douglas. They violated the export law. Under the present \nExecutive order, they may be charged as much as $120,000. For a big \ncorporation, they spend more on an ad than that. That is incidental \nbusiness. Under this bill, they could be fined up to $120 million. That \ngets the attention of business.\n  Also, the individuals who are willingly and knowingly involved in \nthis could go to jail. They could go to jail for up to 10 years for \neach offense. So you can see that if there are enough offenses under \nthis bill, they could have life imprisonment. Those are penalties that \nhave their attention.\n  There are several other items. I will not go into all of them. But \nthe teamwork is completed by a well-defined system for reliability and \npredictability, one that relies on prioritizing enforcement assets to \ncatch the bad guys. The United States makes so many products, they \ncannot all be watched.\n  I need to make a clarification. While we are talking about national \nsecurity, we are not talking about guns and missiles. That would be on \nthe munitions list. That isn't under the control of the Export Act. \nThat list, the munitions list, is controlled by the Department of \nDefense and is much stricter--and has to be. We are not talking about \nsatellites and the technology that goes with that. That technology is \ncontrolled by the State Department.\n  We are referring to products which we have given a fancy name. We \ncall those products dual-use technologies. They were not designed for \nwar. Most were not even intended to be dangerous. Many things are \ncommon household items. We call them dual-use technologies because they \ncan be used for more than one use, and we worry about those items that \ncan be used in a way that would be harmful to the United States.\n  For example, a stick can provide stability when you are walking or it \ncould be a club. A knife can be a dagger or it could be a vegetable \npeeler. A precision machine can manufacture toys or stealth airplane \nparts. A computer can teach you math or it can run math models to test \nnuclear weapons. Everything your senses can sense can be used for good \nor for evil. Some evil is worse than others.\n  I think you begin to get a sense for the kind of items this bill \ncould control. I think you can see where the bill could have some \nvalidity controlling every single item made or used, except everybody \nagrees that would not be feasible. If the universe is too great, we \ncannot afford the enforcement and business will not be able to sell \nanything. This bill was worked to prioritize logical enforcement.\n  To have a better idea of how enforcement works, I have had a person \non loan to my staff for the last several months who is a law \nenforcement agent, a very specialized enforcement agent, a person who \nhas worked daily with the enforcement of dual-use exports. That help \nhas been valuable beyond belief.\n  We and every one of our constituents know the value of hands-on \nexperience. There are some things about a job you can only learn by \nexperience. I am\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nthankful we have had experience helping us.\n  Also, during the drafting part of this bill, I sought out a person \nwho had experience actually applying for export licenses. He served as \na fellow on my staff for a few months and was also instrumental in \ndrafting the bill.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank all the people from the \nadministration who spent hours showing me what they do or explaining \nhow the system works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. With the indulgence of the Senator from New Jersey, I ask \nunanimous consent for some additional time so I can finish this \nexplanation, which I think is critical to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, some of the people working for the Federal Government \nright now have worked in a number of capacities and have seen export \nlicensing from more than one side. I would be especially remiss if I \ndid not mention the dedicated and time-consuming help of Undersecretary \nof Commerce Bill Reinsch and especially Undersecretary of Defense Dr. \nJohn Hamre. At one point, they had visited so much over the telephone \nabout this bill that they caught an ``electronic bug'' and were ill for \n24 hours.\n  On my own staff, I thank Katherine McGuire, my legislative director, \nwho also works with the committee, and Joel Oswald, who is my committee \nperson.\n  On Senator Johnson's staff, I not only have to mention his tremendous \nwork and coordination, but I have to mention Paul Nash, who sat in on \nhours and months of meetings; on Senator Gramm's staff, particularly, \nWayne Abernathy; on Senator Sarbanes' staff, particularly, Marty \nGruenberg; the staffs from all of the different committee chairs who \nhave been involved in this.\n  This bill has a lot of rabbits, and it has taken a lot of people to \nkeep track of all of the rabbits, particularly as they multiply. I \nwould like to tell you the debate we will hear on this bill is going to \nbe fascinating. I would like to tell you that the bill will hold your \nattention, that you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, but that \nwould be false advertising. If the bill were that thrilling instead of \nthat detailed, it would have passed long ago.\n  This may be the most important debate we have this year, but I have \nto warn you, you can't tell the players without a program, and some \nparts of this debate don't even allow a program. We will ask you to \npretend that you are James Bond, but the most exciting mission you will \nbe assigned might make you feel like a proofreader in an atlas factory.\n  We need to talk about country tiering. That is where all the \ncountries in the world are classified according to the risk to our \ncountry. We are going to talk about control lists; that is, the list of \nitems we need to keep an eye on and have special instances in which \nthey might need to be licensed. We are going to talk about a process \nfor getting on the list and getting an item off the list. To really \ncomplicate the process, we are going to go back to our country list of \nrisk and vary the risk by each item on the control list. Because that \nwill cause some gray areas, we have this little handbook. This little \nhandbook is a translation, a simplification of the rules that, if you \nare exporting a single thing, you better be aware of because you could \nbe violating the law if you aren't following all 1,200 pages.\n  All of those things have to be blended together into something \nworkable for industry and national security. I am prepared to explain \nany of those concepts, to go into great detail with anyone who needs \nthat. Hopefully, we will not do that on the floor. I have been doing \nthat for groups as small as one or as great as 500 for the last year.\n  But before you think that is all there is, we threw in two new \nconcepts that have been mentioned before, so I will not go into detail \non those except to mention that they are critical. We threw in mass \nmarkets and foreign availability. We recognized that if an item is \navailable all over the world, probably the bad guys get that, too. And \nif a product is mass marketed in the United States, if it is so small \nand so cheap and sold at enough outlets that it could be legally \npurchased, easily hidden, and taken out of the country, that if you try \nto enforce that, you will probably not get anywhere either.\n  I could go on for a long time about the complexities in this bill--\n158 pages of detail. We have established a system that is transparent \nand accountable to Congress, requires recorded votes, has ways of \ngetting things up to the President, and allows for the President to \ncontrol some things. We recognized the deficiency in the present system \nof difficulty of objecting to licenses, objecting to things on the \nlist, and we have cleared those up. Now we need to clear up the \nmisunderstandings that there are with the bill.\n  Industry and national security--each side has the ability to walk \naway from this bill and cause its demise. It would be the simplest \nthing in the world. I commend business and the security agencies for \ntheir efforts, their teamwork, and their cooperation. They have read \nthe reports that have come out on this. The Cox report has been \nreferred to many times. The Cox report says this needs to be done. \nCongressman Cox appeared before the Banking Committee and testified \nthat this bill needs to be done.\n  I could go into other examples there. I am asking both sides, \nindustry and security, to stay together, to keep working to stay in the \nmiddle so that we can have a system in place that will solve some of \nthe problems of the United States while it increases exports. It can be \ndone.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1280-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1280-S1281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTIONS IN TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during this generation we have \nwitnessed the greatest expansion of democratic nations in history. From \nEast Asia to Eastern Europe to Latin America and the islands of the \nPacific, the blessings of democratic pluralism have expanded to the \nvery bounds of each continent. It is in the proudest legacies of this \nNation that the United States has played an essential role in \nfacilitating the transition of these nations to democracy and their \nprotection at critical moments.\n  From military defense to economic assistance, it is questionable \nwhether Korea, Poland, Haiti, and scores of other nations would be free \nif it were not for the leadership of the United States. Now this \ngeneration of American leadership has a new challenge. As certainly as \nour parents and grandparents fought to ensure that these nations would \nhave an opportunity to be free, it is our responsibility to assure that \nthese fledgling democracies have an opportunity to remain free, a \nchallenge that democracy is not a transitional state but a permanent \ncondition of mankind, and the nations that would represent them.\n  There is one threat developing now before us to this proposition. It \ninvolves the people of Taiwan. During the late 1980s and 1990s, Taiwan \nunderwent an extraordinary transformation from an authoritarian regime \nto a genuine democracy. Taiwan provided an example of peaceful \npolitical evolution from a military and authoritarian government to a \ntrue pluralist democracy with little violence, no military \nconfrontation, and without a revolution.\n  After years of justifying tight security control, step by step, year \nby year, Taiwan created a genuine democracy. In 1986, a formal \nopposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, was formed. And in \n1987, martial law was ended after more than 40 years. In 1991, \nPresident Lee ended the Government's emergency powers to deal with \ndissent and a new, freely elected legislature chosen by the people was \ncreated. In 1996, Taiwan's democracy had matured to the point that a \nPresidential election was held. Taiwan had fully developed. Democracy \nhad come of age.\n\n  Now, in only a few days, on March 18, Taiwan will hold its second \ndemocratic Presidential election. The challenge to this democracy and \nthe rights of freedom of press, worship, and assembly so central to \nmaintaining human freedom are no longer under attack from within. The \npressure is from Beijing. On the very eve of these elections, the \nPeople's Republic of China issued a statement that constitutes a new \nthreat to Taiwanese democracy. China recently\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\nissued its so-called white paper which warned that if Taiwan \nindefinitely delays negotiations on reunification, China will ``adopt \nall drastic measures possible, including the use of force.''\n  This goes beyond China's previous statements that it would take \nTaiwan by force only if it declares independence or were occupied by a \nforeign power. The more democratic Taiwan has become, the lower the bar \nappears to be for military intervention and a hostile settling of the \nTaiwan issue.\n  These aggressive statements obviously only serve to increase tension \nin the region and make a peaceful settlement among the people of Taiwan \nand the People's Republic of China much more difficult. This \nbelligerent approach obviously has precedent, almost an exact \nprecedent. In 1996, also on the eve of a Presidential election in \nTaiwan, the People's Republic launched missiles in a crude attempt to \nintimidate the people of Taiwan as they approached their election.\n  It now appears that the election of Taiwan's new President will be \nclose. It is critical to the functioning of Taiwan's democracy that \nthey thwart any belief in Beijing that intimidation will solve or \ncontribute to the relationship between these peoples. It is critical \nthat the people of Taiwan stand resolute and that their voters not \nallow these actions to intimidate them.\n  There is obviously an American role. The United States must respond \nto this ultimatum by making it absolutely clear that our position is \nfirm; it is unequivocal. The dispute between Taiwan and Beijing will \nnot be settled by military means, and the United States, in a policy \nthat is not unique to Taiwan, will not idly witness a free people in a \ndemocratic nation be invaded or occupied and have their political \nsystem altered by armed aggression.\n  This, I believe, is the cornerstone of American foreign policy in the \npostwar period. It remains central to who we are as a people and our \nrole as the world's largest and most powerful democracy. Any ambiguity \nwill, on the other hand, only serve to embolden Beijing and can lead to \ndangerous misinterpretations and miscalculations.\n  There is, within this Congress, the opportunity to end any possible \nambiguity. The House of Representatives has passed, and the Senate has \nbefore it, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. Senator Helms and I \nintroduced this legislation last year in the Senate. The House has \nspoken overwhelmingly in favor of our legislation, as modified. The \nquestion is before this Senate.\n  The legislation Senator Helms and I have offered is designed to \nensure Taiwan's ability to meet its defensive security needs and to \nresist Chinese intimidation. It imposes no new obligations on the \nUnited States. The legislation, as passed by the House, will simply \nstrengthen the process for selling defense articles by requiring an \nannual report to Congress on Taiwan's defense requests and ensuring \nthat Taiwan has full access to data on defense articles. It mandates \nthe sale of nothing. It requires the transfer of no specific article. \nIt does guarantee that this Congress understand the security situation, \nTaiwan's requests, and a flow of information. It improves Taiwan's \nmilitary readiness by supporting Taiwan's participation in U.S. \nmilitary academies, ensuring that their military personnel are trained, \nunderstand American doctrine, and could coordinate if there were a \ncrisis. This is not only good for Taiwan, it is good for the United \nStates, ensuring that if tragically there ever should be a \nconfrontation, our own Armed Forces are in the best position to train \npeople familiar with our doctrine and any mutual obligations.\n  Finally, it requires that the United States establish secure, direct \ncommunications between the American Pacific Command and Taiwan's \nmilitary. Nothing would be more tragic than to enter into a military \nconfrontation by mistake or misinformation. This ensures reliable, \nfast, secure information so the situation is available to our own \nmilitary commanders.\n  The legislation does not commit the United States to take any \nspecific military actions now, later, or ever. A full range of options \nare available to the President and to the Congress. It also does not \nalter or amend our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act. Rather, \nit helps us to fulfill those commitments under the act and ensures that \nTaiwan's security needs are adequately met.\n\n  If we pass this legislation, it makes it less likely that we will \nbecome engaged in any future conflict because there will be no \nambiguity, no chance of miscalculation because of Taiwan's ability to \nstrengthen itself, and because of our mutual ability to assess \ndefensive needs, less chance of a military calculation in the mistaken \nbelief that either Taiwan will not be defended or have the ability to \ndefend itself.\n  There is an important national interest in integrating the People's \nRepublic of China into the world's economy and in promoting the growth \nof democracy and human rights in a nation that will play a vital role \nin the coming century. But our overall relationship cannot possibly \ndevelop quickly and positively if China continues to seek a military \nsolution to the question of its relations with the people of Taiwan.\n  By not making our policy clear, by not assessing the military \nsituation, we do not contribute to the avoidance of military conflict. \nWe enhance the possibility of military conflict. This legislation, I \nbelieve, is a strong statement that avoids miscalculation and lessens \nthe chances of conflict. President Clinton made a strong statement last \nweek in support of a peaceful resolution of this issue when he said:\n\n       Issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved \n     peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan.\n\n  This formulation's emphasis on the ``assent of the people''--the \nwords used by President Clinton--is new and important.\n  Together with this Taiwan Enhancement Security Act, I believe it is \nan important contribution in this current debate on the problems of \nTaiwan security. It is, most importantly, in accord with the language \nof the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act as passed by the House, which \nstates, ``Any determination of the ultimate status of Taiwan must have \nthe express consent of the people of Taiwan.''\n  The Taiwan Enhancement Security Act, therefore, and President \nClinton's own statement in response to recent provocations by Beijing, \nare not only similar, they are identical. I believe the House of \nRepresentatives, in changing the Helms-Torricelli approach, has made a \nvaluable contribution. I believe, for the maintenance of the peace and \nensuring this Nation's commitment, that those nations which have chosen \nto be democratic, pluralist nations, governed with the consent of their \nown people--the commitment of this Nation that those nations will not \nby force of arms or intervention have their forms of government changed \nor altered will be enhanced.\n  Taiwan, today, is the cornerstone of that American commitment. \nTomorrow, it could be Africa or Latin America. How we stand now on the \neve of these free elections in Taiwan will most assuredly constitute a \npowerful message in all other places where others would challenge these \nnew and fledgling democracies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask what the pending business is.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1281-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1281-S1283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RISING COST OF FUEL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak with my \ncolleagues about the justifiably increasing concern among the American \npeople about the increasing price of gasoline and other fuels.\n  The fact is that our gas pumps are fast turning into sump pumps for \nAmerican pocketbooks. Just 2 days ago, the Energy Information \nAdministration pegged the average current retail price for a gallon of \ngas at $1.54. That is the highest level in a decade for this time of \nthe year.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the end of it. Prices are expected to soar \nbeyond this height in the months ahead. In fact, the Energy Information \nAdministration is projecting an average price of more than $1.80 a \ngallon of gas by Memorial Day, the start of the summer driving season.\n  That is, in and of itself, according to experts on oil pricing to \nwhom I have spoken, an optimistic assessment. It is predicated on the \npromises of several OPEC nations that they will raise their production \nof oil after their March 27\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\nmeeting and thus lower the price of crude oil.\n  There are very reputable analysts of oil markets who are saying the \naverage per gallon price of gasoline will go to $2 and in some places \nas high as $2.50 a gallon this summer. Ouch. That is not only \nunprecedented but will have a disastrous effect not only on individual \nbusinesses and consumers, particularly those of more modest average \nmeans, but it will, I am afraid, have a disastrous effect on our \neconomy, setting off a vicious cycle of prolonged oil price increases, \nan increase in inflation rates, corresponding hikes in interest rates, \nand a stall in the historic run of economic growth we have had over the \nlast several years.\n  Another consequence of oil price increases, as we unsettlingly saw \nyesterday, could be significant declines in the stock markets. I \nunderstand the decline yesterday was attributed not just to oil price \nincreases but also to the report from Procter & Gamble that they would \nbe reporting lower quarterly profits than were expected. But oil price \nincreases are part of it.\n  Not surprisingly, yesterday crude oil trading on the New York \nMercantile Exchange rose $1.95 to $34.13 a barrel, which is the highest \nlevel increase since November 1990--the highest level increase in a \ndecade.\n  I trust that my colleagues are hearing from their constituents, both \nindividual and business, as I am, with complaints ever more vociferous \nabout the strain this price spike in gasoline is putting on their \nfamily and business budgets. As these energy and transportation costs \ncontinue to climb, the cries for help will also increase.\n  The squeeze is now being felt across the country, but it constitutes \nfor us in the Northeast the second chapter of this current sad story of \nenergy pricing since, as I know you know, Mr. President, the State of \nConnecticut and the entire Northeast was particularly hard hit by a \nprolonged price shock in home heating oil, which more than doubled in a \nspace of months the amount people in our region of the country were \npaying. So this jump now in the price of gasoline represents what might \nbe called a ``double energy pricing whack.''\n  Last week, on Thursday, several Members of Congress in both parties \nwere invited to the White House for a meeting of the President, \nSecretary Richardson, Secretary Summers, and others in the \nadministration to discuss these matters. It was a spirited discussion \nand one that represented a very good exchange.\n  I say to my neighbors and constituents in the Northeast that the most \nencouraging part of the discussion to me was the receptivity of the \nadministration to an idea that my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd, and I put forward to create a regional home heating oil reserve--\nnot crude oil as in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve we have now but \nhome heating oil which could be used in cases as the one we just \nexperienced in the Northeast when there was what I consider to be an \nartificial rise in price based on the OPEC cartel limiting supply in \nwhat is, after all, a critically necessary commodity--fuel.\n  It would allow this reserve to immediately put out at times such as \nthis in the future an amount of home heating oil, distillate product--\nit could go for diesel fuel as well, where price increases have so hurt \ntruckers--to raise supplies so that the price could decline to a more \nbalanced point.\n\n  Work goes on and discussion goes on. This idea could be a model in \nenergy shortages in other regions. Some regions dependent on propane, \nfor instance, might create similar reserves that could be used to \neffect when artificial prices create dramatically increasing prices.\n  I look forward to continuing those discussions with the \nadministration. At a minimum, if we can do something between now and \nnext winter, it will give people and businesses in the Northeast some \ncomfort--I apologize for the metaphor--but a kind of security blanket, \nif you will, so that next year, if OPEC again reduces supply, they will \nhave the home heating oil at reasonable prices to heat their homes and \nbusinesses.\n  Let me turn now to the gasoline price increase which is now going \nacross the country and has very significant ramifications for our \neconomy overall.\n  My apologies to Ernest Hemingway. I ask, For whom does the gas pump \ntoll today? I say the answer is, It tolls for us--not just that we are \npaying it, but it should remind us once again of the debilitating \ndangers of our dependence on foreign oil, reminding us that our \nconsumers and our economic security are being held hostage by the \ndecisions of the OPEC producers as they are in this case following \ntheir own interests, but it is not in our interest.\n  No matter how great a country we are--the strongest country in the \nworld, the most successful economy with the greatest standard of \nliving--we have put ourselves in a position where a small group of \nnations, because they control this commodity--oil--that is so vital to \nus, can hold us hostage.\n  So the President has to send the Secretary of Energy and others, \nbasically, pleading with these oil-producing countries that are \nsupposed to be our friends and allies to get reasonable and to increase \nthe supply so that they fill at least the two-million-barrel-per-day \ngap between supply and demand on world oil prices.\n  I hope as we face this crisis, though, we will take steps to \ndeclare--as we have been saying now for two decades, but to do it \nhopefully with some meaning, greater meaning--energy independence, and \nto do so by tapping in more vigorously to the supplies of energy over \nwhich we have some control, such as natural gas and oil, where that is \npossible within our own domestic control.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to more aggressively try to convert \nand develop supplies of energy in our control. We have to more \naggressively support conservative efforts and development of renewable, \ncleaner sources of energy. We have to be prepared to invest and \ncontinue to support even more aggressively some of the pioneering, \npathbreaking work being done in the automobile industry to develop \nhigh-fuel-efficiency vehicles.\n\n  Very exciting work is being done, and we can help with further \nsupport in the development of fuel cells as a renewable clean source of \nenergy. The truth is, no matter how strong, innovative, \nentrepreneurial, and how great our increases in productivity are in \nthis country, until we invest more into the energy that drives our \neconomy, we are going to be subject to being effectively brought to our \nknees and having our markets and our bank accounts follow down in that \ndirection.\n  Another item discussed at the meeting with President Clinton and \nSecretary Richardson last week, advanced by my colleague and friend \nfrom New York, Senator Schumer, Senator Collins of Maine, and others, \nwas, in this crisis, to be prepared to either swap or draw down the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, in which there is now approximately 580 \nmillion barrels of oil owned by the taxpayers of the United States, and \nput some of that at this critical moment into our economy as a way to \nfill the gap between supply and demand, and, frankly, as a way to let \nour friends at OPEC know that, though our resources are limited, they \nare not meager and that we are prepared to contend with their \nartificial inflation of oil prices.\n  I report these developments to my colleagues and say I believe that \nthe President, at least, is keeping the option of using oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve on the table. No commitments were made, no \ndecision was made either about that or a final decision made about the \nstrategic heating oil reserve for our region that I discussed earlier. \nI appreciated the discussion and I appreciated the active and, \nobviously, concerned interest that was expressed by the President at \nthe meeting last week.\n  I look forward to continuing those discussions. I hope we can do it \nin a spirit of reason and balance and not in a spirit of panic because \nour economy has been stalled and our markets have been essentially \nattacked and have fallen as a result of this shortage in oil supply, \nbased on the actions of an oil cartel, OPEC, which hurts the United \nStates because of our continuing dependence on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PAEZ\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I have the responsibility \ntoday to write the majority leader to ask that we not proceed to vote \non the Paez nomination, and to ask that additional hearings be held on \nthat nomination to determine whether or not he correctly and properly \nhandled the guilty plea and sentencing of John Huang in Los Angeles, \nCA, that fell before his jurisdiction in the Los Angeles district \ncourt.\n  This is a matter of importance. It is something we have not gotten to \nthe bottom of. It is something my staff has uncovered as we have come \nup to this final vote. I believe it is important.\n  Judge Paez is a Federal judge today. He has been controversial \nbecause of his activist opinions and background and has been held up \nlonger than any other judge now pending before the Congress. We have \nonly had a few who have had substantial delays, probably fewer than two \nor three. There are two now who have been delayed. He is still the \nlongest. I do not lightly ask that he be delayed again, but he is a \nsitting Federal judge; he has a lifetime appointment. It is not as if \nhis law practice is being disrupted and he is being left in limbo about \nhis future. He can continue to work until we get to the bottom of this.\n  The President seeks to have him confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, which is the highest appellate court in the United States \nexcept for the Supreme Court. It is a high and important position. We \nought to make sure we know what really happened out there when John \nHuang was sentenced.\n  Basically, that is what happened. The John Huang case was part of the \ninvestigation of campaign finance abuses by the Clinton-Gore team in \nthe 1996 election. Mr. Huang is the one who raised $1.6 million, a lot \nof it from foreign sources, the Riadys in China--those kinds of things. \nUltimately, the Democratic National Committee had to refund $1.6 \nmillion that they believed they had received wrongfully and illegally. \nEventually, the Clinton Department of Justice proceeded with this \ninvestigation.\n  The Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, and the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, Fred Thompson from Tennessee, \nrepeatedly urged the U.S. Attorney General not to investigate that case \nherself because she held her office at the pleasure of the President of \nthe United States. He could remove her at any time. Even if she did a \nfair and good job with it, people would have reason to question it. \nThey urged her repeatedly--and I have, others have, and a large number \nof Senators have--to turn this over to an independent counsel. She did \non many other investigations. But this one they would not let go of; \nthey held onto it. The President's own appointees held on to this \ncampaign finance investigation.\n\n  I spent 15 years as a Federal prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. attorney, 2\\1/\n2\\ as an assistant U.S. attorney. I have personally tried hundreds of \ncases. I have personally participated in, supervised, and directly \nhandled plea bargains. I know something about the sentencing \nguidelines, which are mandatory Federal sentencing rules saying how \nmuch time one should serve.\n  What happened is that the case did not go before a Federal grand jury \nfor indictment. The prosecutor, a Department of Justice employee, and \nMr. Huang and his attorneys met and discussed the case. They reached a \nplea agreement. That plea agreement called for him to plead guilty to \nillegal contributions to the mayor's race in Los Angeles for $7,500--\nmaybe another little plea, but I think it was just that $7,500--and he \nwould be given immunity for the $1.6 million or any illegal \ncontributions he may have received for the Clinton-Gore campaign that \nhad to be refunded. He would be given immunity for that. He was \nsupposed to cooperate and testify. That was going to justify the \nsentence.\n  After they reached this agreement and Mr. Huang agreed to waive his \nconstitutional rights to be indicted by a grand jury, he said: Don't \ntake me before a grand jury. You make a charge, Mr. Prosecutor, called \nan information, instead of an indictment, and I will plead guilty to \nthat. So they worked out an agreement. He agreed to plead guilty to \nthat.\n  Sometimes that is done. It is not in itself wrong, but it is a matter \nthat increases the possibility of an abusive relationship between the \nprosecutor and the defendant, I must admit.\n  They say that cases are randomly assigned in Los Angeles. There are \n34 judges in Los Angeles. Judge Paez was one of those judges. He got \nthe Huang case. Curiously, he also got the Maria Hsia case. They had a \ncase against Maria Hsia in Los Angeles because she was involved in \nthis, too, and they eventually tried her a few days ago and convicted \nher in Washington on charges of tax evasion, I believe, arising out of \nthis same matter. She was tried and convicted here on separate charges.\n  Oddly, this judge, who was a nominee of the President of the United \nStates, somehow got these cases and presided over them. I think there \nis a real question whether he should have taken the cases.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, as a professional prosecutor who has \nbeen through these cases for many years, that the prosecutor's duty is \nto make sure the defendant is given credit for cooperating; that is, \nspilling the beans, admitting he did wrong, asking for mercy in those \ncases, agreeing to testify about what he knows. When you do that, you \nare entitled to get less than the sentencing guidelines would cause you \nto get.\n  But the critical thing is, Mr. Huang knew high officials in this \nadministration and knew the President. I believe he spent the night in \nthe White House. He has certainly been there for meetings at times. So \nthis was a man who had been involved in not just some inadvertent event \nbut a very large effort to solicit foreign money, some of it connected \nto the country of China, which is a competitor of the United States. It \nwas a big deal case.\n  Knowing that the person who had nominated him at that very moment \ncould have been embarrassed or maybe even found to be guilty of \nwrongdoing if Mr. Huang spilled all the beans, I am not sure he should \nhave taken the case at all out of propriety, but he took it, assuming \nhe did the right thing.\n  The case then came up for sentencing. Some of the people who defend \nJudge Paez have told me repeatedly in recent days that they don't \nbelieve it was Judge Paez's fault so much as it was the fault of the \nDepartment of Justice, that they did not tell him all the truth; they \nacted improperly; if they had told him all the facts, he may have \nrendered a more serious sentence than he did under these circumstances.\n  I have had my staff review the plea agreement. Much of it is not \navailable to us. We did not get the pre-sentence report, which I would \nlove to see. We did not get to see some other matters involving the \nextent of the cooperation of Mr. Huang. That was not available to us. \nBut we do have a transcript of the guilty plea, what went down and what \nfacts were produced and what facts the judge did know and the judge was \ntold.\n  It appears to me the judge was not told all the facts by the \nDepartment of Justice. That is a very serious thing, if it occurred. It \nis a failure on their part to fulfill the high ideals of justice in \nthis country.\n  If we look on the Supreme Court building, right across the street \nfrom the Capitol, the words written in big letters on the front of that \nbuilding are these: Equal justice under law. When charges were brought \nagainst President Nixon, the impeachment charges voted\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\nagainst him were clearly established by the Supreme Court--that the \nPresident and no person in this country is above the law.\n  We are a government of laws and not of men. That is a foundation \nprinciple of America. It is in our early debates about establishing the \nConstitution and the rule of law.\n  We are a government of laws and not of men. That was raised during \nthe drafting of the impeachment clause. I remember I researched that at \nthe time. That high ideal was discussed by the people who wrote our \nConstitution. So I say to you that this was a high-profile case of \nimmense national interest. It had been a subject about which TV and \nnews stories, magazines, newspapers, and so forth have written--the \nHuang case. The American public had every right to expect this case \nwould be handled scrupulously and that there not be the slightest \nmisstep.\n  A judge with a lifetime appointment ought not to have felt in any way \nobligated to do anything other than conduct himself according to the \nfair and just aspects of handling this case. That, to me, was basic. \nThat is why we give the stunning power of a lifetime appointment. But \nwe have to ask that they adhere to high standards in utilizing that \npower. If they misuse it, we can't vote and say: We don't like the way \nyou are doing your job, judge, we are going to remove you. No. He has a \nconstitutional right to a lifetime appointment, unless he commits an \nimpeachable offense. Bad decisions are not impeachable offenses.\n  So the judge took this case, and I believe he had a high obligation \nto conduct himself properly. The whole Nation was watching. Maybe he \ndidn't have all the facts, but we found that he started at a base level \nof 6. Under our Federal sentencing guidelines--many of you may not \nknow, but this Congress did a great thing a number of years ago. When I \nwas prosecuting cases, they eliminated parole and put a restriction on \nhow a judge could sentence. They said you have to carefully evaluate \nevery case that comes before you, and we have a sentencing commission \nthat goes over the details.\n  There are guidelines about what you must find. If you find the \ndefendant used a gun, or that he is a previously convicted felon, or \nthat he used corrupt means to organize an entity, all of these factors \ncould increase the time he or she serves in jail. How much money was \ninvolved could increase the time in jail; a little bit is less, and \nmore is more. Judges have used all of those guidelines. But there was \ngreat concern in the Congress that many judges in Federal court didn't \nsentence appropriately. You might have an offense in one district that \nis treated one way, and it might be treated much more lightly in \nanother district. So he got the base level for that.\n  One of the factors that the judge had awareness of and had the \nevidence on was that a substantial part of this fraudulent scheme was \ncommitted outside the United States. Under the sentencing guidelines, \nthat calls for adding two different levels to this sentence. Judge Paez \nmade no adjustment. He did not increase the level for the fact that in \npart of this scheme the money came from outside the United States. \nPeople who were giving the money were from outside the United States. A \nsubstantial part of this involved international activity. That is \nprecisely the motive behind adding to punishment within the level of \nguidelines. The judge failed to do so. I believe he clearly should have \ndone so under the circumstances.\n  He also had evidence that at least 24 illegal contributions were \nspread out over the course of 2 years involving multiple U.S. and \noverseas corporate entities, which John Huang was responsible for \nsoliciting and reimbursing these illegal contributions. So he was \nactively involved with these corporations. Under Federal guidelines, \n``If an individual is an organizer or a manager that significantly \nfacilitated the commission or concealment of the offense''--that is a \ndirect quote--``under 3(b)1.3, he should be given a 2 to 4 level \nincrease.''\n\n  Judge Paez gave him no level increase for those two acts. John Huang \nalso was ``an officer and director of various corporate entities \ninvolved and also was a director and vice chairman of a bank.'' What \ndoes that mean when you are doing sentencing guidelines? Under the \nguidelines, if an individual abuses a position of public or private \ntrust, such as using his position as a board director and vice \npresident of a bank in a manner that significantly facilitated the \ncommission or concealment of the offense, then he should have added two \nadditional levels for that. Right there, we are talking about at least \nsix, maybe eight, different additional levels. The judge found no \nincreases for that.\n  So when he pleaded guilty, Judge Paez found that his level was eight. \nThat is very critical because, I am sad to say, that is the highest \nlevel you can have and still get probation and not spend a day in jail. \nIt calls for a sentence of zero to 6 months if you have level 8. If the \njudge wants to be tough, he can give him 6 months if he falls under \nlevel 8. If he wants to be lenient, he can give straight probation, or \nzero time in jail. Judge Paez gave him probation, the lowest possible \nsentence. If it would have been level 9, the lowest possible sentence \nwould have been time in the slammer, in the bastille where he belonged.\n  I am troubled by that. I know there was a lot of pressure to move \nthis case along, get this case out of the way and not have any \nembarrassment. I am sure there was a lot of tension. But a lifetime-\nappointed Federal judge should have a commitment to the highest \nstandards of integrity. Even if it involved the President of the United \nStates, the man who appointed him, he should not play with the \nsentencing guidelines. I assure you that 18-, 19-, and 25-year-old \nkids, every day, going into Federal court--and I have seen it; I \npresided over them--are getting 10, 15, 25 years without parole because \nthey are significant drug dealers and they have been selling crack. \nThey are sent off to the slammer and nobody worries about them.\n  So how is it that John Huang raises $1.6 million that had to be \nreturned, pleads guilty to some token offense on a contribution to the \nmayor of Los Angeles, and he gets to walk out without 1 day in jail? \nWell, the prosecutor was at fault, in my opinion. This was an \nunjustified disposition of this case, in light of the circumstances \ninvolved.\n  I cannot imagine that anybody can ultimately defend the disposition \nof this case. They may say, well, the judge just followed the \nprosecutor's recommendation. The judge did follow the prosecutor's \nrecommendation, but he was not required to do so. In that plea bargain, \nas I noted, it said the judge is not required to follow this plea \nbargain. If he, Mr. Huang, rejects it, we will withdraw the plea and we \nwill go back to square one and start all over. The judge is not \nrequired to accept it. The judge wasn't required to accept the plea, \nand he should not have accepted this plea.\n  These are the exact words from the plea agreement:\n\n       This agreement is not binding on the court. The United \n     States and you--\n\n  Meaning Mr. Huang, in the contract between the prosecutor and Mr. \nHuang--\n\n     understand that the court retains complete discretion to \n     accept or reject the agreed upon disposition provided for in \n     this agreement. If the court does not accept this agreement, \n     it will be void, and you will be free to withdraw your plea \n     of guilty. If you do withdraw your plea of guilty, this \n     agreement made in connection with it and the discussions \n     leading up to it shall not be admissible against you in any \n     court.\n\n  That is standard language. I have used it many times myself. The \njudge was obligated to follow the law of the United States. He was \nobligated to make sure justice occurred, if there was equal justice \nunder the law.\n  I don't know how judges who send kids to jail for 20 years without \nparole can sleep at night when they are talking about letting this guy \noff the hook for this offense.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know my friend doesn't want us to vote on Judge Paez.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me just say to the Senator that I have asked for an \nadditional hearing to find out if I might be wrong about this and hear \nboth sides of it. But I am not going to support a filibuster on this \nnomination. If we do that, we will just vote on it, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much.\n\n[[Page S1285]]\n\n  I want to ask him if he read what Senator Specter said regarding the \ntwo cases we raised, the Maria Hsia case and the Huang case. I ask the \nSenator to react to this because I think it is important.\n  When asked if this vote ought to be put off, he said:\n\n       These matters are now ripe for decision by the Senate. \n     There has been some suggestion of a further investigation on \n     this matter, but when Judge Paez's nomination has been \n     pending since 1996, and all of the factors on the record \n     demonstrate it was the Government's failure, the failure of \n     the Department of Justice to bring these matters to the \n     attention of Judge Paez and on the record, he has \n     qualifications to be confirmed.\n\n  In other words, what Senator Specter is saying is that Judge Paez was \nfollowing the recommendation of the prosecutor.\n  I ask my friend: When the prosecutors say this is what we think is \nthe best for the case, is it really that unusual for a judge to say let \nthe prosecution stand? If we want to accuse Judge Paez of something, it \nought to be that he was soft on the case, No. 1. I say to my friend: It \nwas randomly selected; he got these two cases; he didn't ask for these \ncases. No. 2, he followed the prosecution's request, and he is being \ncondemned for it.\n  My last point is--I know my friend will comment on all of this--my \nfriend was interested in the sentencing issue surrounding Judge Paez. \nWe have the facts on that, and he does as well.\n  I think it is important to note that if you look at U.S. district \ncourt as a whole--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will come back to it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will finish, and the Senator can respond.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate my friend yielding. I will wait.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sorry. I will be happy to enter into a dialogue \nand come back to it later.\n  Senator Specter was, in fact, a State prosecutor. He is familiar in \nthat boiler room of Philadelphia when judges are sitting up there and \nprosecutors come forward on burglary cases. The judge is a victim. He \nhas to take the recommendation of the prosecutor and does so routinely. \nFederal judges try to do that, but it is always recognized that they \nhave ultimate responsibility, as this plea agreement says.\n  In a case of national importance, which in itself just on the face of \nit does not pass the smell test, in my view, he should not have \naccepted it.\n  Another thing Senator Specter has never done is handle the sentencing \nguidelines. They were not a part of the State courts of Philadelphia or \nPennsylvania, but they were a part of the Federal court where Judge \nPaez was sitting. I don't think Senator Specter has ever considered the \nfact that the evidence is what the judge had, and he did not have all \nthat he should have had. But what he did have indicates that he did not \nproperly apply the guidelines. That is the only thing he can be \nresponsible for, in my view. If evidence was withheld from him, I \nunderstand that. But what I have been quoting here is what he did have.\n\n  I also note in Roll Call, in the Republican Representative Jay Kim \nprobation case, they said Judge Paez's sentence of Representative Kim \nwas a mere slap on the wrist and makes us think that the Senate \nJudiciary Committee ought to question whether or not Paez is too soft \non criminals to be a Federal judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I hate to ask this to be delayed. But he is a sitting Federal judge. \nIt is not messing up his Federal practice in a couple or three weeks to \nget to the bottom of this and how the case was assigned, because it \ndidn't come out of an indictment by a grand jury, it came out of the \nhandling by the prosecutor. In my experience, those cases are not \nrandomly assigned. Quite often, they are taken directly by the \nprosecutor to the judge.\n  I would like to have somebody under oath explain to me how the Hsia \ncase and the Huang case went to Judge Paez. Out of 34 judges, they went \nto Judge Paez. That doesn't strike well with me. I would like to know \nthat before we go forward with the vote. If he has a good answer, I am \nwilling to accept it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nproceed in morning business for up to 10 minutes and that my remarks be \nfollowed by the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1285-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1285-S1286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE INCOME TAX ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 87 years ago today, the Federal Government \nbegan collecting income tax. I rise not to celebrate the anniversary, \nbut to condemn the occasion. What began as a simple flat tax on the \nrevenue of a few has turned into a Pandora's box that devastates many. \nAnd so I take this opportunity today to strongly urge Congress to begin \nrepealing the process of the constitutional amendment granting the \nFederal Government the power to tax, abolish the income tax, and \nreplace it with a tax that is fairer, simpler, and friendlier to the \ntaxpayers.\n  The reasons for abolishing the Federal income tax are compelling. To \nbegin with, the income tax has clearly violated the fundamental \nprinciples upon which this great Nation was founded.\n  Mr. President, our country was born out of a tax revolt--a tax revolt \nbuilt upon freedom and liberty. To preserve liberty, our Founding \nFathers crafted an article in the Constitution unequivocally rejecting \nall direct income taxes that were not apportioned to each state by its \npopulation.\n  During the following 100 years, this provision brought enormous \neconomic opportunities and prosperity for America. Although Congress \nattempted to enact income taxes in the late 19th century, the Supreme \nCourt repeatedly declared the income tax unconstitutional. As a result, \nbetween 1870 and 1913, before the income tax was levied, the U.S. \neconomy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms. This was an average \ngrowth rate of more than 10 percent per year, without inflation.\n  Congress has passed many ill-advised laws, but nothing has been more \ndisastrous than the passing of the 16th amendment in 1909, which \nallowed the Federal Government to begin levying and collecting income \ntax as of March 8, 1913.\n  This shift in policy represented the efforts of those liberal \nelements who believes and promoted the ideology that society has a \nclaim on one's capital and labor. They suggested that the \nredistribution of private income would increase equality among people. \nTheir strategy was simple: they claimed this income tax was to ``soak \nthe rich'' and was not supposed to provide a mechanism for Washington \nto reach into most Americans' pockets--the argument we still hear again \nand again on the Senate floor.\n  Initially, less than 1 percent of all Americans paid income tax. Only \n5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939. But today, \nnearly every American is subject to the income tax. The Federal tax \nburden is at an historic high. A median-income family can expect to \ngive up nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local \ntaxes--more than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and \nhousing combined.\n  More Americans are working harder and are earning more today. But a \nlarge share of the higher incomes of hard-working Americans aren't \nbeing spent on family priorities, but are instead being siphoned off by \nWashington.\n  They are working harder, but they are taking home less money because \nthe Government is taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. Then \nthere is ``bracket creep.'' I think everybody knows what that is. It \nmeans a large share of revenues goes to taxes as inflation pushes you \ninto another income level, or another tax bracket, so Washington can \nget a bigger bite out of your paycheck.\n  Mr. President, is this what our Founding Fathers fought for? Even the \nsponsor of the 16th amendment, Congressman Sereno E. Payne of New York, \nlater realized his mistake and denounced direct taxation as ``a tax \nupon the income of honest men and an exemption, to a greater or lesser \nextent, of the income of rascals.''\n  T. Coleman Andrews, a former commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService said:\n\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n\n       Congress [in implementing the 16th Amendment] went beyond \n     merely enacting an income tax law and repealed Article IV of \n     the Bill of Rights, by empowering the tax collector to do the \n     very things from which that article says we were to be \n     secure. It opened up our homes, our papers and our effects to \n     the prying eyes of government agents and set the stage for \n     searches of our books and vaults and for inquiries into our \n     private affairs whenever the tax men might decide, even \n     though there might not be any justification beyond mere \n     cynical suspicion.\n\n  To my colleagues who would brush off that statement as an \nexaggeration, I remind them of the horror stories we heard from many of \nour constituents 2 years ago, when the Senate Finance Committee held \nhearings into abuses carried out by the IRS. Those poor taxpayers whose \nlives were shattered thanks to the unwarranted excesses of an overeager \ntax collector were not exaggerating.\n  The income tax must be abolished because it has become so complicated \nand inefficient. The Federal Tax Code today stretches on for more than \n7 million words, and is made up of 4 huge volumes, another 20 volumes \nof regulations, and thousands of pages of instructions. Not even tax \naccountants or lawyers fully understand it. What chance does the \naverage taxpayer have of getting it right?\n  The government publishes 480 separate tax forms and mails out 8 \nbillion pages of forms and instruction each year. The IRS employs over \n10,000 agents to collect taxes, more agents than the FBI and the CIA \ncombined.\n  The income tax must be abolished because it keeps enlarging the \ngovernment. In Washington, taxing and spending always go hand in hand. \nAs the income tax rate goes up, government spending explodes. Between \n1913 and 1999, inflation-adjusted federal government spending increased \nby more than 16,000 percent.\n  The income tax must be abolished because even in an era of budget \nsurplus, it allows the government to continue overcharging Americans as \nwe see today with our surpluses. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, working Americans' tax overpayments will be as high as $1.9 \ntrillion in the next 10 years. After the biggest tax increase in \nhistory, President Clinton has repeatedly denied working Americans a \ntax refund and refuses to return tax overpayments to the American \npeople. His last budget again increases taxes instead of cutting them. \nIn a time of surplus, this President is out with a proposal to again \nincrease your taxes.\n  How is this possible? We would all agree that if a customer is \novercharged for a service he receives, the right thing for the merchant \nto do is to return the extra money--not keep it because the merchant \nhas other things he'd like to spend it on. The same principle holds \ntrue for tax overpayments. I strongly believe we should return tax \noverpayments to their rightful owners--the taxpayers--rather than spend \nthem on new government programs. Not only does this money belong to \nthem, but the American people will spend it far more intelligently than \nWashington politicians ever could.\n  Mr. President, on this somber income tax anniversary, I argue that we \nhave no choice but to repeal the income tax and abolish the IRS. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in a pledge that we will dedicate ourselves to \nreplacing the Tax Code with a better system early next Congress, as we \ncontinue to do everything we can to reduce the existing tax burden on \nthe overtaxed American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1286-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1286-S1288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as one of the two California Senators, \nthis is a very big day for two Californians who have been nominated for \nthe Ninth Circuit Court: In the case of Richard Paez, more than 4 years \nago, the longest time anyone has had to wait for a vote in a 100-year \nhistory; and Marsha Berzon, nominated a couple of years ago.\n  I am grateful we have gotten to this day. I am very hopeful. In \nfairness, our colleagues from both sides of the aisle will make a \nstatement on this cloture vote, if we have to have a cloture vote, that \nthey do deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  I will attempt in the next few minutes to put a face on the \nnominations. I had about 5 minutes to speak yesterday and will take a \nlittle bit longer today.\n  I will introduce Marsha Berzon, who is a stellar attorney. She is \nshown with her husband and her two children. This is a wonderful woman. \nThe whole family has been so excited about her nomination, but every \ntime we think we will have a vote, we don't seem to get there.\n  I say to Marsha and her family: We will have a vote and I am \noptimistic you are going to be seated on this bench.\n  Marsha Berzon is exquisitely qualified, as is Richard Paez. She is a \nnative of Ohio. She was raised in New York. She now lives in \nCalifornia, is married to Stephen Berzon, shown here. She practices law \nwith her husband and is a mom of two youngsters.\n  She was first nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit in January of 1998, and she testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in July of 1998. There was no action on her \nnomination in the 105th Congress, so her nomination was sent back and \nshe testified on June 16, 1999. Then she was favorably reported out of \nthe committee.\n  We are very hopeful since the committee considered her to be very \nwell qualified that the Senate will agree.\n  Let me give a few of her qualifications. She is a nationally known \nand extremely well-regarded appellate litigator. She is a graduate of \nHarvard/Radcliffe College and Boalt Hall University of Law. She served \nas a law clerk for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge James \nBrowning, and for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. She has \nargued four cases in the Supreme Court of the United States and filed \ndozens of briefs in the Court in a wide variety of cases. She is \npraised broadly not only by those whom she had as clients, but more \ntelling, I think, she is praised by the people she opposed, people on \nthe other side of the case. People of both political parties have \npraised Marsha.\n  I could go on with the extensive quotations of the high regard she is \nheld in, but they were printed in the Record yesterday.\n  She is supported by Senator Hatch. He is also supporting Richard \nPaez. Arlen Specter is very strongly in favor of her. She is supported \nby former Republican Senator James McClure of Idaho. She has the \nsupport of Paul Haerle, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, \nFirst Appellate District in California, who is the former chair of the \nCalifornia Republican Party and a former point secretary to then-\nGovernor and then-President Ronald Reagan.\n  She has tremendous support from law enforcement: From the president \nof the California Correctional Peace Officers Association; from Arthur \nReddy, International Union of Police Associations; Robert Scully, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations; from William Sieber, \npresident of the Los Angeles Professional Peace Officers Association. \nShe has a huge amount of support in the business community which I \nthink is important to those on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a list of supporters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Letters of Support for Marsha S.

You will see \nmany attorneys who have come to appreciate Marsha. Again, this is a \nwoman who has tremendous support in the community, Republican and \nDemocrat; a fine family member. She will be an asset to this court and \nI am very hopeful Marsha will receive the overwhelming vote of this \nbody.\n  Did my friend have a question? I would say to my friend, he is, I \nknow, waiting to speak. I also had to wait quite a while. I am going to \nbe about another 15 minutes.\n  So today we have this wonderful opportunity, yes, on Marsha, and we \nhave an opportunity to say yes to another wonderful nominee, Richard \nPaez. Again, to put a face on it, here is Richard's face. This is a \nwonderful human being. He is a wonderful judge with many years of \nexperience on the bench. He is a wonderful family man, married to his \nwife Dianne for quite a while, with two terrific kids. He is very \ninvolved with his children's lives, involved in their sports and \nacademic achievements. He is someone most deserving of this honor I \nhope we are about to bestow upon him.\n  Yes, Richard has waited for 4 years. This has been very difficult for \nhim. It has been very difficult for his family. But I can only say I am \nnot going to look back. I want to look ahead. We are going to have a \nvote, and I am very hopeful we will see the tide turn in his favor. \nEverything I see now leads me to believe that.\n  Richard has the support of Senators Hatch and Specter and he just got \nthe public support of Senator Domenici. We have a statement from him, \nwhich will take me just a moment to find. I am very pleased about it.\n  Yesterday, Senator Domenici has a statement in the Record. He says:\n\n       I rise today to announce I intend to vote to confirm Judge \n     Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. He has waited 4 years. I \n     believe the time has come.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I have reviewed Judge Paez' record, including some of the \n     issues which appear controversial. I am satisfied he has \n     adequately responded to the concerns.\n\n  I will paraphrase. He talks about those concerns. Then he goes on and \nsays:\n\n       Mr. President, Judge Paez has earned bipartisan support \n     from a variety of sources.\n\n  He goes through those.\n  I called Senator Domenici this morning--I didn't have a chance to \nspeak to him because he was at a hearing--to thank him profusely for \nhis support. This is a deserving man. I am proud to see Senators from \nthe other side stepping up to the plate and supporting him. I think it \nis so important.\n  Richard Anthony Paez was born in Salt Lake City, UT, which happens to \nbe the hometown of our distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He graduated in 1969 from Brigham Young University and \nreceived his law degree from Boalt Hall at the University of California \nat Berkeley in 1972.\n  For 13 years, he served as municipal court judge. Then he was \nnominated to the district court. He has been in that capacity now for \nabout 5\\1/2\\ years. As the first Mexican American on that district \nbench, he has proven himself to be a role model and a real leader.\n  He has won the respect of law enforcement and attorneys who practice \nin his court. They have analyzed his rulings. We have an amazing \narticle that I have already had printed in the Record. I wanted to \nrefer my colleagues to it. It is from the Daily Journal, a very open, \nbipartisan review of Richard Paez. People from the most liberal to the \nmost conservative who looked at Richard's record, Judge Paez's record, \nessentially said his decisions will stand the test of time. His \nopinions are praised as being well reasoned. So I think we know Judge \nPaez will be fair.\n\n  He has received the endorsement of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the Los \nAngeles County Police Chiefs' Association, the current district \nattorney, Gil Garcetti, and the late Sheriff Sherman Block of Los \nAngeles, Republican sheriff in Los Angeles. Listen to what the LA \nPolice Protective League said:\n\n       . . . he has a reputation for integrity, fairness and \n     objectivity, all qualities we believe essential for a member \n     of the Appellate Court.\n\n  The lawyers who appear before him have praised his skills. Yesterday, \nI read comments from some of them. I will repeat some of these \ncomments:\n\n       He is a wonderful judge.\n       He's outstanding.\n       He rates a 12 or 13 on a scale of 10.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I don't know anyone here who has not been exceedingly \n     impressed by him.\n\n  Another:\n\n       I think he has great temperament. He never says or does \n     anything that's off.\n       He has a very good demeanor. He's very professional. He \n     doesn't have any quirks.\n\n  So it goes on and on. It is a wonderful thing to be supporting Judge \nPaez because I feel I have so many objective people saying so many good \nthings about him.\n  A law professor who looked at one of the rulings said:\n\n       The opinion is clear, concise, straightforward, logical--\n\n  I think this is important to my colleagues from the other side--\n\n     and provides no indication of the author's personal policy \n     predilections on the issue. . . . [It is] implicitly \n     respectful of the separation of powers among the branches of \n     government.\n\n  Again, we have so many Republicans supporting Richard outside of this \nChamber and, hopefully, enough inside this Chamber so we can get him \nthrough. But let me tell you some of those outside the Chamber.\n  Sheldon Sloan, a former California judge, former president of the LA \nCounty Bar, the former head of Governor Pete Wilson's Judicial \nSelection\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\nCommittee--here is the man who picked the judges for Governor Pete \nWilson--wrote a letter to Chairman Hatch, saying that Judge Paez:\n\n       . . . has performed his duties with distinction and he is \n     held in great esteem by all who worked with him, be the \n     members of the bench or of the Bar.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Richard Paez is a hard-working, experienced, quality Judge. \n     He can be strong without being overbearing and he can be \n     compassionate without being soft. He has been, and he will \n     continue to be, a credit to the judiciary as a whole.\n\n  The American Bar Association gave Judge Paez the highest rating \npossible.\n  When I hear colleagues come over here, and they had every right in \nthe world to vote no on this nomination; absolutely. I do not want to \noverstate it, but I would lay down my life for their right to do what \nthey think is right. But the one thing with which I take issue is when \nthe record is distorted. I do not think it is purposely distorted, but \nRichard has some people who do not want him to be on the bench, and \nthey distorted things. We have heard things on the floor; that there \nwere games being played in the district court when he got certain \ncases; that Judge Paez is soft on criminals when, in fact, a review \nthat was requested by Senator Sessions showed, on the contrary, that \nJudge Paez is tougher than most.\n  This shows his downward departures in sentencing--in other words the \ntimes he has sentenced less than the guidelines--were far fewer than \nthe average court. He granted downward departures only 6 percent of the \ntime when U.S. district courts granted downward departures 13.6 percent \nof the time. So he has been tough. He has an excellent record on \ncriminal appeals. He has not been reversed once on a criminal sentence.\n  I feel he has a strong sentencing record. Then, again, when Senator \nSessions says he gave too easy a sentence to certain people, as Senator \nSpecter put in the Record yesterday, he was following what the \nprosecution asked him to do to the letter. He was following what the \nprosecution asked him to do. So if there is any gripe about it, it is \nwith the prosecutor. He did what the prosecutor asked.\n  So, I ask my colleagues--I would love to ask Senator Hutchinson how \nmuch time he needs on the floor, and Senator Specter, because I have \nanother few minutes, but I would like to accommodate them.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think morning business is for 10 minutes. That is \nwhat I need, 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And my colleague?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond, I spoke in support of \nJudge Paez yesterday. I would like to speak for about 4 minutes on a \nmatter, if I could squeeze in here?\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I make a suggestion, and may I ask a question? I am \nabout to wrap up on Judge Paez and put a number of things in the \nRecord. I have a question.\n  Mr. President, would it be in order to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Hutchinson be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, \nSenator Specter for 7 minutes, and I will come back for another 10 \nminutes so I can give my friends time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, is that a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, can I persuade my colleague to let me \nhave 4 minutes ahead of him?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I revise the request to ask for 4 minutes \nfor Senator Specter, 10 minutes for the good Senator from Arkansas who \nhas been waiting, and 10 minutes for this Senator. This is after I \nfinish my remarks, which will be in a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends.\n  I will conclude about Judge Paez in this fashion. I will have printed \nin the Record the extensive list of his supporters--elected officials, \nboth Republican and Democratic, national law enforcement associations, \nCalifornia State judges and justices, bar leaders, business leaders, \ncommunity leaders, attorneys, and Hispanic groups. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSupport For the Honorable Richard A.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe ``Report on the Investigation of Espionage Allegations against Dr. \nWen Ho Lee.'' I have circulated this 65-page report with a Dear \nColleague letter today, but I think it important to speak about it on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The Dear Colleague letter urges Senators to support S. 2089 which is \ndesigned to reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to avoid \nthe mistakes which were made in the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee.\n  In the Wen Ho Lee matter, the FBI went to the Attorney General \npersonally to ask for approval for a FISA warrant and was turned down. \nThe Attorney General in August of 1997 assigned the matter to a \nsubordinate who had no experience on FISA matters. The Attorney General \ndid not check on the matter, and the FBI request was, therefore, \nrejected. The FBI then let the matter languish for some 16 months \nbefore taking any investigative action.\n  At that stage, the Department of Energy meddled in the matter by \ngiving a lie detector test to Dr. Lee, representing he had passed it \nwhen, in fact, he failed it, throwing the FBI investigation off course. \nThe FBI then gave another polygraph on February 10\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\nwhich Dr. Lee failed, but there was no action taken to remove him from \nthe office until March 8, so that he stood with access to this very \nimportant information for some 19 months.\n  This information was so important that, according to the testimony of \nDr. Stephen Younger at the bail hearing, it could change the global \nstrategic balance.\n\n  The legislation seeks to correct these failures by requiring the \nAttorney General personally to review the matter when requested in \nwriting by the Director of the FBI, and then, if the FISA application \nis declined, to state in writing the reasons, which will give a roadmap \nto the FBI as to what to do, and then for the Director of the FBI to \npersonally supervise the investigation and to centralize the authority \nof the FBI to keep the meddling of the Department of Energy \nillustratively out of it.\n  This report is disagreed with in some manner by the Department of \nJustice, and there is some disagreement by other Federal agencies and \nsome Senators. But it sets out a narrative, and anybody who has a \ndisagreement will have an opportunity to testify before the oversight \nsubcommittee.\n  This legislation has been cosponsored by Senator Torricelli, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Biden, Senator Thurmond, Senator Feingold, Senator \nSessions, Senator Schumer, Senator Helms, and Senator Leahy. There is \nwidespread support for the legislation even though there is some \ndisagreement as to whether the probable cause was adequate for the FISA \nwarrant or some of the other specific statements of fact.\n  This report has been prepared with the exhaustive work of Mr. Dobie \nMcArthur. It summarizes in detail what happened on the errors of the \nWen Ho Lee investigation. I am circulating it, as I say, with a Dear \nColleague letter to Senators.\n  I think it is an important matter. It has been cleared by the \nDepartment of Justice and other agencies so that it does not contain \nany classified information. It can be found at my Senate website: \nwww.Senate.gov/Specter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Dear Colleague letter and the \nexecutive summary be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2000.\n       Dear Colleague: I urge you to support S. 2089 which would \n     reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to \n     prevent future lapses like the ones which plagued the \n     investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. Had these reforms been in \n     effect, a FISA warrant would doubtless have been issued and \n     major risks to U.S. national security could have been \n     avoided.\n       The seriousness of Dr. Lee's downloading classified codes \n     onto an unclassified computer was summarized at his bail \n     hearing on December 13, 1999 when Dr. Stephen Younger, \n     Assistant Laboratory Director for Nuclear Weapons at Los \n     Alamos, testified:\n       ``These codes and their associated data bases and the input \n     file, combined with someone that knew how to use them, could, \n     in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global \n     strategic balance.'' (Emphasis added)\n       While the overall investigation of Dr. Lee from 1982 \n     through 1999 contained substantial errors and omissions by \n     the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice, \n     including the FBI, the failure of DoJ to authorize the FISA \n     warrant in August 1997 and the failure of the FBI to pursue \n     prompt follow-up investigation gave Dr. Lee a critical \n     opportunity to download highly classified information.\n       The Attorney General was personally requested by ranking \n     FBI officials to approve the FISA warrant. She did not check \n     on the matter after assigning it to a DoJ subordinate who \n     applied the wrong standard and admitted it was the first time \n     he had worked on a FISA request. After DoJ declined to \n     approve the FISA warrant request, the FBI investigation \n     languished for 16 months (August 1997 to December 1998) with \n     the Department of Energy permitting Dr. Lee to continue on \n     the job with access to extremely sensitive information from \n     August 1997 until March 1999.\n       Senator Torricelli summed up the situation in his February \n     24th floor statement supporting S. 2089:\n       ``There was a startling, almost unbelievable failure of \n     coordination and communication between the Department of \n     Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Energy in dealing \n     with this matter, and only through that lack of coordination \n     with this matter, and only through that lack of coordination \n     was an allegation of possible espionage able to lead to 17 \n     years of continued access and the possibility that this \n     information was compromised.'' (Congressional Record S801)\n       This bill would require the Attorney General to personally \n     decide whether a FISA warrant should be approved by DoJ when \n     personally requested in writing by the FBI Director, the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense or the Director \n     of Central Intelligence. If the Attorney General declines, \n     the reasons must be set forth in writing.\n       This bill would further require the FBI Director to \n     personally supervise the follow-up investigation to secure \n     additional evidence/information to obtain the FISA warrant. \n     The bill further provides that the individual need not be \n     ``presently engaged'' in the particular activity since \n     espionage frequently spans years or decades and improves the \n     coordination of counter intelligence activities among Federal \n     agencies.\n       I am enclosing for your review: (1) a copy of S. 2089; (2) \n     a sixty-five page Report on the Investigation of Espionage \n     Allegations against Dr. Wen Ho Lee, including a five-page \n     Executive Summary. Circulation of this Report has been \n     delayed until the Department of Justice including the FBI, \n     the CIA and the Department of Energy agreed that the Report \n     does not contain classified information.\n       While the Department of Justice and some Senators disagree \n     with some of the conclusions in this Report, there has been \n     general agreement that legislation is warranted. To date S. \n     2089 has been co-sponsored by Senators Torricelli, Grassley, \n     Biden, Thurmond, Feingold, Sessions, Schumer, Helms and \n     Leahy.\n       If you are interested in co-sponsoring, please contact me \n     at 224-9011 or have your staff contact Dobie McArthur at 224-\n     4259.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\nReport on the Investigation of Espionage Allegations Against Dr. Wen Ho \n                           Lee, March 8, 2000\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       While the full impact of the errors and omissions by the \n     Department of Energy and the Department of Justice, including \n     the FBI, on the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee requires \n     reading the full report, this summary covers some of the \n     highlights.\n       The importance of Dr. Lee's case was articulated at his \n     bail hearing on December 13, 1999 when Dr. Stephen Younger, \n     Assistant Laboratory Director for Nuclear Weapons at Los \n     Alamos, testified:\n       ``These codes and their associated data bases and the input \n     file, combined with someone that knew how to use them, could, \n     in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global \n     strategic balance.'' (Emphasis added)\n       As Dr. Younger further noted about the codes Dr. Lee \n     mishandled:\n       ``They enable the possessor to design the only objects that \n     could result in the military defeat of America's conventional \n     forces . . . They represent the gravest possible security \n     risk to . . . the supreme national interest.'' (Emphasis \n     added)\n       It would be hard, realistically impossible, to pose more \n     severe risks to U.S. national security.\n       Although the FBI knew Dr. Lee had access to highly \n     classified information, had repeated contacts with the PRC \n     scientists and lied about his activities, the FBI \n     investigation was inept. In December 1982, Dr. Lee called a \n     former employee of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who \n     was suspected of passing classified information to the PRC. \n     Notwithstanding the facts that Dr. Lee denied (lied) about \n     calling that person, admitted to sending documents to Taiwan \n     marked ``no foreign dissemination'' and made other \n     misrepresentations to the FBI in 1983 and 1984, the FBI \n     closed its investigation in March 1984.\n       A new investigation was initiated in 1994 by the FBI after \n     Dr. Lee failed in his obligation to report a meeting with a \n     high ranking PRC nuclear scientist who said that Dr. Lee had \n     been helpful to China's nuclear program. This contact \n     occurred at a time when the PRC had computerized codes to \n     which Dr. Lee had unique access. Notwithstanding good cause \n     to actively pursue this investigation, the FBI deferred its \n     inquiry from November 2, 1995 to May 30, 1996 because of a \n     Department of Energy Administrative Inquiry, which was \n     developed by a DoE counterintelligence expert in concert with \n     a seasoned FBI agent who had been assigned to the DOE for the \n     purposes of the inquiry.\n       In the 1993-1994 time frame, DoE was incredibly lax in \n     failing to pursue obvious evidence that Dr. Lee was \n     downloading large quantities of classified information to an \n     unclassified system. According to Dr. Stephen Younger, it was \n     access to that information which would eventually enable \n     the ``possessor'' to ``defeat America's conventional \n     forces''. DoE's ineptitude had disastrous consequences \n     when the FBI asked DoE's counter-intelligence team leader \n     for access to Dr. Lee's computer and the team leader did \n     not know Dr. Lee had signed a consent-to-monitor waiver.\n       The most serious mistake in this sequence of events \n     occurred when DoJ did not forward the FBI request for a \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to the \n     FISA court where:\n       (1) The FBI presented ample, if not overwhelming, \n     information to justify the warrant;\n       (2) The Attorney General assigned the matter to a DoJ \n     subordinate who applied the\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n     wrong standard and admitted it was the first time he had \n     worked on a FISA request;\n       (3) Notwithstanding Assistant FBI Director John Lewis's \n     request to the Attorney General for the FISA warrant, the \n     Attorney General did not check on the matter after assigning \n     it to her inexperienced subordinate.\n       After DoJ's decision not to forward the FBI's request for a \n     FISA warrant, which could have been reversed with the \n     submission of further evidence, the FBI investigation \n     languished for 16 months with DoE permitting Dr. Lee to \n     continue on the job with access to classified information.\n       On the eve of the release of the Cox Committee Report that \n     was expected to be highly critical of DoE, DoE arranged with \n     Wackenhut, a security firm with which the DoE had a contract, \n     to polygraph Dr. Lee on December 23, 1998 upon his return \n     from Taiwan. According to FBI protocol, Dr. Lee would have \n     been questioned as part of the post-travel interview. \n     However, the case agents were inexplicably unprepared to \n     conduct such an interview. Ultimately, the polygraph decision \n     was coordinated between DoE and the FBI's National Security \n     Division. The selection of Wackenhut to conduct this \n     polygraph was questioned by the President's Foreign \n     Intelligence Advisory Board and criticized as \n     ``irresponsible'' by the FBI agent working Dr. Lee's case.\n       The FBI's investigation was thrown off course when they \n     were told Dr. Lee had passed the December 23, 1998 polygraph \n     which the Secretary of DoE announced on national TV in March \n     1999.\n       A review of the Wackenhut polygraph records by late January \n     contradicted the Department of Energy's claims that Dr. Lee \n     had passed the December 1998 polygraph; and a February 10, \n     1999 FBI polygraph of Dr. Lee confirmed his failure. In the \n     interim from mid-January, Dr. Lee began a sequence of massive \n     file deletions which continued on February 10, 11, 12 and 17 \n     after he failed the February 10, 1999 polygraph.\n       It was not until three weeks after the February 10, 1999 \n     polygraph that the FBI asked for and received permission to \n     search Dr. Lee's computer which led to his firing on March 8, \n     1999. A search warrant for his home was not obtained until \n     April 9, 1999. Those delays are inexplicable in a matter of \n     this importance.\n       The investigation of Dr. Lee demonstrates the need for \n     remedial legislation to:\n       1. Require that upon the personal request of the Director \n     of the FBI, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense \n     or the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General \n     will personally review a FISA application submitted by the \n     requesting official.\n       2. Where the Attorney General declines a FISA application, \n     the declination must be communicated in writing to the \n     requesting official, with specific recommendations regarding \n     additional investigative steps that should be taken to \n     establish the requisite probable cause.\n       3. The official making a request for Attorney General \n     review must personally supervise the implementation of the \n     Attorney General's recommendations.\n       4. Explicitly eliminate any requirement that the suspect be \n     ``presently engaged'' in the suspect activity.\n       5. Require disclosure of any relevant relationship between \n     a suspect and a federal law enforcement or intelligence \n     agency.\n       6. Require that when the FBI desires, for investigative \n     reasons, to leave in place a suspect who has access to \n     classified information, that decision must be communicated in \n     writing to the head of the affected agency, along with a plan \n     to minimize the potential harm to the national security. \n     National security concerns will take precedence over \n     investigative concerns.\n       7. The affected agency head must likewise respond in \n     writing, and any disagreements over the proper course of \n     action will be referred to the National Counterintelligence \n     Policy Board.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I have heard from hundreds of private \nlandowners, forest owners, and farmers in Arkansas who are greatly \nconcerned about the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to \nrewrite portions of the Clean Water Act.\n  I know the Senator from Idaho has been very much involved in this \nissue, has had hearings on this, and has been a leader in determining \nexactly what the EPA intends to do.\n  In August of last year, as the occupant of the chair knows, the EPA \nproposed a regulation which requires States to renew their efforts to \nfully implement a so-called voluntary total maximum daily load, or \nTMDL, program.\n  The States, in conjunction with the EPA, would establish TMDLs for \nwater bodies statewide. If States fail to meet those TMDL guidelines, \nthe EPA would then have the authority to enforce the new water quality \nstandards. I believe that is what this agency had in mind all along.\n  Should the EPA be successful in carrying out their plans, this \nregulation will have a direct impact on two of my State's most \nimportant industries: agriculture and timber. Agriculture and forestry \nactivity, which the EPA currently treats as potential ``non-point \nsource'' polluters, could be regulated as point source pollution.\n  A regulation requiring foresters, private landowners and farmers to \nobtain discharge permits for traditional forestry and agriculture \nactivities is costly, overly burdensome and unnecessary.\n  I believe this is yet another deliberate attempt to circumvent the \nClean Water Act and legislate through regulation. Rewriting TMDL \nrequirements and redefining point source pollution should be addressed \nwhen Congress, the elected representatives of the people, reauthorizes \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  Arkansas has put forth a tremendous effort to implement statewide \nBest Management Practices and other water quality regulations.\n  If my State is required to establish and enforce expanded federal, \none-size-fits-all TMDL standards, it must redirect already limited \nfunds and resources away from successful State implementation programs \nand hand them over to bureaucratic EPA procedures and oversight.\n  These are some of the reasons why landowners in Arkansas are so \nupset. In early January I spoke at a meeting in El Dorado, AR, where \n1,500 people attended to voice their concerns.\n  A few weeks later, 3,000 people attended a similar meeting in \nTexarkana, AR. Although the public comment period for this proposed \nregulation is over, a third meeting scheduled for later this month is \nexpected to draw similar crowds.\n  The thousands of people who attend these meetings have families, busy \nschedules, and many other responsibilities, but they are willing to \nsacrifice their time to learn more about this proposed regulation and \nhow it will affect their livelihood.\n  One of the core issues motivating Arkansans to attend public meetings \nby the thousand is trust. Ultimately, the people of my State do not \ntrust the EPA. In other words, the EPA has not earned the trust of my \nconstituents.\n  Clearly, the EPA has done an incredibly poor job communicating their \nproposal to those whom it will affect the most. During my time in \npublic service, I have never seen this kind of public outcry to \nanything the EPA has done.\n  In response to the reaction from foresters, private landowners and \nfarmers, private landowners and farmers in Arkansas, I have introduced \nS. 2139, the Timber and Agriculture Fairness Act.\n  My bill consists of two simple parts: First, it exempts silviculture \noperations and agriculture stormwater discharges from EPA's National \nPollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting requirements; and, \nsecond, it defines nonpoint source pollution relating to both \nagriculture stormwater discharges and silviculture operations.\n  This two-prong approach, I believe, is the sensible way to winning \nback the trust of Arkansans and the American people.\n  We must remind ourselves that we have a Government ``of the people, \nby\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\nthe people, and for the people.'' By passing this legislation, we will \ngive the Government back to its original owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2139.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from California for fitting \nme in between her comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator from California for allowing me to \ntake a few moments to address the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1291-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONALD E. DIXON\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement in \nrecognition of one of my very close friends out in Idaho who has just \nhad a wonderful accomplishment in his life. He is a neighbor, a friend, \nand a member of my staff from Idaho, Don Dixon.\n  On March 24, Don will be given the distinct honor of induction into \nthe Eastern Idaho Agriculture Hall of Fame. The honor reflects his \ncommitment to farming in Idaho and the respect and esteem in which he \nis held in our community. I know you join eastern Idaho and myself in \nextending to Don congratulations on this achievement.\n  Don is a lifelong farmer and resident of Idaho Falls, ID. He owns and \ntends the farm his grandfather purchased in 1900 and, thereafter, was \nowned by his father. Apparently, the farming bug hit Don hard because \nhe took over the Dixon operation with his brother soon after college \nand his military service. A measure of his success is reflected by his \ncontinued expansion of the farm and livestock and the handover of a \nsolid operation to his son.\n  For years, Don's work has produced some of the region's best \npotatoes, in a State that has the world's finest spuds, cattle, hay, \nand grain. In this time of agriculture distress and low prices, Don has \ndemonstrated himself to be a model farmer by taking steps to protect \nthe environment by undertaking the best management practices and water \nconservation through improved irrigation techniques. We can all be \nproud of his work to be a productive member of the agriculture \ncommunity and a good steward of the land.\n  Although his induction into the Hall of Fame is a special \naccomplishment, Don has long been chosen as a representative of his \ncommunity. He has been an active member of eastern Idaho's business and \nagriculture organizations for as long as I can remember. Don has served \non the board of the Eastern Idaho State Fair and, for 6 years, served \non the Idaho Potato Commission, a post nominated by our Governor. His \nrecognition at the national level is evident from Don's successes as \nDirector of the National Potato Promotion Board.\n  In 1995, Don joined my staff and served with distinction through the \nbalance of my House tenure, working on agriculture and natural \nresources issues. He was instrumental in my work with farmers and \nranchers throughout the State during the debate on the 1996 farm bill. \nWhen I was elected to the Senate in 1998, Don agreed to continue our \npartnership by becoming my State Director of Agriculture, a position he \nhas fulfilled with distinction and widely-held respect.\n  Don has served the people of Idaho above and beyond the call of duty, \nmeeting more farmers and community leaders than any of his peers and \nprobably has logged enough miles on his pickup truck to circumnavigate \nthe world several times. The patience and understanding of his wife \nGeorgia, his four children, and extended family for his work is a \ntestament to Don's commitment to service and leadership in eastern \nIdaho's agriculture community.\n  Don's generosity and good-natured approach to life and work is also \nreflected in his induction into the Eastern Idaho Agriculture Hall of \nFame. He is a valued counselor and friend of my entire family. I salute \nhim on the accomplishment of this high honor. I know you and my \ncolleagues in the Senate join me in offering our congratulations to Don \nDixon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who were able to \nwork out time back and forth on various issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1291-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATIONS OF MARSHA BERZON AND RICHARD PAEZ\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

This treaty, signed by President Carter, almost made it to the \nSenate floor some 6 years ago when it was voted favorably out of the \nForeign Relations Committee. Unfortunately, it was never brought up. \nThe treaty is called CEDAW. It stands for the Convention on the \nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\n  This is a treaty that has been nicknamed the Magna Carta for women \nbecause it essentially gives basic human rights to women all over the \nworld. That is why 165 nations, all of our allies and friends in the \nworld, have in fact ratified it. But we haven't ratified it. One might \nsay, well, who hasn't ratified it? I am sorry to say, we are standing \nwith such stalwarts of democracy as Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and \nSomalia. We don't belong in that company. This country is, in fact, a \nleader of human rights. It is really an embarrassment that we have not \nbrought that treaty to the Senate floor.\n  I wrote a resolution that calls on the Senate to ask the Foreign \nRelations Committee to hold a hearing on CEDAW. It now has 25 \ncosponsors, including Republicans. It is very simple. It expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations--that is a committee on which I serve--should hold hearings, \nand the Senate should act on CEDAW, should take action on this \nconvention to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. The \nresolution goes through why this treaty is so important. It talks about \nhow important it is that CEDAW be enacted: because it would help give \nwomen equal rights, equal opportunity, equal education; it would help \nthem get protection against violence. We know that happens all over the \nworld where women don't have equal rights. And it would give us the \nclout, if you will, the portfolio to be stronger as a world leader.\n  The bottom line of this is that today I asked the Democratic \nleadership to ask unanimous consent to bring this resolution that I \nwrote to the floor. The resolution doesn't say ratify this convention. \nIt simply says to the Foreign Relations Committee, please hold \nhearings.\n  It was objected to by the other side of the aisle because they don't \nwant to have this hearing. I will discuss that because it is with great \nrespect that I bring up these differences between the two sides of the \naisle. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, with whom I \nhave a wonderful relationship, a very good working relationship, took \nto the floor of the Senate today. He unequivocally stated--and when he \nwants to be unequivocal, he can--that he will not hold hearings on the \nConvention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. And \nhe explained why. I totally respect his right to have this\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nview, but I will paraphrase the reasons he gave as to why he doesn't \nwant to hold hearings on this. I will offer another view.\n  First, he said he wasn't going to hold hearings because there are \nradical groups behind this treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of the \norganizations that have endorsed the women's convention.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Organizations That Have Endorsed the Women's Convention (Partial List)\n\n     Action for Development\n     *American Association of Retired Persons\n     *American Association of University Women\n     *American Bar Association\n     American College of Nurse-Midwives\n     American Council for the United Nations University\n     American Federation of Teachers\n     *American Friends Service Committee\n     *American Jewish Committee\n     *American Nurses Association\n     American Veterans Committee\n     Americans for Democratic Action, Inc.\n     *Amnesty International USA\n     Association for Women in Development\n     Association for Women in Psychology\n     Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith\n     *Baha'is of the United States\n     Black Women's Agenda\n     *B'nai B'rith International\n     Bread for the World\n     *Business and Professional Women/USA\n     BVM Network for Women's Issues\n     Catholics for A Free Choice\n     Center for Advancement of Public Policy\n     Center for Policy Alternatives\n     Center for Reproductive Law and Policy\n     Center for Women's Global Leadership\n     Center of Concern\n     Chicago Catholic Women\n     Church of the Brethren, Washington Office\n     *Church Women United\n     Coalition on Religion & Ecology\n     Coalition for Women in International Development\n     Columban Fathers' Justice & Peace Office\n     Commission on the Advancement of Women/InterAction\n     D.C.

With the Chair's indulgence, I will read to the Senate \njust a few of these organizations. I want the Senate to decide if these \norganizations are radical or in any way not in the mainstream of \nthought. These are just some of the organizations that say, yes, the \nUnited States should ratify this treaty to end all forms of \ndiscrimination against women: the American Association of Retired \nPersons; the American Association of University Women; the American \nJewish Committee; Amnesty International USA; the Bahais of the United \nStates; the Black Women's Agenda; the B'nai B'rith International; \nBusiness and Professional Women USA; Chicago Catholic Women; Church of \nthe Brethren, Washington Office; Church Women United; Episcopal Church; \nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church of America; Hadassah; Human Rights \nWatch; The Humane Society; Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; \nLeadership Conference of Women Religious; National Association of \nCommission for Women; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; the \nNational Coalition of American Nuns; the National Council of Churches \nof Christ in the USA; the National Council of Women's Organizations; \nthe Presbyterian Church, Washington Office; the Soroptimist \nInternational of the Americas; the Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations; the Unitarian Universalist Association, Washington \nOffice; the United Methodist Church; the Women's Legal Defense Fund; \nand the YWCA of the United States of America.\n  I don't mind debating an issue on its merits, its demerits, its \nflaws, its problems. But to come to the Senate floor and say the people \nbehind this convention to eliminate all forms of discrimination against \nwomen are radicals is simply not a fact in evidence, unless you think \nHadassah is radical or the nuns are radical or all these churches and \norganizations are radical. They are far from radical. They are \nmainstream America. Mainstream America supports this, and we can't get \na hearing because our chairman believes these groups are radical.\n  I understand some tactics have been used to get the chairman's \nattention to hold this hearing that he does not appreciate. And that is \nhis right. But I beg my chairman to look past that and understand that \nthese groups are in the mainstream of America. America should be in the \nleadership and out front on this issue. So the first point he made, I \ndo not agree with, that radicals are behind this treaty.\n  Secondly, his other argument was that signing this international \ntreaty would interfere with our sovereignty; in other words, it would \ninterfere with us as lawmakers to do our job, would interfere with our \nlaws. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have thousands of \ninternational treaties of which we are a part. They are all in this \nbook. I won't put this in the Record because it would cost too much to \nprint, but it is page after page with almost every civilized country. \nWe\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\nhave treaties with them on all kinds of things--on science, on military \naid, on human rights.\n  I will give you a couple that we signed on human rights. We are a \nparty to a number of human rights treaties. One in particular is the \nU.N. Convention Against Torture, and other cruel, inhumane, and \ndegrading treatment or punishment. We ratified that in 1990. The \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified in \n1992. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination, ratified in 1994.\n  So to say that these treaties will interfere with us just doesn't \nmake any sense. Again, it is just not a fact in evidence.\n  The third reason my chairman says he doesn't want to hold a hearing \nis that he believes the whole purpose of this convention is to grant \nwomen the right to choose. In other words, in his opinion, this whole \nthing is about abortion rights. I want to say again how off the mark I \nthink that suggestion is. When the committee voted this convention out \nfor ratification 6 years ago, there was a big debate on this matter. \nWhat the committee did--by the way, I will support it overwhelmingly--\nit said this treaty and this convention is abortion neutral. It \nspecifically said it ``does not create or reflect an international \nright to abortion or sanction abortion as a means of family planning.'' \nIt goes on, ``We don't endorse it as a means of family planning,'' et \ncetera. The understanding states that ``nothing in the convention \nreflects or creates a right to abortion'' and that ``in no case should \nabortion be promoted as a method of family planning.''\n  So these issues that the chairman of the committee has raised, in my \nopinion, are straw men, or straw people, or straw women. They are not \nfact. The fact is, when we voted out this convention 6 years ago, we \nspecifically stated it had nothing to do with abortion. The fact is \nthat 165 nations have passed this, and we are standing with the most \nretrograde, rogue states in our opposition to it. There are thousands \nand thousands of treaties that do not interfere with our rights of \nsovereignty. The fact is that it has nothing to do with abortion. The \nmost mainstream groups--and I have read some of them to you, and they \nare all that way--are behind this treaty and are working very hard to \nget it done.\n  Now, 21 years ago, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a treaty. Twenty \nyears ago, President Carter signed the treaty. So it is really long \noverdue. I don't want to stand with Iran, Sudan, Somalia, and North \nKorea, as the rare nations who have not ratified this. I think it is a \ndisgrace that we are not a party to this treaty. We know since 1981, \nwhen it entered into force, it has had a positive impact on the \ncountries that have signed it. One such example is constitutional \nreform in Brazil, which brought significant guarantees of women's human \nrights, and CEDAW provides the framework for articulating these rights.\n  There are many other wonderful things that have happened worldwide as \na result of this treaty. Other nations have copied word for word from \nthe treaty the kinds of rights they are going to give women in their \nnations. We have an important book, ``Bringing Equality Home,'' which \nshows how many good things have happened because of that.\n  You might say, Senator Boxer, why does America have to act if these \ngood things are happening? The fact is, we have to act because we \nshould be proud that all of the things in this treaty we already do in \nour country. So we should be a leader, not a follower, on this. And we \nneed that portfolio because when there is a case of a country that is \nnot doing right by its women--and let me give you a case in point. \nThere was a case in Kuwait where women were struggling to get the right \nto vote. It was a big brouhaha, and everybody thought, my goodness, we \ncame to their assistance in the gulf war, they are going to follow suit \nand women will get the right to vote. Guess what happened. They did \nnot. We were pressing them so hard, but I bet they turned to our \nnegotiator and said, ``Wait a minute, why should we listen to you, you \naren't even a party to the CEDAW treaty.'' It takes away our ability to \nlead for equal rights for women because we have not yet ratified.\n\n  I am very hopeful that Senator Helms will have a change of heart on \nthis, although I believe he does hold strong views. But today I learned \nthat Congressman Gilman, who is the Republican chair of the committee \ncalled the House International Relations Committee, has agreed to hold \nhearings on this treaty.\n  The fact is, it is our business, our work, our job. We are the ones \nwho should be doing it. Although I am very pleased that the House is \ngoing to have the hearing--and I hope I can get over there and testify. \nBut I think we should have our own hearings. After all, we have 25 \nMembers of the Senate who were on this. I will read you the list of \nSenators who have gone on this, asking for hearings on this: Senators \nMurray, Mikulski, Collins, Snowe, Robb, Wellstone, Biden, Lautenberg, \nKennedy, Sarbanes, Cleland, Bob Graham, Jack Reed, Lincoln, Feinstein, \nLandrieu, Feingold, Durbin, Daschle, Leahy, Dodd, Bingaman, Torricelli, \nKerry, and Specter.\n  We have many Republicans and many Democrats. I honestly think that if \neveryone knows about this resolution--and I will work hard on that--we \nwill get some more. We now have a quarter of the Senate on record \nasking for hearings on CEDAW. My view is, since it was voted out \nfavorably 6 years ago by the committee on a bipartisan vote of 13-5, we \nought to do it again and get it moving and bring it down here for \ndebate.\n  Women deserve equal rights, voting rights, human rights. They deserve \nto be protected from violence, either in their own homes or walking \ndown the street. They should be protected against institutional \nviolence. We have seen things that go on in Africa with operations that \nare forced upon women. It is very important that for us to lead in the \nworld, we must be a leader on this treaty.\n  Again, I say to my friends on the other side who oppose this, I \nrespect your right to oppose it. But, my goodness, what about having a \nhearing on it so we can listen to both sides? I think women in this \ncountry are waking up to this fact. There are so many issues we deal \nwith every day. The women in my State are dealing with making it home \nin time to greet their children coming home from school or who are in \nday care. Their husbands are also working and putting dinner on the \ntable and planning all the things they plan for their families. They \nare balancing their lives with their jobs. Do you know what? They care \nabout this.\n  I have had meetings with many women who care about this because we \nare on this Earth right now and we have to try to make it a better \nworld. We can't stop every evil, that is for sure; we know that. But we \ncan stand for equal rights and human rights for people all over the \nworld. We can stand up and say in certain countries women are treated \nlike second-class citizens and, in some cases, not even third-, fourth-\n, or fifth-class citizens; they are treated like property. They have no \nrespect. I just believe this great Nation of ours has come a long way \nto have the equality we have. Sometimes I look at the young women here \nand I think: Do you really know what it was like before women had \nequality?\n  Do you know what it was like when I went to get a job on Wall Street \nafter graduating from college and was told: Women don't work here? The \nmost shocking thing about it was that I said OK. And I packed up my bag \nand left. I didn't even argue with them. It was a given. There were \nonly certain jobs for women.\n  I had to study to pass my test as a stockbroker on my own without the \nbenefit of anyone. Once I got my licensing back, I said: Now, can I \nplease be a stockbroker, and bring commission to this brokerage house, \nby the way? Well, all right, but just do it quietly. We want to make it \nlook like you are a secretary. Those were tough days. It wasn't that \nlong ago. I know I am old, but I am not that old. We faced that kind of \ndiscrimination.\n  Women could not vote until 1920. People look around here and say: Why \naren't there more women? Believe me. I say that every day. But the \nbottom line is we didn't get to vote until 1920. We weren't used to \npower--not even the power to vote until the 1920s. We are learning how \nto deal with it now. But it takes time. Why shouldn't the world learn \nfrom our experience? What\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\nwe know to be a fact and evident is that women are equal. By the way, \nit doesn't mean we are better. We are equal. We are equally good in \nsome cases and equally bad in some cases--not better. But we know that \nand we respect that in this country, although I would still like to see \nthe equal rights amendment be part of the Constitution. But basically \nwe know that. We should take that knowledge and that commitment, and \nmake sure the women of the world have a chance at life. I think we can \ndo it through this treaty. I would think we would be proud to do it \nacross the party line.\n  I think this is going to become an issue in this election because \nthere is no reason why we shouldn't at least hold a hearing and debate \nthese issues.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was down here today. \nHe was eloquent in his opposition. Now I am on the floor and he is not \nhere. I hope I have been a little eloquent on why we should pass the \ntreaty. Why not bring that debate inside the Foreign Relations \nCommittee where it belongs? Why not hear from Senators on both sides \nwho care about this one way or the other? Why not vote it out? Why not \ncome to the floor and have a good debate on these issues, and perhaps \nelevate the Senate? We get into our petty quarrels. Sometimes we take \nup issues that are, frankly, not as important as others. This one would \nbe one that I think would make us all proud, wherever we come out on \nthis matter and on this question. But in terms of the arguments against \nit, I hope I have put the other side out on the table.\n  Good people are behind this treaty--good, mainstream American groups. \nThe treaty is a Magna Carta for women. We ought to be proud of it. We \nought to stand with the countries in the world that are civilized, that \ngive their women equal rights and fair rights. We ought to stand with \nthem. It is time we do it.\n  It is International Women's Day. I will end where I started with \nhappy International Women's Day. I hope when we think about this \nperhaps in the next few days and weeks and months, we will factor in a \nvery important treaty--the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women--on the floor of the Senate for a high-\nlevel debate and a vote.\n  Thank you very much Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon \nto publicly thank my colleague from the State of Washington, Mr. \nGorton, for endorsing my bill, S. 2004, the Pipeline Safety Act of \n2000. I am delighted Senator Gorton joined with me on this very \nimportant public safety issue. Senator Gorton has the respect of many \nin the Senate leadership, and I expect he will be a great help in \nhelping us pass this pipeline safety bill. I look forward to working \nwith him to make sure that the tragedies he talked about today--such as \nthe one that occurred in Bellingham, WA--don't happen again.\n  I also wish to take a moment to recognize the efforts of many, many \npeople in my home State of Washington--especially the mayor of \nBellingham, Mark Asmundson, who has done more than anyone I know to \nraise public awareness about pipeline dangers and to call for stronger \nsafety measures.\n  I encourage my colleagues, many of whom I have met personally over \nthe last several months on this issue, to take this opportunity now to \njoin Senator Gorton and me in helping to ensure the safety of the \npipelines that transport natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids \nthroughout our communities.\n  Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents \nnationwide. These accidents have killed 325 people and injured another \n1,500. Three of those people died in Bellingham, WA, last June. We want \nto make sure we take steps this year to ensure that does not happen \nagain to any other community. It is time to act. It is time to prevent \nanother disaster.\n  My bill, S. 2004, would expand State authority. It would improve \ninspection practices, a move that is drastically needed. It would \nexpand the public's right to know.\n  For any of you who may suffer from a disaster in the future, you will \nquickly find that your communities and cities won't have the ability to \nask pipeline companies whether pipelines have been inspected, and what \nproblems there are, or actions they have taken to solve those problems, \nunless we pass the public's ``right-to-know provision.'' It will \nimprove the quality of pipeline operators, and it will increase funding \nto improve safety.\n  I look forward to working with the rest of the Washington State \ndelegation to put the lessons that we learned all too tragically in \nBellingham, WA, into law.\n  I ask my colleagues, many with whom I have met, to again take a look \nat this legislation and join us in sponsoring it, and for this Senate \nand Congress to move on this very important piece of safety \nlegislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes at \nthis time to congratulate the majority leader, Chairman John McCain, \nSenator Slade Gorton, Representative Bud Shuster, and everyone in \nCongress who has worked so hard to produce a conference report on the \nFAA. Many of my colleagues have discussed the importance of this bill \nto our national aviation infrastructure, so I will not repeat now their \ncomments. It is my purpose to remark to the Senate how important this \nbill is to my State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of Alaska's communities are accessible only \nby air. We have enormous needs and, frankly, those needs have often \ntaken a back seat to major metropolitan areas of the lower 48. It is my \nhope this bill will address some of those inequities, and I \ncongratulate my Congressman, Don Young, for his hard work on this bill.\n  We have 71 unlighted airports in Alaska. In an area where we spend \nhalf of our year in darkness, those airports are unlighted. One hundred \nand fifty airports in my State are less than 3,300 feet in length. More \nthan half of our rural airports are without minimal passenger shelters. \nYou reach the airport, get off the airplane, and there is literally \nnothing there. One hundred and seventy-six public use airports do not \nhave basic instrument approach capability, and 194 locations in Alaska \nlack adequate communication, navigation, and surveillance.\n  This bill does not address all of those needs, and I hope to work \nwith the Members of the House and Senate on the Appropriations \nCommittee to fill a few of those gaps. This is a classic case in which \nsome congressional earmarking is appropriate because the national \nadministration too often has\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\nwritten off Alaska as a priority in matters relating to aviation.\n  I am pleased my colleagues agreed with my proposal to increase the \npercentage of airport improvement program funds that flow to airports \nengaged in cargo operations. This modification will bring additional \nmoneys, almost $6 million, to the Anchorage International Airport, \nwhich is now the busiest cargo airport in this Nation--Anchorage, AK.\n  It is also encouraging to see the committee once again included my \nlanguage to allow the Administrator of the FAA to modify regulations to \ntake into account special circumstances in Alaska. Sometimes rules that \nappear to make sense in the lower 48 simply do not work in our north \ncountry. That is why the conference agreed to exempt Alaska from \nprovisions that bar new landfills within 6 miles of an airport. This \nprovision is literally unworkable in Alaska where most of our remote \nvillages are surrounded by Federal refuges and, despite repeated \nefforts, we are not even allowed to build a road a mile long because of \nintervention of an alphabet soup type of Federal agency domination.\n  That may sound strong, but it is literally true.\n  Many of you may have heard I was concerned about a provision in the \nbudget treatment section of the final compromise package on the FAA. \nThat is true, and I would like to briefly discuss it.\n  The practical effect of the provision that the House ultimately \nagreed to delete from this bill would have been to bar any Senate bill \nor conference report or budget resolution from being considered that \ndid not slavishly adhere to the legislative structure or levels of \nfunding in this bill. Such a provision amounted to an ultimatum to the \nSenate that presented an unwarranted intrusion into the legislative \nprocess. The provision would have given a small number of House Members \nthe ability to completely derail an appropriations conference report, \nagreed to by the House and the Senate, on completely procedural \ngrounds.\n  This provision could have had severe and damaging unintended \nconsequences. For example, the House insistence on the across-the-board \ncuts in last year's wrapup bill would have triggered that provision, \nand the omnibus bill would not have been in order on the floor of the \nHouse.\n  The minority party in the House could have used this provision to \noppose a transportation appropriations conference report, a \nsupplemental conference report, or an omnibus bill if the guaranteed \nlevels or program structures were modified in any fashion, pursuant to \nthe waiver provisions contained in the law, even if such modification \nwere made at the request of the leadership or of the authorization \ncommittees.\n  The bottom line when considering this particular provision is that it \nis hard to predict the future. Budget constraints, shifting \ncongressional priorities, administration priorities, and other aviation \nissues that emerge after enactment of a reauthorization bill often \nrequire modification of other legislative provisions. The (C)(3) \nprovision that has been deleted failed to provide for such exigencies, \nand I am pleased the conferees have deleted it. I hope we will not face \nthat proposal again.\n  Beyond that, the budget treatment in the FAA reauthorization bill is \nchallenging for the Appropriations and Budget Committees, but it is \nmanageable. It will necessitate that the Senate and the House make some \nchoices between discretionary priorities, transportation, and other \npriorities during the consideration of the budget and the funding bills \nfor the year 2001. Above all, it will require the House and the Senate \nto agree to a budget at levels that will enable us to keep the mandates \nof the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  This bill adds between $2.1 and $2.7 billion in aviation spending \nabove the fiscal year 2000 levels. I support that. I support spending \nas much on aviation as we can afford. I am not unmindful of the \npressure that this and other guaranteed spending will place on the \nbudget, the Budget Committee, and the appropriations bills. We will \nhave to all work together on these matters.\n  Once again, I thank the members of the conference and my staff, \nincluding Steve Cortese, Wally Burnett, Paul Doerrer, Mitch Rose, and \nmy legislative fellow Dan Elwell, for all of their work on this measure \nover the past year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \napproximately 12 minutes on the Paez nomination. I don't know whether \nthere is any agreement on that. Otherwise, I will do it in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1295-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1295-S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE PAEZ NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I remain very troubled by this \nnomination. I know it has been pending for a long time because of the \ncontroversy surrounding the activism of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals to which Judge Paez has been nominated and by Judge Paez's own \npersonal history of activism and his philosophy of judging that \nindicates to me he is quite clearly right along with the leftward group \nin tilt and movement of that circuit. We need to remove that circuit to \nthe mainstream, not continue it out in left field, not having it be \nreversed 17 times, unanimously, by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1 year, a \nrecord that has never been met and probably never will be surpassed by \nany circuit in history. We need to get that circuit in the mainstream \nof law. Judge Paez will keep it out of the mainstream.\n  But we have had recent developments. We have been looking into Judge \nPaez's handling and acceptance of the guilty plea of John Huang, in Los \nAngeles, where he is a sitting district judge, Federal court judge. I \nbelieve there are a number of factors that indicate to me that that was \nnot handled properly, not handled according to the highest standards of \njustice and, in fact, the plea bargain and sentence he approved was not \njustified under the law, and that he violated Federal guidelines in \norder to approve a plea bargain that was unacceptable, in my view, as \nto what should have occurred in the disposition of that case.\n  So I believe, and I have asked, and I have written the majority \nleader and asked that he pull this nomination off the floor and we be \nallowed to go back to committee and have live witnesses, under oath, to \nfind out how it was, out of 34 judges who could have heard the Huang \ncase in Los Angeles, that this case got to Judge Paez, the one who was \nalready being nominated by the President for a court of appeals that is \none step below the U.S. Supreme Court. How did it go to him?\n  Also, we had the Maria Hsia case that was recently tried here in \nWashington, and she was convicted. I believe there was a mistrial in \nCalifornia, but he had that case, too. How did this judge, out of 34, \nget both those cases that had great potential to embarrass the \nPresident, because this was the key part of the campaign finance \ncorruption scandal? John Huang is the guy who raised $1.6 million in \nillegal funds from foreign sources that the Democratic National \nCommittee had to return because they were illegally obtained.\n  Then he comes in and the Department of Justice, which was urged by \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate and the House, \nMembers of this body--we urged the Department of Justice to send a \nspecial prosecutor to handle this case, and she did, in a number of \ncases; Attorney General Janet Reno did make special appointments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope my friend understands that in the Maria Hsia case \nthere were two trials. The campaign trial he is talking about did not \ngo to Judge Paez. The trial he had with her had to do with a tax \nevasion case where there was a jury that deadlocked. My friend keeps \nbringing up these cases injecting politics into this. My friend knows \nall these cases are taken on a random basis. My friend knows there are \nrated--\n\n[[Page S1296]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor. I appreciate the \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want my friend to comment on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Maria Hsia was indicted in California and charged here. \nShe had a hung jury there and was convicted here. That was a critical \ncase to the Clinton-Gore administration. It was important to them. She \nhad the potential to cooperate and talk.\n  At any rate, it still remains odd to me that in these high-profile \ncases about which much has been written in recent weeks, one of which \nwas tried here in Washington, Judge Paez got both of them.\n  I submit to my colleagues that perhaps that circuit is assigning \nthose cases randomly, but this case of John Huang did not come off an \nindictment; it came off a plea bargain. I have a copy of the plea \nbargain which is part of the public record in California. It was signed \nby John Huang, his attorneys, and the prosecutor, a Department of \nJustice employee of Janet Reno who holds her job in Washington at the \npleasure of the President of the United States, whose campaign was \ninvolved in this illegality. That is who was making the decision on the \nprosecutorial end.\n  To me, the question is whether or not the judge handled himself \ncorrectly. Some say the judge did not know of all this material and it \nwas not his fault; it was the prosecutor's fault. I do believe the \nprosecutors failed in advocating effectively the interests of the \npeople of the United States and the rule of law in this case.\n  In California, young people every day are getting sent to jail for 15 \nyears, 20 years, without parole, for dealing in crack cocaine and other \nviolations. A guy raises $1.6 million from the Chinese Government and \nlaunders it into the Democratic National Committee, and what does he \nwalk out with? Total probation, not a day in jail. That is wrong.\n  This is how they did it. This is a plea agreement. First and \nforemost, a judge is not bound to accept the plea agreement. He does \nnot have to accept it. I am going to read the language in this \nagreement that talks about that. This is Huang and his attorneys and \nthe U.S. attorney prosecutor. They signed this agreement. It says:\n\n       This agreement is not binding on the Court.\n\n  And the court in this case is Judge Paez.\n\n       The United States and you--\n\n  Huang--\n\n     understand that the Court retains complete discretion to \n     accept or reject the agreed-upon disposition provided for in \n     Paragraph 15(f) of this Agreement.\n\n  They had an agreement, but the judge had every right not to accept \nit. It goes on to say:\n       In addition, should the Court reject the Agreement and \n     should you thereafter withdraw your guilty plea--\n\n  They said if the judge did not follow this recommendation of \nprobation, John Huang could withdraw his plea and go to trial and \ndeclare his innocence and they would not use anything he said against \nhim.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       . . . without prejudice . . . to indictment--\n\n  In your defense.\n  It goes on in detail about it. That is normally done. I was a Federal \nprosecutor. I am aware of that.\n  They had the deal arranged. They took it to him. He was not given all \nof the facts in the case, but he was given enough facts in the case and \nhe was aware of enough facts to reject this plea.\n  I want to go over with my colleagues a couple of the items. I \nmentioned them earlier, but this is so critical. This is why we need to \ntake some time to pause before we confirm this man for a lifetime \nappointment to a court one step below the U.S. Supreme Court. We waited \nand fought for 4 years as to whether or not he should be confirmed. Now \nwe have these new charges pending, and I do not see why in the world we \ncannot be given 3 weeks--just 3 weeks--to inquire into it and make a \ndecision.\n  This is what he was given. He was given evidence that a substantial \npart of the fraudulent scheme was committed outside the United States \nbecause this was foreign money. If that is true, the judge was required \nto add two levels to the sentencing. He added no levels to the \nsentencing for that.\n  He was told there were 24 illegal contributions spread out over a \ncourse of 2 years involving multiple overseas corporate entities of \nwhich June Huang was responsible for soliciting the money and \nreimbursing the contributions. That should have added two to four new \nlevels.\n  He was an officer and a director in a bank, and as an officer and a \ndirector, he should have had two levels added for abusing a position of \npublic or private trust.\n  These are not requests. These are matters at which the judge is \nsupposed to look. They are mandates of law. He ignored all of those, \nand that is how the judge came out with a sentence level of 8 and not \nmaybe 14 because if it had been a level 9, one more level up, and this \nsentence would have required John Huang to go to jail at least some \ntime.\n  The Department of Justice did not want him to go to jail. They wanted \nhim to have a deal. He spent not one day in jail and pled to a \ncontribution to the mayor's race of the city of Los Angeles and did not \nplea to any criminal charge relating to the 1996 Presidential campaign \nand, in fact, I want to note what this plea agreement said. It grants \nhim immunity on all of those charges. This is what the agreement said, \nAmerica. Listen to this. This is serious business.\n  It said: Judge, if you accept this plea, the prosecutors of the \nUnited States will not prosecute you, John Huang, for any other \nviolations of law other than those laws relating to national security \nor espionage occurring before the date of this agreement signed by you.\n  He could have been found to commit murder. Giving blind immunity is a \nvery dangerous commitment to make. He could have committed \nembezzlement. He could have committed bribery. He could never be \nprosecuted. He got his probation deal, he walked out of court, and he \nreceived no time in jail.\n  There was no evidence presented in court about the $1.6 million he \nspent in this campaign for the Democratic National Committee, which was \nillegal and had to be returned. None of that came out. It was not a \nplea bargain; it was a wrong plea bargain. He should have looked those \nlawyers in the eye and said: Gentlemen, I have the right to reject this \nplea and I do. This is a matter of national importance. It is a matter \nthat goes to the core of justice and our commitment in this country to \nequal justice under law.\n  He did not do so. He actually went along with a procedure in which he \naccepted guideline levels that he could not justify and that were \nwrong. He was affirmatively wrong. He maybe should have had more \nevidence, but he had enough to reject this agreement.\n  I know my time is up, Mr. President. I believe strongly in this. We \nought not to be doing this. We ought not to be shoving this through. \nThis man ought not to be on the bench until we know precisely how he \ngot this case and why, and have him stand up under oath and explain why \nhe did not follow the plain guidelines of the law of the United States \nof America. I believe strongly in it. I have voted for an overwhelming \nnumber of Federal judges put forth by this administration. This \nCongress has rejected only 1 out of over 300-something. This one has \nbeen controversial from the beginning, and he ought not go forward.\n  Mr. President, my time is up, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the nominations of Ms. Berzon and \nJudge Paez, and spoke yesterday urging my colleagues to do the same.\n  I would hope my remarks prove persuasive. But if they do not, my \ncolleagues of course are free to reasonably disagree with my view and \nto cast a vote against these candidates.\n  It is quite another story, however, for members of this body to \nfrustrate a majority vote on these nominees by forcing a super-majority \ncloture vote.\n  I have reached this conclusion after having been part of this process \nfor over 20 years now, and having served as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for more than half a decade.\n  There are times when legislators must, to be effective, demonstrate \ntheir mastery of politics. But there are also times when politics--\nthough available--must be foresworn.\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\n  I am reminded of the great quote of Disraeli, which I will now \nparaphrase--``next to knowing when to seize an opportunity, the most \nimportant thing is knowing when to forego an advantage.'' I hope my \ncolleagues will forego the perceived advantage of a filibuster.\n  Simply put, there are certain areas that must be designated as off-\nlimits from political activity. Statesmanship demands as much. The \nSenate's solemn role in confirming lifetime-appointed Article III \njudges--and the underlying principle that the Senate performs that role \nthrough the majority vote of its members--are such issues. Nothing less \ndepends on the recognition of these principles than the continued, \nuntarnished respect in which we hold our third branch of Government.\n  On the basis of this principle, I have always tried to be fair, no \nmatter the President of the United States or the nominees. Even when I \nhave opposed a nominee of the current President, I have voted for \ncloture to stop a filibuster of that nominee. That was the case with \nthe nomination of Lee Sarokin.\n  To be sure, this body has on occasion engaged in the dubious practice \nof filibusters of judicial nominees. But such episodes have been \ninfrequent and, I shall add, unfortunate.\n  During a number of occasions in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, \nmy colleagues on the other side engaged in filibusters of judicial \nnominees. Frequently, they backed off, ostensibly realizing there were \nenough votes to stop a filibuster.\n  And just last year, I watched with sadness as the minority made \nhistory by filibustering one of its own party's nominees. Forcing a \ncloture vote on Clinton nominee Ted Stewart--who is now acquitting \nhimself superbly as a district judge in Utah--reflected nothing more \nthan a political gambit to force action on other judicial nominees. \nFortunately, the effects of that filibuster were short-lived, as the \nminority recognized the errors of its ways.\n\n  These unfortunate episodes do not a precedent make. The fact that \nthese actions precede us does not establish a roadmap for the Senate's \nhandling of future nominations.\n  Moreover, these filibusters were limited in number. During some of \nthe Reagan and Bush years, I thought our colleagues on the other side \ndid some reprehensible things in regard to Reagan and Bush judges. But \nby and large, the vast majority of them were put through without any \nreal fuss or bother, even though my colleagues on the other side, had \nthey been President, would not have appointed very many of those \njudges. We have to show the same good faith on our side, it seems to \nme.\n  My message against filibusters of judicial nominees is one I hope to \nmake abundantly clear to my colleagues in the majority. This is so \nbecause, to the extent our majority party gives repeated credence to \nthe practice of filibustering judicial nominees, we can expect the \nfavor to be returned when the President is one of our own. We hope in \nearnest that the next President will hail from our party. And if we are \ngratified in that hope, how short-sighted it will have been that we \ngave a fresh precedent to the minority party in this body to defeat--by \nrequiring not 51 but a full 60 votes--that Republican President's \njudicial nominees.\n  It is important to remember another reason against filibustering \njudicial nominees. Most of the fight over a nomination has occurred \nwell before a nominee arrives at the Senate floor. Proverbial battles \nare fought between people in the White House and members of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As a general matter, when nominees get this far, most of them should \nbe approved. Though there are some that we will continue to have \nproblems with, it is our job to look at them in the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is our job--to look into their background. It is our \njob to screen these candidates.\n  In the case of both Ms. Berzon and Judge Paez, each was reported \nfavorably to the floor. And now we have the unusual situation of a \nDemocrat President, the Republican and Democrat Senate Leaders, and \nRepublican and Democrat Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, all agreeing that votes on the nominees should go forward. \nBut certain Senators who oppose these nominees have nonetheless elected \nto thwart such votes.\n  At bottom, it is a travesty if we establish a routine of \nfilibustering judges. We should not play politics with them.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ngoing to act on the nomination of Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. The history of her nomination is one of \nthe most disappointing episodes in the Senate's recent shameful \ntreatment of judicial nominees. One of America's most qualified \nappellate litigators has been held hostage by opponents who raise \ncomplaints without substance or merit to impede her confirmation. Today \nI hope to dispel some of the myths that opponents of her confirmation \nhave used to block Marsha Berzon's nomination. I urge the Senate to \nconfirm her, and put a highly qualified lawyer on the bench where she \nbelongs.\n  What kind of nominee do we have before us today in the person of \nMarsha Berzon? We have a woman who has distinguished herself at all \nlevels, from clerkship through successful private appellate practice. \nWe have a woman who has already argued before the Supreme Court four \ntimes and has repeatedly appeared before Circuit courts around the \ncountry.\n  Thirty years ago Ms. Berzon received the honor of being picked as \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan's first female law clerk. \nHer opponents have seized on this honor as suggesting that Ms. Berzon \npossesses a liberal and activist judicial philosophy. I say to those \nwho believe serving as a Supreme Court clerk is emblematic of one's \npolitical beliefs that they are wrong to believe a clerk adopts her \nJustice's philosophy for life. First, to be chosen by any Justice of \nthe Supreme Court as a clerk is a rare and noteworthy honor, reserved \nfor the most promising legal minds from the finest law schools. So the \nmost important thing to be gathered from Ms. Berzon's service as a \nSupreme Court clerk is that her promise as a lawyer and future judge \nwas already apparent thirty years ago just as she was beginning her \ncareer.\n  Second, it is demonstrably untrue that you can tell the philosophy of \nan individual by the belief of his or her former boss. I'm sure we all \nknow examples of people who have worked for us in the Senate who don't \nshare our views on every issue. But perhaps the best example of the \nunfairness of assuming that Marsha Berzon believes everything that \nJustice Brennan did is another former Brennan clerk, Judge Richard \nPosner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Many consider Judge Posner \nthe most creative legal mind of his generation, and no one who is \nfamiliar with his law and economics philosophy would call him a \nliberal.\n  So let's put that fallacious line of argument to rest.\n  Listen to the praise our Judiciary Committee Chairman, my friend Sen. \nHatch, heaped upon Marsha Berzon when the Committee considered her \nnomination before forwarding it to the full Senate. Chairman Hatch \ncalled Berzon ``one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.'' He noted in a \nletter supporting her nomination that her ``competence as a lawyer is \nbeyond question'' and that she has the ``sound temperament that will \nserve her well as a federal judge.'' At the time Chairman Hatch also \nnoted that Marsha Berzon had attracted ``both Republican and Democratic \nsupport.'' I am pleased that the Chairman continues to support her \nnomination on the floor.\n  Opponents of Marsha Berzon have questioned her credentials unfairly. \nDespite graduating with honors from Harvard/Radcliffe college and \nteaching law school courses at both Cornell and Indiana University Law \nschools, her scholarship has been attacked.\n\n  Some who have opposed Berzon's nomination have even called her a \nlabor zealot. But Mr. President, there are a number of people in this \nroom who were attorneys before joining the Senate. They know, as do I, \nthat the code of professional responsibility requires zealous advocacy \non a client's behalf. So to mention her zeal for her practice is simply \nto highlight one of those qualities which makes her such a fine \ncandidate for the 9th Circuit. It shows that she has taken her practice \nof law to the highest and most professional level.\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n  And lest her opponents complain about professionalism and infer \nunfairly that a former labor lawyer cannot be fair to management, \nlisten to what numerous management-side attorneys who have litigated \nagainst her say about Marsha Berzon. Let's take the case of W.I. Usery, \nJr., a former Republican Secretary of Labor:\n  Usery said Ms. Berzon ``has all the qualifications needed, as well as \nthe honesty and integrity that we need and deserve in our court system \ntoday. . . I know she will be dedicated to the principles of fairness \nand impartiality in all her judicial activities.''\n  Or perhaps, we should listen to Fred Alvarez, President Ronald \nReagan's former EEOC Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of Labor. \nAlvarez says:\n\n       Someone with the intellect and integrity, which Ms. Berzon \n     has demonstrated, understands the difference between advocacy \n     and the solemn responsibilities undertaken as a federal \n     appellate court judge . . . I can think of no other union-\n     side lawyer who would command so strong and so compelling a \n     consensus from management lawyers on her suitability for such \n     an important position on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  So there you have it Mr. President. Top Republican officials--who we \ncan be sure favor management positions by personal philosophy--endorse \nBerzon and her professionalism without reservation.\n  So let's put the foolish argument that Marsha Berzon can't be fair \nconcerning labor issues to rest.\n  Let's review. We've shown that arguments that Berzon is some liberal \nby her association with Justice Brennan are fallacious. We've shown \nthat arguments that she is a zealous advocate and should be rejected as \nan ideologue in fact highlight her mastery of the practice of law and \nmake her highly qualified for this position. We've exploded the myth \nthat she is anti-management and incapable of impartiality in hearing \ncases pitting management versus labor, and found that she works towards \nreaching consensus. So one has to wonder Mr. President, what is really \ngoing on here?\n  I'm concerned about the appearance that Marsha Berzon has had such a \nlong, hard road to confirmation because she is a woman. And I don't \nblame the public for taking that message from this delay when a highly \nqualified appellate attorney is held up for years and the arguments \nagainst her confirmation are so thin.\n  At the end of 1999, the entire federal judiciary included only 158 \nwomen--that's a scant and embarrassing 20% of sitting judges. Rather \nthan attempting to address that disparity, this Senate has chosen to \ncontinue the policies of limiting the upward elevation of talented and \ncapable women attorneys and judges. We've repeatedly delayed action on \na host of female candidates. What's the impact? If fewer women get \nconfirmed, there are fewer lower court judges to elevate to the \nnation's appellate courts. And if the judiciary remains a male bastion, \nas far as we've come in this country in recognizing equal rights for \nwomen, we risk creating the perception that gender biases will continue \nto plague our judicial system well into the 21st century.\n  I believe Ms. Berzon is highly qualified to sit on the 9th Circuit, \nand her confirmation should wait no longer. I enthusiastically support \nher and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nominations \nof Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to sit on the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  There are serious problems with the 9th Circuit. It has become a \nrenegade Circuit, far out of the mainstream of modern American \njurisprudence, and I am afraid that if these nominees are confirmed, \nthey will only make a bad situation worse.\n  Over the past six years, the 9th Circuit has been overturned 86% of \nthe time by the U.S. Supreme Court, a terrible record. During this \nperiod, the Supreme Court has reviewed 99 decisions from the 9th \nCircuit, and overturned 85 of those decisions. During the current \nsession, the 9th Circuit has been overturned in all of the 7 cases \nreviewed by the Supreme Court, and in one term--1996-97--27 of 28 \ndecisions were overturned, including 17 by unanimous votes.\n  This is the worst record of any circuit, and is especially troubling \ngiven the size and influence of the 9th Circuit. It covers almost 40% \nof the country, and 50 million Americans--20 million more than any \nother circuit. The fact that the 9th Circuit has been slipping toward \njudicial extremism is no laughing matter, and directly affects a large \npart of our nation and almost one-fifth of our citizens.\n  The main reason for the judicial imbalance on the 9th Circuit is that \nDemocratic appointees currently comprise 15 of the 22 positions on the \n9th Circuit, 10 of whom were appointed by President Clinton. I do not \nbegrudge President Clinton his appointees; he is the President, and has \nthe constitutional right and responsibility to fill the federal bench. \nBut the 9th Circuit has become lopsided with activist judges that has \nhelped push it far out of the judicial mainstream. The circuit cries \nout for balance.\n  Confirming Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the 9th Circuit would \nonly exacerbate its problems. Mr. President, I do not know the nominees \nand I have nothing against them. Their records show that they have long \nlegal backgrounds, and deserve a final vote on their nominations. But, \nthe record also shows that they both tilt far too left in their \njudicial views and would not help to restore balance or judicial \nsensibilities to the 9th Circuit.\n  Ms. Berzon has worked as the general counsel of the AFL-CIO for over \na decade, and was long active with the ACLU. At least one conservative \ngroup has described her as the ``worst judicial nomination President \nClinton has ever made.'' Mr. President, Ms. Berzon is entitled to her \nviews and I am not going to criticize her for her personal beliefs. But \nlooking at her past and the causes which she has pushed show that, if \nconfirmed, she is not going to help steer the 9th Circuit toward the \njudicial mainstream.\n  As for Judge Paez, he currently sits on the federal district court in \nthe 9th Circuit, and his nomination is opposed by over 300 grassroots \nconservative organizations that are troubled by his judicial activism. \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \nhave even taken the unusual step of opposing his nomination because of \ntheir concerns over some of his past decisions, arguing that he has \npursued an agenda that ``has the potential to cause significant \ndisruption in U.S. and world markets.'' Mr. President, business groups \nusually do not become involved in judicial nominations, and when they \ndo it should make us wonder.\n  Even the Washington Post editorial page, no friend of conservative \ncauses, has cautioned that opposition to Judge Paez ``is not entirely \nfrivolous'', and points to past public remarks by Judge Paez that show \nhow ``sympathetic'' he is to activist, judicial thinking.\n  Mr. President, since coming to the Senate I have voted for some of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees, and I have opposed several. \nYesterday, in fact, I voted to confirm Julio Fuente to sit on the Third \nCircuit. But confirming Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to sit on the \n9th Circuit would be a mistake, and would directly affect 50 million \nAmericans. The 9th Circuit has serious problems, and confirming these \nnominations are not going to fix those problems. Consequently, I am \ngoing to oppose them.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in strong support \nof the nomination of Richard Paez to be a judge on the Court of Appeals \nfor the 9th Circuit. By finally moving on the nominations of Judge Paez \nand Ms. Marsha Berzon this week, the Senate will take long-delayed \nsteps towards returning the 9th Circuit dockets to a manageable level. \nAction on these nominees is long overdue. I believe their nominations \nshould be confirmed, and I hope, after all this delay, there will be \nstrong bipartisan votes in favor of them.\n  Four years, 1 month, and 11 days. Just over forty-nine months. One \nthousand, four hundred and ninety-nine days. That's right. 1499 days, \ntwo short of 1500. That is how long Judge Richard Paez has been waiting \nfor the Senate to act on his nomination. In the same amount of time, a \nyoung adult could enter and complete a full college degree program. Let \nme repeat that. Judge Paez has waited for the Senate to grant him the \nsimple grace of voting his nomination up or down for longer than it \ntakes a young American to complete an entire college education. A \nPresident or Governor could be inaugurated, serve his or her entire \nterm\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\nand be re-inaugurated during that same four year time period. While I'm \nsure Judge Paez is a patient man, possessed of the proper judicial \ntemperament that makes him an excellent candidate to sit on the 9th \nCircuit, I know that even his patience must have long-ago worn thin \nwaiting for the Senate to act on his nomination.\n  First nominated to fill a 9th Circuit vacancy on January 26, 1996, \nJudge Paez has been subject to delay after delay after delay, and yet \nhis opponents have not been able to give a convincing reason why we \nshouldn't confirm his nomination. Even with his 13 year record as a LA \nMunicipal Court Judge and nearly 6 years as a U.S. District Court Judge \nfor the Central District of California, those who don't want him on the \nbench can't build a case against his elevation to the 9th Circuit. They \ncharge that he is an ``activist judge,'' but the record simply doesn't \nsupport this allegation.\n  Judge Paez now bears the dubious distinction of suffering through the \nlongest pendency of a nomination to the federal bench in the history of \nthe United States.\n  All Judge Paez, has ever asked for was this opportunity: an up or \ndown vote on his confirmation. Yet for years, the Senate has denied him \nthat simple courtesy.\n  I find it ironic that Judge Paez, the same judge who diligently \nworked to reduce the length of delays in resolving civil matters in Los \nAngeles and throughout California's court system through his design and \nimplementation of a civil trial delay reduction project, should himself \nbe subjected to such egregious delay in getting his ``day in court'' \nbefore the full Senate. Particularly when the Senate confirmed his \nnomination for a District Court judgeship in July 1994 by unanimous \nconsent. Now I recognize that control of this body has changed since \n1994, but his nomination to the District Court was confirmed without \nobjection. And his record on that court has been exemplary.\n  This delay has not simply been unfair to Judge Paez and his family. \nIt has affected the administration of justice. Listen to the concerns \nof Procter Hug, Jr., Chief Judge of the 9th Circuit. Chief Judge Hug \nhas responsibility for overseeing the functioning and managing the \ncaseloads of the entire Circuit. Currently, of the 28 spots on the 9th \nCircuit, 6 stand vacant. Chief Judge Hug explained in a letter this \npast week to the Judiciary Committee that during his term as Chief \nJudge, the Senate has left him with up to 10 vacancies on the court at \nany one time. He has responded to this judicial emergency by begging \nhis colleagues to redouble efforts to resolve cases and then increased \ntheir dockets to prevent even longer delays in resolution of cases. Hug \nargues forcefully for the confirmation of Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon and \nasks this body to swiftly fill the other 4 vacancies on the court.\n  Now Mr. President, let me address the argument made by the Majority \nLeader and others that the pending 9th Circuit nominations should be \nrejected because that circuit has a supposedly high level of reversals \nwhen its decisions are reviewed by the Supreme Court. This argument \nsimply doesn't hold water.\n  First, if we assume that this argument is not meant to be critical of \nthe views or qualifications Judge Paez or any other nominee personally, \nit makes no sense at all. Even if we disagree with the direction of \nthat court, why would we deny the 9th Circuit adequate resources, \nthereby depriving the litigants in that circuit of efficient \nadministration of justice? It just makes no sense.\n  More importantly, arguing that the Ninth Circuit is out of step with \nthe Supreme Court and needs to be reined in doesn't get opponents over \nthe hurdle that they have not yet been able to satisfy--to show that \nJudge Paez is unsuitable for the appellate bench. He is obviously not \nresponsible for past decisions of the 9th Circuit. So the argument has \nto be that his elevation will continue the Circuit on its supposedly \nmisguided course. The evidence of Judge Paez being unable to follow \nSupreme Court precedent is thin indeed, if not non-existent.\n  But more fundamentally, it is simply not factually correct that the \n9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court and other circuit \ncourts. Chief Judge Hug in his letter convincingly refutes the argument \nthat his circuit is reversed more often than others. In fact, its clear \nfrom the numbers that even in 1996-1997, when the 9th Circuit's \nreversal rate was at its highest level of recent years, it was reversed \nless frequently than 5 other circuits--the 5th, 2nd, 7th, D.C. and \nFederal--each of which were reversed 100% of the time that year by the \nSupreme Court. In more recent years, the statistics show even more \nclearly that the 9th Circuit is not a runaway train that somehow needs \nto be slowed down, but many in the Senate would like it to become a \nmore conservative circuit, perhaps to be broken into two conservative \ncircuits. And they are willing to hold up Judge Paez and others to \nachieve that political objective.\n  Furthermore, I have to point out that reversal rates are a very poor \ncriteria for judging a court's work. The Supreme Court is not required \nto review every appellate decision. It picks which cases to review. So \nit is hardly surprising that when it does take a case, it reverses a \nlower court. Chief Judge Hug quite rightly points out that the 9th \nCircuit decides about 4,500 cases on the merits each year. 4,500. So \nthe fact that 10 or 20 cases per year are reversed really should not \ntrouble us. It is just not a plausible argument against a nominee for \nthis Circuit that its decisions are out of the mainstream.\n  We ought to congratulate the women and men currently serving on the \n9th Circuit for so successfully fulfilling their judicial roles at the \nsame time vacancies are greatly increasing their dockets and stretching \ntheir time thin. The pressure to carefully make the proper judicial \ndecisions is great, and these Judges are responding with \nprofessionalism. I thank them for that, but I cannot help but think \nthat we are putting an unconscionable burden on them.\n  So what is the point of raising meritless arguments against this \nnominee? Why the long delay? Let me suggest two possibilities, neither \nof which reflect well on the Senate. First, Senators delaying these \nnominations may be trying to run out the clock until President Clinton \nleaves office. Confirmations always slow down in a presidential \nelection year. In 10 months, we will have a new President. Perhaps a \ndifferent President will put forward a different nominee. But Judge \nPaez was actually nominated a year before the President's 2nd \ninaugural. So holding up this particular nomination for purely \npolitical reasons is most unfair. In some ways, this nomination should \nget special treatment. We had an intervening election after the \nnomination was first made, and President Clinton won. It is \nindefensible to hold a nomination hostage for his entire second term. \nIt defies the clear constitutional prerogatives of the duly elected \nPresident to choose nominees to the bench and the duty of the Senate to \nsay yes or no.\n  Some Senators may also object to moving the nomination of Judge Paez \nbecause of a perceived judicial philosophy. Some opponents of his \nnomination look to his long and distinguished service in legal aid and \nattempt to tar him with the epithet of ``liberal,'' forgetting that his \nexemplary judicial career has been filled with distinction at all \nlevels. A close look at his record as a U.S. District Court judge since \nthe Senate confirmed his nomination in 1994 debunks attempts to label \nhis opinions as conservative or liberal, reactionary or progressive.\n  The Los Angeles Daily Journal, which is a newspaper devoted to \ncovering the courts and the legal profession in Los Angeles \ncommissioned 15 legal experts to examine Judge Paez's decisions in \nseven different cases. Each case was reviewed by at least 2 experts. \nThe results were clear. Thirteen of the legal scholars and \npractitioners found Paez's opinions ``well-reasoned and well-written.'' \nTwo others were mildly critical. And, in the one decision in which the \nexperts were critical of Judge Paez's decision not to dismiss claims \nthat Unocal Corporation was liable for human rights abuses in Burma, a \nthird expert countered the criticism of Judge Paez's decision, saying \n``I would give Judge Paez very good marks on his ruling.'' What's the \npoint here? In a variety of decisions, the commentators praised the \nwork of Judge Paez. Here are some of their comments:\n\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\n\n       I carefully read Judge Paez's opinion and found that it was \n     excellent in every respect.\n       His writing was clear and his expression was good. He did \n     not show any ideological or personal bias.\n       Judge Paez's injunction--in a case against anti-abortion \n     demonstrators--was entirely consistent with the reasoning and \n     result in conservative jurisdictions.\n\n  The result is that claims that the Judge's record is activist, or \nliberally slanted are simply wrong. Claims that he is anti-business are \nsimply not borne out by the facts. Paez also ruled in favor of Philip \nMorris on a second-hand smoke suit and for Isuzu against Consumers \nUnion. Senators opposing this nominee because they claim he's anti-\nbusiness are missing the point. Paez rules on each case on the merits--\nyes, on the merits--and shows no favoritism for or against business. So \nagain, Mr. President, I'm just baffled by these claims of activism or \nanti-business philosophy being leveled against Richard Paez.\n  Now if his record as a judge doesn't support these charges of \n``judicial activism'' where did Judge Paez's opponents get the idea \nthat he must be stopped. Opponents aren't saying it openly but it could \nbe that they are worried that a judge who formerly worked in a legal \naid capacity must be a liberal, and incapable of making balanced \ndecisions. Having failed to find any hint of bias or lack of judicial \ntemperament in 20 years of judicial decisions, what other reason for \nopposition could there be other than a belief that if you are an \nattorney who agrees to work on behalf of those unable to access the \nlegal system because they are poor or under-educated, as Judge Paez did \nfor nine years early in his career, you must be a liberal, right?\n  Wrong. Dead wrong. The organized Bar in every single state requires \npublic service of attorneys. Every major law firm has dedicated efforts \nto reach under-served populations needing legal advice. That's part of \nthe profession, a noble part of the profession, and those who would \ncomplain about Judge Paez's service to those in need would do well to \nremember their own reasons for choosing to serve the public. For my \npart, I applaud the decision of Judge Paez and others like him to serve \nthe poor, and I cannot imagine how his unique perspective from working \none on one with these populations for nine years would not be desirable \nand an advantage to parties before the 9th Circuit. His perspective is \nbadly needed in a circuit which serves 20% of the nation's population, \nmany of whom are people who needed legal aid when he was working with \nthem during the 70s.\n  If opponents of Judge Paez want to fill the court only with seemingly \nconservative judges, they mistake their role in the constitutional \nscheme in my opinion. Let's not kid ourselves. Partisan politics \nshouldn't play a part in the confirmation of judges, but they do. But \nto hold up a well-qualified judge for a President's entire term on the \nbasis of unsupported allegations of ``judicial activism'' is shameful, \nit takes the impact of politics on this process to an extreme that we \nhave not seen before, and I hope we never see again.\n  Mr. President, regardless of the reason for delays in acting on Judge \nPaez's nomination, the effects of delay are damaging and unmistakable. \nI believe they are twofold. First, as I discussed before, justice is \nput on hold in the 9th Circuit because of crowded dockets. Second, this \nSenate sends a subtle, but unmistakable signal to Hispanic Americans, \nor recent immigrants about opportunities in America.\n  It's an old adage but a true one. Justice delayed is justice denied. \nParties take their disputes to court to reach a resolution. Longer \ndockets mean delays for families and businesses seeking to settle legal \nconflicts and move forward. Holding up qualified nominees like Judge \nPaez and leaving huge holes to fill on appellate benches literally \ndelays justice.\n  And the subtle, even subconscious message sent to Hispanic Americans \nwhen they examine who hears their disputes in a court of law is that \nCircuit court judgeships are not open to them. Young Hispanic Americans \nhearing about Judge Paez will unfortunately learn the message without \nit ever being said out loud that there are limitations to their \nadvancement in careers of public service. The signals sent by Senators' \nfailure to vote for Paez's confirmation lead to diminished expectations \nand a view of limited, not limitless opportunities for millions of \nHispanic Americans. The Washington Post reported on Monday that only 9 \nHispanic American judges currently sit on appellate courts in this \ncountry out of a total of 170 appellate judges. And only 31 out of 655 \nDistrict Judges, including Judge Paez, are Hispanic Americans. That's a \nshameful record as we begin the 21st century.\n  Here's the message sent if Judge Paez is not confirmed. You can go to \nlaw school at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, work tirelessly \nwith under-served and under-represented populations needing legal \nassistance, be a successful and well-respected judge on the local bench \nand the federal District Court, get the highest rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, receive endorsements from law enforcement \norganizations, bar leaders, business leaders, and community leaders, \nand yet be needlessly and unfairly delayed and prevented from being \nelevated to the prestigious 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based on \nunsubstantiated and vague concerns that you are a ``judicial activist'' \nor a ``liberal.'' There is only one nominee in this position, whose \nnomination has been held up for over 4 years. That is Richard Paez, who \nis a Hispanic American. That's the wrong message from this Senate to \nmillions of Americans, and we should not send it.\n  I strongly support Judge Paez's confirmation, and urge my colleagues \nto join me in quickly filling this and other vacancies on the 9th \nCircuit. This long delayed confirmation vote for Richard Paez is an \nimportant test for the Senate. I hope we pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1300-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1300-S1301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WENDELL H. FORD AVIATION INVESTMENT AND REFORM ACT FOR THE 21ST \n                 CENTURY--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now vote on adoption of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 1000.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided for debate. The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill provides a generous contribution \nto the future of aviation in the 21st century. It significantly reforms \nthe operations of the Federal Aviation Administration. It represents \nthe collective wisdom of the chairman and the ranking minority member \nof the Commerce Committee, the chairman and the ranking minority member \nof the Subcommittee on Aviation, and the majority and minority leaders \nof this Senate. We do not have many bills such as this. I commend it to \nmy colleagues for passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We have known a long time we have been underfunding \nour aviation system as a whole, particularly our air traffic control \nsystem, reforming the FAA--all the rest of it --building airports.\n  Overall, aviation funding is increased by 25 percent in this bill. It \nis a start. FAA operations funding is increased. Airport money is \nincreased by 33 percent; air traffic control modernization is increased \nby 40 percent.\n  This is the first shot we have at making the airways safe for the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I note Senator Lautenberg wanted to have 1 minute in \nopposition, but I do not see him on the floor. I do not know what to \nadd further to that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a bill that \npurportedly takes care of the problems of the FAA. I have to say, this \nbill guarantees funding increases in a manner that is grossly \nimbalanced. It threatens to cut funding from Amtrak, from the Coast \nGuard, from highway safety, and the NTSB in order to provide an \naviation entitlement.\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\n  Investments in aviation do have to be made, but it has to be in a \nbalanced way if we are going to avoid gridlock. You cannot ignore the \nrail system or highway safety and only focus on aviation.\n  The agreement seeks to guarantee a 64-percent increase in airport \ngrants and a 37-percent increase in modernization funding. Tight budget \ncaps mean either cuts in transportation appropriations--including the \nCoast Guard or Amtrak--or cuts to other discretionary programs, such as \neducation, health care, veterans' benefits, or agriculture.\n  Further, it does not provide for the kinds of funding that operations \nwill need to put on more controllers to man this larger system. It does \nnot provide money for the continued training of new controllers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Jersey has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 1000. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, is the Senator from Vermont correct that we \nhave now voted cloture on both the nominations before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then what is the parliamentary situation, as regarding the \ntwo nominations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 hours, evenly divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request and \nclosing script.\n  As you know, cloture was just invoked on two Ninth Circuit judges. I \nstill hope we have not set a precedent. I don't believe we have because \nit was such an overwhelming vote to invoke cloture and stop the \nfilibuster. We should not be having filibusters on judicial nominations \nand having to move to cloture. But we had to, and it was an \noverwhelming vote of 86-13 on the first one, and I guess that was the \nvote on the second one, too. I intend to offer a time agreement between \nthe proponents and opponents regarding postcloture debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith of New \nHampshire be in control of up to 3 hours of total debate on both \nnominations, and that Senator Leahy, or his designee, be in control of \nup to 1 hour 30 minutes of total debate on both nominations; that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate lay \nthe nominations aside until 2 p.m., at which time the Senate would \nproceed to back-to-back votes on or in relation to the confirmations of \nBerzon and Paez. That would be at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I tell the \ndistinguished leader I was struck by the comments of the distinguished \nleader in saying we should not have the precedents of filibusters and \nrequiring cloture. I commend him for supporting the cloture motion and \nmoving this forward so we would not have that precedent. I am \nconcerned, though, because I have heard rumors that one of these votes \nmay be on a motion to indefinitely postpone a vote on these nominees. I \nunderstand that while such a vote might be in order, there is no \nprecedent for such a vote on a judicial nominee; am I correct on that? \nI mean in my lifetime, and I was born in 1940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a precedent that a motion to postpone \nis in order after cloture is invoked.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was not my question, Mr. President. My question was \nvery specific. In fact, I stated that I understand motions to postpone \nindefinitely, I believe, are always in order, as are filibusters. But \nas the distinguished leader said, we would not want to set a precedent \nof filibusters on judicial nominations. Am I correct that we have not \nused motions to postpone indefinitely on judicial nominations following \ncloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The precedent does not state what the item of \ncloture is on.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I understand, we have never had this \ncircumstance. Certainly, I have not in my 25 years in the Senate. I do \nnot believe ever having a circumstance where we have had cloture on two \njudicial nominations and then had a motion to postpone, in effect, \nkilling the nominations.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, traditionally, it is in order postcloture to \nhave a motion to table or a motion to postpone indefinitely. I don't \nknow the precedents in terms of that actually having been used. I am \ncertainly not advocating it. But under the rules of the Senate, I am \nunder the impression that it would be in order. I thought maybe I could \nanswer it succinctly without getting into the precedents.\n  Mr. President, has the request been----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nsay, first, to the majority leader that I appreciate very much his \neffort to bring the nominations forward, and voting for cloture, \nbecause without that we would not be where we are. I want that \nunderstood.\n  I state on the Record today that this Senator believes if there is \ngoing to be a motion made--which there very well may be because that is \nthe rumor that I hear--to indefinitely postpone a vote on one of these \nnominees, then I believe that kind of a motion is denying that nominee \nan up-or-down vote. You can argue that it is really like an up-or-down \nvote, but after we have gotten over 80 votes, with the help of the \nmajority leader and Senator Hatch, in a bipartisan way--and Senator \nLeahy worked on that--you would think we could vote up or down. There \nis no precedent that I have gotten from the Parliamentarian up to this \npoint where he has been able to show me this was done with a judicial \nnomination after cloture was invoked. I wish to make that point because \nI don't like to ever blindside my colleagues on anything.\n  I think that if we go this route, it will be interpreted as a way to \ndeny a vote on the nominee, and I hope this will not be the case. \nSurely, I hope, if it is offered, we will defeat it. But it seems to me \na bad precedent. I hope we won't see this go in that fashion. I thank \nthe Chair. I shall not object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then the votes will occur back to back at 2 p.m. on \nThursday. In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes \nthis evening. I believe our staffs have probably put everybody on \nnotice of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1302-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the question of how to write Federal laws \nand consider treaties that enable our armed forces and diplomats to \nprotect and defend the people of the United States is both important \nand difficult for Members of Congress to answer. To write laws that \nkeep America safe, we must evaluate today's threats and tomorrow's \nthreats, we must consider the plans presented by our military to meet \nthose threats, and we must be vigilant against the understandable \ntendency to want to withdraw from the world. We must remember those \nmoments in our past when lack of preparation and planning resulted in \nterrible loss and then prepare to defend against threats we face.\n  We must also remember that freedom is not free, and that the price \npaid by\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\nthose men and women who choose to serve us in active, reserve, and \nNational Guard duty is considerable. They serve the nation. They are \nnot just in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and \nthe Coast Guard; they are in the United States Army, the United States \nNavy, the United States Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, and \nthe United States Coast Guard. This is a real distinction with a real \ndifference.\n  The difference is that United States forces do not just defend \nAmerican shores. They defend liberty around the world. In the confused \naftermath of the cold war, one thing should be abundantly clear: The \nfight for freedom is worth the price. From the end of the Vietnam War \nin 1975 to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 there was an active \ndebate about the value and importance of this fight. However, the sight \nof tens of millions of men and women celebrating the end of a political \nsystem that denied them freedom thrilled even those grown cynical about \nthe value of cold war expenditures. The intellectual debate about the \nvalue of communism ended when we saw and examined the destruction that \nwas done by political tyranny. The human spirit was reduced and \nsquandered. The air, the water, and the health of the people were \nsacrificed. Even the development of economic standards of living--long \nthought to be comparable to America's--were shockingly inferior.\n  Four times in my Senate career I have heard world leaders speak to \njoint sessions of the Congress to praise the price paid by America for \ntheir freedom. Duly elected as Presidents of newly freed people, each \nstood before us and spoke. Lech Walesa thanked us on behalf of the \npeople of Poland. Nelson Mandela thanked us on behalf of the people of \nSouth Africa. Vaclav Havel thanked us on behalf of the people of \nCzechoslovakia. And Kim Dae Jung thanked us on behalf of the people of \nSouth Korea. Their message was simple: If the United States had not \ntaken their side in the struggle for freedom, they would not have \nsucceeded.\n  Certainly we have made mistakes. Our actions have not been free of \ntreachery, deceit, and failure. Sometimes our actions have brought \nshame and disgrace. Yet, we should allow ourselves to learn and be \nguided by these failures. We cannot permit them to discourage us from \ncontinuing the work of writing laws that enable us to hold the ground \nwe have won and to continue, most of all, the effort on behalf of \nothers held captive by the world's remaining dictators or those who \nchoose to terrorize us with their unlawful actions.\n  This rather long opening leads me to a simple discussion of just one \nof the questions we need to answer before we write the laws and \nnegotiate the treaties that determine the nature, size, and shape of \nour defenses. The question is this: What nuclear force structure is \nneeded to provide a minimal level of safety to the people of the United \nStates? My intent in beginning this way is to make certain that I \napproach this question with the requisite seriousness to ensure that my \nanswer will defend America rather than defending an ideology.\n  The person who has been given the authority to command our strategic \nnuclear forces lives at Offut Air Force Base adjacent to Bellevue, NE. \nAs Commander in Chief of Strategic Forces--or STRATCOM--his \nresponsibility is to carry out the orders and instructions given to him \nby the President through his Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have had the \npleasure and honor of visiting STRATCOM on many occasions. On each of \nthose occasions I have been briefed on the plans and mission of our \nstrategic nuclear forces. On each of these occasions, I have left with \npride and enthusiasm for the patriotism, energy, and talent of the men \nand women who serve at STRATCOM. On every occasion I have left with the \nimpression that Americans are getting their money's worth from this \neffort. With this in mind, I think it is important to describe for the \nAmerican people what STRATCOM is and what it does.\n  The mission of STRATCOM is simple, but it is also deadly serious. \nTheir mission is to ``deter major military attack, and if deterrence \nfails, employ forces.'' In this effort, Adm. Richard Mies, the \nCommander of STRATCOM, controls the most effective and lethal set of \narmaments ever assembled by human beings: The strategic nuclear force \nof the United States of America. Yet, nearly a decade after the end of \nthe cold war, many Americans no longer have an appreciation for the \nsize and power of this force. I would like to take this opportunity to \ndescribe the force Admiral Mies controls.\n  First, America's strategic nuclear weapons are based on a triad of \ndelivery systems: Land-based, sea-based, and strategic bombers. The \nU.S. relies on this triad to ensure credibility and survivability. \nBecause our forces are diversified in this way, a potential enemy must \nrecognize that, regardless of any hostile action, the United States \nwould be able to retaliate with overwhelming force.\n  Currently, the U.S. has about 500 Minutemen III and 50 Peacekeeper \nmissiles in the land-based arsenal. While some of the Minuteman III \nmissiles are being modified to accept single warheads, the bulk of \nthese missiles are armed with three warheads. These warheads have a \nyield ranging from 170 to 335 kilotons. The 50 Peacekeeper missiles are \neach armed with 10 individually targetable warheads with a yield of 300 \nkilotons. In other words, our current land-based force alone can, upon \nan order and instruction from the President of the United States, \ndeliver approximately 2,000 warheads to 2,000 targets on over 500 \ndelivery vehicles with a total yield of about 550 megatons.\n\n  In itself, this is an awesome force. But it is only the beginning of \nwhat is available to U.S. military planners. At sea, we have 18 Ohio-\nclass submarines. These are the ultimate in survivability, able to stay \nundetected at sea for long periods of time. As such, our submarine \nforce must give pause to any potential aggressor. Eight of these boats \ncarries 24 C-4 missiles. Each of these missiles are loaded with eight \nwarheads with 100 kilotons of yield. The other 10 subs carry 24 of the \nupdated D-5 missiles. These missiles are also equipped with eight \nwarheads with varying degrees of yield from 100 to 475 kilotons.\n  This is close to 1,500 additional targets that we are able to hit \naccurately and rapidly, if the President of the United States merely \ngives the order--an awesome force, again, all by itself to be able to \ndeter individuals or nation states from taking action against the \nUnited States.\n  The third leg of the triad, the strategic bomber force, includes both \nthe B-2 and the B-52 bomber. These bombers have the capacity to carry \n1,700 warheads via nuclear bombs and air-launched cruiser missiles.\n  Talking about this force, I use--and others do as well--words such as \n``yield'' and ``kilotons'' or ``megatons.'' Unfortunately, most of \nthese words to a lot of us have very little meaning. On previous \noccasions, I have come to the floor to describe what a single 100-\nkiloton weapon would do to one American city, the kind of destruction \nnot just to that American city but to the American economy, as well as \nto the psyche of the American people who would, to put it mildly, be \nterrorized as a consequence of this single action. I don't want to \nrecount that narrative today, but I do think it is important for us to \ntry to put the power of these weapons in perspective. Oftentimes we \ndon't. The numbers are so large and the weapons systems so numerous \nthat we get dulled in our recognition of what they can do.\n  Let me use one example. On August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay dropped the \nfirst atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. That and the \nsubsequent bombing of Nagasaki ended World War II. Little Boy was the \nname of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It destroyed 90 percent \nof the city. Instantly, 45,000 of this city's 250,000 inhabitants were \nkilled. Within days, another 19,000 had died from the aftereffects of \nthe bomb. This bomb had a yield of 15 kilotons. A 300-kiloton warhead \nsuch as can be found on top of our Peacekeeper missile is 20 times as \npowerful. We don't have in our strategic arsenal a weapon that is under \n100 kilotons. Each of the 50 Peacekeeper missiles in our arsenal \ncarries 10 of these 300-kiloton weapons. In all, Admiral Mies, under \norders from the President of the United States, can deliver 6,000 \nstrategic nuclear warheads with an approximate yield of over 1,800 \nmegatons.\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important, as we debate what our \nnuclear weapons system needs to be, that we understand this concept and \nthat we sort of take a map and use some common sense and try to \nevaluate what 6,000 nuclear weapons with over 100 kilotons of yield \neach could do to targets inside of our principal reason for deterrence, \nmaintaining that arsenal, and that is Russia today.\n  I think common sense would cause us to pause and wonder whether or \nnot we are keeping a level of weapons beyond what is necessary.\n  The purpose of this description is to give my colleagues a sense of \nthis force and what this force could do if brought to bear by order of \nour Commander in Chief. I think it is fair for the American people to \nask, first, what is the purpose of this force. According to the 2000 \nedition of the Secretary of Defense's Annual Report to the President \nand to Congress:\n\n       Nuclear forces remain a critical element of the U.S. policy \n     of deterrence.\n\n  Simply put, the United States maintains its nuclear arsenal to guard \nagainst an attack from any potential weapons of mass destruction \nthreat. I think it is important for us as well to examine these \npotential threats and ask if our current nuclear forces are structured \nto adequately address them.\n  As I see it, there are three main sources of threat for which we must \nmaintain a nuclear deterrent. The first is the threat from rogue \nnations like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. While the United States must \nremain vigilant in the effort to confront the weapons of mass \ndestruction programs of these nations, there is no evidence that any of \nthese countries currently possess nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it \nwould be hard to justify the expenditure of approximately $25 billion a \nyear to maintain an arsenal of over 6,000 warheads to defend against \nthe threat posed by rogue nations.\n  If not rogue nations, what about China? While the threat from China \nhas gotten a lot of attention lately, press accounts indicate the \nChinese have no more than 20 land-based nuclear missiles capable of \nreaching the United States. Also according to the media, Chinese \nnuclear weapons are not kept on continual alert. Rather, nuclear \nwarheads and liquid fuel tanks are stored separate from their missiles. \nIt would take time for the Chinese to fuel, arm, and launch these \nweapons. Now, just one of these weapons would cause immense pain and \ndevastation, but the likelihood of their use, accidental or \nintentional, is low. Once again, the maintenance of over 6,000 warheads \nis hardly justified by China's 20 missiles.\n  The only other threat that can justify our nuclear force levels is \nthe Russian nuclear arsenal. But what is the current state of the \nRussian nuclear arsenal?\n  The Russian military relies on the same triad of delivery systems as \nwe do. In their land-based arsenal, the Russians have approximately:\n  180 SS-18 missiles with 10 warheads at 550 kiloton yields each,\n  They have 160 SS-19 missiles with six warheads at 550 kiloton yields \neach.\n  They have 86 SS-24 missiles with 10 warheads at 550 kilotons yields \neach.\n  They have 360 SS-25 missiles with a single warhead each at 550 \nkiloton yield, and they have\n  10 SS-27 Topol M missiles with a single warhead at 550 kiloton yield.\n  This is obviously an impressive force. Any one of these weapons could \ndevastate an American city or cities. But the Russians are finding that \nmany of these missiles are nearing the end of the service-lives. And \nbudgetary constraints have slowed the pace of acquisition of their \nlatest land-based missile, the Topol M, to the point at which they are \nhaving trouble maintaining the numbers of weapons that will be allowed \nunder the START treaties.\n  The collapse of the Russian economy, and the resulting strain on the \nRussian military budget, has also had disastrous consequences for the \nRussian Navy. Russia now has less than 30 operational nuclear-armed \nsubmarines. In fact, the slow op tempo of Russian submarines has meant \nthat at certain times none of these boats are at sea. Regardless, \nreports indicate these subs maintain almost 350 nuclear delivery \nvehicles with more than 1,500 available warheads.\n  The Russian Air Force has also suffered. At the end of 1998, Russia \nhad about 70 strategic bombers, but not all of these were operational. \nEstimates are Russian strategic bombers have about 800 warheads on both \nnuclear bombs and air launched cruise missiles.\n  Mr. President, the overall picture of the Russian arsenal force is \nthat it is deadly, but it is decaying as well at an extremely rapid \nrate. Russian generals have said that they see a time in the near \nfuture when the Russian strategic arsenal will be measured not in \nthousands but in hundreds of weapons. It is this decay in the Russian \narsenal which I believe poses the greatest threat to the United States \nand should encourage us to do more to find ways in which to achieve \nsignificant parallel nuclear reductions.\n  Some will argue that we have in the process already a way to achieve \nthose reductions and it is called START. Yet even if START II is \nratified by the Russian Duma, the United States and Russia would still \nhave 3,500 nuclear warheads on each side at the end of 2007. We can't \nafford to wait over 7 years to make reductions that leave the Russians \nwith still more weapons than they can control.\n  In response, some argue not to worry, START II is going to be quickly \nfollowed by START III. In discussions with the Russians on a possible \nSTART III treaty, the United States has told Russia that we are not \nwilling to go below the 2,000- to 2,500-warhead threshold. This number \nis based on a 1997 study on U.S. minimum deterrence needs completed by \nthe then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili.\n  While I have no doubt that this report was professionally prepared \nand evaluated on criteria available at the time, I believe strongly it \nis time to redo this study. The current size of the United States and \nRussian nuclear arsenals is not based on any rational assessment of \nneed; rather, it is a relic of the cold war. As the former commander of \nSTRATCOM, Gen. Eugene Habiger, has said, ``The cold war was a unique \nwar. And when the war ended, the loser really didn't lose. We still had \nthis massive military might on both sides staring each other in the \nface.''\n  As I have described the accuracy, diversity, and power of our nuclear \narsenal, I find it difficult to argue that the men and women at \nSTRATCOM will be able to accomplish their objective of deterring attack \nwith far fewer weapons. I don't know what the magic number is for \nminimum deterrence, but given our cooperative relationship with Russia, \ngiven the fact Russia is about to hold its third democratic election \nfor President, and given our conventional and intelligence \ncapabilities, I am confident we can deter any aggressor with less than \n6,000, or 3,500, or even 2,000 warheads. It is time we begin the \nprocess to come up with a realistic estimate of our deterrence needs.\n  As long as nuclear weapons remain a reality in this world, the men \nand women at STRATCOM will have a job to do in defending our Nation. \nTheir contribution to our safety cannot be underestimated. But just as \nthey have a responsibility, we have a responsibility to act in a way \nthat will decrease the danger of nuclear weapons and increase the \nsafety and security of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1304-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JUDGE FUENTES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our \ncolleagues in marking the 25th annual observance of International \nWomen's Day.\n  Today, March 8, 2000, is a day on which people around the world will \ncelebrate the myriad contributions and accomplishments of women.\n  Women in the United States and around the world have made tremendous \nprogress toward full equality since this observance was initiated by \nthe United Nations in 1975, the International Year of the Woman.\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n  Sadly, that progress has been tempered by the continued prevalence--\nand in some places the troubling acceptance and even encouragement--of \ngender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence.\n  No one disputes that women in the United States have come a long way \nin the quarter century since the first International Women's Day was \nobserved. Women are making significant contributions at every level of \nour society and in every level of government, from local school boards \nto the President's Cabinet.\n  But we must do more. Quality, affordable child care must be more \naccessible. Women should not have to choose between taking care of \ntheir children and the job that they need to provide the basic \nnecessities of food, clothing, and shelter for their families.\n  The glass ceiling, while perhaps a bit cracked, still blocks the \nprogress of many women who work outside the home. And women who work \noutside of the home deserve equal pay for equal work. We must do all we \ncan to close the wage gap between women and their male counterparts.\n  In the United States, March is National Women's History Month. This \nmonth we celebrate the contributions of women such as Carrie Chapman \nCatt, a native of Ripon, Wisconsin, who served as the last president of \nthe National American Women Suffrage Association, and was the founder \nand first president of the National League of Women Voters. Her \ninfluence on the direction and success of the suffrage movement is \nlegendary, and her legacy in grassroots organizing is equally \nsignificant. She led a tireless lobbying campaign in Congress, sent \nletters and telegrams, and eventually met directly with the President--\nusing all the tools of direct action with which political organizers \nare now so familiar today.\n  Catt's crusade for suffrage saw a home front victory on June 10, \n1919, when Wisconsin became the first state to deliver ratification of \nthe constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote before it \nwas adopted as the Nineteenth Amendment in August of 1920.\n  Carrie Chapman Catt's legacy is alive and well today as women around \nthe globe become more active in their communities and in the political \nprocess.\n  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, I had the opportunity late last year to \ntravel to ten African nations. During my trip, I saw first-hand the \nimportant role that women play in every aspect of society in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  In Rwanda, I was struck by the generosity and far-sightedness of a \nwoman I met just outside the capital city of Kigali. She had donated \nland to refugees from different ethnic backgrounds and was helping them \nto build a new, integrated community on that property. It is this kind \nof selfless act that will help to build the bridges that are necessary \nto heal the wounds left by the ethnic violence in that country.\n  While in Uganda, I had the opportunity to meet with female \nlegislators and the Minister of Ethics and Integrity, who happens to be \nfemale. Africa can only benefit from the women who are taking an active \nrole in governing.\n  Women's voices also need to be heard in ongoing peace negotiations \naround the globe. For example, it is crucial that women be included in \nthe inter-Congolese dialogue, and that they be allowed to participate \nfully in Rwanda's justice system.\n  On a more somber note, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has ravaged the \ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa. This disease affects women at a \nsignificantly higher rate than men. We need to be vigilant in \npreventing mother-to-child transmission and in promoting programs at \nhome and abroad that educate women about reproductive choices and the \nprevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity, as we honor all women and \ngirls worldwide, to again call for prompt hearings in the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on the United \nNations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women (CEDAW). CEDAW marked its 20th anniversary last year and \nstill has not been ratified by one of its chief architects--the United \nStates. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional responsibility to \noffer its advice and consent on this treaty.\n  Mr. President, as the father of two daughters, I believe we must do \nall we can to improve the status of women in the United States and \naround the world. Respect for basic human rights--regardless of gender, \nrace, ethnicity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation--is a \nfundamental value that we must pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in honor of International Women's Day, I \nrespectfully call upon my friend, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, to hold hearings on an international treaty to \nfight discrimination against women around the world.\n  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women (CEDAW) was adopted by the United Nations in 1979 and \nsigned by President Carter in 1980. It is a comprehensive and detailed \ninternational agreement to promote the equality of women and men. It \nlegally defines discrimination against women for the first time and \nestablishes rights for women in areas not previously covered by \ninternational law. More than 160 countries have ratified CEDAW, \nincluding all of our European allies and most of our important trading \npartners. It is well past high-time that the United States Senate take \nup and ratify this important international agreement.\n  In 1988, I convened field hearings on CEDAW in Massachusetts to \nhighlight the importance of this treaty to American women. In the years \nthat followed, I was pleased to support the efforts of former Senator \nClaiborne Pell, then-chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to \ndevelop a resolution of ratification of CEDAW. In 1994, thanks to \nSenator Pell's leadership, the Foreign Relations Committee voted 13 to \n5 to report the Convention favorably with a resolution of ratification \nto the Senate for its advice and consent. Despite support for \nratification from Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, many \nstate legislatures, the Clinton administration, and from the American \npublic, opponents of this treaty blocked its consideration by the full \nSenate.\n  The resolution of ratification for CEDAW could be taken up tomorrow, \nif there was the political will in the Senate to do so. Ratification of \nCEDAW will strengthen our continuing efforts to ensure that women \naround the world are treated fairly and have the opportunity to realize \ntheir full potential. It will send a clear signal of our commitment to \neliminating all forms of discrimination against women and it will \nunderscore the importance we assign to international efforts to promote \nthe rights of women. By allowing us to participate in the UN Committee \non the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, ratification will \ngive us a bigger voice in shaping international policies that affect \nwomen.\n  Our failure to ratify has encouraged criticism from allies who cannot \nunderstand our refusal to uphold rights that are already found within \nthe provisions of our own Constitution. It has put us in the same \ncategory with a small and very undistinguished minority of countries \nwho have not ratified CEDAW, including Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran \nand Sudan. It is difficult for the United States to criticize the \nterrible treatment of women in these and other nations when we have not \nyet recognized those rights as international legal standards.\n  CEDAW is an important human rights document that is largely \nconsistent with the existing state and federal laws of the United \nStates. Senate advice and consent to this Convention will demonstrate \nU.S. leadership in the fight for women around the world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today is a very special day for \nmillions of women around the world. Today is a day that celebrates the \npromise of a better future. Today is a day that offers the hope that \ninjustices inflicted on too many women in too many societies will \ndisappear from the earth forever. Today, March 8, 2000, is \nInternational Women's Day\n  I rise today to recognize this day's importance to the women of today \nand to the generations of women to come. I rise to cry shame for our \nfailures in fulfilling this day's promise. And, I rise to direct our \nattention to three critical\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nissues: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women, CEDAW, international family planning, and \nthe international trafficking of women and girls. These are issues in \nwhich the United States, and especially this body, are honor-bound to \nspare no effort in leading the international community to improve the \nstatus of women around the world.\n  In 1948, the United Nations dramatically focused world attention on \nthe international human rights agenda when it adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This historic event aimed at increasing \npublic awareness of the need to better the human condition in many \nplaces throughout the globe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nrepresented a milestone in human history. Regrettably, it glossed over \nthe needs of over half the world's population--women.\n  Women's rights remained unrecognized as a legitimate concern until \nthe Convention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \nCEDAW, was drafted to redress this oversight. CEDAW organized all \nexisting international standards regarding discrimination on the basis \nof gender, and established rights for women in areas not previously \nsubject to international standards. The United States actively \nparticipated in drafting of the Convention; President Carter signed it \non July 17, 1980.\n  Then the U.S. did nothing. For fourteen years, the United States \nscrutinized CEDAW with an intense scrutiny normally reserved for \njudging the merits of a technically demanding international agreement, \nnot a document seeking to establish the fundamental human rights of \nover half the world's population. CEDAW was not sent to the Senate \nuntil September, 1994.\n  In 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee recommended by bipartisan \nvote that CEDAW be approved with qualifications, but acted too late in \nthe session for the Convention to be considered by the full Senate.\n  Now, almost six years later, the Convention continues to languish in \nthe Senate, locked up in the Committee on Foreign Relations. A bi-\npartisan group of women Senators, among whom I am proud to be counted, \nhas sponsored Senate Resolution 237 which expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should hold hearings \non CEDAW and that the full Senate should act on CEDAW by March 8, 2000.\n  Today is March 8, 2000. The date has come, and will go, and this body \nhas yet to take substantive action on CEDAW, even though this \nConvention contains no provisions in conflict with American law.\n  The Convention has been ratified by 161 countries. Of the world's \ndemocracies, only the United States has yet to ratify this fundamental \ndocument. Indeed, even countries we regularly censure for human rights \nabuses--China, the People's Republic of Laos, Iraq--have either signed \nor agreed in principle. In our failure to ratify CEDAW, we now keep \ncompany with a select few--Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Afghanistan \namong them. Remember, as the old saying goes, we are judged by \nthe company we keep. Is this how we want to be known when it comes to \ndefending the human rights of those unable to defend themselves?\n\n  In failing to sign on to this Convention, we risk losing our moral \nright to lead on human rights. By ratifying CEDAW, we will demonstrate \nour commitment to promoting equality and to protecting women's rights \nthroughout the world. By ratifying CEDAW, we will send a strong message \nto the international community that the U.S. understands the challenges \nfaced by discrimination against women, and we will not abide by it. By \nratifying CEDAW, we reestablish our credentials as a leader on human \nrights and women's rights.\n  Today, as we commemorate International Women's Day, I call on my \ncolleagues in the Senate to move forward and ratify CEDAW.\n  The second issue I would like to touch on today is one which has seen \nmuch congressional attention in recent years: U.S. support for \ninternational family planning and reproductive health.\n  The world now has more than 6 billion people. The United Nations \nestimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. Almost all \nof this growth will occur in the places least able to bear up under the \npressures of massive population increases. The brunt will be in \ndeveloping countries lacking the resources needed to provide basic \nhealth or education services. If women are to be able to better their \nown lives and the lives of their families, they must have access to the \neducational and medical resources needed to control their reproductive \ndestinies and their health.\n  International family planning programs reduce poverty, improve health \nand raise living standards around the world; they enhance the ability \nof couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their \nchildren.\n  Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, \nand under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the \nUnited States has established a long and distinguished record of world \nleadership on international family planning and reproductive health \nissues.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years these programs have come under \nincreasing partisan attack, despite the fact that no U.S. international \nfamily planning funds are spent on international abortion.\n  The Fiscal Year 2000 omnibus appropriations bill contained ``Mexico \nCity'' restrictions that prohibit U.S. grants to private foreign non-\ngovernmental organizations that perform abortions or lobby to change \nabortion laws in foreign countries. House leaders insisted on these \nprovisions in exchange for acceptance of arrear payments to the United \nNations.\n  I was disappointed that the bill included this language. I voted in \nfavor of the legislation because I thought it critical that we pay our \nback dues to the United Nations, and because it contained a provision \ngranting Presidential authority--which President Clinton later \nexercised--to waive the restrictions through the end of Fiscal Year \n2000. I am pleased the President took this action and that he announced \nthat he would oppose any attempt to renew the ``Mexico City'' \nrestrictions when they expire on September 30, 2000.\n\n  International family planning programs have experienced significant \ncuts in funding in recent years. President Clinton's foreign aid budget \nfor Fiscal Year 2001 calls for $542 million for international family \nplanning programs, restoring funding to Fiscal Year 1995 levels.\n  Today, as we mark International Women's Day, I urge my colleagues to \nrecommit themselves to U.S. leadership in international family planning \nand support the President's request.\n  Lastly, I would like to focus attention on a vicious, and growing \nproblem for women the world over--forced or coerced trafficking of \ngirls and women for the purpose of sexual exploitation.\n  This is a rapidly growing, highly lucrative international business. \nThe United Nations estimates that every year millions of women fall \nvictims to this international trafficking in human life. Criminal \norganizations make an estimated $7 billion a year on the trafficking \nand prostitution of approximately 4 million women and girls. They do \nsome by preying on the fears and economic insecurity created by the \ngrinding poverty, rising unemployment and disintegrating social \nnetworks common to many poorer societies, today.\n  The traffickers target women from Eastern Europe and East Asia, women \nwho agree to work as waitresses, models or dancers in the \nindustrialized world to escape the grip of poverty in their native \nlands. But, once they arrive, their passports are seized, they are \nbeaten, held captive and forced into prostitution. Traffickers and \npimps hold these women in bondage, forcing them to work uncompensated \nas repayment for exaggerated room, board, and travel expenses.\n  These victims have little or no legal protection; they travel on \nfalsified documents or enter by means of inappropriate visas provided \nby traffickers. When and if discovered by the police, these women are \nusually treated as illegal aliens and deported. Even worse, laws \nagainst traffickers who engage in forced prostitution, rape, kidnaping, \nand assault and battery are rarely enforced. The women will not testify \nagainst traffickers out of fear of retribution, the threat of \ndeportation, and humiliation for their actions.\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\n  We, as a nation, cannot sit idly and allow this vicious exploitation \nof women to continue unchecked. We must effectively enforce current \nlaws and implement new laws to protect victims and prosecute \ntraffickers. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of Senator Wellstone's \nInternational Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection of \n1999 which provides more information on trafficking and toughens law \ndealing with the illegal trade of women.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital piece of \nlegislation.\n  The issues I have laid before you today are not just women's issues, \nthey are humanity's issues. As First Lady Hillary Clinton has said, \n`Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights.' \nThey merit attention throughout the year, not just on one day.\n  We must debate and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and \nour resources to international family planning programs. And we must \nenact tough anti-trafficking legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1307-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF JAMES DUFFY TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am fully aware that this is a busy year, \nthe year we elect a new President. I also realize that one-third of our \ncolleagues will be up for reelection or will be involved in the \nelection for the seat from which they are retiring. As a result, all of \nus are striving to close this shop as soon as possible and go home. \nHowever, we do have important unfinished business with the Judiciary.\n  The Judiciary is the critical third branch of our government. Just as \nit is important that we hold an election this year, it is important \nthat we fill the vacancies in our court system. I can not speak of \nvacancies in other districts or other circuits, but I believe I can \nspeak of vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. Hawaii is part of the Ninth \nCircuit. Since the retirement of Judge Choy in 1984, Hawaii has not \nbeen represented on that bench by a full-time Circuit Judge. The law of \nthe United States requires that at least one member of the bench of \neach state be represented on the Circuit Court, that there be a judge \nfrom Hawaii on the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Hawaii delegation has submitted the name of James Duffy. I have \nno idea whether Mr. Duffy is a Democrat or Republican. I have not asked \nhim. However, his reputation as a skilled lawyer is well-established in \nour islands. Mr. Duffy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He \nearned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of Saint Thomas and \nearned his Juris Doctorate from Marquette University Law School in 1968 \nwhere he served on the Board of Editors of the Law Review. Upon \ngraduation, he came to Hawaii to begin his career. He has spent his \nlegal career in private litigation practice, doing both plaintiff and \ndefense representation, for more than 31 years. He has served the \nCircuit Courts of the State of Hawaii as a court-appointed Special \nMaster in Probate, Guardianship, and Family Court Proceedings, as a \nSpecial Master for Discovery Rulings in civil cases, and as a Mediator. \nMr. Duffy has also served in leadership roles in legal organizations, \neducational organizations, and even as a judge in the Hawaii High \nSchool Rodeo Association. In his spare time, he and his wife, Jeanne, \nbreed and sell quarter horses and Brahma cattle. Mr. Duffy is a vital \npart of the Hawaii legal and civic community.\n  Jim Duffy was nominated by the President for a position on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals on June 17, 1999. I have been advised that the \nAmerican Bar Association has finished reviewing his credentials. Mr. \nDuffy was unanimously given the ABA's highest grade of ``well-\nqualified.'' The Board of Directors of the Hawaii State Bar Association \nalso unanimously reported that Mr. Duffy was well-qualified. In fact, \nin a letter to the Chairperson of the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary, the HSBA President wrote, ``[f]or what it's worth, \nmy Board expressed dismay that there wasn't a category called `the very \nbest.' We consider Jim to be the best of the best.''\n  Both Democrats and Republicans in my state, regard Jim Duffy as one \nof Hawaii's best lawyers. I do hope the Judiciary Committee will give \nMr. Duffy a hearing and expedite the consideration of his nomination. \nThis will provide its members the opportunity to meet him and review \nhis credentials and skills. I am convinced the members will be \nimpressed by him. I am equally convinced that Mr. Duffy will be a good \njudge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1307-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements of Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough March 6, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \nthe 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). The \nbudget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted to the Senate \nto reflect funding for emergency requirements, disability reviews, \nadoption assistance, the earned income tax credit initiative, and \narrearages for international organizations, peacekeeping, and \nmultilateral banks.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $10.3 billion in budget authority and below the budget \nresolution by $2.3 billion in outlays.

This report is \n     submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of H. Con. Res. 68, \n     the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000. \n     The budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted \n     to the Senate to reflect funding for emergency requirements, \n     disability reviews, adoption assistance, the earned income \n     tax credit initiative, and arrearages for international \n     organizations, peacekeeping, and multilateral banks. These \n     revisions are required by section 314 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, as amended.\n       Since my last report, dated January 27, 2000, the Congress \n     has cleared for the President's signature the Omnibus Parks \n     Technical Corrections Act of 1999 (H.R. 149). This action has \n     changed the current level of budget authority and outlays.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B.

Mr. President, today, as we celebrate National Women's \nHistory Month, I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary women, past \nand present, who have broken down barriers and continue to shape our \nnation's future.\n  First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski, who herself has succeeded in redefining the role of \nwomen in politics by becoming the most senior woman in the Senate \ntoday. Twenty years ago, when Senator Mikulski was in the House, she \nand another one of my notable colleagues, Senator Orrin Hatch, co-\nsponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution declaring National \nWomen's History Week, now a month long celebration acknowledging the \naccomplishments of women. I applaud my colleagues for their leadership \nin bringing forth this important celebration of women.\n  This year's national theme is ``An Extraordinary Century for Women--\nNow, Imagine the Future!'' Given the extraordinary accomplishments of \nwomen this last century and the bright future of women in this new \nmillennium, a more appropriate theme for this month's celebration of \nwomen could not have been chosen.\n  This month, we pay tribute to the founders of the first Women's \nRights Convention 150 years ago. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, \nand Susan B. Anthony were visionaries who championed women's rights. We \nalso celebrate the historic achievements of Amelia Earhart, Ida B. \nWells, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy, Sally Ride, and other \nlegendaries who redefined the role of women and are role models, not \nonly for today's young women, but for all.\n  My home state of Illinois is filled with such legendary women. Jane \nAddams was a socially conscious community leader who founded Hull \nHouse, a neighborhood center for immigrants in Chicago and was awarded \nthe Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Minnie Saltzman-Stevens was an \ninternationally known Wagnerian soprano who received her first voice \ntraining from the O.R. Skinner Music School in Illinois. Content \nJohnson was an artist who gained considerable reputation as a portrait \nand still life painter in oils. Elizabeth Irons Folsom was an author \nand winner of the 1923 O'Henry Prize for short stories. Margaret \nIllington, born Maud Light, was a renowned actress who so loved \nBloomington, Illinois, that she changed her name to Illington, forever \nbearing the proof of her love. These women paved the way for today's \ntalented female Illinoisans.\n  Today's prominent Illinoisans include my friend and former colleague \nCarol Moseley-Braun, the first African American elected to the Senate \nand now the US Ambassador to New Zealand; Karen Nussbaum, Director of \nthe Women's Bureau in the US Department of Labor; Marlee Matlin, the \nonly hearing impaired person ever to win an Academy Award for Best \nActress; Hillary Rodham Clinton, American first lady, attorney, and \nleader on education and children's issues; and Caribel Washington, an \n86 year old civil rights activist who continues to use her strength and \nfortitude to inspire all people.\n  The struggles and triumphs of these women will guide those who \nfollow. One such follower is Winifred Alves, who I had the pleasure of \nmeeting the other day. Winifred is this year's recipient of the Girl \nScout Gold Award.\n  Winifred's future is as bright as her Gold Award.\n  Despite opposition, many of us in this Congress are fighting to \nensure fair pay for women and close the wage gap. We are working to \nopen the doors of college to all Americans by providing quality \neducation at the elementary and secondary level and college tuition \nassistance to make higher education more affordable. We are working to \nimprove our nation's health by bringing the issues of affordable \nprescription drugs and a Patient's Bill of Rights to the forefront.\n  Although Winifred's future is bright, the lives of many of our \nchildren remain in jeopardy until we pass tougher gun laws. Last week, \nsix year old Kayla Rolland was tragically shot to death by her fellow \nkindergarten classmate with a stolen gun. Kayla never had an \nopportunity to become a Girl Scout. She died senselessly because \nanother six year old child was able to gain access to an illegal \nfirearm. How many more of our children must die before we, as a \nCongress, band together on a bipartisan basis to pass comprehensive gun \nlegislation?\n  In this month of March, let us not only pay tribute to those women \nwho have pioneered and inspired all of us, let us remember the young \nlives we have failed to protect by failing to pass commonsense gun \ncontrol legislation. Let us also remember, their mothers, teachers, \nneighbors and friends, who helped shape these young lives but will \nnever know the full potential of their joyous labor. And let us also \nremember our own mothers, sisters, and aunts who, although unknown to \nmost, continue to shape our lives and our nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1308-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1308-S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONVENTION TO ELIMINATE ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Boxer, \nfor bringing this important treaty before the Senate. I am proud to be \na sponsor of Senate Resolution 237, which expresses the sense of the \nSenate that hearings should be held by the Foreign Relations Committee \non the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen.\n  The treaty establishes international standards and definitions to \nprotect women against discrimination. The treaty also calls for action \nin the areas of education, health care, and domestic relations, and \ncreates a process to monitor the status of women and their progress \ntoward equity. The standards are fully consistent with existing U.S. \nprotections against discrimination. In countries that do not have such \nprotections, this treaty is an effective tool to combat violence \nagainst women, reform unfair inheritance and property rights, and \nstrengthen women's access to fair employment and economic opportunity.\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\n  165 countries have not ratified the treaty. As the country that \nconsistently leads the way in the battle for human rights and human \ndignity, and that took an active role in drafting the treaty, it is \npast time for the United States to ratify it as well.\n  U.S. support for women's equality at home and abroad requires that we \npromptly consider and ratify this treaty. I urge the Senate to pass \nthis resolution and to do all we can to expedite the ratification of \nthis important treaty.\n  To move our country in that direction, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee should hold a hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1309-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WREN's hard work has made \na real difference in the lives of the women of Northern New Hampshire, \nand the accomplishments of its members are to be commended.\n  With the assistance of Passumpsic Bank, WREN developed a program to \nhelp women in Northern New Hampshire start their own businesses. The \nprogram initially offered training in areas such as business plan \ndevelopment, marketing, financial management and computer literacy, but \nquickly expanded to include other crucial skills such as networking and \ntechnology training. As a result of the success of those programs, WREN \nis currently developing a community center that will house a retail \nstore to sell the products of the program's participants, a community \nart studio and an expanded meeting and teaching space. The sky is the \nlimit for this program, and its future certainly looks bright.\n  The achievements of the program are remarkable, and they serve as a \nshining example of what can be accomplished when local banks and \ncommunity-oriented groups work together. It is truly an honor to serve \nsuch a hardworking organization in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1309-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1309-S1310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH: TRIBUTE TO ALICE WALKER\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, 20 years ago, my friends and \ncolleagues Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Senator Orrin Hatch \nfrom Utah joined to create a National Women's History Week. Since that \ntime, the commemoration has expanded into an entire month of \ncelebration and recognition of the many contributions and \naccomplishments of American women. I am proud to use this occasion to \nhighlight the many accomplishments of one of Georgia's own, author and \nteacher Alice Walker.\n  Alice Walker has become one of the leading voices among African-\nAmerican writers. She has published poetry, novels, short stories, \nessays, and criticism, the most famous probably being ``The Color \nPurple'', for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1983. Her \nportrayal of the struggle of African-Americans throughout history, \nespecially the experiences of black women in the American South, has \nearned her praise around the world. Ms. Walker's insightful and \nriveting portraits of poor, rural life display human resourcefulness, \nstrength and endurance in confronting oppression.\n  Alice Walker was born on February 9, 1944, in Eatonton, Georgia, the \neighth and last child of Willie Lee and Minnie Lou Grant Walker, who \nwere sharecroppers. When she was eight years old, she lost sight in one \neye during an accident with one of her brothers' BB guns. This incident \nproved to be a turning point in Walker's life. Walker has said that it \nwas from this point that she ``really began to see people and things, \nreally to notice relationships and to learn to be patient enough to see \nhow they turned out * * *''\n  In high school, Alice Walker was valedictorian of her class. That \nachievement, coupled with a ``rehabilitation scholarship,'' made it \npossible for her to go to Spelman College, a historically black women's \ncollege in Atlanta, Georgia. After spending two years at Spelman, she \ntransferred to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, traveling to Africa \nas an exchange student during her junior year. She received her \nbachelor of arts degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1965.\n  After graduation, Alice Walker spent the summer in Liberty County, \nGeorgia where she helped to draw attention to the plight of poor people \nin South Georgia. She went door to door registering voters in the \nAfrican-American community. Her work with the neediest citizens in the \nstate helped her to see the debilitating impact of poverty on the \nrelationships between men and women in the community. She moved to New \nYork City shortly thereafter where she worked for the city's welfare \ndepartment. It was then that she was awarded her first writing grant in \n1966.\n  Ms. Walker had originally wanted to go to Africa to write, but \ndecided against it and instead traveled to Tougaloo, Mississippi. It \nwas there where she met her future husband, civil rights attorney \nMelvyn Leventhal. He was supportive of her writing and admired her love \nfor nature. They married in 1967 and became the first legally married \ninterracial couple in the state of Mississippi. While her husband \nfought school desegregation in the courts, Alice worked as a history \nconsultant for the Friends of the Children, Mississippi's Head Start \nProgram.\n  Since there was still a great deal of racial tension in the state, \nand because her husband was working adamantly in the courts to \ndismantle the laws barring desegregation, animosity against the couple \nwas strong. While the couple lived in Mississippi, Alice and her \nhusband slept with a gun under their bed at night for protection. Their \nonly daughter, Rebecca, was born in 1969.\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\n  Alice Walker became active in the Civil Rights Movement of the \n1960's, and remains an involved and vocal activist for many causes \ntoday. She has spoken out in support for the women's equality movement, \nhas been involved in South Africa's anti-apartheid campaign, and has \nworked toward global nuclear arms reduction. One of her most pronounced \ninvolvements has been her tireless work against female genital \nmutilation, the gruesome practice of female circumcision that remains \nprevalent in many African societies.\n  Among her numerous awards and honors for her writing are the Lillian \nSmith Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rosenthal \nAward from the National Institute of Arts & Letters, a nomination for \nthe National Book Award, a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship, a Merrill \nFellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Front Page Award for Best \nMagazine Criticism from the Newswoman's Club of New York. She has also \nreceived the Townsend Prize and a Lyndhurst Prize.\n  In 1984, Ms. Walker started her own publishing company, Wild Trees \nPress. She has authored more than 20 books over the years. Divorced \nfrom her husband, she currently resides in Northern California with her \ndog, Marley where she continues to write.

LEE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntruly incredible American and resident of McLean, Virginia for the past \n35 years, who has passed from this world.\n  Chester M. Lee--known as ``Chet'' to family and friends--was born on \nApril 6, 1919. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy Class of \n1942, Chet Lee went directly into service in World War II. Chet was \ninvolved in a number of battle engagements during World War II and \nsurvived a Japanese kamikaze attack on his ship, the USS Drexler, off \nthe coast of Okinawa in 1945. Chet Lee spent 24 years in the U.S. Navy, \nserving his country with great honor both in and out of battle. Chet \nhelped pioneer the Navy's use of ship radar, was instrumental in \ndevelopment and testing of the POLARIS missile program, and commanded \ntwo Navy destroyers and an entire destroyer division. Chet Lee moved to \nNorthern Virginia in 1964 to serve the Secretary of Defense at the \nPentagon and achieved the rank of Captain before retiring from the Navy \nin 1965. He continued to be affectionately referred to by Navy and non-\nNavy colleagues as ``Captain Lee,'' and remained an avid Navy football \nfan throughout his life!\n  In 1965, Captain Lee requested to be retired from active duty in \norder to answer the call at the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, \nwhich was deeply involved in the Cold War space race. At NASA, Chet \nspent 23 years providing instrumental leadership during our nation's \nmost exciting and pivotal space years. Captain Lee served as Assistant \nMission Director for Apollo Missions 1 to 11 and then Mission Director \nfor Apollo Moon Missions 12 to 17. He was Director for the Apollo/Soyuz \nspace-docking mission, perhaps one of the most significant precursor \nevents to the melting of Cold War barriers between the U.S. and then-\nSoviet Union. Captain Lee's impressive NASA career continued as he \nplayed an integral role in the development, operation and payload \nmanagement for the U.S. Space Shuttle program.\n  In 1987, Chet Lee continued advancing U.S. aerospace leadership in \nthe private sector, joining SPACEHAB Inc., a company dedicated to \npioneering U.S. space commerce. He ascended to the position of \nPresident and Chief Operating Officer in 1996. Chet was instrumental in \nguiding the company's participation in the joint U.S.-Russian Shuttle-\nMir program, and his tenure at SPACEHAB included 13 Space Shuttle \nmissions, including the mission that returned Senator John Glenn to \nspace. Captain Lee became Chairman of SPACEHAB's Astrotech commercial \nsatellite processing subsidiary in 1998 and served on SPACEHAB's Board \nof Directors. At the age of 80, Chet Lee continued to work full-time on \nSPACEHAB and Astrotech projects up to his last days here on Earth.\n  Chet Lee was a tireless public servant, a devoted husband, father and \ngrandfather and mentor to countless in the aerospace community. I am \nproud to have had Chet as a constituent, and my blessings go out to his \nfamily and friends during this time of mourning. I ask my colleagues to \npay tribute today to Captain Lee's memory and to honor him for his \ncontributions to this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1310-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1310-S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JUDY JARVIS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwoman who has sent her reasoned voice across the radio airwaves of \nAmerica. A strong willed and strong minded woman who is not only a \nfriend, but I'm fortunate to say is also a constituent, Judy Jarvis. \nYesterday, this great radio talk show host, Judy Jarvis, my friend, \nlost her battle with cancer.\n  She fought hard to the bitter end. She fought by informing her \naudience, by not keeping them in the dark about the cancer that was \ninvading her body. She shared her fears, her hopes and her dreams with \nher weekday broadcasts and in interviews when the table was turned and \nshe became the subject of the interview. Mr President I would like to \nsubmit two articles for the Record about her battle with cancer. A June \n1999 article from Talkers Magazine and a November 29, 1999 article from \nPeople Magazine. Her listeners became an extended family, and when she \nwasn't well enough to continue broadcasting the entire show everyday, \nthey warmly welcomed her cohost, her son, Jason Jarvis. As the only \nnationally syndicated Mother/Son radio team in America, Judy and Jason \nwere a great team. They enjoyed each other's company and brought a \nwonderful mixture of generations and views to their show.\n  Judy Jarvis will be missed by those of us in this chamber who embrace \ntalk radio, by all of us, Democrats and Republicans who have been \nprivileged to be regular guests on her show. She was a woman of \nintellect and humor, a broadcaster who did her own research and never \nwent for the cheap shot. She was opinionated and provocative, but never \nnasty. Judy dug deep for the questions that would generate answers to \nbest inform her audience. Judy Jarvis earned a special place in the \nhistory of talk radio and left us with a strong human legacy--her \nhusband, Wal, her sons Jason and Clayton and her granddaughter \nAlexandra.\n  I wouldn't be surprised if Judy has not already set up interviews, up \nthere in Heaven. Her audience now is global and out of this world. Judy \nJarvis, you will be missed by those of us fortunate and blessed enough \nto call you friend.\n  Mr. President, I ask that articles from Talkers magazine and from \nPeople magazine be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follows:\n\n                [From Talkers Magazine, June/July 1999]\n\n                    Judy Jarvis--Profile in Courage\n\n                         (By Michael Harrison)\n\n       Hartford.--Everything was rolling along just fine for \n     nationally syndicated talk show host Judy Jarvis. Her \n     independently produced and syndicated midday talk show which \n     has been on the air since April of 1993 had recently achieved \n     what she describes as a ``second tier breakthrough'' and was \n     solidly implanted on more than 50 highly respectable \n     affiliates across America. The longstanding live hours of \n     noon to 3 pm ET had just been expanded an extra couple of \n     hours per day to re-feed several prestigious new stations \n     picking up the show. Judy was appearing as a regular guest on \n     the cable TV news talk channels and her commentaries were \n     being published in important daily newspapers. She was again \n     on the annual TALKERS magazine heavy hundred list for the \n     fifth year in a row and generally admired throughout the \n     industry as a talented talk show host on the rise. Plus, on \n     the business side of things she had attained recognition and \n     respect as the head of a successful, family-run radio network \n     operation complete with a in-house staff of nine and the \n     beneficiary of professional sales and affiliate \n     representation from one of New York's finest national firms, \n     WinStar.\n       The show had even built its own state-of-the-art two-room \n     studio in Farmington Connecticut at the well-known \n     Connecticut School of Broadcasting.\n       Yes, things was going great guns until this past Fall of \n     1998--shortly after the NAB Radio Show in Seattle--when upon \n     feeling unusually fatigued and having developed a cough that \n     would not go away; Judy Jarvis checked into Beth Israel \n     hospital in Boston\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n     and didn't check out for six weeks. Tests indicated that Judy \n     had developed lung cancer . . . a particularly vicious type \n     that had already impacted her blood and was causing clotting \n     problems.\n       ``It was absolutely a shock,'' Judy tells TALKERS magazine. \n     ``It was like being the victim of a drive-by shooting.''\n       Judy has never even been a smoker and, until this \n     terrifying revelation, had enjoyed very good health.\n       ``I was a moose!'' she says, with the good humor that \n     typifies her positive approach to the great challenge that \n     had fallen upon her shoulders.\n       Instantly committed to beating the disease, she was also \n     determined to preserve the radio show that she and her family \n     had worked so long and hard to build. As it is turning out, \n     the family connection plays a key role in the rescue of the \n     Judy Jarvis Show and Hartford-based Jarvis Productions.\n       Five years ago, her son, Jason, then 25, left his job at \n     the Washington, DC political journal Hotline and became his \n     mom's producer. He quickly developed a favorable reputation \n     within the business as both an excellent behind the scenes \n     broadcaster and an extremely personable individual. Her \n     husband, Wal Jarvis--a successful businessman outside the \n     radio industry--also serves on the company's executive board \n     to which he brings his considerable experience and expertise. \n     Judy simply describes Wal and the way he has supported her \n     career and now her personal trial as ``the best ever!''\n       So when disaster struck . . . as an immediate stop-gap \n     measure, ``We ran tape for a few weeks to keep the show on \n     the air,'' Judy recounts. ``That worked well for a while,'' \n     she says, but with her initial stay in the hospital and \n     newly-diagnosed illness extending beyond the program's \n     ability to keep playing reruns and maintain a viable network, \n     her son Jason--who had never been a radio personality--\n     stepped up to the microphone and went on the air. He told the \n     audience about his mother's situation and began to do a radio \n     talk show.\n       His natural ability and honesty were enough to hold the \n     fort for another couple of months while Judy began an \n     aggressive round of treatments to begin fighting the disease.\n       The affiliates were individually informed of the plight by \n     WinStar reps backed up by Jarvis Productions in-house \n     business manager Deb Shillo. Just about all the affiliates \n     were extremely cooperative . . . especially since Jason \n     Jarvis turned out to be a surprisingly talented talker, \n     enhanced, of course, by the extremely dramatic circumstances \n     in which he was immersed. American talk radio was not about \n     to abandon this sturdy ship caught in a storm.\n       When discussing Jason's pinch-hitting effort, Judy tries to \n     hold back the tears. ``He never wanted to do this,'' she says \n     in a burst of emotion that shakes the calm restraint that had \n     marked the conversation to this point.\n       ``It was an amazing act of courage and love. He wanted to \n     save it (the show) in case I would get better.''\n       Judy Jarvis' form of lung cancer hits 20,000 people per \n     year and kills more women than breast cancer. But she \n     optimistically points out that modern medicine has come a \n     long way and ``it is not quite as grim as it might have \n     been'' had this happened several years ago.\n       Judy completed the first round of treatments and returned \n     to the show on January 4, 1999 with nearly 100% of her \n     affiliates (and listeners) intact, waiting for her return. \n     However, now, it had become a two-person show. Jason earned \n     himself a place on the program as co-host and a unique \n     mother-son talk team modestly emerged on the talk radio \n     airwaves of America, largely unheralded by the media at large \n     and void of the hype that usually marks the beginning of \n     something that can lay claim to being a first.\n       But the challenges facing Judy Jarvis and her family were \n     far from over. As the Winter of 1999 wore on, so did the pain \n     in Judy's left leg, due to circulation complications arising \n     from the illness. The bleak diagnosis indicated an \n     irreversible condition in which the only remedy was \n     amputation. In March, Judy Jarvis' left leg was removed below \n     the knee.\n       More treatment, more recovery, more courage . . . and \n     finally back to work, on the air again with Jason.\n       After a period of several weeks in a wheelchair, Judy has \n     been successfully outfitted with a prosthesis and now is able \n     to walk again. She has risen to the challenge with the same \n     positive attitude that she brings to the air. Life is tough \n     enough in the competitive world of day-to-day syndicated talk \n     radio. Judy now does it while going through the discomfort of \n     chemotherapy and adjusting to the trauma of losing a limb.\n       ``The work is conducive to my recovery,'' she says, ``it \n     helps me focus on something positive.'' And the program \n     remains positive. Although Judy's situation has been \n     presented quite honestly to the audience, adding an increased \n     dramatic dimension to the culture of the show, the Judy \n     Jarvis Show remains upbeat and issues-oriented. It continues \n     to reflect the niche she has carved out on the talk radio \n     landscape as a fiercely independent moderate who covers the \n     big political issues, but also talks about day-to-day life \n     and the endless controversies, crisis, joys and sorrows that \n     make up real life for real human beings. Her credentials \n     speak for themselves and give her immense credibility to \n     really communicate with her listeners.\n       In terms of her status in the talk radio industry: She is a \n     giant of strength, will and talent. Staying on the air and \n     running her company as effectively and as dedicatedly as she \n     has done under the conditions she has faced is the kind of \n     inspirational heroism that brings out the best in talk radio \n     as both a business and a cultural phenomenon.\n       Judy Jarvis can be reached via Deb Shillo at Jarvis \n     Productions, 860-242-7276.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From People, Nov. 29, 1999]\n\n                              Life Support\n\n\ncancer-stricken, talk radio's judy jarvis sees the show she loves kept \n                  alive as son jason steps to the mike\n\n       The topic today on The Judy Jarvis Show, out of Farmington, \n     Conn., is overprotective parents. Jarvis listens as her son \n     Jason ranges through a serious of examples in the news, then \n     talks herself about a town that removed see-saws from its \n     playgrounds because children were jumping off and sending \n     kids on the other end crashing down. ``I don't understand \n     it,'' says Jarvis. ``In schools they won't give kids failing \n     grades; they won't let them play sports where the scores are \n     too unbalanced. I learn everything I know from failure! \n     Should parents be there all the time to make sure nothing bad \n     happens?''\n       Obviously she things not. It is also clear from the way the \n     phones light up that the 54-year-old national-radio talk show \n     host is still, in her words, the same ``independent-minded \n     broad'' she has always been. Thankfully, Jarvis is back--back \n     on the air and, more important, back from cancer. It's not \n     that she has been cured. One of 22,000 people stricken with \n     the disease each year without ever having smoked, she still \n     suffers from lung cancer. But for now she seems as feisty as \n     ever. ``You know when everybody tells you to `live in the \n     moment'?'' asks Jarvis.\n       ``I pretty much have done that my whole life. And now we'll \n     just deal with whatever comes.''\n       The possibility of relapse notwithstanding, this moment is \n     a good one for Jarvis. The show, broadcast by about 50 \n     stations from Boston to Seattle, is thriving. Plus, she gets \n     to work with her older son Jason. In fact, she has Jason to \n     thank for her show's very survival. At the beginning of \n     Jarvis's illness, stations stood behind her, broadcasting \n     reruns of her show in the hope she would return. But after \n     six weeks they were worried. That's when Jason, 30, moved \n     behind the mike and saved the day. ``It was either we give up \n     or I step in,'' says Jason, who had been his mother's \n     producer.\n       At first, Jason merely meant to bridge the gap until Judy's \n     return. But the two worked so well together that Jason stayed \n     on as cohost, and they have become the only mother-son team \n     with a nationally syndicated radio show. Jason's new role \n     ``makes it more of a warm, supportive atmosphere,'' says \n     Tracy Marin, operations manager at affiliate KHTL in \n     Albuquerque. ``She was kind of hard-edged before. I think it \n     makes it a lot softer.''\n       It was in October 1998, at a meeting of the National \n     Association of Broadcasters in Seattle, that Jarvis first \n     experienced shortness of breath and a nasty little cough. She \n     didn't pay much attention because she was far more concerned \n     with the convention, which she saw as a stepping-stone toward \n     her goal of becoming a recognized name like Imus or Limbaugh. \n     In spite of her fatigue, Jarvis broadcast live each day from \n     Seattle, waking at 4 a.m. to go through the papers for \n     discussion topics. ``By the end of the trip I thought I had a \n     bug of some sort,'' she says. ``I felt just awful.'' Her \n     husband, Wal, 54, who heads a company that makes parts for \n     the aerospace and surgical industries, assumed that the trip \n     had simply exhausted her.\n       But back in Connecticut a few days later, Jarvis became \n     short of breath and nearly collapsed in the studio parking \n     lot. Wal drove her to her Boston internist, who, he says, \n     ``did a chest X-ray and didn't like the way it looked.'' \n     Further testing showed fluid in her chest, and on Nov. 5 she \n     was admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. There a \n     lung biopsy revealed cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1311-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1311-S1312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAYOR RAYMOND J.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday was the tenth annual \nNational Sportsmanship Day--a day designated to promote ethics, \nintegrity, and character in athletics. I am pleased to say that \nNational Sportsmanship Day was a creation of Mr. Daniel E. Doyle, Jr., \nExecutive Director of the Institute for International Sport at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island. This year, over 12,000 schools in all 50 \nstates and more than 100 countries participated in National \nSportsmanship Day. This is remarkable, since ten years ago this program \nonly existed in Rhode Island Elementary Schools!\n  Yesterday, the Institute held a day-long live internet chat room in \nwhich athletes, coaches, journalists, students, and educators engaged \nin discussions of sportsmanship issues, such as trash-talking, \n``winning at all costs,'' professional athletes as role models, and \nbehavior of fans. I believe that the Institute's work in addressing the \nissues of character and sportsmanship, and its ability to foster good \ndialogue among our young people is significant.\n  As part of the Day's celebration, the Institute selected Sports \nEthics Fellows who have demonstrated ``highly ethical behavior in \nathletics and society.'' Past recipients have included: Kirby Puckett, \nformer Minnesota Twins outfielder and 10-time All Star; Joan Benoit \nSamuelson, gold medalist in the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984; \nand Joe Paterno, longtime head football coach at Penn State University. \nThis year, the Institute honored 10 individuals including Grant Hill, \nfive-time All-Star with the Detroit Pistons, and former All-American at \nDuke; Jennifer Rizzotti, head women's basketball coach, University of \nHartford, and member of the WNBA Houston Comets; Jerry Sandusky, former \ndefensive coordinator/linebackers coach, Penn State University, PA; and \nMark Newlen, former member of the University of Virginia basketball \nteam (1973-77) and presently physical education teacher and coach at \nthe Collegiate School, Richmond, VA.\n  This year, the Institute has found another avenue to promote \nunderstanding and good character for youngsters. A new program called \n``The No Swear Zone'' has been instituted to curb the use of profanity \nin elementary, middle and high school sports, as well as at the college \nlevel. In order for a school's athletic team to become a member of \n``The No Swear Zone,'' it must pledge to stop the use of profanity in \npractice and in games.\n  I am very proud that National Sportsmanship Day was initiated in \nRhode Island, and I applaud the students and teachers who participated \nin this inspiring day. Likewise, I congratulate all of those at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island's Institute for International Sport, whose \nhard work and dedication over the last ten years have made this program \nso successful.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the winning essays from this year's contest \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The essays follow:\n\n                Always Try Your Hardest, Be Encouraging\n\n(By Katie McGwin, a fifth grader at Quidnesset Elementary School North \n                             Kingstown, RI)\n\n       To be a good sport means to be kind to others, play fairly, \n     never cheat, try your hardest and be responsible. You can be \n     kind to others by saying encouraging words such as ``You can \n     do it!'' and ``You tried your hardest! Maybe next time.''\n       These simple words can convince people that they really can \n     do it and they tried their hardest and next time they will do \n     it well. You can play fairly by following the rules and never \n     cheating.\n       You can try your hardest by being the best you can be. You \n     can be responsible by keeping track of your things, doing \n     chores, cleaning up after yourself, taking care of your pets, \n     bringing your homework into school and many other things.\n       I try my hardest in my dance class. I do well, but I think \n     I could try harder. I show my responsibility by keeping track \n     of my things, doing chores and bringing my homework into \n     school. I sometimes encourage people. I always play fairly \n     and I never cheat. I am showing that I am a good sport. I do \n     well in school and I do well at home.\n       Some people do not show sportsmanship. Those are the people \n     who do not care about the rules of the game. They do not show \n     responsibility. Those are the people who are not kind to \n     others. They do not cheer people on. They think that they are \n     the winners and the other team is just there to lose.\n       Losing can be tough. I've been there, too. Don't get too \n     discouraged. The truth might be that your team will win next \n     time. So keep trying.\n       You may have different ways of being a good sport. It \n     doesn't matter what you do to be a good sport; it matters \n     that you are a good sport. Remember this: Always keep trying!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Children Learn Good and Bad From Models\n\n   (By Patrick Kolsky, a 10th grader at Novato (Calif.)

Sports in the beginning were first seen \n     as something that could help someone relieve pressure, help \n     cope with stress, join families and communities together and \n     to expose oneself to a little friendly competition.\n       Most of all, however, sports were mainly seen as a creative \n     outlet to relieve one's extra energy and recycle it into \n     something that was fun for everyone. In more recent years, \n     sports have escalated into something more.\n       Professional sports focus on winning and salary, while the \n     original intentions of sports take a back seat. Younger \n     children are extremely influenced by professional athletes \n     and are well known to try and imitate their favorite player.\n       Most athletes today don't really care whether they had fun \n     while playing a sport, but only if they won or lost. and why \n     should they? It is not their job to have fun or to set good \n     examples--their job is to win. But when the millions of \n     onlookers observe what ``real'' athletes perceive of sports, \n     it is almost inevitable that they themselves will follow the \n     lead of their role models.\n       These unsportsmanlike ethics that people pick up on lead to \n     an unhealthy imbalance and lack of scruples in non-\n     professional and non-profit-oriented sports today.\n       I feel very strongly that sports for children should not be \n     a main focal point of their lives. Children's sports should \n     focus on team play, listening and respecting an opponent.\n       It is unhealthy for children to be so focused on winning at \n     a young age that it will influence other aspects of their \n     lives. The majority of children do not become overly \n     competitive by themselves, but rather from examination of an \n     outside source. It is this outside source that is the most \n     crucial to any child's path to becoming a good sportsman.\n       Children find role models at a young age; and whether that \n     role model is a professional basketball player or a \n     weatherman, they always end up being influenced by the person \n     that they admire. When these children grow up, they usually \n     carry with them the perception of what was ``said'' to be \n     acceptable and then apply that to other areas of life, not \n     just sports.\n       This is exactly the reason why it is imperative that good \n     sportsmanship be stressed in children's sports as well as \n     higher-level sports. It does no good to a child when good \n     sportsmanship is stressed by one source, yet they look at \n     another source and see exactly the opposite.\n       It is not uncommon in today's sports for the players as \n     well as the fans to become unsportsmanlike. It is OK for \n     people to become competitive as long as they understand the \n     real meaning behind sports and not get too caught up in \n     winning.\n       Unfortunately, many people overlook this issue entirely. \n     Players trash-talk their opponents without remorse, and fans \n     will become overly excited and unruly in the stands. Of \n     course, there are consequences for all of\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\n     their actions, but to the people who only care about winning, \n     consequences are just consequences, and nothing more. They \n     will continue to do whatever they can if they feel it will \n     help them win.\n       Some people are so focused on instant gratification that \n     they don't care what the effects of their actions will be. \n     This is an extremely lethal setback to young onlookers that \n     see this kind of behavior. If their own role models do not \n     believe that they are doing anything wrong, why should they? \n     Every action has a consequence, but not every consequence has \n     the effect it should on the perpetrator.\n       Sports is a huge industry, and there are so many fans, \n     young and old, who hold sports in high regard and are \n     influenced deeply by almost every aspect of the games. Some \n     people become blind to the fact that some of the idealism \n     that they are picking up from sports may not be in their best \n     interest. Winning at all costs is a poor example of how some \n     role models are supposed to behave in front of the people \n     that idolize them. Our children are watching--and they are \n     picking up every thing that comes their way.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Parents Have an Obligation To Be Good Sports, Too\n\n     (By Aroha Fanning, a senior at Jacksonville (Fla.) University)\n\n       Sports are probably one of the most popular pastimes of \n     today's society, whether you are an athlete, a spectator or a \n     sponsor or whether you are pro or amateur, young or old, \n     disabled or physically fit. Athletics caters to everyone.\n       But the people who benefit most from sports today are not \n     the professional basketball players or football players who \n     sign contracts of up to $30 million a year or more. They are \n     the little rugrats you can see running around a soccer field \n     on a Saturday morning, or the 3-foot-nothing munchkins who \n     take to the ice for little league ice hockey each season.\n       Getting children involved in sports not only keeps them \n     active and away from the TV screen or computer monitor, it \n     also teaches them how to be a team player and how to interact \n     socially with other children. But what kind of sportsmanship \n     is being modeled to our children when parents are standing on \n     the sidelines yelling at referees and coaches and getting \n     into fights with parents of the opposing team?\n       Whatever happened to phrases such as ``It's not whether you \n     win or lose, but how you play the game'' and ``Just go out \n     there and do your best?''\n       All over the country, parents are being asked to shape up \n     or ship out of the ballpark, stadium or playing grounds. In \n     Jupiter, Fla., parents are now required to take a good \n     sportsmanship class before their children are allowed to play \n     a sport. Parents in Los Angeles are asked to sign a ``promise \n     of good behavior'' form.\n       Perhaps so many parents push their children into \n     participating in athletics in hope that they will be able to \n     get a scholarship to college and will go on to the major \n     leagues and sign one of those $30 million contracts. Maybe \n     others push their kids into athletics just so they can brag \n     to their friends and family about how little Johnny is the \n     star of his soccer team. Perhaps parental expectations come \n     from unfulfilled childhood dreams of playing college \n     football, baseball, basketball or whatever the sport of \n     choice might have been.\n       However you look at it, or whatever the motive for pushing \n     children into athletics, encouraging them to run onto a field \n     while yelling at them for making a mistake or losing isn't \n     going to make them love the sport. It is not going to get \n     them that college scholarship. It is not going to make them \n     the best on the team. And it is not going to fulfill the lost \n     dream of being a college athlete.\n       The only thing that pushing your child beyond the true \n     purpose of the game--to have fun--accomplishes is to push the \n     child further away from the sport and, eventually, the \n     parent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1313-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO PUBLISHERS SETH AND LUCILLE HEYWOOD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

The Agreement will dramatically \ncut import barriers currently imposed on American products and \nservices. It is enforceable and will lock in and expand access to \nvirtually all sectors of China's economy. The Agreement meets the high \nstandards we set in all areas, from creating export opportunities for \nour businesses, farmers, and working people, to strengthening our \nguarantees of fair trade. It is clearly in our economic interest. China \nis concluding agreements with other countries to accede to the WTO. The \nissue is whether Americans get the full benefit of the strong agreement \nwe negotiated. To do that, we need to enact permanent Normal Trade \nRelations (NTR) for China.\n  We give up nothing with this Agreement. As China enters the WTO, the \nUnited States makes no changes in our current market access policies. \nWe preserve our right to withdraw market access for China in the event \nof a national security emergency. We make no changes in laws \ncontrolling the export of sensitive technology. We amend none of our \ntrade laws. In fact, our protections against unfair trade practices and \npotential import surges are stronger with the Agreement than without \nit.\n  Our choice is clear. We must enact permanent NTR for China or risk \nlosing the full benefits of the Agreement we negotiated, including \nbroad market access, special import protections, and rights to enforce \nChina's commitment through WTO dispute settlement. All WTO members, \nincluding the United States, pledge to grant one another permanent NTR \nto enjoy the full benefits in one another's markets. If the Congress \nwere to fail to pass permanent NTR for China, our Asian, Latin \nAmerican, Canadian, and European competitors would reap these benefits, \nbut American farmers and other workers and our businesses might well be \nleft behind.\n  We are firmly committed to vigorous monitoring and enforcement of \nChina's commitments, and will work closely with the Congress on this. \nWe will maximize use of the WTO's review\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nmechanisms, strengthen U.S. monitoring and enforcement capabilities, \nensure regular reporting to the Congress on China's compliance, and \nenforce the strong China-specific import surge protections we \nnegotiated. I have requested significant new funding for China trade \ncompliance.\n  We must also continue our efforts to make the WTO itself more open, \ntransparent, and participatory, and to elevate consideration of labor \nand the environment in trade. We must recognize the value that the WTO \nserves today in fostering a global, rules-based system of international \ntrade--one that has fostered global growth and prosperity over the past \nhalf century. Bringing China into that rules-based system advances the \nright kind of reform in China.\n  The Agreement is in the fundamental interest of American security and \nreform in China. By integrating China more fully into the Pacific and \nglobal economies, it will strengthen China's stake in peace and \nstability. Within China, it will help to develop the rule of law; \nstrengthen the role of market forces; and increase the contacts China's \ncitizens have with each other and the outside world. While we will \ncontinue to have strong disagreements with China over issues ranging \nfrom human rights to religious tolerance to foreign policy, we believe \nthat bringing China into the WTO pushes China in the right direction in \nall of these areas.\n  I, therefore, with this letter transmit to the Congress legislation \nauthorizing the President to terminate application of Title IV of the \nTrade Act of 1974 to the People's Republic of China and extend \npermanent Normal Trade Relations treatment to products from China. The \nlegislation specifies that the President's determination becomes \neffective only when China becomes a member of the WTO, and only after a \ncertification that the terms and conditions of China's accession to the \nWTO are at least equivalent to those agreed to between the United \nStates and China in our November 15, 1999, Agreement. I urge that the \nCongress consider this legislation as soon as possible.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, let me advise you, yesterday at the \nclose of business, the posted price of oil was $34.13 a barrel. The Dow \nwas down 374 points. The share price of one company, Procter & Gamble, \nplunged 30 percent as a consequence of their third quarter profits \nfalling off because of the high cost of oil.\n  We have a crisis in this country. Today, I rise to introduce \nlegislation on behalf of myself and 33 other Members that I believe, \nand they believe with me, offers the United States its best chance to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil; that is, by producing more oil \ndomestically.\n  We have seen the oil price rise in the last year from roughly $10 to \nover $30 a barrel. That is a pretty dramatic increase. There is an \ninflation factor associated with this. While we have not really \naddressed it, it is fair to say that for every $10 increase in the \nprice of a barrel of oil, there is an inflation factor of about a half \nof 1 percent. Alan Greenspan has been quoted as saying, ``I have never \nseen a price spike on oil that I have ever ignored.''\n  So we are now in a situation where we have seen heating oil prices in \nthe Northeast reach historic highs this winter, nearly $2 a gallon. We \nare seeing a surcharge on our airline tickets of $20. You do not see it \nat the counter where you buy your ticket; of course not. You do not \nknow what the price of a ticket generally is because they have so many \nprices between point A and point B. But it is there. It is $20. The \nAmerican public ought to be questioning that. They at least ought to be \naware of it, if they do not question it.\n  Regarding diesel prices, we saw the truckers come to Washington, DC. \nDiesel prices are the highest since the Department of Energy began \ntracking.\n  We are in a crisis. We have to do something about it. There are many \nfactors that contribute to the price structure of each particular fuel, \nbut underlying all of these, without a doubt, is our reliance on \nimported crude oil. We are 56-percent dependent on foreign crude oil. \nThe current reserves indicate we are consuming twice as much crude in \nthe U.S., as we are able to produce domestically.\n  I had the professional staff of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee trying to do a forecast, with the Department of Energy--we \nhave a net decline because we are using more crude reserves than we are \nbringing in--about what time the bear goes through the buckwheat; that \nis, when perhaps we are looking at $2 a gallon, $2.50 a gallon for \ngasoline. Relief is not in sight as yet.\n  The worst part of it is this did not come without some warning. Those \nof us from oil-producing States, my State of Alaska, the overthrust \nbelt--Louisiana Senators, Texas, Mississippi, other areas, Colorado, \nOklahoma, Utah, Wyoming--have been predicting the dangers of increased \ndependence on imported oil. The administration, Department of Energy, \nhas forecast by the years 2015 to 2020 we will be approaching 65-\npercent dependence on imported oil. The problem with that is it looks \nnow as if that is a goal rather than a forecast. They are not taking \nany steps to relieve us of that dependency.\n  The facts, I think, are staggering. If you look at what is happening \nin this country, domestic production has decreased 17 percent since \n1990. That is a fact. Consumption, however, has increased 14 percent. I \nhave a chart to show this. It shows, I think very clearly, what is \nhappening in this country.\n  We are seeing the demand, and that is the black line here, going, in \n1990, from 16 million to 19 million barrels per day. So what is \nhappening is we see a constant demand going up. Then what happens on \nthe offset? Where is the crude production? The crude production is \ndeclining, from 7.4 to a domestic production of 5.9.\n  This reflects the reality of what has been happening. This should not \ncome as a great surprise to the Department of Energy, the Clinton \nadministration, or the Congress of the United States. This has been \ncoming for some time.\n\n  In one year, total petroleum net imports rose 7.6 percent. So, as we \nlook for relief, we look towards imports. Now we are 56-percent \ndependent. What does it mean? It means we do not learn from history. We \ndo not learn much. In 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo--some \npeople remember the gasoline lines around the block--at that time, we \nwere 37-percent dependent on imported oil. We said it would never \nhappen again. We said we would create a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nensure we were not held hostage.\n  What did other countries do? Different things. The French, for \nexample, said they would never be held hostage by the Mideast again, \nand they departed on a nuclear program so that today the French are \nover 90-percent dependent on nuclear energy. We do not have that \nsituation in the United States. I simply point that out to direct \nattention to what some countries have done with their energy policy \nvis-a-vis others. What we have done is very little.\n  We fought a war over in the Mideast, didn't we? We fought that war, \nDesert Storm, to keep Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait and taking \nover those oil fields. During Desert Storm, we were 46-percent \ndependent. Today we are held hostage to aggressive OPEC pricing \npolicies. What has our response been?\n  Secretary of Energy Richardson went to the Mideast. Some suggest it \nwas the greatest hostage recovery effort since the Carter \nadministration sent the military to Tehran. He went there and said: We \nhave an emergency in the United States. We have a crisis. We need you \nto produce more oil.\n  Do you know what they told him? They looked him in the eye and they \nsaid: We are going to have a meeting March 27 and we will address our \npolicies then.\n  That is hardly responding to an emergency, particularly at a time \nwhen he reminded them of how quickly\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\nwe responded to the emergency when Saddam Hussein was about to invade \nKuwait. Nevertheless, that is reality, that is business, that is the \nattitude of OPEC. This time the hostage is our country, our energy \nsecurity--and the rescue mission is flawed.\n  We can look to the non-OPEC countries for relief. We can look to \nVenezuela. We can look to Mexico.\n  I happened to have a little feedback from Mexico. We went down to \nMexico. The Secretary met with them and said we need you to produce \nmore oil. There was a message, and that message that came back from \nMexico is: Where was the United States when the Mexican economy was in \nthe tank? When oil was selling at $11 a barrel, were you, the United \nStates, doing anything to help out Mexico and its economy? Clearly, we \nwere not. We were very happy to get $11, $12 oil.\n  So somebody said: If the shoe fits, wear it.\n  We have been stiffed. We have been poked in the eye because OPEC is \nsaying: Ho, ho, the United States--do you know what the United States \ncould do, if they wanted to do a favor for the consumer? They can waive \nall their taxes, waive all the highway taxes, waive all the State \ntaxes. That will bring the price down.\n  It is an interesting suggestion. Obviously, it is unacceptable to us \nand an indignity, but I think it is sobering to recognize that is their \nproposed answer.\n  The irony that Iraq has emerged as the fastest growing source of U.S. \noil imports is something beyond comprehension. We need to question \nwhere we are placing the Nation's energy security. Are we placing it \nwith Saddam Hussein? That is where our imported oil is coming.\n  Our own Government agencies question this policy. Isn't that \ninteresting? They question the policy they make.\n  Here is the statement on a chart. This is at a time when the \nadministration is suppressing domestic production. This is from the \nMinerals Management Service:\n\n       Much of the imported oil that the United States depends on \n     comes from areas of the world that may be hostile to the \n     interest of the United States and where political instability \n     is a concern.\n\n  That speaks for itself. The Mideast is unstable. We see our friends \nin Libya, Iran, Iraq, and now the relationship between Iran and Iraq \nseems to be closer than it ever was. We are caught in the middle.\n  In the meantime, What has happened to our domestic industry? It is \ninteresting. We have seen in the oil industry a 28-percent decline in \njobs, a 77-percent decline in oil rigs that are used in exploration, \nand we have seen a 7-percent decline in reserves. That is the largest \ndecline in 53 years.\n  This is what we are doing, particularly under this administration, \nrelative to encouraging domestic exploration and drilling: Rigs \ndrilling for oil are down from 657 in 1990 to roughly 153 in 2000.\n  What has our energy policy been under the Clinton-Gore \nadministration? Coal: Highly dependent on coal. But EPA filed a lawsuit \nagainst eight electric utilities with coal-fired powerplants. The \nlawsuit says these plants have been allowed to extend beyond their \nlifespan, and the management says they are trying to maintain these \nplants according to the permitting process and not necessarily \nextending their life.\n  One gets a different point of view, but clearly there is going to be \nemployment for a lot of attorneys.\n  Hydro: Secretary Babbitt wants to be the first Secretary to tear down \ndams. It is estimated by my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest that \nif the dams go down, we are going to see roughly 2,000 trucks per day \non the highways to replace the barge service, particularly in Oregon, \nand the environmental air quality and congestion issues will be \nsignificant.\n  Nuclear power: The administration opposes this. They do not want to \naddress what they are going to do with nuclear waste on their watch.\n  Natural gas: It is the fuel of the future, but they have closed so \nmuch of the public lands; 60 percent of the overthrust belt is off \nlimits in the Rocky Mountain area, which is Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, \nUtah, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota. They estimate there \nis 137 trillion cubic feet of gas out there. And as a consequence, but \nthey have put 60 percent of the area off limits.\n  Let's look at one more thing. If we look at our reliance on natural \ngas and oil, we recognize that we are not going to change over the next \n20 or 25 years, as much as we would like to have greater dependence on \nalternative energy sources. The realization is the technology is not \nthere. We have to continue to encourage them. The real answer is long-\nterm and short-term relief. There is some short-term potential relief \nin repealing the Clinton-Gore gas tax hike. With prices at the pump \nsteadily rising, one thing we can do is suspend the 4.3 cent-per-gallon \nClinton-Gore gas tax. That came in 1993. The Democratic Congress, \nwithout a single Republican vote, adopted the Clinton-Gore gas tax as \npart of one of the largest tax increases in history.\n\n  That tax has cost the American motorist $43 billion over the last 6 \nyears. We can suspend this tax until the end of the year when prices \nmay be stabilized, and we can make sure the highway trust fund is \nreimbursed for any lost revenue so we can ensure all highway \nconstruction authorized will be constructed.\n  It is interesting to note that when Clinton-Gore passed this tax, it \nwas not used for highway construction; it was used for Government \nspending, until Republicans took over Congress and authorized the tax \nto be restored for highway construction.\n  Long-term fixes: We need to stimulate the domestic oil and gas \nindustry. We need to get in the overthrust belt. We need the Department \nof Interior to open up these areas, and we need a long-term fix. It \ninvolves legislation that I am introducing to authorize the opening of \nthe Coastal Plain.\n  I will show my colleagues what I am talking about. This is an area \nthat lies in the northeast corner of Alaska, north of the Arctic \nCircle, 1,300 miles south of the North Pole. The pipeline of Prudhoe \nBay over the last 30 years has produced 25 percent of the total crude \noil produced in this country.\n  I will show another chart because we have to put this area in \nperspective, otherwise you lose it.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge consists of 19 million acres in \nits entirety. We have set aside in wilderness permanently 8 million \nacres. We set another 9.5 million acres in refuge, permanently--no \ndrilling, nothing in those two areas. But Congress set aside what they \ncall the 1002 area, the Coastal Plain, for a determination of whether \nor not to open it for competitive oil and gas bids. The Eskimo people \nof Kaktovik, a little village there, support exploration in this area. \nThe geologists say it is the most likely area for a significant find.\n  We propose a competitive lease sale. We propose only exploration in \nthe wintertime, that way we will make no footprint on the ground. There \nis roughly 1.5 million acres on the Coastal Plain. The industry says if \nthey are allowed to develop it with the technology they have, they will \nuse less than 2,000 acres in the entirety of the 1.5 million acres. \nThat is the kind of footprint the technology gives us.\n  As we look at national energy security, we have to look at some long-\nterm solutions because Prudhoe Bay, as can be seen on this chart, shows \na good degree of compatibility with abundant wildlife. This shows \nPrudhoe Bay field and the caribou wandering around. This is the \npipeline that goes 800 miles to Valdez. If the oil is where we think it \nis, we simply extend the pipeline over to Prudhoe Bay and produce it.\n  This chart shows what frequently happens on the pipeline. Here are \nsome bears going for a little walk on the pipeline enjoying the \nafternoon. They get away from bugs and flies, and it is easier walking \non the pipeline than it is in the heavy snow. They know what they are \ndoing.\n  I conclude by recognizing in October our Vice President made a \nstatement that he is going to do everything in his power to make sure \nthere is no new drilling off our coastal areas relative to OCS lease \nsales. I think that statement is going to come back and haunt the \nadministration and certainly haunt the Vice President because if we do \nnot go for OCS activities, we are not going to go anywhere.\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Sierra Club soliciting \nvisitations to Washington to lobby Members of Congress be printed in \nthe Record.

A bill to clarify the treatment of nonprofit entities as \nnoncommercial educational or public broadcast stations under the \nCommunications Act of 1934; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           noncommercial broadcasting eligibility act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in late-December 1999, the Federal \nCommunications Commission took the unusual and aggressive step to \nrestrict the programming of noncommercial television stations by not \nallowing certain types of religious programming.\n  Within the context of a license transfer involving a noncommercial \ntelevision station in Pittsburgh, PA, the FCC attempted to establish \nguidelines for what they felt were ``acceptable'' educational religious \nprogramming.\n  The commission states in the Additional Guidance section of their \ndecision document that, ``. . . programming primarily devoted to \nreligious exhortation, proselytizing, or statements of personally-held \nreligious views or beliefs generally would not qualify as `general \neducational' programming.''\n  As a former religious broadcaster, this type of misguided agenda \ncoming from a nonelected agency of the federal government is very \ndisturbing. My office was flooded with letters and phone calls from \nArkansans who were worried that the Federal Government had finally made \nan overt attempt to restrict what religious programming we watch on \ntelevision or listen to on the radio.\n  Surprisingly, the national media remained strangely quiet despite the \nserious free speech implications and first amendment violation by the \ncommission's ruling.\n  Soon after the FCC's controversial decision, I sent a letter to \nChairman Kennard, along with Senators Nickles, Helms, Enzi, and Inhofe, \ncriticizing the commission's actions. Congressman Oxley introduced \nlegislation in the House to address this issue.\n  Although I am a cosponsor of Senator Brownback's companion bill to \nCongressman Oxley's bill, I do not believe this legislation to prevent \nfuture attempts by the FCC to restrict religious programming goes far \nenough.\n  That is why I am introducing S. 2215, the ``Noncommercial \nBroadcasting Eligibility Act of 2000.''\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\n  Simply put, my bill would effectively deny the FCC the ability to \ncreate new rules defining what is appropriate and eligible programming \nfor noncommercial television and radio stations, while creating a \n``clear and simple test'' and guidance as to what programming \nnoncommercial television and radio broadcasters may broadcast.\n  This ``clear and simple test'' is based on the well-established \nguidelines from section 501(c)(3) and 513 (a) and (c) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986.\n  By requiring the FCC to look to the well-established guidance used by \nthe Internal Revenue Service and the courts in defining what is \n``substantially related'' programming, my legislation gives \nnoncommercial broadcasters the ability to broadcast programming that is \n``substantially related'' to their tax-exempt purpose, whether it be \neducational, religious, or charitable.\n  It is clear that the FCC intended to restrict religious programming \nand may be inclined to do so in the future. The commission should not \nbe allowed to circumvent the United States Constitution and pursue its \nown political agenda.\n  Again, the Noncommercial Broadcasting Eligibility Act of 2000 will \nhelp prevent future misguided attempts by the FCC to limit our rights \nwhich are protected by the first amendment to the United States \nConstitution.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me by cosponsoring this bill and making \nit clear that the Senate will not stand idly by as the FCC attempts to \nunilaterally decide what religious programming is in the public's best \ninterest.\n  I think it is outrageous for a nonelected agency to decide that a \nchurch service is not educational or that certain choral presentations \ndo not fit their accepted definition of religious education. It is time \nthat we draw the line. This legislation will do that. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2216. A bill to direct the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to require, as a condition of any financial \nassistance provided by the Agency on a nonemergency basis for a \nconstruction project, that products used in the project be produced in \nthe United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  the federal emergency management agency buy american compliance act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency Buy American Compliance Act, legislation \nwhich would apply the requirements of the Buy American Act to non-\nemergency Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance \npayments.\n  The Buy American Act was designed to provide a preference to American \nbusinesses in the federal procurement process. Currently, when FEMA \nawards grants for non-emergency projects, the agency itself adheres to \nthe requirements of the Buy American Act. However, when FEMA awards \ntaxpayer money to state or local entities in the form grants, those \nentities are not similarly required to comply with the Buy American \nAct's standards. This disparity needs to be changed.\n\n  Mr. President, the Buy American Act's requirements should be applied \nto all FEMA non-emergency grants. It should not make a difference \nwhether FEMA is directly spending federal tax dollars or passing those \nsame federal tax dollars on to states or local governments for them to \nspend. The Buy American Act's standards should apply to all federal \ndollars distributed by FEMA for non-emergency situations, no matter who \nis spending it. It is only right that we ensure that the American \npeople's federal tax dollars are spent according to the Buy American \nAct.\n  The Buy American Act is necessary to protect American firms from \nunfair competition from foreign corporations. Many of the nations we \ntrade with have significantly lower labor costs than the United States. \nWithout the safeguard provided by the Buy American Act foreign \ncompanies are able to underbid American companies on U.S. government \ncontracts.\n  It is important to understand the Buy American Act's criteria for \ndetermining whether a product is foreign or domestic. The nation where \nthe corporation is headquartered is irrelevant--the Buy American Act is \nfocused upon the origin of the materials used in the construction \nproject. In order to be considered an American product, the product in \nquestion has to fulfill the following two criteria; first; the product \nmust be manufactured in the United States, and second; the cost of the \ncomponents manufactured in the United States must constitute over 50 \npercent of the cost of all the components used in the item.\n  My proposed legislation would stipulate that federal funds \ndistributed by FEMA as financial assistance could only be used for \nprojects in which the manufactured products are American made, \naccording to the criteria established by the Buy American Act. The \nHouse version of this legislation has been recently introduced by \nCongressman Michael Collins of Georgia.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense that the American people's hard \nearned tax dollars should be allowed to slip through a loophole that \nmakes it possible for some entities to avoid the Buy American Act. The \nBuy American Act should apply to all who spend FEMA non-emergency \nfunds. When these federal funds are passed down from FEMA to another \ngovernment agency, those other government agencies should also be \nrequired to abide by the Buy America Act.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this legislation in order to ensure there \nis consistency in the law, with regard to FEMA and the provisions of \nthe Buy American Act. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \npassage of this pro-American measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill I am introducing today be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846, \n     with funds bequeathed to the United States by James Smithson \n     for the ``increase and diffusion of knowledge'';/\n       (2) once established, the Smithsonian Institution became an \n     important part of the process of developing the United \n     States' national identity, an ongoing role which continues \n     today;\n       (3) the Smithsonian Institution, which is now the world's \n     largest museum complex, including 16 museums, 4 research \n     centers, and the National Zoo, is visited by millions of \n     Americans and people from all over the world each year;\n       (4) the National Museum of the American Indian of the \n     Smithsonian Institution (referred to in this section as the \n     ``NMAI'') was established by an Act of Congress in 1989, in \n     Public Law 101-185;\n       (5) the purpose of the NMAI, as established by Congress, is \n     to--\n       (A) advance the study of Native Americans, including the \n     study of language, literature, history, art, anthropology, \n     and life;\n       (B) collect, preserve, and exhibit Native American objects \n     of artistic, historical, literary, anthropological, and \n     scientific interest; and\n       (C) provide for Native American research and study \n     programs;\n       (6) the NMAI works in cooperation with Native Americans and \n     oversees a collection that spans more than 10,000 years of \n     American history;\n       (7) it is fitting that the NMAI will be located in a place \n     of honor near the United States Capitol, and on the National \n     Mall;\n       (8) thousands of Americans, including many American \n     Indians, came from all over the Nation to witness the \n     groundbreaking ceremony for the NMAI on September 28, 1999;\n       (9) the NMAI is scheduled to open in the summer of 2002;\n       (10) the original 5-cent buffalo nickel, as designed by \n     James Earle Fraser and minted from 1913 through 1938, which \n     portrays a profile representation of a Native American on the \n     obverse side and a representation of an American buffalo on \n     the reverse side, is a distinctive and appropriate model for \n     a coin to commemorate the NMAI; and\n       (11) the surcharge proceeds from the sale of a \n     commemorative coin, which would have no net cost to the \n     taxpayers, would raise valuable funding for the opening of \n     the NMAI and help to supplement the endowment and educational \n     outreach funds of the NMAI.\n\n     SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n       (a) $1 Silver Coins.--In commemoration of the opening of \n     the Museum of the American Indian of the Smithsonian \n     Institution, the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this \n     Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue \n     not more than 500,000 $1 coins, each of which shall--\n       (1) weigh 26.73 grams;\n       (2) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and\n       (3) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.\n       (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be \n     legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United \n     States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of a program under which long-term care insurance is \nmade available to Federal employees and annuitants and members of the \nuniformed services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\nFEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND UNIFORMED SERVICES GROUP LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE \n                              ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I am very \npleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Barbara \nMikulski and Charles Grassley, to introduce our proposal for the \nlargest employer-based long-term care insurance program in American \nhistory. Today, we are introducing the Federal Employees and Uniformed \nServices Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 2000.\n  At age 25, I returned from Vietnam facing the potential need for \nlong-term care. I did not have the opportunity to plan for those needs \nand I was fortunate to avoid that outcome through the support of my \nfamily and the wonderful military health care system and VA system I \nencountered. Our legislation will provide federal employees, members of \nthe Uniformed Services, including Reservists and the National Guard, \nretirees, spouses, parents and parents-in-law with the opportunity to \nplan for assistive care needs that become a necessity for all of us at \nsome time in our lives.\n  Currently there are several measures pending in the Senate which \noffer different approaches to providing long-term care insurance to \nfederal and military employees and their families. Our bill represents \na carefully considered compromise between these competing approaches.\n  The Cleland-Mikulski-Grassley bill combines the features of our \noriginal proposals, S. 894, S. 57 and S. 36, as well as additional \nprovisions to produce the most comprehensive proposal for an employer-\nbased long-term care insurance program. Our legislation will:\n  One, allow federal employees, members of the Uniformed Services and \nForeign Service, Reservists and retirees, spouses, parents, and parent-\nin-laws to purchase long-term care insurance at group rates.\n  Second, have premiums based on age (premiums are expected to be 10%-\n20% less than on the open market).\n  Third, provide individuals with options, including cash \nreimbursements for family caregivers, tax exemptions under the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and portability \nof benefits.\n  The current forecast for the cost of meeting long-term care needs of \nour aging population is staggering in terms of personal and national \nresources. Average nursing home costs are projected to increase from \n$40,000 per person per year today to $97,000 by 2030. Medicare and \nregular health insurance programs do not cover most long-term care \nneeds. Medicaid can offer some long-term care support, but generally \nrequires ``spend-down'' of income and assets to qualify. Additionally, \nvery few employers offer a long-term care insurance benefit to their \nemployees. We hope that our legislation will be a model that other \nemployers will use in providing long-term care insurance for their \nemployees and will lessen the financial burden on the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs.\n  Working families are too often being forced to choose between sending \na child to college and paying for a nursing home for a parent. Families \ndesperately need the tools to help themselves and to meet their family \nresponsibilities.\n  Consider these astounding statistics:\n  Almost 6 million Americans aged 65 or older currently need long-term \ncare.\n  As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-term care \nneed either for themselves or a family member.\n  41% of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or take family \nmedical leave to care for a frail older parent or parent-in-law.\n  80% of all long-term care services are provided by family and \nfriends.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. By working together in a \nbipartisan cooperative spirit my fellow sponsors and I have bridged \nsome significant differences in approach to craft a proposal which \nshould have widespread support in the Senate. I hope and expect that we \nwill take up and pass this bill this year. Those who have served, and \nare now serving, our nation deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Section-by-Section Analysis of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFederal Employees and Uniformed Services Group Long-Term Care Insurance \n                    Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n(To amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for the establishment \nof a program under which long-term care insurance is made available to \nFederal employees and annuitants and members of the uniformed services, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       Section 1 of the bill titles the bill as the ``Federal \n     Employees and Uniformed Services Group Long-Term Care \n     Insurance Act of 2000.''\n       Section 2 of the bill amends title 5, United States Code, \n     to provide for the establishment and operation of the Program \n     by adding a new chapter 90.\n       New section 9001 provides the definitions used in the \n     administration of the Program. Included are the following:\n       ``Activities of daily living'' includes eating, toileting, \n     transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence.\n       ``Annuitant'' has the meaning such term would have under \n     section 8901(3), if for purposes of such paragraph, the term \n     ``employee'' were considered to have the meaning of \n     ``employee'' in (5) of this section.\n       ``Appropriate Secretary'' means, except as otherwise \n     provided, the Secretary of Defense; with respect to the \n     United States Coast Guard when it is not operating as a \n     service of the Navy, the Secretary of Transportation; with \n     respect to the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, the Secretary of Commerce; and \n     with respect to the commissioned corps of the Public Health \n     Service, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       ``Eligible individual'' means (A) an annuitant, employee, \n     member of the uniformed services, or retired member of the \n     uniformed services, or (B) a qualified relative of an \n     individual described in (A).\n       ``Employee'' means an employee as defined under section \n     8901(1)(A) through (D) and (F) through (I), but does not \n     include an employee excluded by regulation of the Office \n     under section 9010, and an individual described under section \n     2105(e).\n       ``Member of the uniformed services'' means a person who (A) \n     is a member of the uniformed services on active duty for a \n     period of more than 30 days; or is a member of the Selected \n     Reserve as defined under section 10143 of title 10, including \n     members on (1) full-time National Guard duty as defined under \n     section 101(d)(5) of title 10; or (2) active Guard and \n     Reserve duty as defined under section 101(d)(6) of title 10; \n     and (B) satisfies such eligibility requirements as the Office \n     prescribes under section 9010.\n       ``Office'' means the Office of Personnel Management.\n       ``Qualified carrier'' means a company or consortium \n     licensed and approved to issue group long-term care insurance \n     in all States and to do business in each of the States.\n       ``Qualified relative'' as used with respect to an eligible \n     individual in this section means the spouse of such \n     individual; a parent or parent-in-law of such individual; and \n     any other person bearing a relationship to such individual \n     specified by the Office in regulations.\n       ``Retired member of the uniformed services'' means a member \n     of the uniformed services entitled to retired or retainer pay \n     (other than chapter 1223 of title 10) who satisfies such \n     eligibility requirements as the Office prescribes under \n     section 9010.\n       ``State'' means a State of the United States, and includes \n     the District of Columbia.\n       New section 9002 provides that any eligible individual may \n     obtain coverage under this chapter; that a qualified relative \n     must provide documentation to demonstrate the relationship as \n     prescribed by the Office, and; an individual is not eligible \n     for coverage if the individual would be immediately eligible \n     to receive benefits upon obtaining coverage.\n       New section 9003 provides the contracting authority for the \n     Office to use in establishing and operating the Program.\n       Paragraph 1 of subsection (a) of this section provides that \n     the Office is authorized to contract with carriers for a \n     policy or policies of group long-term care insurance for \n     benefits specified in this chapter, without regard to section \n     3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) or any other \n     statute requiring competitive bidding.\n       Paragraph (2) of this subsection states that the Office \n     shall contract with a primary carrier for the assumption of \n     risk; no less than 2 qualified carriers to act as reinsurers; \n     and; as many qualified carriers as necessary to administer \n     this chapter, which shall also act as reinsurers. The Office \n     will ensure that each contract is awarded on the basis of \n     contractor qualifications, price, and reasonable competition \n     to the extent practicable. This\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\n     provision ensures that at least 3 companies or consortia will \n     participate in the Program.\n       Subsection (b) gives the Office the authority to design a \n     benefits package or packages and negotiate final offerings \n     with qualified carriers.\n       Subsection (c) provides that each contract shall contain a \n     detailed statement of the benefits offered, including any \n     limitations or exclusions, the rates charged, and other terms \n     and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Office and the \n     carrier involved can be consistent with the provisions of \n     this chapter.\n       Subsection (d) provides that premium rates shall reasonably \n     reflect the cost of the benefits provided under a contract, \n     as determined by the Office.\n       Subsection (e) provides that the coverage and benefits \n     under this section shall be guaranteed renewable and may not \n     be canceled except for nonpayment of premium.\n       Subsection (f) gives the Office the authority to withdraw \n     an offering based on open season participation rates, the \n     composition of the risk pool, or both.\n       Subsection (g) requires each contract to provide insurance, \n     payment, or benefits to an  individual if the Office, or a \n     designated party, determines the individual is entitled to \n     such under the contract. The subsection also requires \n     reinsurers under (a)(2)(A)(ii) to participate in \n     administrative procedures to effect an expeditious \n     resolution of disputes arising under such contract, and \n     where appropriate, one or more means of dispute \n     resolution.\n       Subsection (h) provides in paragraph (1) that each contract \n     shall be for a term of five years, unless terminated earlier \n     by the Office. The rights and responsibilities of the \n     enrolled individual, the insurer, and the Office (or a duly \n     designated third party) under any contract shall continue \n     until the termination of coverage of the individual.\n       Paragraph (2) of subsection (h) specifies that the \n     termination of coverage shall occur upon the occurrence of \n     death, the exhaustion of benefits, or nonpayment of premium \n     as specified in subsection (e).\n       Paragraph (3) of subsection (h) provides that each contract \n     under this section shall be consistent with regulations of \n     the Office under section 9010 to (1) preserve all parties' \n     rights and responsibilities under such contracts, \n     notwithstanding the termination of such contract and (2) \n     ensure that once an individual is enrolled, the coverage will \n     not terminate due to any change in status, such as separation \n     from Government service or the uniformed services, or ceasing \n     to be a qualified relative.\n       Subsection (i) specifies that nothing in this chapter shall \n     be construed to grant authority to the Office or a third \n     party to change the rules under which the contract operates \n     for disputed claims purposes.\n       New Section 9004 specifies the long-term care benefits to \n     be provided under this chapter.\n       Subsection (a) states that benefits under this chapter will \n     be long-term care insurance under qualified long-term care \n     insurance contracts within the meaning of section 7702B of \n     the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, as determined \n     appropriate by the Office, the benefits under such contracts \n     will be consistent with the more stringent of the most recent \n     standards of the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners or such standards as recommended in 1993.\n       Subsection (b) of this requires each contract under this \n     chapter to provide for: (1) adequate consumer protections; \n     (2) adequate protections in the event of carrier bankruptcy; \n     (3) the availability of benefits upon certification as to the \n     individual's inability to perform at least 2 activities of \n     daily living for a period of at least 90 days or substantial \n     supervision of the individual to protect such individual from \n     threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive \n     impairment; (4) choice of service benefits; (5) availability \n     of inflation protection; (6) portability of benefits; (7) \n     length-of-benefit options; (8) options relating to flexible \n     long-term care benefit options regarding care modalities, \n     such as nursing home care, assisted living care, home care, \n     and care by family members; (9) options relating to \n     elimination periods; and (10) options relating \n     to nonforfeiture benefits.\n       New section 9005 addresses the financing of the Program and \n     makes clear that each individual enrolled for coverage must \n     pay 100 percent of the charges for such coverage. Subsections \n     (b) through (d) of this section provide for the withholding \n     of premium from the pay of an employee or member of the \n     uniformed services or the annuity of an annuitant or retired \n     member of the uniformed services. Withholdings for a \n     qualified relative, may at the discretion of the individual \n     related to the relative, be withheld from pay as if the \n     enrollment were for the qualified relative. An enrollee whose \n     pay, annuity, or retired or retainer pay is insufficient to \n     cover the withholding is required to remit the full amount of \n     premiums directly to the carrier.\n       Subsection (e) of this section requires each carrier to \n     account for all funds under this chapter separate and apart \n     from funds unrelated to this chapter.\n       Subsection (f) of this section specifies that a contract \n     under this chapter must include provisions under which the \n     carrier must reimburse the Office or other administering \n     agency for administrative costs incurred by the Office or \n     other agency, including implementation costs. These costs are \n     considered allocable to the carrier. Reimbursements under \n     this section, except for the initial costs of implementation, \n     must be deposited in the Employees Health Benefits Fund and \n     held in a separate Long-Term Care Insurance Account. This \n     account is available without limitation to the Office for \n     purposes of this chapter.\n       New section 9006 provides that this chapter shall supersede \n     and preempt any State or local law, or law of a territory or \n     possession, which is inconsistent with the provisions of this \n     chapter or, after consultation with the National Association \n     of Insurance Commissioners, the efficient provision of a \n     nationwide long-term care insurance Program for Federal \n     employees. An exception applies to any financial requirement \n     by a State or District of Columbia that is more stringent \n     than the requirements of 9004(b)(1).\n       New section 9007 provides that each qualified carrier \n     entering into a contract with this Office shall provide such \n     reasonable reports as the Office determines necessary to \n     carry out its functions and permit the Office and the General \n     Accounting Office to examine the records of the carrier. It \n     also requires Federal agencies to keep records and \n     certifications, and furnish the Office, the carrier, or both \n     with information the Office may require.\n       New section 9008 addresses claims for benefits under this \n     chapter.\n       Subsection (a) of this section requires that claims be \n     filed within 4 years after the date on which the reimbursable \n     cost was incurred or the service was provided.\n       Subsection (b)(1) provides that benefits payable under this \n     chapter are secondary to any other benefit payable for such \n     cost or service, e.g., workers' compensation, no-fault \n     insurance. It also provides that no benefit is payable where \n     no legal obligation exists to pay.\n       Paragraph (2) of subsection (b) specifies the exceptions to \n     the policy in paragraph (1) such that benefits payable under \n     the medical assistance program of title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act and any other Federal or State program that the \n     Office may specify in regulations that provide health \n     coverage designated to be secondary to other insurance \n     coverage are secondary to benefits paid under this chapter.\n       New section 9009 specifies that a claimant may file suit \n     against a carrier of the long-term insurance policy covering \n     such claimant in the district courts of the United States, \n     after exhausting all available administrative remedies.\n       New section 9010 requires the Office, in subsection (a), to \n     prescribe regulations to carry out the requirements of this \n     chapter.\n       Subsection (b) of this section that the Office shall \n     prescribe the time at which and manner and conditions under \n     which an individual can obtain or continue long-term care \n     insurance, including the length of time for the first \n     opportunity to enroll, the minimum period of coverage \n     required for portability, and provisions for periodic \n     coordinated enrollment.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Office cannot exclude an \n     employee or group of employees solely on the basis of the \n     hazardous nature of employment or part-time employment.\n       Subsection (d) specifies that any regulations necessary to \n     effect the application and operation of this chapter with \n     respect to an eligible individual or qualified relative shall \n     be prescribed by the Office in consultation with the \n     appropriate Secretary.\n       The Technical and Conforming Amendment amends the table of \n     chapters for part III of title 5, United States Code, by \n     inserting, after the item relating to chapter 89, the new \n     reference to chapter 90, Long-Term Care Insurance.\n       Section 3 of the bill authorizes the appropriations of such \n     sums as may be necessary to pay for costs incurred by the \n     Office in the implementation of chapter 90, title 5, United \n     States Code, from enactment of this Act to the date on which \n     long-term care insurance coverage first becomes effective. \n     Any reimbursements of such costs by carriers under 9005(f) of \n     title 5, United States Code, are to be deposited in the \n     General Fund.\n       Section 4 provides that the amendments made by this Act \n     will be effective on the date of enactment. However, this \n     section also provides that coverage will be effective under \n     this Act not later than the first day of the first fiscal \n     year beginning more than 2 years after the date of enactment. \n     This time frame is necessary to negotiate contracts, \n     preparation of materials, and the large task of educating the \n     millions of potential enrollees about this Program.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor \nof the ``Federal Employees and Uniformed Services Group Long-Term Care \nInsurance Act of 2000.'' This important piece of legislation represents \na carefully considered compromise between several bills currently \npending in the Senate.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cleland and Senator Grassley for all of \ntheir hard work in coming to a consensus on how best to provide federal \nand military employees, retirees, and their families with the \nopportunity to purchase long-term care insurance.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people \nafford the burdens of long-term care. Ten years ago, I introduced \nlegislation to change the cruel rules that forced elderly couples to go \nbankrupt before\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nthey could get any help in paying for nursing home care. Because of my \nlegislation, AARP tells me that we've kept over six hundred thousand \npeople out of poverty and stopped liens on family farms.\n  I also fought for higher quality standards for nursing homes. Through \nthe Older Americans Act, seniors have easier access to information and \nreferrals they need to make good choices about long-term care. I am \nalso working hard to create a National Family Caregivers Program, so \nthat families can access comprehensive information when faced with the \ndizzying array of choices in addressing the long-term care needs of a \nfamily member.\n  These are important steps. But unfortunately, we haven't made much \nprogress in the last few years. We've been stymied by partisan \nbickering, shutdowns, and inaction. The long-term care crisis needs a \nlong-term care solution. I am pleased to say that this new bipartisan \nlegislation puts an important down payment on this solution.\n  Despite past disagreements on approaches to financing long-term care, \neveryone agrees that the crisis is growing. Nursing home costs are \nprojected to increase from $40,000 today to $97,000 by 2030. This will \nonly get worse since the number of senior citizens will double over the \nnext thirty years. Families are being forced to choose between sending \na child to college or paying for a nursing home for a parent, or a \nparent-in-law. I think that is wrong.\n  Consider these sobering statistics:\n\n       At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older currently \n     need long-term care\n       As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-\n     term care need\n       41 percent of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or \n     take family medical leave to care for a frail older parent or \n     parent-in-law\n       80 percent of all long-term care services are provided by \n     family and friends\n\n  Families desperately need the tools to help themselves and meet their \nfamily responsibilities. This bill is the first step in helping all \nAmericans do just that. Let me tell you what our new legislation will \ndo:\n\n       It will enable federal and military workers, retirees and \n     their families to purchase long-term care insurance\n       It will provide help to those who practice self-help by \n     offering employees the option to better prepare for their \n     retirement and the potential need for long-term care\n       It will enable federal employees to buy long-term care \n     insurance at group rates--they are projected to be 10%-20% \n     below open market rates.\n       Participants will pay the entire premium but because of the \n     lower premium this is a good deal for federal workers--and \n     for taxpayers\n\n  I'm starting with federal employees for two reasons. First, as our \nnation's largest employer, the federal government can be a model for \nemployers around the country. By offering long-term care insurance to \nits employees, the federal government can set the example for other \nemployers whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. \nStarting with the nation's largest employer also raises awareness and \neducation about long-term care options.\n  I have a second reason for starting with our federal employees. I am \na strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so many of \nthem live, work, and retire in Maryland. They work hard in the service \nof our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting for \nfair COLAs, lower health care premiums, or to prevent unwise schemes to \nprivatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can \ncount on me.\n  One of my principles is ``promises made should be promises kept.'' \nFederal retirees made a commitment to devote their careers to public \nservice. In return, our government made certain promises to them. One \nimportant promise made was the promise of health insurance. The lack of \nlong-term care for federal workers has been a big gap in this important \npromise to our federal workers. This legislation will close that gap \nand provide our federal workers and retirees with comprehensive health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate my commitment to finding long-term \nsolutions to the long-term care problem. I am proud that this \nbipartisan bill takes an important step forward in helping all \nAmericans to prepare for the challenges facing our aging \npopulation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I cosponsor \nthe Federal Employees and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Group \nInsurance Act of 2000, introduced by the Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nCleland], the ranking minority member of the HELP Aging Subcommittee \n[Ms. Mikulski], and the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging [Mr. \nGrassley]. This bipartisan legislation is testament to what can be \naccomplished when members from both sides of the aisle have a common \ngoal. I salute the months-long effort undertaken by my colleagues and \ntheir staffs to bring this compromise bill to fruition.\n  As the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, with direct jurisdiction \nover this measure, I am mindful that there are several long-term care \nbills pending before the Subcommittee. However, I would like to point \nout that the three pending bills, S. 894, S. 57, and S. 36, are \noriginal proposals introduced by the Senators from Georgia, Maryland, \nand Iowa, who have combined features from each of their bills to craft \na measure that will address the long-term care insurance needs of \nfederal and military personnel and their families.\n  Many Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare and their regular \nhealth insurance programs will pay for long-term care. They do not. \nAlthough Medicaid provides some long-term care support, an individual \ngenerally must ``spend-down,'' his or her income and assets to qualify \nfor coverage.\n  More and more Americans are requiring long-term care. About 5.8 \nmillion Americans aged 65 or older require long-term, care due to \nillness or disability. An approximately equal number of children and \nadults under the age of 65 also require long-term care because of \nhealth conditions from birth or a chronic illness developed later in \nlife.\n  The need for long-term care is great. By the year 2030, the number of \nAmericans age 65 years or older will double, from 34.3 to 69.4 million. \nThe cost of nursing home care now exceeds $40,000 per year in many \nparts of the country, and home care visits for nursing or physical \ntherapy runs about $100 per visit. In 1996, over $107 billion was spent \non nursing homes and home health care. However, this figure does not \ntake into account that fully 80 percent of all long-term care services \nare provided by family and friends.\n  In my own state of Hawaii, 13.2 percent of the population is persons \n65 and older. Although Hawaii enjoys one of the highest life \nexpectancies--79 years, compared to a national average of 75 years--the \nstate's rapidly aging population will greatly impact available \nresources for long-term care, both institutional and from non-\ninstitutional sources. Hawaii's long-term care facilities are operating \nat full capacity. According to the Hawaii State Department of Health, \nthe average occupancy rate peaked at 97.8 percent in 1994. But \noccupancy remains high. By 1997, the average occupancy dropped to 90 \npercent.\n  These statistics point to the overriding need to help American \nfamilies provide dignified and appropriate care to their parents and \nrelatives. We know that the demand for long-term care will increase \nwith each passing year, and that federal, state, and local resources \ncannot cover the expected costs. Nursing home costs are expected to \nreach $97,000 by the year 2030.\n  What Congress can do, however, is make long-term care insurance \navailable to a broad segment of the population and offer a model for \nthe private sector. The bill introduced today will provide quality \ngroup long-term care insurance to the nation's federal employees, \nincluding postal workers, members of the Foreign Service, and Uniformed \nServices. Retirees of these agencies and their spouses, parents, and \nparents-in-law will be eligible to participate, and employees in a \n``deferred annuitant status'' can enroll when retirement benefits are \nactivated. The bill has broad-based support, including endorsement by \nthe National Treasury Employees Union and the National Association of \nRetired Federal Employees, two federal employee unions, as well as the \nMilitary Consortium, an organization of the major military groups.\n  The proposal parallels portions of the President's four-part \ninitiative designed to address long-term health, including having the \nfederal government\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nserve as a model employer by offering quality private long-term care \ninsurance to federal employees. The bill introduced today allows the \nOffice of Personnel Management to use its market leverage to offer \nenrollee-paid quality private long-term care insurance to federal \nemployees, military personnel, retirees, and their families at group \nrates. Participants would pay the full premium, whose costs are \nexpected to be 10-20 percent lower than open market rates. There would \nbe options, including cash reimbursement for family care givers, tax \nexemptions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct (HIPAA), and portability benefits--features that will provide \nenrollees the ability to tailor policies to individual needs.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill, \nwhich will offer federal employees, uniformed service personnel, \nretirees, and their families an opportunity to plan for future long-\nterm care needs in a responsible manner. I foresee this proposal as \nserving as a model for the private sector and state and local \ngovernments, and I again thank my colleagues for their diligence in \ncrafting this compromise measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2220. A bill to protect Social Security and provide for repayment \nof the Federal debt; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, \n1977.\n\n\n     THE AMERICAN SOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTION AND DEBT REPAYMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in this \nimportant discussion about the federal budget, the budget surplus, and \nthe American government's economic future. When I first came to \nCongress in 1992 the discussion was radically different. The concept of \na budget surplus, let alone long term projections for a surplus, was \nforeign. The notion that a national debt measured in trillions could \never be paid off was practically science fiction. While 1992 was only \neight years ago, we stand on the floor of the Senate today a million \nmiles away from the bleak fiscal outlook of those times. But we must be \ncareful. While our present fiscal condition may be rose colored, fiscal \nirresponsibility and a refusal to wisely use the budget surplus can not \nonly lead us back to our deficit spending ways of the past, but it will \nthreaten the fiscal health of our nation for yet another generation of \nAmericans. I am here today to urge my colleagues to address the \nresponsibility that comes with a five-point-seven trillion dollar debt.\n  During the 105th Congress I introduced the American Debt Repayment \nAct. This legislation provided an amortization schedule for the \nrepayment of the national debt. The largest purchase an average \nAmerican family will ever make is the purchase of a home. This \nexpenditure is made possible through the use of a mortgage, a set \nschedule of payment. When I was crafting the American Debt Repayment \nAct I studied this traditional form of payment and applied it to the \nenormous federal debt. Two short years later the outlook has somewhat \nchanged as the federal government has run, and is estimated to continue \nto run, an on-budget surplus. During the previous two budget cycles we \nhave witnessed an eagerness to spend more and more money. On-budget \nsurplus dollars have become lumped in to the appropriations process to \nallow for increased spending. We have seen the results yielded by our \ntime of prosperity as surplus money has been used to raise the \ndiscretionary spending level, allowing Congress to shy away from making \nsome hard choices. The willingness to spend surplus dollars is so \nstrong, in fact, that when Congress adjourned last fall there was no \nreal certainty as to whether we spent all of the on-budget surplus and \nthen dipped into Social Security Trust Fund dollars. This, quite \nsimply, is no way to run any enterprise. Flowing surplus money back \ninto discretionary spending to the extent that Social Security money \nwould be jeopardized is bad policy.\n  Today I rise to offer legislation that offers not only an opportunity \nto control the impulse to spend surplus dollars, but would eliminate \nthe entire three-point-six trillion dollar debt owed to the public, \nsave over three trillion dollars in interest, and protect the Social \nSecurity program from annual discretionary appropriations raids. It is \nsimple legislation in the model of the American Debt Repayment act, \nproviding dedicated debt repayment over a twenty year period.\n  Beginning with the fiscal year 2001 and for every year thereafter my \nlegislation requires that the federal government maintain a balanced \nbudget. As most families and business owners know, you must live within \nyour means. It is fair and equitable that the federal government live \nunder the same parameters. I believe that this is the first and most \nessential step in federal budget accountability and debt repayment.\n  My legislation further provides that Congress must budget for a \nsurplus that will be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held \nportion of the debt. Specifically, in fiscal year 2001 Congress must \nuse fifteen billion dollars of on-budget surplus receipts to pay down \nthe debt. Every succeeding year the amount of debt payment must \nincrease by fifteen billion dollars, so the amount Congress must budget \nfor and pay toward the debt in fiscal year 2002 will be thirty billion \ndollars, forty-five billion in fiscal year 2004, and so on. If Congress \ncan remain within the framework of a spending freeze at fiscal year \n2000 levels the entire amount of annual payment will fit within the \nprojected amount of federal on-budget surplus.\n\n  If this system is adopted, by the year 2021 the entire debt owed to \nthe public will be zero.\n  We must have a plan to repay the debt. When we have a plan and a \nrepayment schedule, just like you have on your home mortgage, we will \nhave the ability to cut taxes. A plan provides certainty and structure. \nI believe that anyone concerned with the national debt or tax cuts will \nunderstand the need for a responsible repayment schedule.\n  In addition to the on-budget surplus payment required by this \nlegislation, I have added language to require that until such time as \nserious Social Security reform is implemented Social Security surplus \ndollars must also be dedicated to the repayment of debt owed to the \npublic. Every Member of this body is aware of the enormous obligation \nthis country has made to present and future Social Security recipients. \nPolicy makers must address the future solvency of Social Security. I am \nnot here today, and my legislation is not drafted, to address this \nvital issue. What my legislation will do, however, is dedicate surplus \nSocial Security dollars to debt repayment until the Congress can \ngenerate an appropriate, long term fix to the obstacles that stand in \nthe way of this program.\n  In recent weeks the distinguished Speaker of the House and the \nPresident have talked a great deal publicly about seizing the \nunprecedented opportunity that lies before us--to pay down this \nnation's debt. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in \nJanuary, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly urged \nCongress to use surplus dollars to pay down the debt. Chairman \nGreenspan stated that his, quote, first priority would be to allow as \nmuch of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the \npublic, unquote. This dialogue has been tremendously helpful in further \ndrawing the attention of the public and elected officials to the \nimportance of debt repayment. As many of my colleagues can attest, and \nas I have experienced in my numerous town meetings around my home state \nof Colorado, this is an issue the public understands. It is an issue \nbasis common sense, equity and responsibility.\n  This legislation is a call to action and accountability. It demands \nthat this country and this Congress recognize the debt it has created. \nIt structures a disciplined, fiscally responsible schedule for the \nrepayment of our debt. In the process it is my hope that this \nlegislation will serve to generate greater fiscal responsibility with \nevery appropriations cycle, prevent future deficit spending, and save \nthe taxpayer more than three trillion dollars in interest payments. \nThat is three trillion dollars that would be far better spent on \nnecessary expenditures, the strengthening of Social Security, and tax \ncuts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the \nAmerican Social Security Protection and\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\nDebt Repayment Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to continue for 2000 the Department of Agriculture \nprogram to provide emergency assistance to dairy producers; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   Financial Relief for Dairy Farmers\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to help \nrelieve the financial crisis in the dairy industry.\n  Last fall, milk prices took their steepest dive in history and fell \nto their lowest level in more than two decades.\n  This is particularly devastating for farmers in Wisconsin who milk on \naverage only about 55 cows. These farmers have particularly tight \nmargins and are less able to withstand low milk prices that USDA \nforecasts will continue through the year.\n  Dairy farmers continue to call my office in despair. Some farmers \ncan't meet their feed bills, even though feed prices remain relatively \nlow. Meanwhile, other input costs, like fuel and interest rates, are \nrising. Auctions in the countryside return little to farmers who have \nmade the difficult decision to quit dairying; their neighbors can't \nafford even the insanely discounted prices for equipment.\n  Are the trials facing farmers markedly different than the difficult \nconditions that other producers have faced over the last several years? \nNo. But what is different is the level of assistance that dairy farmers \nhave received from the federal government relative to other \ncommodities.\n  The dairy price support program costs only about $150 million per \nyear. That stands in contrast to the more than $14 billion spent in \nAMTA payments and Loan Deficiency Payments provided to other producers \nlast year.\n  Anticipating a price decline in dairy, Congress provided $325 million \nfor dairy market loss payments. Compare that to the $15 billion \nprovided to crop producers over the last two years. While milk \nproducers are happy for the extra help, most have told me that it \nsimply is not enough given. Milk prices fell far lower than \nanticipated. And now we must do more.\n  On top of this injustice, Midwest dairy farmers, where much of the \nnation's milk supply is produced, also suffer from lower income \nresulting from the discriminatory pricing under the Federal Milk \nMarketing Order system. Last year, Secretary Glickman attempted to \nrestore some fairness to that system by making some modest reforms. But \nthis Congress unjustly overturned those reforms while simultaneously \nextending the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact--a milk price cartel \nwhich protects producers in the Northeast at the expense of consumers \nand producers outside the cartel.\n  I am going to work to repeal the Northeast Dairy Compact and to \nrestore some common sense to federal milk pricing. I also will work \nwith my colleagues to develop a meaningful and lasting safety net for \ndairy producers.\n  But, Mr. President, that will take time. And right now, dairy farmers \nin Wisconsin don't have time. They need relief.\n  So, today I am introducing a bill to provide $500 million in direct \nincome relief payments to dairy farmers throughout the nation. The \nmoney is targeted to small scale farms--those least able to withstand \nthese wild price fluctuations. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nFeingold, Specter, Grams, Santorum, and Schumer on this legislation. \nMr. President, I hope to include this funding in the upcoming \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  This will put money in the pockets of dairy farmers now, when they \nmost need it. Not a year from now when many of them will have already \nsold their cows.\n  Let me emphasize that this is a national solution to a national \nproblem. It is not a regional fix. It does not exclude any dairy farmer \nfrom participation. And it does not help some at the expense of others. \nIt helps all dairy farmers.\n  But it is, like last year's funding, merely a bandage to stop the \nbleeding. Dairy farmers everywhere need a meaningful safety net, not \nregional milk cartels. I urge my colleagues who have sought regional \nsolutions to depressed dairy farm income to join me in my efforts to \nfight for a new, national dairy policy that will provide both an \nadequate safety net and hope to dairy farmers across the nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2223. A bill to establish a fund for the restoration of ocean and \ncoastal resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        COASTAL STEWARDSHIP ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amended \nversion of the Coastal Stewardship Act, which I offer along with \nSenators Hollings and Inouye. The purpose of introducing this amended \nversion is to provide a blueprint for how we believe the Senate should \naddress coastal and marine issues in larger proposals that allocate \nrevenues from oil and gas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf \n(OCS) to the States for conservation. This amended version creates the \nOcean and Coast Conservation Fund with $375,000,000 to address urgent \nneeds in our coastal and marine environment, including wetlands, non-\npoint pollution, fisheries research and management, coral reefs and \nenforcement.\n  The bill allocates $100,000,000 to Cooperative Fisheries Research and \nManagement. We have a great need to improve our understanding of \nfisheries and the fishing industry. The National Marine Fisheries \nService, regional fisheries councils, states, the commercial and \nrecreational fishing industries and conservationists rely on fishery \ndata to make difficult management and investment decisions. Given the \nimportance of having sound information, Congress requested the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nquality of our fisheries data. NOAA concluded that, ``Despite some \nregional successes, it is clear that the current overall approach to \ncollecting and managing fisheries information needs to be re-thought, \nrevised, and reworked. The quality and completeness of fishery data are \noften inadequate. Data are often on inaccessible in an appropriate form \nor timely manner. Methods for data collection and management are \nfrequently burdensome and inefficient. These drawbacks result in the \ninability to answer some of the most basic question regarding the state \nof the Nation's fisheries . . .'' NOAA added, ``Simply put, to manage \nfisheries at local, state, regional, or national levels requires a much \nbetter fisheries information system than the one in place.'' I have \nheard a similar refrain from almost every person and group involved in \nour fisheries, whether their interest is fisheries management, \ncommercial or recreational harvest or fisheries conservation. With this \nlegislation, the Governor of any State represented by an Interstate \nMaine Fishery Commission may make an application to the Secretary of \nCommerce for funding to support projects that address this critical \nneed. We will establish comprehensive programs to improve the quality \nand quantity of information available to evaluate stocks, design \ncontrol measures, develop more environmentally-sound gear and include \nthe fishing community in the process.\n  The Cooperative Enforcement provision allocates $25,000,000 for the \nSecretary of Commerce to enter joint agreements with coastal states to \nenhance our coastal and marine enforcement. As with all our laws, our \nnatural resources laws are only effective if they are enforced. These \njoint ventures allow states and local governments to tailor enforcement \nprocedures to fit local needs and available resources, and allow for \ncollaboration between state and local enforcement agencies and federal \nagencies, including the Coast Guard. The proposal authorizes the \nSecretary of Commerce to delegate its living marine resource \nenforcement authorities to a state marine law enforcement entity and to \npay state enforcement costs pursuant to the individual agreements \ncrafted with each participating state. State enforcement under these \nagreements would extend to requirements of federal or regional \nfisheries management plans, including those of interjurisdictional \nfishery management commissions. When first introduced, this proposal \nwas endorsed by the National Association of Conservation Law \nEnforcement Chiefs, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the \nNortheast Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs Association and others.\n  A total of $250,000,000 is dedicated to Coastal Stewardship. This \nflexible program allocates funds to states based on coastline, \npopulation and need for projects that restore and preserve coastal and \nmarine habitat. Projects must be consistent with the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act, National Estuary Program, National Marine Sanctuary \nAct, the National Estuarine Research Reserve program and other laws \ngoverning conservation and restoration of coastal or marine habitat. In \nthis program, states set priorities and decide how and when projects \nproceed within broad national goals. The benefits will be enormous. We \nwill preserve and restore wetlands, reduce non-point source pollution, \nremove abandoned vessels causing environmental damage, address \nwatershed protection, and undertake a range of other projects, all \naimed at coastal conservation.\n  Finally, $25,000,000 is set targeted at Coral Reef Restoration and \nConservation. We must recognize the importance of maintaining the \nhealth and stability of coral reefs which possess enormous \nenvironmental and economic value. With this legislation we will fund \ncooperative projects with States to preserve and restore our coral \nreefs.\n  A portion of these authorizations is set aside for the Department of \nCommerce to enhance its National Marine Sanctuaries, coral programs and \nother critically important conservation efforts.\n  I want to thank Senator Hollings and Inouye for joining as \ncosponsors. I look forward to working with Senator Bingaman, the \nCommerce Committee, and Senator Landrieu and others who are working to \npass comprehensive legislation to dedicate revenues from Outer \nContinental Shelf exploration to the conservation of our coastal and \nmarine environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2224. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nencourage summer fill and fuel budgeting programs for propane, \nkerosene, and heating oil; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n             THE SUMMER FILL AND FUEL BUDGETING ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Summer \nFill and Fuel Budgeting Act of 2000.\n  This winter's fuel crisis will be etched on the memories of New \nEnglanders for many years to come. Price spikes and low inventories \nhave hit Vermonters hard. Schools closed down, oil dealers were driven \nout of business, and many low income families were forced to choose \nbetween heating their homes and purchasing necessary food and \nprescription medications. The region's Senators have focused with a \nsingle-mindedness on the seriousness of the situation and the dire need \nto ensure that it is never repeated.\n  There have been many letters written, emergency funds released, \nmeetings held, and legislative initiatives discussed. Today after weeks \nof diligent research and careful analysis, I am introducing the Summer \nFill and Fuel Budgeting Act of 2000. Senators Joe Lieberman, John \nKerry, Ted Kennedy, and Patrick Leahy are joining me as original co-\nsponsors.\n  The legislation is a critical long term education initiative. Its \npurpose is to educate our constituents about the benefits of filling \ntheir propane, kerosene and heating oil tanks in the summer and \nentering into annual fuel budget contracts. The legislation authorizes \n$25 million for Fiscal Year 2001, and such sums in each fiscal year \nthereafter, for the states to use to develop education and outreach \nprograms to encourage consumers to fill their fuel storage facilities \nduring the summer months. It also promotes the use of budget plans, \nprice cap arrangements, fixed-price contracts and other advantageous \nfinancial arrangements to help avoid severe seasonal price increases \nfor and supply shortages of propane, kerosene, and heating oil.\n  I believe that we must work with retailers and consumers to implement \nthese types of proactive measures to ensure that our fuel supply, as \nwell as the health and safety of millions of Americans, is not subject \nto the whims of foreign oil producing countries. I invite other \nSenators, concerned about the influence that major oil producing \ncountries have on our economy and national security, to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n\n

Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas the Navy and Marine Corps have always been vital to \n     the defense and security of the Nation;\n       Whereas academic institutions and oceanographers made vital \n     contributions in support of the Navy and Marine Corps during \n     World War II;\n       Whereas the great benefits of scientific research to the \n     efforts of the United States during World War II resulted in \n     an understanding that science and technology were of critical \n     importance to the future security of the Nation;\n       Whereas Congress created the Office of Naval Research in \n     the Department of the Navy in 1946 to ensure the availability \n     of resources for research in oceanography and other fields \n     related to the missions of the Navy and Marine Corps;\n       Whereas the Office of Naval Research, in addition to its \n     support of naval research within the Federal Government, has \n     also supported the conduct of oceanographic and scientific \n     research through partnerships with educational and scientific \n     institutions throughout the Nation; and\n       Whereas these partnerships have long been recognized as \n     among the most innovative and productive research \n     partnerships ever established by the Federal Government and \n     have resulted in a vast improvement in understanding of basic \n     ocean processes and the development of new technologies \n     critical to the security and defense of the Nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) applauds the commitment and dedication of the officers, \n     scientists, researchers, students, and administrators who \n     were instrumental to the program of partnerships for \n     oceanographic and scientific research between the Federal \n     Government and academic institutions, including those \n     individuals who helped forge that program before World War \n     II, implement it during World War II, and improve it \n     throughout the Cold War;\n       (2) recognizes that the Nation, in ultimately prevailing in \n     the Cold War, relied to a significant extent on research \n     supported by, and technologies developed through, those \n     partnerships, and in particular on the superior understanding \n     of the ocean environment generated through that research;\n       (3) supports efforts by the Director of the Office of Naval \n     Research to honor those individuals, who contributed so \n     greatly and unselfishly to the naval mission and the national \n     defense, through those partnerships during the period \n     beginning before World War II and continuing through the end \n     of the Cold War; and\n       (4) expresses appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the \n     Office of Naval Research to support oceanographic and \n     scientific research and the development of researchers in \n     those fields, to ensure that such partnerships will continue \n     to make important contributions to the defense and the \n     general welfare of the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1328-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  REID (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2883\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Boxer) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 1712) to provide authority to control \nexports, and for other purposes;

Mr. President, I want to underscore what I have said, what \nthe distinguished Senator from California has said, and what others \nhave said in support of the Paez and Berzon nominations.\n  Judge Paez has waited more than 4 years to have his nomination heard \non this floor--4 years--notwithstanding the fact that he has the \nhighest rating the American Bar Association can give a nominee. He has \none of the most distinguished records of any nominee, Republican or \nDemocrat, to come before this body since I have been here.\n  Similarly, Ms. Berzon has waited for more than 2 years, an \nunconscionable period of time--again, a woman with an extraordinary \nbackground and the highest of ratings from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  They have for some reason been held to a higher standard than most \njudicial nominees. I do not recall a situation where a nominee has had \nto go through these kinds of hoops to get here and have an up or down \nvote.\n  Again, I compliment the majority leader and the Democratic leader for \nhelping us put together a successful cloture petition on each of these \nnominations. We have now 85 or 86 votes to move forward.\n  I hope the Senate will not shame itself by taking the unprecedented \nstep tomorrow of moving to postpone indefinitely either of these \nextraordinary nominees. It is a fact that one can make a motion to \nsuspend or indefinitely--that is true--or to indefinitely postpone. One \ncan make such a motion. But it would be unprecedented for a judicial \nnominee. We have asked informally and I have asked the presiding \nofficer and through him the parliamentarian and no precedent for such a \nmotion against a judicial nomination following cloture has been \nprovided.\n  I defy anybody to point out, certainly in my lifetime--as I said \nearlier, I am 59 years old--to point out in my lifetime where a \njudicial nominee has gone through the extraordinary hoops of multiple \nnominations hearings, being reported favorably twice, having a \nnomination have to be resubmitted by the President Congress after \nCongress, being forced to wait more than 4 years to be debated, getting \npast a filibuster, invoking cloture with 85 or 86 votes--an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate--and then having a motion to \nindefinitely postpone, in effect, to kill the nomination.\n  It would shame the Senate, No. 1, to even bring up such a motion, but \ncertainly to allow such a motion to be successful with a nominee who \nhas been waiting for 4 years, notwithstanding the fact that this is a \nperson who is one of the most extraordinary Hispanic American jurists \nwe have ever seen, who has the highest rating, who is backed by \neverybody from law enforcement to litigators. Judge Paez has been \nforced to go through these extraordinary hoops and his nomination is \npoised, finally, for debate and a fair up or down vote. To have \nsomebody take this unprecedented and shameful step of asking us to \nindefinitely postpone Senate approval of this nomination is, in effect, \na procedural device to deny that up or down vote and kill this \nnomination.\n  The same with Marsha Berzon: This extraordinary woman, reaching the\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\npinnacle of her legal career, having earned success every step along \nthe way, having earned the highest possible rating from the American \nBar Association, comes here, has to undergo an extraordinary ordeal and \nthis long wait, has to go through the unusual step of a cloture motion \nand our prevailing with 85 votes. Then for the Senate to say to her: \nBut now we are going to do something that has never been done before to \na judicial nominee who has gotten past cloture: We are going to move to \nindefinitely postpone. That is not right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquick question? I will be very brief.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I thank Senator Leahy for his extraordinary \nleadership. I was so taken aback by this. I made some comments to our \nPresiding Officer. It seems to me there is a letter of the law and a \nspirit of the law, there is a letter of cloture and there is a spirit \nof cloture.\n  We go through a situation where we say it is unprecedented to even \nhave these cloture motions. We don't do it often. It is not \nunprecedented--I think seven or eight times in decades. Now we have a \nnew way to go where we essentially would deny that individual an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  I want to say to my friend how articulate he is on this point. I hope \nSenators are listening in their offices. I hope they will view this as \na violation of the spirit of cloture and certainly will not go down \nthis road.\n  That is all I can say. My colleague is right on this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason I get concerned about this is, \nnow, having in excess of 80 votes to go forward with this, we ought to \nhave the courage and the honesty to stand up and vote. Senators are \npaid to vote ``aye'' or ``nay.'' They are not paid to vote ``maybe.'' \nIt would be a cowardly and disgraceful step to vote ``maybe'' because \nwe want to avoid saying what the Senate is being asked to do--to close \nthe door to two such extraordinary people. I always respect Senators \nwho vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' I will not respect Senators who vote \n``maybe.'' That is beneath the dignity of the Senate.\n  There are only 100 of us who are elected to represent a quarter of a \nbillion Americans. Let us have the courage to stand up and vote either \nfor or against these two extraordinary nominees. Let us not play silly \nparliamentary games and tell the American people we do not have the \nguts to vote, that we are going to vote ``maybe.'' I did not get \nelected to serve in the Senate to vote ``maybe.'' I did not serve for \n25 years in a body that I revere to vote ``maybe.''\n  I am certainly not going to stand here and allow with no comment \nthese two people to be held hostage one more time. Vote for them, or \nvote against them. I certainly urge my colleagues to vote for them.\n  In all my years on the Judiciary Committee extending back over \nseveral decades, I do not know of two finer nominees who have come \nbefore the Senate, Republican or Democrat. And I voted for most \nnominees, Republican and Democrat, during that time.\n  Vote for these two people. At least in that way, apologize for \nholding them hostage all of these years. But, for God's sake, don't \nshame us all by voting for some kind of parliamentary gimcrackery \nsaying we will postpone it indefinitely. Vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' \nDon't vote ``maybe.''\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/08/senate-section/article/S1331-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1331-S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL CRISIS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak for \njust a few minutes, as we are closing up today, on a very important \npolicy question before the Senate, one that while actually not being \ndebated on the Senate or House floors at this time, it is being hotly \ndebated in private meetings and corridors and in some public meetings \nof the various committees; that is, the problem, the crisis, the \nchallenge that this country is now facing with extraordinarily high oil \nprices.\n  The price of crude oil today, according to the Wall Street Journal, \nis above $34 a barrel. For some, this causes--as in an oil-producing \nState--a bonanza; for others, it causes a real problem.\n  I will speak for a few minutes about some of the steps we could \nperhaps take. Wild swings in and the volatility of the price of oil are \nnot good. Senators heard troublesome testimony today from senior \ncitizens and a young family struggling in the Northeast, which is the \nmost dependent part of our Nation. Neither are these price swings good \nfor the oil-producing States, of which I represent Louisiana.\n  What a difference a year can make. Last year at this time, our \ncommittee was actually meeting about the world price of oil pushing $5 \na barrel. Our Energy Committee met time and time again, trying to \nfigure out what we could do to help stabilize a very important industry \nto our Nation, to help provide some relief, particularly for the small \nand independent producers who obviously were driven out of business. \nThe oil and gas industry lost literally tens of thousands of workers \nover the course of the year because they simply could not turn any kind \nof profit at that low price.\n  Just today, we had a hearing in the same committee, now talking about \noil at $34 a barrel and the havoc it is wreaking in other places.\n  In the Northeast, people are having great difficulty, understandably \nso, having not been able to predict this would happen. Adding $300 and \n$400 a month to home heating oil, it is tough for many families to make \nthat payment.\n  As in Louisiana last year, in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, and other \nplaces around the Nation, some families were not able to pay any bills \nbecause they lost an entire paycheck which rested on the strength of a \ndomestic industry that had the rug pulled out from underneath it.\n  We now face a looming energy crisis of a completely different \nnature--not extraordinarily low prices but extraordinarily high prices. \nIt is said only in times of war do we really appreciate our military. \nAt least this time, perhaps at times of high oil prices, we now can \nfully appreciate the importance of our domestic energy industry in the \nproducing States--not just oil producers, who are important, but gas \nproducers and producers of energy who will help our country be more \nself-reliant. Since we are the greatest consumer of energy in every \nsector, we must have a policy that encourages the strength and \nrobustness of the energy-producing sector. I suggest we have a long way \nto go, given what is happening today.\n  In 1959--quite a while ago, but not so long ago that many people in \nthis Nation cannot still remember quite well--our Nation imported only \n16 percent of its oil and gas. Today we import over 50 percent. We have \nmoved from self-reliance to reliance on others, and in many instances \nit is not even allies on whom we are relying. It is one thing to have \nto rely on our allies and our friends such as Saudi Arabia and \nVenezuela, encouraging them to help in this difficult time, as we most \ncertainly have stepped up to their aid and continue to do so.\n\n  However, we also have to go hat in hand to countries that are not our \nallies--in fact, enemy nations--and have interests contrary in terms of \nfreedom and democracy--Iran and Libya, to name two.\n  It is a particularly difficult situation and one which I think is \navoidable if this administration and others had a better policy \nregarding energy self-reliance for a strong and vibrant economy.\n  I will make a few suggestions. First, let me comment on some of the \nthings I hear other people suggesting as a remedy. I say to my \ncolleagues, we should all be engaged in coming up with solutions. We \nshould be putting remedies on the table. We might not adopt every one, \nbut we most certainly should be engaged in finding solutions to this \nproblem, not just turning our head and hoping it goes away, hoping OPEC \nwill provide the relief we need. We need to get our fate back in our \nown hands.\n  One suggestion being tossed around and has actually been filed as a \nbill by several Members of the Senate is using the Strategic Petroleum \nOil Reserve to provide some temporary relief. That may or may not be a \ngood idea.\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n  Let me quote from Chairman Greenspan who, when presented with this \nidea, made this statement in front of the House Banking Committee \nrecently:\n\n       It is foolishness to believe we can have any significant \n     impact short of a very major liquidation short-term of that \n     reserve. There is more to this than economics. It is a \n     diplomatic security question.\n\n  That reserve was created to protect the U.S. from a cutoff and keep \nthe U.S. from being held hostage.\n  While some think dipping into that reserve might move us out of this \ncrisis, I suggest that before we make that decision we do the math. \nThere are only 55 days of supply. We might be able to drive down the \nprice if we liquidated a significant portion of that oil and gas for a \ncertain amount of time, maybe at a 7 or 10-percent drop. But thinking \nwe can liquidate our strategic oil reserve and drive down this price \nand sustain a low price, I am not sure that case has yet been made.\n  For the purposes of this discussion, that should be kept on the \ntable. We must be very careful not to give the American people the idea \nthat we have a secret key, that we have a magic wand, that we can \nsimply liquidate this reserve and prices will fall and all things will \nbe made whole again. Not only am I not sure that would work, but it \ncould leave our country in a very difficult position from a national \nsecurity standpoint to have liquidated that reserve. Then it would be \nat a great expense to the taxpayer in that a lot of this oil that was \npurchased when the price was quite low, which was smart to do, would \nthen, at great expense to the taxpayer, have to be replenished at three \nand four times the cost. So let us say I would agree to keep it on the \ntable but not present the American public with the idea that \nliquidating the SPR is the answer.\n\n  Another sort of false solution, I think, rests with some who are \nsuggesting we simply need to call in our chips, that America can simply \nrely on the good will of our neighbors. Yes, we do many wonderful \nthings for countries. We have stepped up to the plate to help Mexico \nand Venezuela most recently in a crisis. We have helped, obviously, \nKuwait. We went to war on their behalf. But I think just relying on \ncalling in our chips, calling in good will, at times such as this is, \nagain, one small thing that can be done but we most certainly do not \nwant to rely on that to keep prices stable and to sustain this great \neconomic boom. I think, again, it is a false remedy.\n  I believe, rather, that some of the things we can do internally would \nhelp us to better prepare for situations such as this. One would be to \nhave more aggressive drilling and exploration in the United States. \nInstead of having oil and gas drilling moratoria as the rule and then \nmaking exceptions for drilling, we should have an aggressive drilling \npolicy that is environmentally sensitive.\n  Let me be quick to say the industry, contrary to popular opinion, has \nmade significant efforts in this regard because there are now local, \nState, and Federal regulations, tough regulations, regulations many of \nus support from oil- and gas-producing States, to make sure this \nextraction is done with the minimum negative environmental impacts. So \nI am not suggesting going back to the days, 30 or 40, even 20, years \nago when none of these regulations was in place. I am suggesting we can \nhave an environmentally sensitive drilling policy, particularly that \nwould give preference, perhaps, or give priority or help to encourage \nthe extraction of natural gas, which is in itself a clean burning fuel.\n  Let me read from ``Fueling the Future''--I will submit this for the \nRecord--about the potential benefits of natural gas. It says:\n\n       Changes in U.S. energy policy that favor increased use of \n     natural gas could improve air quality, conserve energy and \n     reduce reliance on imported oil from politically unstable \n     countries.\n\n  It would seem to me, since we have all of these natural gas reserves, \nsome in the Gulf of Mexico, in shallow and deep water, some around \nAlaska, and some in other places in this Nation, that it would do us a \nworld of good to be much more open to the idea of using natural gas in \nits many different forms to help us fill our energy grid and make it \ngreener, to meet our own expectations and to meet new international \nstandards for clean air. That is one thing that we most certainly can \ndo.\n  Another, we have taken the step in an aggressive policy to \nacknowledge what a good thing we did when we gave royalty relief for \ndeep water drilling in the gulf. There were many Members of this body \nwho not only did not vote for that, they vigorously opposed it. My \npredecessor was the lead sponsor of that legislation. I can only say \nthank goodness that that has given us a window of hope. Because new \ntechnologies have been developed, we are able to find reserves in \ndeeper water in the Gulf of Mexico to give us the balance we need in \ndomestic production. Whether it is necessary to extend that relief now, \nwith prices going up, would be a question for another day. But thank \ngoodness we did it at the time we did it so we now have increased \nreserves and because technology has been developed, that helps us to \nminimize those dry holes, and maximizes--and it makes much more \nefficient--this extraction. We can continue to do those things.\n  Another thing, we should put our money where our mouth is when we \ntalk about alternative fuels development. I mentioned natural gas, but \nwe have solar; we have the potential for fuel cells; we have other \npotential sources of energy. We cannot take nuclear off the table, \nwhich we have discussed in this body for the last 20 years. I hope now \npeople can appreciate the part that nuclear power can play when \nproperly regulated and properly run to help make our grid greener.\n  France takes 80 percent of their energy needs from nuclear. We should \nat least be open to the possibility of sustaining our current nuclear \ncapacity and perhaps even increasing it to help us get our grid greener \nand again minimize our reliance on outside sources. So vigorous \nprograms for alternatives, promoting the use of natural gas, and also, \nof course, continuing to promote conservation--whether it is in \ntransportation or weatherization of our homes--are also important.\n  My point is, in times of war we appreciate our military all the more \nand the great sacrifices our men in uniform make and how proud we are \nof them and how happy we actually are to support them with our tax \ndollars because we recognize their great value.\n  I hope the country will take note that when prices are this high, we \nfeel vulnerable. We feel scared and nervous and frustrated and angry. \nThere is a lot of pain. When prices are high, truckers cannot move \ntheir product. Farmers have now been hit not only with tough weather \nand rock-bottom prices but high diesel fuel costs. It is a triple \nwhammy for our farmers.\n\n  I hope this country will recognize and express appreciation for our \ndomestic oil and gas and other energy producers, and say we cannot take \nit for granted. We must nurture this industry, help it to be as \nenvironmentally sensitive as possible, but not allow this Nation, the \ngreatest nation on Earth, to be so dependent on sources outside of our \nsphere of influence and outside of our boundaries. It would be the same \nas depending on other nations for our food. We would not do that. We \nwould not import 100 percent of our food. I do not think people in this \nNation realize how much we are importing from other nations.\n  Let us take this opportunity to put all our suggestions on the table. \nLet us urge those running to be the President of our Nation to come up \nwith a real, comprehensive, workable policy that will help to maintain \nstable prices where our producers can make money and turn a profit. \nObviously, people would not be in business if they could not make \nmoney. That is why people are in business. We are in government for \ndifferent reasons, but business people usually go into business only if \nthey can turn a profit in that enterprise or activity. So we have to \nmaintain a stable price at a level where our domestic industry can make \na profit, where people can stay in and work. Tax policies can have a \nlot to do with that.\n  We appreciated the help, although it was small and somewhat \nnoncomprehensive, last year when our energy producers were feeling the \npinch. We hope we can give some short-term relief to those who are \nclearly suffering from these high prices. Ultimately, the answer lies \nin long-term, comprehensive fixes, based on real-world economics and \nhelping the American people\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nunderstand with every choice to take some area away from drilling or \nwith every choice to turn away from some source of energy, with every \ndecision made, there are consequences to those choices. Then we can \ncreate a policy that Americans feel good about and a policy which \nexpands our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article ``Fueling the Future'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From American Gas, March 2000]\n\n                           Fueling the Future\n\n                            (By Karen Ryan)\n\n       Could U.S. consumption of natural gas rise by as much as 13 \n     quadrillion Btu (quads) over the next 20 years? A new \n     American Gas Foundation study says it's certainly a \n     possibility if appropriate policies are implemented.\n       ``Fueling the Future: Natural Gas & New Technologies for a \n     Cleaner 21st Century'' confirms what natural gas industry \n     professionals have long suspected: Changes in U.S. energy \n     policy that favor increased use of natural gas could improve \n     air quality, conserve energy and reduce reliance on imported \n     oil from politically unstable countries. Consequently, the \n     study forecasts that the environmental, economic and \n     efficiency advantages of natural gas--combined with advances \n     in gas-related technologies and the introduction of new end-\n     use technologies--could help push U.S. gas consumption into \n     the 35-quad range over the next two decades. Currently, U.S. \n     gas demand is close to 22 quads a year.\n       The study tracks two scenarios: a ``current projection,'' \n     which shows gas demand reaching nearly 30 quads by 2020, and \n     an ``accelerated projection,'' which foresees demand topping \n     35 quads by then based on the adoption of national policies \n     encouraging greater use of natural gas. Gas supply will keep \n     pace with rising demand, with at least 84 percent of demand \n     in 2020 fulfilled by gas produced domestically, compared with \n     85 percent today, says the study. The rest will be imported \n     primarily from Canada, just as it is now. The nation's gas \n     resource base is enormous, continues the study, and tapping \n     into it to produce enough gas to sustain 35 quads of demand \n     will require technological innovations similar to those that \n     opened up major new domestic sources of gas over the past 15 \n     years.\n       Assuming continued resource base expansion, coupled with \n     continued technological progress in the ways the nation \n     finds, produces, delivers and uses gas, the cost of gas \n     service will increase only modestly over the next 20 years, \n     says the study. The price of gas purchased at the wellhead is \n     expected to remain in the mid-$2 per MMBtu range.\n\n\n                         the common denominator\n\n       ``We believe that the study challenges conventional \n     estimates of the natural gas market's potential,'' says AGA \n     Chairman Gary Neale, who is president, chairman and CEO of \n     NiSource Inc. Changing energy, technological and \n     environmental forces are creating extraordinary market \n     opportunities for the natural gas industry, from advanced \n     residential furnaces and water heaters to gas cooling, fuel \n     cells and advanced industrial applications. Neale points to \n     distributed generation, as does the study, as a major reason \n     gas consumption will swell in coming years. In the \n     accelerated projection, distributed generation--in the form \n     of reciprocating engines, microturbines and fuel cells--\n     accounts for about 20 percent of the electricity generated \n     in the nation by 2020.\n       ``AGA can play an immensely important role in expanding \n     this new market,'' says Neale. In an early step, the \n     association joined the Distributed Generation Forum, managed \n     by GRI to provide its members with technical, regulatory and \n     market information to use in strategic planning and in \n     market-development and education programs. The membership of \n     the Distributed Generation Forum comprises gas and electric \n     utilities, manufacturers and other parties developing and \n     promoting distributed generation. AGA also is working with \n     Congress to make sure nothing in the upcoming electric \n     industry deregulation legislation will hamper the distributed \n     generation market.\n\n\n                            at home with gas\n\n       Today, 56 million out of the 102 million households in the \n     United States--55 percent--have natural gas service. In 1998, \n     these customers used 4.5 quads of gas. Residential gas \n     consumption is forecast to reach 5.7 quads in 2020 under the \n     study's current projection. The accelerated projection pegs \n     demand at 7.4 quads, based on continued growth in traditional \n     markets coupled with an assumption that greater demand for \n     gas fireplaces, air conditioners, microturbines and fuel \n     cells will radically alter the residential gas market.\n       The forecast goes on to say that home builders will \n     continue to favor gas over electricity by a wide margin. In \n     1998, 70 percent of newly built houses were heated with \n     natural gas. It also assumes that owners of existing homes \n     will continue to convert their heating systems from other \n     fuels to natural gas at the same pace as in the past decade \n     when about 200,000 homeowners a year switched fuels. The \n     study sees significant potential for conversion of other \n     household tasks to natural gas in homes already hooked to the \n     gas system.\n       In addition, gas fireplaces have been a huge draw for \n     energy-conscious consumers in recent years. The typical gas \n     fireplace is far cleaner than its wood counterparts, \n     eliminating or making major reductions in a variety of \n     pollutants, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon \n     monoxide and soot. In fact, wood fireplaces are banned or \n     restricted in a number of areas, including Denver, \n     Portland, Phoenix and Los Angeles because of environmental \n     concerns. Currently, gas fireplaces account for 125 \n     trillion Btu annually.\n\n\n                        Getting Down to Business\n\n       The businesses and institutions making up the commercial \n     market currently use about 3 quads of gas annually. \n     Consumption in 2020 is forecast to total 4.4 quads under the \n     current projection and 5.5 quads under the accelerated \n     scenario. New technologies, says the study--especially gas-\n     fueled cooling and dehumidification systems and aggressive \n     growth in space and water heating and various food service \n     applications--will drive the demand increase.\n       To help spread the news about gas-based technologies, AGA \n     recently began a national accounts program aimed at the food-\n     service and supermarkets sectors. The goal this year, says \n     Walter Woods, who heads the program for AGA, is to call on \n     executives at the headquarters of 16 restaurant and 16 \n     supermarket chains to discuss the advantages of using gas.\n       ``We hope to persuade these companies to test and specify \n     gas equipment by giving them information they may not have,'' \n     says Woods, who is accompanied on the visits by \n     representatives of the local gas utilities. One thing Woods \n     has discovered is that some national companies are surprised \n     when a representative of the gas industry pays a visit. ``The \n     electric side does this sort of thing all of the time,'' he \n     says, ``but apparently the gas side has not.''\n       Another program, the Gas Foodservice Equipment Network, was \n     launched last fall to serve as a resource for information, \n     education and marketing support. The network is an alliance \n     of utilities, foodservice equipment manufacturers, trade \n     associations (including AGA) and other industry participants. \n     The April issue of American Gas will cover the network's \n     program.\n\n\n                    Fueling Instury and Power Plants\n\n       The environmental and energy-efficiency attributes of \n     natural gas technologies will continue to prove attractive to \n     the operators of the nation's factories and power plants. \n     According to the foundation's forecast, industrial \n     consumption of gas in 2020 will reach 11 quads under the \n     current projection and 13 quads under the accelerated \n     projection, up from 10.1 quads in 1998. The industrial sector \n     has led the resurgence in gas demand since the mid-1980's \n     with factory operators selecting a number of innovative new \n     technologies from direct-contact water heaters to gas-fired \n     infrared burners. Continued equipment advances in the new \n     millennium will offer additional choices.\n       Even though coal is forecast to remain the dominant power \n     plant fuel, natural gas is projected to double its share of \n     this market by 202 with demand moving up to 6.7 quads under \n     the accelerated projection. This market includes electric \n     utilities as well as independent (non-utility) power \n     producers. Most of the rise in power plant gas demand is \n     linked to wider use of combined-cycle technology, which \n     captures the waste heat produced by the generator's large gas \n     turbines and uses it to produce more electricity.\n       Demand is actually a little lower under the accelerated \n     projection than in the current projection. The accelerated \n     projection forecasts that slightly less new generating \n     capacity will be required because: The operating lives of \n     some coal-fired and nuclear-powered generating plants will be \n     extended, some new coal-fired plants will be built, \n     distributed generation will account for 20 percent of added \n     generation capacity and renewable sources of energy will \n     generate more electricity in 2020 than today.\n\n\n                             the ngv market\n\n       ``Fueling the Future'' sees gas consumption in the \n     transportation sector increasing to 2.8 quads by 2020. More \n     than 1.5 quads of this growth is attributed to natural gas \n     vehicles (NGVs) although the study points out that widespread \n     use of NGVs will hinge on the success of on-going efforts to \n     increase their driving range and make the vehicles more \n     economically competitive, including bringing down the \n     purchase price.\n       Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition President Richard Kolodziej \n     reports that roughly 80,000 NGVs travel U.S. roads today, \n     mainly as fleet vehicles. The industry's strategy, he says, \n     is ``to pursue the high fuel-use fleet market, which includes \n     transit and school buses, trash trucks, urban delivery \n     vehicles, airport shuttles and taxis.''\n       Kolodzeij also notes that the national transportation-\n     related environmental focus until recently has been on \n     reducing the automotive emissions that contribute to smog. \n     ``There is now a growing focus on diesel fuel because of \n     concerns about the health effects of particulates and other \n     air toxins,'' says Kolodzeij. ``Studies are showing that \n     diesel vehicles have a disproportionate impact on air quality \n     with respect to carcinogenic toxins.'' The shift in emphasis \n     is improving the prospects for natural gas in the truck and \n     bus markets. In the past two years alone, between 17 and 20 \n     percent of all new transit buses that have been ordered have \n     been fueled by natural gas, he says.\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n                       other optimistic outlooks\n\n       Reality check: Is the American Gas Foundation's accelerated \n     scenario too optimistic? Not especially when compared with \n     some other recent projections. While the other forecasts may \n     use different parameters to arrive at their conclusions and \n     look only as far as 2015, they all reach basically the same \n     conclusion: Gas use will rise substantially in the early \n     years of the new century.\n       In contrast with GRI's and the National Petroleum Council's \n     recent studies, the American Gas Foundation's study is a bit \n     more optimistic, predicting a slightly higher potential for \n     demand. It also projects market growth differently--\n     attributing potential higher demand coming more from end-use \n     applications in the residential and commercial sectors rather \n     than from electricity generation.
