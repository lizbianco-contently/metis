Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 10:15. Following morning business, a cloture \nvote will occur on the motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax \nElimination Act.\n\n\n                                  vote\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 10:15 this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will continue postcloture \ndebate on the motion to proceed. The Senate may also resume \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill in an effort to make \nfurther progress on that important piece of legislation. It is the \nintention of the managers of the Interior appropriations bill to lock \nup a filing deadline for first-degree amendments during today's \nsession.\n  Senators should expect votes each day this week. Also, we will have \nlate nights to have debate on amendments on the Defense authorization \nbill with votes on amendments, if necessary, occurring the following \nmorning. I have been assured by the managers of that legislation, \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin, that we will be working tonight and \nwe probably will have some votes the first thing in the morning on the \nbill.\n  I regret that we have to have a vote on the motion to proceed. A good \nfaith effort has been made to work out an agreement on a limited number \nof amendments, but we have not been able to come to an agreement on \nthat.\n  It is important that we get to the substance of this legislation--the \nelimination of the death tax. It is high time we take action on this \nunfortunate tax provision that has been on the tax rolls since Theodore \nRoosevelt was President. I know from personal experience that it is \nhaving a very devastating effect on small businesses, family farms, and \nhomesteads. I have come across members of families in tears in my own \nState on finding they had to sell their small business or their farm \nthat has been in the family sometimes for two or three generations \nbecause they had to pay this most unfair death tax.\n  Many commentators seem perplexed, trying to understand why this \nlegislation would have received such overwhelming support in the House \nof Representatives with an almost unanimous vote among the Republicans \nand 65 Democrats, from all regions, backgrounds, races, sex, and \neverything else. They can't understand why it got this very outstanding \nvote.\n  The answer is really very simple. First of all, all of us would like \nto be able to have an estate of some value when we reach the end of our \nrole. We would like to be able to pass it on to our children for the \nnext generation. The idea that the Federal Government would come and \nreach into the grave and pull back 40, 45, 50, or 55 percent of a \nlife's work offends the American people regardless of financial status. \nIt is a basically and patently unfair tax provision.\n  I am pleased we are going to move forward this week to get a vote. Of \ncourse, we will have to have a vote on cloture so that there won't be \nan extended series of unrelated, nongermane amendments or filibusters. \nBut I hope we will get that vote. Then we will get to final vote on the \nsubstance. It is long overdue.\n  I commend the chairman of the committee, Chairman Roth, and the \nranking member, Senator Moynihan, for allowing this legislation to come \nto the floor today for a vote. Also, again I must express my admiration \nfor the way the House handled this matter.\n  I understand there will be a period for morning business. Senators \nare here prepared to speak on the substance of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6404-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is most unfortunate that the \nPresident has decided to delay the first federal execution in almost \nforty years.\n  Mr. Juan Garza was a vicious drug kingpin who was found guilty of \nthree murders and sentenced to death in 1993. He was also convicted of \nvarious drug and money laundering offenses. Of course, there is no way \nto know how many American lives he destroyed indirectly through his \nextensive drug trafficking into this country. He is just the type of \ncriminal that the Congress had in mind when we reestablished the \nfederal death penalty in 1988.\n  His lawyers are not claiming he is innocent. Rather, they are making \ngeneral arguments about the fairness of the death penalty, and the \nPresident is apparently sympathetic to this.\n  Over the weekend, the White House confirmed that the President will \npostpone the execution for at least 90 days and maybe until after the \nNovember elections. The reason for the administration has given is that \nthe Justice Department is still drafting formal clemency guidelines. \nMr. Garza was sentenced to death 7 years ago, and his case has been \ntied up in appeals ever since. The Supreme Court decided in November \nthat it would not hear his case, and in May a judge scheduled his \nexecution for August. The Department has had more than enough time to \nprepare such guidelines.\n  Of course, the President does not need any special death penalty \nguidelines to act. The President has the power to commute Mr. Garza's \nsentence or even pardon him if he wishes. The President should make his \ndecision and not further delay an already extremely long process.\n  This is consistent with this administration's treatment of the death \npenalty overall. Only steadfast opponents to capital punishment can \nargue that it is used too often in the federal system today. Last year, \nmy Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing that discussed the federal \ndeath penalty in some detail. After becoming Attorney General, Ms. Reno \nestablished an elaborate review process at Main Justice to consider \nwhether a U.S. attorney may seek the death penalty. She has permitted \nprosecutors to seek the death penalty in less than one-third of the \ncases when it is available.\n  Also, her review permits defense attorneys to argue that she should \nreject the death penalty in a particular case, but it does not permit \nvictims to argue for the death penalty. I hope the Department's new \nclemency rules will allow victims to participate in the process. \nHowever, victims should be allowed to encourage the Department to seek \nthe death penalty in the first place.\n  The death penalty is an essential form of punishment for the most \nserious of crimes. Yet, it has not been carried out in the federal \nsystem for 37 years. We should not continue to delay its use. When an \ninmate's appeals are exhausted, as they are in this case, the President \nshould carry out the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6404-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the remarks made \nby the majority leader a few moments ago on the subject of the estate \ntax.\n  First of all, the question of repealing the estate tax or changing \nthe estate tax is an important issue, but it is not an issue that is \nimportant to the exclusion of all other issues. The majority leader \ntakes the position that the estate tax ought to be repealed completely \nso those in this country who die and leave $100 million in assets or \n$500 million in assets or $1 billion in assets, who now pay some estate \ntax, will be tax free. That is what ``repeal'' means.\n  I happen to believe we ought to change the estate tax to provide a \nsignificant exemption so that no small business and no family farm gets \ncaught in the estate tax. I don't want people to try to leave the \nfamily farm or the small business to their children, only to discover \nthere will be a crippling estate tax to pay. So I say, let's get rid of \nthat situation. Let's provide an exemption--$8, $10 million--that takes \ncare of the vast majority of cases.\n  But how about those folks who leave half a billion dollars or $1 \nbillion? Do we really want to repeal the estate tax on that kind of \nestate? There are other and competing needs for the revenue involved. \nFor example, we could pay down the Federal debt; we could provide a \nlarger tax credit for college tuition; we could invest in elementary \nand secondary education; we could provide tax relief to middle-income \nfamilies rather than to the wealthiest estates in the country.\n  I happen to believe we should change the estate tax, but I don't \nbelieve we ought to repeal the estate tax for the largest estates.\n  The majority leader says the problem is with the Democratic side of \nthe Senate. No, the problem is that yesterday the majority leader came \nto the floor of the Senate and tried to pass the repeal of the estate \ntax by unanimous consent. No debate, no discussion, no amendments, $750 \nbillion of tax cuts in the second decade after repeal--$750 billion in \ntax cuts by unanimous consent, without any debate, and without any \namendments. That is what he tried to do yesterday. We objected to that.\n  Yesterday we proposed that he bring up this measure under a regular \norder. The majority leader objected to that. Democratic leaders \nproposed that the majority leader bring the bill up and allow 6, 8, or \n10 amendments, with time agreements. But the majority leader has \nobjected to that.\n  His position is: I want my way or no way. I want to bring it up and \nrepeal all of the estate tax, which would mean generous tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest estates in this country. If we don't do it his way, we \nwere told, we won't have an opportunity to offer any amendments. That \nis the majority leader's position. The people elected to the Senate on \nthis side of the aisle will not be able to offer amendments. He says in \neffect, ``We have an idea, we intend to push that idea, we demand a \nvote on that idea, and, by the way, you, Senators, don't have any right \nto offer amendments.''\n  That is the majority leader's position. That is not a position that \nis acceptable to me. It is not the way the Senate ought to work. There \nis something called a regular order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for raising the point that they were \ngoing to pass a $750 billion tax break for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, those who pay estate taxes, and do it without one minute of \ncommittee hearings--I see the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \non the floor--not a minute of hearing. This was going to be done \nwithout any discussion, any debate, $750 billion in tax breaks.\n  I ask my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, whether or not he \nbelieves it also says something about the priorities of the Congress, \nthat of all the different people who could be helped by this Congress, \nthe highest, the single most important priority for the Republicans \nturns out to be the wealthiest. When it comes to helping people pay for \ntheir prescription drugs, when it comes to helping people, dealing with \nareas such as difficulties with HMOs, folks don't even have a voice in \nthis debate. They are not even being considered.\n  Would the Senator address the whole question of prioritization, as to \nwhether or not we are making the right decision in terms of helping the \npeople who really need it the most in this country?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n  Let me correct something I said a moment ago. The majority leader \nyesterday tried to bring up H-1B legislation, not the estate tax. I was \nmistaken about that. I should have known better. I was on the floor at \nthat time, as a matter of fact.\n  But it is true that the majority leader wants to bring up the estate \ntax and say to half of the Members of the Senate: You don't have a \nright to offer amendments, and if you don't like it, tough luck. That \nis what the issue is about.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked the question, Shouldn't this proposed \nrepeal be measured against other priorities, and shouldn't this suggest \nwhat is important in the Senate? It sure does. There is not the time or \nthe energy or the inspiration on the part of those who control the \nagenda in the Senate to have a real debate about protecting people \nagainst HMOs, and to try to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. No, there \nis not time for that. Can we work to put a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program? No, not quite enough time for that either. In \nfact, the other side understands that is an important issue, so they \nhave cobbled together a goofy proposal that says OK, the senior \ncitizens are having trouble affording prescription drugs, so let's give \na subsidy to the insurance companies. Even the insurance companies see \nthrough that. They have come to my office--and I assume to the \nSenator's office--and said: We will not be able to offer a prescription \ndrug plan. We would have to charge $1,200 for a plan that has $1,000 in \nbenefits.\n  The point the Senator from Illinois makes is we have other \npriorities. Those other priorities somehow don't get to the floor of \nthe Senate because the big priority at the moment is to give an estate \ntax repeal to the largest estates in the country.\n  As I said, I think we ought to provide a significant exemption so \nthat every family farm and every small business can be transferred to \nthe kids upon the death of the parents, with no estate tax at all--\nnone, zero. However, when a billionaire or someone with $500 million in \nassets dies and there is an estate, is it not unreasonable to have some \ntransfer here, some estate tax, in order to use those resources for \nother purposes, such as reducing the Federal debt, providing middle \nincome tax relief--a whole range of urgent needs? Is that not a \nreasonable thing? That is what we ought to measure this against.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Republicans have their way to totally repeal the \nestate tax for the wealthiest in America and take $750  billion out of \nthe surplus for that purpose, doesn't that diminish the likelihood, \ndoesn't that reduce the possibility, that we will have the resources to \npass a meaningful prescription drug benefit for the elderly and \ndisabled in America, one that helps all of them pay for the outrageous \ncost of prescription drugs?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Illinois, it is exactly as he \nstates. With the wonderful economy we have had and the surpluses that \nare expected, there is a certain amount of revenue available. The \npriority, for the majority side, is to repeal the estate tax, including \nthat top half of the estate tax that applies to the wealthiest estates \nin the country. If we follow this priority, that will crowd out the \nability to do other things.\n  This is a question of making judgments about what is important, what \nis the priority of this Congress. Should we provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare? Should this Congress make the investments in \neducation that we should make? Should this Congress decide we should \npay down the Federal debt? Should this Congress decide college tuition \nshould trigger an increased tax credit that helps kids go to college? \nThese are all priorities, and there are more of them that we ought to \nmeasure against this proposal to repeal the estate tax for the largest \nestates in the country.\n  As I said, it is a matter of priorities, and it is also a matter of \nwill. What do we have time to do in the Senate? We are told by the \nmajority leader that we do not have enough time to deal with Patients' \nBill of Rights, prescription drugs for Medicare, the minimum wage, \nclosing the gun show loophole. We do not have time for those things, we \nare told, but we have plenty of time for the things the majority wants \nto do. We have plenty of time to decide to repeal the estate tax \ncompletely, including repeal for the largest estates in the country. Do \nmy colleagues know what that will do on average to an estate above $20 \nmillion? It will provide about a $12 million tax cut for the estate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator telling me we could give estate tax \nreform, virtually exempt all family farms, all small businesses--say \nyour business is worth $8 million or less; you are not going to pay a \ntax on it; families with assets of $4 million would not pay an estate \ntax--and still then have the resources to provide for a prescription \ndrug benefit if we refuse to go along with the Republican approach \nwhich gives this estate tax break to the very wealthiest in America, \nthose in the multimillion-dollar, maybe even billion-dollar category?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Illinois, that is exactly the \ncase. In fact, one of the proposals we offer as an amendment that is \nprevented by the majority leader would provide an $8 million exemption \nfor a small business or small farm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished assistant majority \nleader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues from Illinois and \nNorth Dakota, we have rules in the Senate, and that is to go through \nthe Chair. The dialogs are interesting, but we are supposed to go \nthrough the Chair, and that has not happened in a while.\n  I want to correct some of the factual misstatements that were just \nmade. My colleagues said we want to bring up the repeal of the death \ntax and offer no amendments. That is not correct. We have told our \nfriends on the Democratic side that we will allow them to offer a \nsubstitute. They can have relevant amendments. We are willing to enter \ninto time agreements to pass this bill. Frankly, what they want to do \nis unload an agenda they cannot pass.\n  My colleagues mentioned that we will not allow them a debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We already voted on it a couple of times. We \nvoted on it last year, and we voted on it twice in the last month. The \nproblem is they have a flawed proposal that will not pass and cannot \npass.\n  We voted on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We voted on minimum wage. \nFor them to say, instead of voting to repeal the death tax, which we \nare hopefully going to do, they have a lot of other things on which \nthey would rather vote--we have given them votes on almost every issue \nthat has been mentioned. On the death tax, we have said--and I will \npropound a unanimous consent request--we will have an amendment on each \nside; we will have three amendments on each side; we will consider \ntheir alternatives.\n  My colleague from Illinois said let's have an exemption, not change \nthe rates; let's vote on this issue. We are willing to do that. The \nproblem is our colleagues on the Democratic side really do not want a \ntax cut, period.\n  We are trying to eliminate the death tax so there will not be a tax \non death. What there will be is a tax on the sale of the property when \nwhomever inherits the property sells it. We will eliminate the taxable \nevent on someone's death. This is a very significant and I believe one \nof the most positive things we can do if we want to help the economy, \nif we want fairness.\n  We are trying to help the small business people, the Democrats say; \nthe Democrats are willing to do that. Hogwash. I used to run a small \nbusiness. I did not want it to be small; I wanted it to be big. I do \nnot know if it would meet the Democrats' definition. A lot of us really \ndo believe we should eliminate the tax on someone's death and turn it \ninto a taxable event when the property is sold. If individuals who \nreceive this business or receive this property do not sell it, there \nwill not be a taxable event. When they do sell it, there will be a tax, \nand that tax will be capital gains. That tax rate is 20 percent, not 39 \npercent, not 55 percent.\n  I want to correct a misstatement just made. We are willing to enter \ninto time agreements. We are willing to consider\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nrelative amendments, substitutes. If they want to have a substitute \nthat has an exemption, fine; let's vote on it. If they want to vote on \nan alternative, let's do it. We are willing to do it. But to say we are \nnot willing to consider amendments and that it is ``take our proposal \nthat passed the House''----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. In a moment I will.\n  The facts are, the cost over 10 years, which is the most we ever use, \nis $104 billion. I heard them say it is $750 billion. I do not know \nfrom where they are grabbing these figures. If we use that kind of \nanalogy, it would be fun to see how much the tax increase of 1993 cost \nbecause if this tax cut is $750 billion over the next 20-some-odd \nyears, I would hate to think how much the cost of the tax increase the \nDemocrats passed in 1993 is.\n  The facts are, the estate tax repeal is $104 billion over the next 10 \nyears. That is what passed the House. Hopefully, that is  what the \nSenate will pass today, tomorrow, or in the near future.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not on my time. I will be happy to yield under the \nSenator's time. I only had 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Can I take 30 seconds?\n  Mr. REID. I yield Senator Dorgan 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I respectfully say that the Senator from Oklahoma is not \naccurate when he says that his side is willing to entertain amendments; \nI do not see a problem here; let's bring it on and have amendments and \na discussion. That is exactly what the majority leader has denied. That \nis exactly what the majority leader said he will not allow to happen on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma is speaking for the majority leader on \nthis issue, I say get the Democratic leader on the line, make an \nagreement, and let's have this issue on the floor where some amendments \ncan be offered and votes taken, and we will see how people feel about \nthe estate tax.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is not accurate in leaving the impression \nthat this has been a reasonable circumstance here and they are willing \nto entertain all kinds of amendments. That is not the case at all. In \nfact, our side has offered a reasonable number of amendments with time \nagreements, and the majority leader has said no, and that is the fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I said the majority leader, to my \nknowledge, is willing to enter into a time agreement and has given it \nto the minority leader. It said we will have relevant amendments. I \nhave a list of amendments on prescription drugs, long-term health care, \nMedicare, retirement--in other words, a lot of things on the Democrats' \nagenda that have not been accomplished.\n  I said relevant amendments pertaining to the death tax and, \nunfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have not been willing to \ncomply or agree. I had hoped we would have had a little less partisan \nexchange on a Tuesday morning. Let's go back to the Cloakroom and come \nup with two or three relevant amendments dealing with this issue and \nvote. That is the way we should work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Do I have time remaining on the 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, there is nothing \npartisan in my intent to correct the impression left by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I was simply saying that proposals have been made on the \nspecific number of amendments and time agreements by our side and the \nmajority leader has rejected them.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma seemed to suggest they are willing to \nentertain this, that, and the other thing; they are very reasonable; \nthey will accept amendments. I was simply trying to correct a \nmisimpression. I did not intend to be partisan.\n  This is an important issue. There are differences in how we view the \nissue. I happen to think we should change the estate tax so no small \nbusiness or family farm ever gets caught in its web. We can do that. An \n$8 million or $10 million exemption would mean that virtually no family \nfarm or small business ever would get caught in the web of the estate \ntax. But I do not happen to believe we should totally exempt the \nlargest estates in this country from the estate tax. That is the \ndifference.\n  Let's debate that difference and have amendments on the choices and \nmake judgments as a Senate. It is not my intent ever to be partisan \nabout this issue, but I want the right information to be given, and the \nright information is that we offered limited amendments and limited \ntime agreements, and they were rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Nickles made the point that the \namendments the minority have sought to bring up have nothing to do with \nrepeal of the death tax. That is why the majority leader said he will \nenter into an agreement with them but let's make it relevant and \ngermane to the issue before the Senate.\n  When the American people see us going through these charades, I \nwonder how they can have any confidence in a body that seems to be so \npartisan and intent on changing the subject.\n  We have one subject before us today: repeal of the death tax. It is \nthe House bill that passed overwhelmingly. Why can't we simply consider \nthis bill with relevant and germane amendments? Why do we have to get \noff into prescription drugs and the rest?\n\n  Our distinguished colleague from North Dakota has said there is an \nalternative with respect to the repeal of the death tax. I would like \nto take that on because it relies on a section of the code today that \nis absolutely unworkable. Two-thirds of the cases that have been \nbrought with respect to this section of the code have been won by the \nIRS. It does not work. Try to qualify, if you are a small business or a \nfarm, under the section that they are taking about; you are not going \nto get relief. It is a sham proposal.\n  You can raise the exemption all you want, but if the definition \nprecludes you from qualifying, you have not gained a thing. I can't \nwait to debate the alternative that the members of the minority want to \npropose. I will agree, right now, to consider that as an amendment that \nwe would vote on here. If we can agree to consider that, we can move \nright on to the consideration of the death tax repeal because the \nprovision they are talking about is unworkable, it is unfair, and it \nwill not provide an adequate alternative to the repeal of the death tax \nthat is called for under H.R. 8, the House-passed bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion so we can get on \nwith the debate about how we can finally bring an end to this most \nunfair and pernicious section of the Tax Code.\n  I welcome a debate of any germane alternative that members of the \nminority would like to present because I think when you hold them up \nside by side, H.R. 8 will win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which \noverwhelmingly passed in the House by a vote of 279-136. I point out \nthat it was a bipartisan vote. It included 65 Democrats. So this \nlegislation that we are about to proceed to has significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is an historic opportunity to repeal the onerous estate and gift \ntaxes which currently have rates as high as 60 percent. In an age of \nsurpluses where taxpayers are, indeed, paying too much, it is time to \nrepeal the estate and gift taxes. Families who toil all their lives to \nbuild a business and diligently save and invest should not be penalized \nfor their hard work when they die. Their assets were already taxed at \nleast once--and it is unconscionable that their estates are taxed again \nat rates as high as 60 percent on the value of their assets at the time \nof their death.\n  This bill would address this problem.\n  I point out, we have held hearings on estate taxes in the Finance \nCommittee as of the last Congress. It is the Finance Committee that is \nthe committee of jurisdiction.\n  I also point out, this bill is substantially similar to the estate \ntax provisions in the tax bill that was vetoed by\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nthe President last year. Some may ask why this House bill did not come \nthrough the Finance Committee. The reason is that the bill holds to the \nestate tax provisions the House and Senate agreed to last year. Since \nthe Finance Committee has already debated and approved these provisions \nand we have negotiated these provisions with the House, I saw no need \nto delay the bill in the committee and perhaps kill the chance of \nrepealing the tax.\n  Now, I would like to briefly go through the bill before us. I point \nout, there are really two time periods to which the bill applies. In \nthe first period, generally from 2001 to 2009, estate tax relief is \nprovided on several fronts. In the second period, beginning in 2010, \nthe entire estate and gift tax regime is repealed.\n  During the first part, from 2001 to 2009, the estate and gift tax \nrates are reduced on both the high end and low end. On the low end, \ncurrently, there is a unified credit that applies to the first $675,000 \nof an estate. That amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in 2006.\n  While current law provides some relief for the smallest estates, for \nmodest estates, those above the credit amount, a high tax rate applies. \nFor example, now a decedent's estate of $750,000 faces a tax rate of 37 \npercent on each dollar over the credit amount. Keep in mind that is \nwhere the rate starts. For larger estates, the rates can be as high as \n60 percent.\n  For the lower end estates, the bill converts the unified credit to an \nexemption. What this means is that estates right above the unified \ncredit amount will face tax rates starting at 18 percent rather than 37 \npercent. In other words, for modest size estates, this bill cuts the \ntax rate in half.\n  For the larger estates, some now facing marginal rates as high as 60 \npercent, the bill includes a phased in rate cut. The rates are reduced \nfrom the current regime, with its highest rate of 60 percent, down to a \ntop rate of 40.5 percent for the highest end estates. Please keep in \nmind that the base of the tax is property, not income, and the rate is \nstill above the highest income tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n  Prior to full repeal in 2010, the bill would also expand the estate \ntax rules for conservation easements to encourage conservation. In \naddition, the bill provides simplification measures for the generation \nskipping transfer tax.\n  In 2010, the whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed. At the \nsame time, a carryover basis regime is put in place instead of the \ncurrent law step up in basis. This means that all taxable estates--and \nI emphasize we are only talking about taxable estates--that now enjoy a \nstep up in basis will be subject to a carryover basis. Carryover basis \nsimply means that the beneficiary of the estate's property receives the \nsame basis as the decedent. For example, if a decedent purchased a farm \nfor $100,000, and the farm was worth $2 million at death, the tax basis \nin the hands of the heirs would be $100,000. The step in basis is \nretained for all transfers in an amount up to $1.3 million per estate. \nIn addition, transfers to a surviving spouse receive an additional step \nup of $3 million.\n  As I have already pointed out, the House passed the bill on a \nbipartisan basis with 65 Democrats voting in favor of repeal of the \nestate and gift taxes. Now is the Senate's opportunity to pass this \nbill on a bipartisan basis and send it to the President. It is my \nunderstanding this will be the only chance this year that we will have \nto pass this bill and repeal estate and gift taxes. If we fail, the \nbill dies. If we come together and vote in favor of the house bill--\nestate tax repeal that the Congress passed last year--it will go \ndirectly to the President for his signature.\n\n  Our family-owned businesses and farms must not be denied this relief. \nThis should not be a partisan issue.\n  Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal \nof estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With \nroughly $2 trillion of estimated non-social security surpluses over the \nnext 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of \nrepealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only \nabout 5 percent of the projected budget surplus. Other than being a \nmoney grab--estate and gift taxes do not serve any legitimate purpose.\n  Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least \nonce. Our Nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works \nhard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and \ngift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished chairman have as much time as he requires to finish his \naddress, which I see is not much longer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote scheduled \nfor 10:15 be delayed until the Senator from Delaware and the Senator \nfrom New York have time to finish their statements. They are both \nmanaging this bill and should have an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I was saying, the estate and gift taxes \nare a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated. I believe it is \nthe right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \nmotion to proceed to this bill to repeal the estate and gift taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as a New Yorker--and I am sure my \nesteemed chairman will understand--I rise in defense of Theodore \nRoosevelt's estate tax: One of the great achievements at the beginning \nof this century and of the last century--although we have members of \nthe Finance Committee staff who still think we are in the last century, \nbut we won't get into that matter. Today, we are here to decide if a \ncentury later we should repeal it.\n  Again, I don't want to press this on my colleague and friend, the \nSenator from Delaware, but this matter should be in the Finance \nCommittee. My friend doesn't have to say a word. We are the Committee \nthat considers tax matters. It should have been referred to us and not \nsent directly to the floor.\n  When we begin the debate and the voting begins, the Democrats will \nhave an alternative. It is simple. I say forthwith and I will say no \nmore, it is less costly than the measure we have received from the \nHouse. We would increase the general exemption from the present \n$675,000 to $1 million immediately--it was scheduled to rise to that \nlevel in the year 2006--and then to $2 million in the year 2009. We \nwould increase the exemption for family-owned businesses and farms from \n$1.3 million to $2 million immediately and to $4 million by the year \n2009. This increase would eliminate the estate tax on virtually all \nfamily farms and 75 percent of family-owned businesses that would \notherwise be subject to the estate tax. This measure will cost $64 \nbillion over 10 years, roughly half the cost of the Republican \nproposal.\n  Of course, the measure the House has sent us, as our Chairman has \nstated, in the year 2010 repeals all estate taxes, and thereafter the \ntrue cost would be approximately $50 billion each year indefinitely.\n  We think this is an extravagant proposal driven by the legitimate \npolitics of the hour. I understand that. I understand the President \nwill veto the measure. I look forward confidently to its being passed \nand vetoed and not forgotten. It will be raised in the campaign. That, \ntoo, is legitimate.\n  But I have to say, sir, having lived on a farm for 36 years in \nupstate New York, the dairy farming world of that State has not \nprospered for half a century. We have a considerable number of meadows, \nin one of which the press gathered just a year ago last week to have \nMrs. Clinton announce her candidacy for the seat I have the honor to \nhold right now. There were hundreds of journalists there. It amazed the \nworld to look at it.\n  Sir, I have to suggest that if we had an equal gathering of family \nfarmers in New York State whose farms would sell for $2 million, the \nturnout would be desultory and the press would report disaster. Does \nanybody here know a family farmer whose farm is worth $2 million a \nyear? I don't mean farms in the eastern end of Long Island where \nviniculture takes place.\n  Mr. ROTH. I do.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. My dear and esteemed chairman says he knows a family \nfarmer whose farm is worth more than $2 million.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. In Delaware.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Therein, sir, lies the difference between the \nDemocratic and Republican parties. I know of no such farmer; my friend \nfrom Delaware does. What more can I say? How pleased I am for him; how \nregretful I am for the toil-driven, poverty-stricken farmers of upstate \nNew York.\n  With that, sir, the vote being announced 4 minutes late, I yield the \nfloor and suggest we proceed under the order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6408-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6408-S6415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Requests\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the Interior appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of the China PNTR legislation and that the first \namendment in order to the bill be Senator Thompson's China sanctions \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, obviously, \nthe PNTR bill is an extremely important bill. This body understands \nthat. Certainly those of us on this side of the aisle who have been the \nforce for expanding trade in this world, who have been basically the \nmajority vote of things the President has wished to do--for example, on \nthe African free trade agreement and on NAFTA, two areas where it was \nreally our side of the aisle that carried the ball for the \nadministration, as they tried to open our trade opportunities across \nthe world--are strongly supportive of the concept of PNTR.\n  But there is still a fair amount of work that has to be done before \nwe can bring it to the floor. Specifically, as was alluded to, there is \nthe Thompson amendment, which would be nice to be able to deal with \nindependent of PNTR. There are also other issues which we are going to \nhave to address before the PNTR is ripe for consideration.\n  So at this point I would have to object, although it is clearly the \nintention of our side of the aisle to bring up the PNTR issue and to \nhopefully pass it, as we did with NAFTA and as we did with the African \nfree trade agreement. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I hope the majority side will not object. \nPNTR transcends all other issues that are before the Senate. It is an \ninternational issue. It is a public policy, a foreign policy issue, one \nwhich clearly falls in the category of politics stopping at the water's \nedge.\n  This measure is monumental in its implications. It must pass. The \nsooner it passes, the better. Delay is danger. We all know that our \nrelations with China are extremely important but also tenuous. The more \nthis issue is delayed, the more likely it is that some untoward, \nunanticipated, unexpected event might occur which would deteriorate \nrelations between our two countries and make it more difficult to pass \na very needed piece of legislation.\n  I understand the majority's concern about scheduling, about \nappropriations bills, about other matters. But I strongly urge the \nmajority party and the leader of the majority party, who correctly sets \nthe schedule, to put politics beyond this, to put policy, public \ninterest, and national security above all the other concerns that are \nlegitimate here in the Senate because once PNTR is set for a vote this \nmonth, I predict that the logjam will break. It will be easier then to \ntake up other measures.\n  I very strongly urge the Senator from New Hampshire to pass the word \non to the majority leader, and others, of the importance of bringing \nthis bill up in July--this month, a date certain--so we can begin to \nestablish a relatively comprehensive and solid relationship with the \ncountry that is going to be probably one of the most important \ncountries that this country is going to be dealing with in this next \ncentury. It is absolutely critical.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior \nSenator from Montana for making the point again, with his unanimous \nconsent request this morning, that we are simply asking for a date \ncertain.\n  I am concerned that this issue, as was discussed and reported \nyesterday, could slip into September. If it slips into September, it \nmight not be considered at all. In September there will be little \nopportunity to confront what we know is going to be a difficult \nchallenge for us in terms of procedural factors in the consideration of \nthis legislation.\n  So I have a very deep concern about this legislation slipping. This \nneeds to be done this month. It ought to be done this week. We are \ngoing to continue to press for its consideration. I applaud the Senator \nfrom Montana in his willingness to do it.\n  There is an array of legislation that has been left undone. We will \ncall attention to those issues as often as we can to encourage and to \nwelcome the involvement and participation on the other side.\n  Another issue is the H-1B bill. It has been languishing now for a \nlong period of time. I have expressed a willingness to cut down the \namendments that we\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nknow are pending on the H-1B bill from the scores, maybe even over 100 \namendments that could be offered to 10 amendments with time limits--\nwith time limits. We would be willing to consider the H-1B bill with a \ntime limit on each amendment, taking it up as soon as possible, in an \neffort to get that legislation passed as well. For whatever reason, the \nmajority has continued to refuse to allow us consideration of the H-1B \nlegislation as well.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, the prescription drug bill, the minimum \nwage bill, education amendments, the juvenile justice legislation--\nthere is a legislative landfill, that gets larger and larger, in large \nmeasure because of the reluctance and outright opposition on the part \nof some of our colleagues on the other side to deal with these issues \nin a constructive manner in order that we may complete them yet this \nyear.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So, Mr. President, I again ask unanimous consent that \nupon the disposition of the Interior appropriations bill, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2045, the H-1B visa bill, that it be \nconsidered under the following time agreement: One managers' amendment; \nthat there be 10 relevant amendments per each leader in order to the \nbill; that relevant amendments shall include those related to H-1B, \ntechnology-related job training, education and access, and/or \nimmigration; that debate on those amendments shall be limited to 30 \nminutes, equally divided in the usual form, and that relevant second-\ndegree amendments be in order; that upon the disposition of the \namendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on final \npassage.\n  The unanimous consent request would allow us to complete the H-1B \nbill in one day--one day. So I am hoping our colleagues will agree to \nthis. I ask that unanimous consent at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the H-1B \nbill happens to be a priority of this side of the aisle. I would be \nhappy to move to this if we could move to the H-1B bill. Unfortunately, \nthe Democratic leader isn't proposing that we move to the H-1B bill. \nWhat the Democratic leader is proposing is that we move to an \nextraneous agenda attached to the H-1B bill, that we bring to this bill \ndebate on all sorts of issues which have no relevance to H-1B. In fact, \nwe have offered, on this side of the aisle, to bring up the H-1B bill \nwith relevant amendments. That has not been accepted by the other side \nof the aisle.\n  We are continuing to be agreeable to bringing up the H-1B bill with \nrelevant amendments. There is no question but that we should pass the \nH-1B bill. I do sense a touch of crocodile tears coming from the other \nside of the aisle because, as a practical matter, almost all the bills \nthat are listed as being held up, such as the education bill--the PNTR \nis a little different class, but the H-1B bill, for sure--are being \nheld up not because of the underlying bill, not because the underlying \nissue is in contest as to whether or not we should take it up--we are \nperfectly willing to take up those issues on this side of the aisle and \nhave propounded a series of unanimous consent requests to accomplish \nexactly that--but it is because there is a whole set of other agenda \nitems, which the Democratic leader has a right to and desires to bring \nup, but he cannot bring them up on those bills and then claim he is \nbringing up those bills, because he is not bringing up those bills; \nwhat he is bringing up is those bills plus an agenda as long as my arm \nof political issues that they wish to posture on for the next election.\n  If he wishes to bring up the H-1B bill with three relevant \namendments, or even five relevant amendments, on each side, we would be \nhappy to accept that type of approach.\n  I have to object to the present proposal, but I would be happy to \npropound a unanimous consent which limits discussion to relevant \namendments, if the Democratic leader is willing to pursue a course of \nbringing up H-1B with relevant amendments. On the proposal as laid out \nby the Democratic leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to respond, I don't know what would be \nnonrelevant about technology-related job training. Is that relevant to \nH-1B? Of course, it is. I don't know what would be nonrelevant about \ntechnology-related education amendments. What could be nonrelevant \nabout a technology-related education and access amendments? What is \nnonrelevant about immigration amendments? We are talking about the \npossibility of allowing 200,000 new immigrants to enter our country to \nwork. We want to offer amendments we feel are relevant to H-1B, and we \nare not allowed.\n  Senators want to be Senators. In the Senate, we offer amendments to \nbills. We want to get this legislation passed as well. In the true \ntradition of the Senate, we ought to be able to offer amendments, \nrelevant amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nthat is our position.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator's position is he is willing to allow \nrelevant amendments, then we can develop a unanimous consent request \nwhich says ``relevant amendments.'' Is that the Senator's position? The \nSenator just used the world ``relevant'' three times to describe the \namendments he would propound. Therefore, it should not be a problem for \nthe Senator to offer relevant amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Does the Senator from New Hampshire not think these \nissues are relevant?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I always allow the Parliamentarian to \ndetermine relevancy, as the Democratic leader has always allowed the \nParliamentarian to determine relevancy. That is why, when we use the \nterm ``relevant,'' if we both agree on the term ``relevant,'' let's put \nit in the unanimous consent request and move forward.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am more than happy to deal with relevant amendments. \nOf course, as the Senator from New Hampshire knows, according to the \nstrict definition of the word ``relevance,'' our amendments would have \nto be related specifically to H-1B. He is unwilling to talk about \nrelevant amendments as we understand it in the English language. Under \nthe common understanding of the English language, ``relevance'' would \nallow the consideration of an immigration-related amendment during the \nH-1B debate because the H-1B bill is an immigration bill. It would \nallow technology-related education amendments to be considered relevant \nto the H-1B bill in this context. Certainly, technology-related job \ntraining amendments would be ``relevant'' under our common \nunderstanding of that term, but you can hide behind those specific \ndefenses if you like. Again, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it the position of the Senator that the Senate does not \nfunction under the English language?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is the position of this Senator that the term \n``relevant'' fits the amendments that we have attempted to offer. Of \ncourse, the reason why our colleagues don't want to deal with these \nissues is not because they are not relevant. It is because they don't \nwant to vote on immigration issues. They don't want to vote on \neducation. They don't want to vote on technology-related job training. \nThey have a take-it-or-leave-it approach to consideration of important \nlegislation such as this.\n  We can go back to the time when they were in the minority. Relevance \nwas never a question then for them. Then relevance was something they \nconsidered and accorded the right of every Senator, just as we are now \nadvocating. We are talking about relevance. We are talking about the \nimportance of relevant amendments.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In response to the Senator, one of the amendments is to \ntry to make sure that in the future there is going to be adequate \ntraining so we are not going to have to offer these jobs necessarily to \nimmigrants, but they would be available to Americans who do not have \nthose skills. To make an argument on the floor of the Senate that we \nare going to deny American workers the kind of training\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nto get these high-paying jobs and participate in the expanding economy \nis just preposterous. That evidently is what the Senator from New \nHampshire is doing. That is one of the key amendments that has been \nobjected to by the Republicans.\n  This is what we are trying to do, to have training programs that are \nbasically structured or organized, or education in the computer \nsciences through the National Science Foundation, through existing \ntraining programs so that we are not duplicating other training \nprograms. It has been objected to.\n  I commend our leader. These are common sense amendments to an issue \nwhich can mean a great deal in an expanding economy and can make a \ngreat difference to American workers.\n  I cannot understand--I do understand because I think the Senator has \nbeen correct--why our Republican friends are constantly objecting to \ncommon sense measures which are absolutely relevant and absolutely \nessential in terms of the H-1B issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. He \nsaid it so eloquently. This is a relevance issue. Whether or not we \ncontinue to allow immigrants who come in to meet certain skill demands \nin this country is directly relevant to whether or not we are going to \nhave an educated workforce. It is directly relevant to whether or not \nwe are going to put the resources forward to train American workers in \norder to ensure that we might someday fill these jobs with workers from \nthis country. If that is not relevant, I really don't know what is.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota \nyielding. Since the Senator from New Hampshire wants to discuss the \nmeaning of the term ``relevant,'' as the Senator from New Hampshire \nknows, the rules of the Senate have words that are used and interpreted \nin very narrow and unique ways. The term ``relevant'' has a very narrow \nmeaning here in the Senate by which we make a judgment about which \namendments might be in order. But the term ``relevant'' is not related \nto common sense, in the Senate at least.\n  Let me give an example. On the issue we were talking about this \nmorning, the estate tax repeal proposed by our friends on the other \nside of the aisle, the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans would benefit to \nthe tune of $250 billion in 10 years. Now, if one says, as they \npropose, let's give a $250 billion tax exemption to the 400 wealthiest \nAmericans as identified in Forbes magazine, and if we say, we have \nanother idea for that tax repeal--instead of giving that tax relief to \nthe 400 wealthiest Americans, let us instead give it to middle-income \nfamilies with an enlarged tax credit for tuition so they can send their \nkids to college; or let us widen the 15-percent bracket to enable more \nfamilies to take advantage of that low rate; or let us enact a \nprescription drug benefit for people who need prescription drug \ncoverage--in short, if we propose a different way to use that revenue \nthat in our view would be more effective and more important, we are \ntold that is not relevant. You can't offer that, we hear. That is not \nrelevant.\n  Of course it is relevant. My colleague just talked about common \nsense. Someone once described common sense as genius dressed in work \nclothes. There is no common sense on the issue of relevancy with \nrespect to the Senate rules. Yet that is exactly the shield behind \nwhich they want to hide on these issues.\n\n  We have a right to offer amendments. We have a right to offer \namendments that relate to the subject at hand. The proposal by the \nmajority side is to prevent us from that opportunity. Our reaction to \nthat is, ``Nonsense.'' We have a right to do that. We have an absolute \nright to do that, as Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, let me end by \nsaying again, I am disappointed.\n  I note the Senator from New Hampshire offered a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution relating to Social Security on the Commerce-State-Justice \nbill in the last Congress. There was no concern then about whether it \nwas relevant or not. Our distinguished majority leader offered an \namendment relating to prayer in schools and at memorial services on the \njuvenile justice bill last year. Again, there was no concern about \nrelevance. Senator Helms offered an amendment that some of us may \nrecall having to do with a patent for the Daughters of the Confederacy \non the community service bill. He also offered a Lithuanian \nindependence resolution on the Clean Air Act. Senator Nickles offered \nan amendment to require a supermajority for tax increases on the \nunemployment insurance extension. Senator Roth has offered tax cuts on \nappropriations bills.\n  There is a lot of interesting history having to do with relevance and \namendments that may or may not pertain directly to the bill under \nSenate consideration. That is all we are asking.\n  What is even more noteworthy is the fact that we are willing to limit \nourselves to 10 amendments with time limits. You can't do much better \nthan that. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we \ncould accommodate our distinguished colleagues in the past when they \nhave offered amendments, certainly they should accommodate us. That is \nwhy the relevancy issue is so important here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the issue being debated and brought forward \nby the minority leader was that he wanted to take up and discuss H-1B. \nThe presentation was for the purpose, at least formally it appeared, of \ntaking up the H-1B issue. We are willing to take up the H-1B issue. And \nwe are willing to do it with relevant amendments. Now, the other side \nsays that is not the English language and it is not common sense to use \nthe term ``relevant.'' That term has been used for the past 200 years \nin this body, and I think it is reasonable to continue to use it.\n\n  On a number of occasions, we have presented unanimous consent \nrequests asking that we be allowed to take up the H-1B legislation with \nrelevant amendments. In fact, the Democratic leader said specifically \nthat the amendments he was talking about would be relevant. He used the \nterm ``relevant.'' I understand that was more in the context of not \nnecessarily the Senate, but in any event he used the term ``relevant.''\n  Right now, I am going to propound a unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, to proceed to Calendar No. \n490, S. 2045, the H-1B legislation, and it be considered under the \nfollowing limitations:\n  Three relevant amendments per each leader in order to the bill; No \nother amendments in order other than second-degree amendments which are \nrelevant to the first-degree amendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove amendments, the bill be read the third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The purpose of this unanimous consent request is to bring up the H-1B \nvisa issue, which I believe should be brought to the floor with \nrelevant amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \ncertainly made clear that in 1 day we would totally complete the debate \non this legislation. Under the unanimous consent agreement we have \noffered, in 1 day we would be completed with H-1B. In fact, in the time \nwe have spent procedurally trying to get this done, we would have \nalready finished two amendments.\n  I think we would be much better off treating the Senate as the \nSenate. My friend from New Hampshire said for 200 years there has been \na meaning of ``relevance'' in the Senate. Of course, that is true. It \nhas changed under different precedents that have been set, but we think \nthe one thing that has not changed--but they are trying very hard to \nchange it--is how debate proceeds in the Senate. We are willing to even \nchange how we feel we should proceed. We believe H-1B should be brought \nup and that debate should be completed on it. We would be through with \nthat probably in 2 days. We are willing to cut that back to 1 day. I \nrespectfully say that I object and I offer again, without restating it, \nthe unanimous consent request.\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New \nHampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest to my friend from New Hampshire \nthat he strongly consider the agreement we have offered--that H-1B be \nbrought up and debate be completed in 1 day. That is what we should do. \nIt would be better for the Senate and for the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate on the motion to proceed on the bill \nunder cloture, with 30 hours of debate for consideration.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend this, without his losing the \nfloor. There are a number of Senators here to speak postcloture and \ndebate the motion to proceed. Perhaps, we can agree on some order that \npeople could speak. On your side, you have seven Senators and we have \nabout the same number. Each person is entitled to 1 hour. People on our \nside would be willing--with the exception of one Senator--to take 30 \nminutes. I wonder if it is agreeable.\n  Mr. ROTH. Thirty minutes a person?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, instead of the 1 hour to which they are entitled. I \nwonder if you would agree to alternate back and forth--the majority and \nminority.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think we can agree to alternate back and forth; but as to \nwho, at this time, we are not certain in what order. I will go ahead, \nand why don't we have some informal discussions to see how we proceed \nafter that?\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate. In the meantime, our people will \nspeak.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the majority \nleader's motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of \n2000, which overwhelmingly passed in the House by a vote of 279-136. As \nI pointed out before, that vote of 279 included 65 Democrats. So it \nwas, indeed, a bipartisan vote in support of this legislation.\n  Before going into the details of the legislation, I'd like to talk \nabout the rationale for this bill and the debate around it.\n  Some ask why are we concerned about the death tax. Only 2 percent of \nestates pay the tax. Many of those taxpayers have the resources to \nminimize the tax. Even if they have to pay the tax at rates approaching \n60 percent, the balance of the estate is available for the \nbeneficiaries. The other 98 percent of estates need not worry about it. \nThose in this position also argue that the revenue raised by the estate \ntax is better spent on Federal programs than kept by the children.\n  I guess it all depends on your perspective. The opponents of death \ntax repeal look at an estate as a thing, such as money or property, \ndetached from the person that created it. From their view, it is a \nvaluable resource for an ever-expanding Federal Government.\n  There is another view. If you look behind the statistics and revenue \nfigures, you will see an estate as something that represents a lifetime \nof actions by the individuals and families. Every day a person makes \ndecisions to sacrifice, work harder, and save. And every day these \nhardworking families are taxed on what they earn. Over a lifetime, this \ndaily dedication adds up. It is natural that the families who created \nthe wealth, by a lifetime of working hard and paying taxes, would want \nthe benefit of their work to go to their families. That is, to stay \nwithin the family rather than be broken up and sent to Washington.\n  I take this latter view. Coming from a small state, like Delaware, I \nmeet a lot of small business people and farmers. Everybody knows how \nhard these folks work, and if they are successful, they are in the \nposition to pass along a family business or farm to their families. The \ndeath tax is a serious obstacle to these family farmers and small \nbusiness people. Not only is a major portion of their hard work taken \nby the Federal Government, and spent here in Washington, DC, but the \nneed for cash to pay the tax often ends up causing a sale of the farm \nor small business.\n  It is this fundamental unfairness, with particular grief inflicted on \nfamily farms and small business at the worst possible time, that, I \nbelieve, has resulted in bipartisan support for repealing the death \ntax. Nine Senate Democrats and 65 House Democrats, better than 20% of \nthe Democratic caucuses of each body, support repeal of the death tax.\n  You're going to hear that family farmers and small businesses are \nalready protected from the current death tax. Thanks to the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, we, on this side of the aisle, won a hard fought \nconcession for estate and gift tax relief. Under that legislation, a \nfamily farm or small business couple can shield up to $2.6 million, on \na phased in basis, from the death tax. Since that legislation became \nlaw, however, I have heard that the provision is technically and \npractically difficult for family farmers and small businesses to use. \nIt seems that the better and simpler approach is to rid our family \nfarmers and small businesses of the burden of this tax.\n  I'd like to turn to the bill before us.\n  The bill is substantially similar to the estate tax provisions in the \ntax bill that was vetoed by the President last year. Some may ask why \nthis House bill did not come through the Finance Committee. The reason \nis that the bill holds to the estate tax provisions the House and \nSenate agreed to last year. Since the Finance Committee has already \ndebated and approved these provisions and we have negotiated these \nprovisions with the House, I saw no need to process the bill in the \ncommittee.\n  There are really two time periods to which the bill applies. In the \nfirst period, generally from 2001 to 2009, estate tax relief is \nprovided on several fronts. In the second period, beginning in 2010, \nthe whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed.\n  During the first part, from 2001 to 2010, the estate and gift tax \nrates are reduced on both the high end and low end. On the low end, \ncurrently, there is a unified credit that applies to the first $675,000 \nof an estate. That amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in 2006.\n  While current law provides some relief for the smallest estates, for \nmodest estates, those above the credit amount, a high tax rate applies. \nFor example, now a decedent's estate of $750,000 faces a tax rate of 37 \npercent on each dollar over the credit amount. Keep in mind that's \nwhere the rate starts. For larger estates, the rates can be as high as \n60 percent.\n  For the lower-end estates, the bill converts the unified credit to an \nexemption. What this means is that estates right above the unified \ncredit amount, will face tax rates starting at 18 percent rather than \n37 percent. In other words for modest size estates, this bill cuts the \ntax rate in half.\n  For the larger estates, some now facing marginal rates as high as 60 \npercent, the bill includes a phased in rate cut. The rates are reduced \nfrom the current regime, with its highest rate of 60 percent, down to a \ntop rate of 40.5 percent for the highest end estates. Keep in mind that \nthe base of the tax is property, not income, and the rate is still \nabove the highest income tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n  Prior to full repeal in 2010, the bill would also expand the estate \ntax rules for conservation easements to encourage conservation. In \naddition, the bill provides some simplification measures for the \ngeneration skipping transfer tax.\n  In 2010, the whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed. At the \nsame time, a carryover basis regime is put in place instead of the \ncurrent law step up in basis. This means that all taxable estates--\nagain, I want to emphasize the words ``taxable estates''--that now \nenjoy a step up in basis will be subject to carryover basis. Carryover \nbasis simply means that the beneficiary of the estate's property \nreceives the same basis as the decedent. For example, if a decedent \npurchased a farm for $100,000 and the farm was worth $2,000,000 at \ndeath, the tax basis in the hands of the heirs would be $100,000. The \nstep in basis is retained for all estates in an amount of up to $1.3 \nmillion per estate. In addition, transfers to a surviving spouse would \nreceive an additional step up in the amount of $3 million.\n  The House passed the bill on a bipartisan basis with 65 Democrats \nvoting in favor of repeal of the estate and gift taxes. Now is the \nSenate's opportunity to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and send \nit to the President. It is my understanding this will be the only \nchance this year that we will have to pass this bill and repeal estate \nand gift taxes. If we fail, the bill dies. If we\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\ncome together and vote in favor of the House bill--estate tax repeal \nthat the Congress passed last year--it will go directly to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Our family owned businesses and farms must not be denied this relief. \nThis should not be a partisan issue.\n  Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal \nof estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With \nroughly $2 trillion of estimated non-Social Security surpluses over the \nnext 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of \nrepealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only \nabout 5 percent of the projected budget surplus.\n  Other than being a money grab--estate and gift taxes do not serve any \nlegitimate purpose. They certainly don't keep people from dying.\n  Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least \nonce. Our nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works \nhard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and \ngift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated. It \nis the right thing to do, and it is the right thing to do now.\n  It has been said that there are only two certainties: death and \ntaxes. The two are bad enough, but leave it to the Federal Government \nto find a way to make them worse by adding them together. This is \nprobably the worst example of adding insult to injury ever devised. Yet \nWashington perpetuates over and over again on hard working families who \nhave already paid taxes every day they have worked.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the discussion \nby the Senator from Delaware. This is an issue brought to the floor of \nthe Senate by those folks who believe that the estate tax ought to be \nrepealed over the next 10 years--that it ought to be phased in and \nrepealed completely.  They call it a death tax.\n\n  There are some things we agree with and other things on which we \ndon't agree. Let me discuss an area of agreement. I think most Members \nof Congress believe the estate tax ought to be reformed in a manner \nthat prevents a small business or family farm that is being passed from \nthe parents to the children from having some sort of crippling estate \ntax apply to that transfer. I think almost all Members agree that \nshould not happen. We want to encourage the transfer of a family farm \nand a small business to the children. We want to encourage parents \ngiving their family farm or small business to their children to operate \nand keep that small business open. To do that, we ought to provide a \nspecific exemption for family farms and small businesses. We provide \nsuch an exemption now in current law, but it is not high enough. We \nought to make it high enough so no family farm or small business gets \ncaught in this web.\n  I propose $10 million. In fact, I cosponsored a piece of legislation \nauthored by the Senator from Oklahoma a couple of years ago that had a \n$10 million ceiling in it with respect to the estate tax applied to a \nfamily farm or small business. We can increase the exemption so as to \nmake sure no one has to worry about the interruption of the operation \nof a farm or small business. That is not rocket science. We can do \nthat.\n  That is not the issue here. We want to offer an amendment to do that. \nIf we ever get the estate tax repeal bill on the floor, we will offer \nan amendment that would say, ``Let's not repeal it; let's instead \nprovide a substantial increase in the exemption so family farms and \nsmall businesses are not hit with an estate tax.'' So that question is \noff the table.\n  The question now is, will some sort of estate tax remain? In the \nnewspaper this morning there is a story about a fellow worth about $900 \nmillion, a big investor-type from New York. I will not use his name. He \nis using his personal money to spend $20 million on television \nadvertising between now and the November election on the issue of \neducation, particularly the issue of vouchers with respect to \neducation.\n  It is his right to do that. Here is a person who amassed a fortune of \n$900 million, according to the newspaper, a terrific amount of money. \nHe is just short of a billionaire. If that person at some point should \ndie--and of course, everyone does--and that person's son or daughter \ngets an inheritance of $500 million because of the estate tax, who will \nstand on the floor and say shame on Congress for taking away part of \nthat estate through an estate tax.\n  The question is, Are there some in this country at the upper scale of \nincome and wealth whom we should expect to be able to pay an estate \ntax? They have lived in this wonderful country, enjoyed the bounty of \nbeing an American, been able to become a millionaire, a billionaire. \nThe wealthiest 400 people, according to Forbes magazine, would get a \n$250 billion tax windfall in estate tax reductions under the proposal \nfor complete repeal. There were 309 billionaires in the United States \nin 1999. More than one half of the billionaires in the world live in \nthe United States. That is not a bad thing. That is a good thing. That \nis wonderful. What a great economy. What a great place to live and work \nand invest.\n  However, we have in this country a tax on estates. The majority has \nproposed eliminating the tax altogether, repealing it completely. \nAccording to the Treasury Department, when fully phased in, in the \nsecond 10 years, this would reduce federal revenues by $750 billion. We \non the other hand have proposed to make changes in the estate tax to \nprovide a sufficient exemption so that no family farm or small business \nis caught in the web of estate taxes. But we also believe that we ought \nto retain the revenue from some of the largest estates currently taxed \nin order to evaluate other possible uses for that revenue.\n  Incidentally, the motion to proceed to this is a debate about \nproceeding to this or something else. Is total repeal of the estate tax \nthe only thing that represents a priority in Congress? How else might \nwe use this money, $250 billion, that under the present proposal would \ngo to the wealthiest 400 people in our country? How else might we use \nthat $250 billion? What about giving it to working families in the form \nof a tax break, an increased tax credit for college tuition to help \nparents send their kids to school?\n  That seems reasonable to me. Or what about the possibility of using \npart of it to help pay down the Federal debt? During tough times, if we \nhave run the Federal debt up to $5.7 trillion, how about during good \ntimes paying it down again? Perhaps we could use part of this revenue \nto pay down the debt. Or what about the proposition to use part of this \nrevenue to provide a prescription drug benefit for those who are on \nMedicare? Those Americans who reach their senior years and have the \nlowest incomes of their lives are now discovering that the miracle \ndrugs they need to extend and improve their lives are not available to \nthem all too often because they cannot afford them. The drugs are \npriced out of reach.\n  Senior citizens have told me in hearings that when they go to the \ngrocery store they go to the back of the store first because that is \nwhere they sell the prescription drugs. That is where the pharmacy is. \nThey must go to the back of the grocery store to buy their prescription \ndrugs to deal with their diabetes and their heart trouble and arthritis \nbecause only then will they know, after they have paid for the \nprescription drugs they need, only then will they know how much money \nthey have to buy food. Only then will they know how much money they \nhave left to eat.\n  What about using some of that estate tax revenue to provide a \nprescription drug benefit for the Medicare program rather than $250 \nbillion for the richest 400 Americans?\n  The majority party has said: We intend to demand the repeal of the \nestate tax by bringing a bill to the floor, and we don't want to mess \naround with your amendments. In fact, the narrow crevice here in the \nSenate on relevancy would say it is not relevant for my colleague, the \nSenator from Illinois, to offer an amendment and say we are debating \nthe repeal of $250 billion of tax obligation to the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans, so I have another idea on what we ought to do with that $250 \nbillion. I propose we use it to provide a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program. It would only require part of that revenue. But \nthat is his idea.\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\n  Under the narrow rules of the Senate, the majority says that is not \nrelevant. We are not within the relevancy rules of the Senate, so we \nhave no right to offer that idea. We have no right to offer that \namendment.\n  We will and should have a longer and expanded debate about this \nissue. If we have the opportunity to offer amendments and have up-or-\ndown votes on issues, we will have an opportunity to take away, \nforever, the proposition that small businesses or family farms are \ngoing to be caught with an estate tax. We will offer an amendment that \nprovides a threshold beyond which no family farms or small businesses \nwill be ever threatened by an estate tax.\n  That is not going to be the issue. The issue is much narrower than \nthat. It is, Should we give up the revenue derived from an estate tax \napplied to the wealthiest estates in America? Should we give up revenue \nthat could be used for other things, including reducing the Federal \ndebt, providing middle-income tax relief, providing prescription drug \nbenefits, or other urgent needs, or should we only decide our priority \nfor the $250 billion is to relieve the tax burden on the estate of the \nwealthiest Americans? That is the question.\n  The question we are dealing with this morning is a motion to proceed \nto this issue. Proceed to what? Proceed to the estate tax repeal. Shall \nwe proceed to debate the estate tax repeal? I have another idea. How \nabout proceeding to debate the issue of prescription drugs in the \nMedicare program?\n  That is a bigger priority for me at the moment. Let's get that done. \nWe have a very limited time between now and the middle of October when \nthis Congress will complete its work. Let's proceed to do a Patients' \nBill of Rights that gives real protection to patients in the health \ncare system. Let's enact one that would say to a patient: You have a \nright to understand every option for your medical treatment--not just \nthe cheapest --every option for your medical treatment; you have a \nright to that.\n  Some say we have debated that. Yes, we debated it and passed a \npatients' bill of goods, not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a hollow \nvessel. Let's get that back to the floor. Let's have a vigorous and \naggressive debate. Let's have a discussion about the issues we have \nraised.\n  Let's have a discussion about the woman who was hiking in the \nShenandoah mountains and fell off a 40-foot cliff and was taken to an \nemergency room with a concussion in a coma and multiple broken bones. \nAfter substantial medical treatment, she survived, only to be told by \nher HMO: We are not going to cover your emergency room treatment \nbecause you did not get prior approval to go to the emergency room.\n  This is a woman who was hauled in on a gurney in a coma and did not \nhave prior approval for emergency room treatment. Let's talk about \nthat.\n  Let's talk about a young boy named Ethan whose physical therapy was \ncut off. He was born with cerebral palsy, and it was judged by a \nmanaged care physician, or a managed care accountant, perhaps, that he \nhad only a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 and that was \n``insignificant\": Therefore, the HMO said, we won't cover the \nrehabilitation therapy. Think about that. A 50-percent chance of \nwalking by age 5 for young Ethan was deemed ``insignificant'' and so \nthe HMO wouldn't cover his rehabilitation therapy. Let's talk about \nthat.\n  Pass a motion to proceed to a Patients' Bill of Rights, and we will \ntalk about these cases and these issues.\n  Let's talk about the young boy who died at the age 16. Senator Reid \nand I had a hearing in Nevada. The young boy's mother told the tragic \nstory. As she took her seat, she was crying and was holding aloft a \nlarge color picture of her 16-year-old son who had died, having been \ndenied the treatment he needed to fight his cancer by the managed care \norganization. She said with tears in her eyes, holding a picture of her \nson aloft: My son looked at me and said: Mom, how can they do this to a \nkid?\n  Let's have a motion to proceed to talk about those issues. That is a \npriority with me.\n  This question of a motion to proceed is a question about what is \nimportant, what are our priorities. I say bring a Patients' Bill of \nRights and have an aggressive, full debate. That issue has been in \nconference, and the conference has not moved a bit. The last time I \nmentioned that one of my colleagues protested: Oh, we have made a lot \nof progress. Month after month there has been no progress at all. When \nI heard that, I told him at least glaciers move an inch or two a year. \nThere is no evidence that conference is alive. On a Patients' Bill of \nRights, nothing is happening.\n  But, boy, take the estate tax repeal, just give some people around \nhere a whiff of providing some big tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans \nand, all of a sudden, it is as if they had an industrial strength \nVitamin B-12 shot. There is nothing but scurrying around this Chamber. \nBoy, are they excited.\n  We are excited about some other things. In fact, there are plenty of \nideas for middle-income-tax relief. If we want to talk about tax cuts, \nwe should be cautious because economists really do not have the \nfoggiest idea what is going to happen 2, 4, 6, 10 years from now. They \njust do not know. We have been through a period in which we think this \neconomy will never go into reverse; we think the business cycle has \nbeen repealed. It has not. We are going to go through periods of \ncontraction, and we are going to continue to have economic conditions \nthat we cannot predict. So we ought to be cautious about predictions of \nlarge, unrelenting surpluses.\n\n  Nonetheless, if we have surpluses in the future that are as generous \nas now predicted, it is perfectly reasonable for us to be talking about \nsome targeted tax cuts that will make a real difference in the lives of \npeople. There are plenty of such areas; repealing the estate tax for \nthe wealthiest Americans does not rank high among them.\n  Yes, getting rid of the estate tax for family farms and small \nbusiness does rank high. We are prepared to offer that amendment. If \nour amendment is adopted, we are not going to have the interruption of \na family farm or small business when it passes from parents to \nchildren.\n  As I indicated earlier, there are 309 billionaires in this country. \nMore than one-half of the billionaires--that is with a B--more than \none-half of the billionaires in the world live in the United States. \nGood for us and good for them. I am as delighted as I can be with all \nthat success. Many of them believe as I do that their estate ought to \nbear some estate tax when they die, and that estate tax, which we now \nreceive, can be used for some other productive investments.\n  Some have an idea--incidentally, I have worked on it some as well. My \ncolleague from Nebraska has worked on a proposal called KidSave, which \nwould invest in supplementary savings accounts for children. In fact, \nwe could develop a proposal which I have worked on that would in which \nthe largest estates bearing an estate tax would help provide a modest \npool of savings for every baby born in this country who then could \naccess those savings upon, for example, the completion of high school.\n  What a wonderful incentive it would be to say to people that if they \npay attention and do their homework and graduate from high school, a \nreward will be waiting for them. There are all kinds of ideas. But the \nonly idea that moves around this Chamber is an idea on that side of the \naisle that says we must repeal the entire estate tax and we must do it \nthrough a vote on this issue in this Chamber and we must do it by \ndenying the minority the opportunity to offer any significant \namendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his eloquence on this point. \nDoesn't it really come down to on whose side are you? For whom do you \ncome here to work? That is what my friend is saying. He is saying that \nif we did a fair alternative to the Republicans on this estate tax \nrepeal, we can take care of those small family businesses, the farms, \nthe people who have homes and have a lot of investment in them. We can \nessentially say only the very wealthiest, the ones who, frankly, owe a \nlot to the greatness of this Nation, the opportunity this Nation \nprovides, their heirs would pay something and they would still wind up \nwith millions and millions of dollars. My colleague is\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\nsaying, maybe even with a little bit of courage around here, we could \ntarget those funds to those who deserve to have the same shot.\n  I just held in my State of California a very important seminar, which \nwas a learning experience for me, on the cost of child care and the \navailability of important early education. What I learned is that in \nCalifornia, only one in five kids who need quality child care even has \na slot. For four out of five of the kids, there is not even a slot. And \nif one is lucky enough to have a chance at that slot, does my colleague \nknow what it costs? Almost as much as it does to go to a private \ncollege.\n  I applaud my friend and ask him this question: Isn't this motion to \nproceed really about whose side are we on around here? Are we on the \nside of the vast majority of the people who get up every day and work \nhard and want a little attention to their problems--prescription drugs, \nPatients' Bill of Rights, the things my friend has discussed, quality \neducation, quality child care--or those who earn in the billions, and I \nsay billions because that is really who is going to be impacted by this \nrepeal. I ask my friend that question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think the Senator from California is right. I was \nthinking also about the alternatives. We have had a lot of discussion \nand will have, I assume, a great deal more discussion on the ability to \npass a family farm on to the children, and I certainly support that.\n  I want to have an exemption that will prevent the estate tax from \nsnaring in its web the passage of the family farm from parents to \nchildren.\n  I will say to my friends who raise these issues, if you want to help \nfamily farmers, we have an amendment that will enable you to do that. \nBut then you go further and say: We want to provide the richest 400 \npeople in America a $250 billion tax break during the second 10 years. \nThat is triple the amount of money each year that we now spend on the \nfarm program.\n  We have this Freedom to Farm bill which is just devastating family \nfarmers. Grain prices have collapsed. They have been collapsed for a \nlong time. Perhaps we could take just a third of the amount of money \nthey want to give in tax relief to the wealthiest estates in America--\njust a third of it--and say: Let's have a farm program that really \nkeeps family farmers on the farm. It is not a priority for some. See, \nthat is the problem.\n  It would be nice, for example--just in terms of what people think \npriorities are--if we could all go to an auction sale at some point. \nArlo Schmidt, an auctioneer in North Dakota --he is a wonderful \nauctioneer--told me about a young boy about 8 years old who came up and \ngrabbed him by the leg at the end of an auction sale.\n  This boy was the son of a farmer whose machinery and land were being \nsold. This little boy grabbed the auctioneer around his thigh and, with \ntears in his eyes, looked up at him, pointed at him, and said: You sold \nmy dad's tractor. This little boy was very angry. He said: You sold my \ndad's tractor. Arlo said: I patted him on the shoulder and tried to \ncalm him down a little bit. This was after the action was over. His \ndad's equipment was gone, and so on.\n  The little boy had none of this calming. The little boy, with tears \nin his eyes, said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big.\n  The point is, we have a lot of things happening in this country that \nrelate to family values and our economy and to what kind of country we \nare. One of them I care a lot about, because I come from a farm State, \nis the health of our family farmers and their ability to make a decent \nliving.\n  For those who would come to the Senate and say, let's get rid of the \nentire estate tax, I would say, regarding the wealthiest estates in our \ncountry, for you to flex your muscles and exert your energy to lift the \nburden of the estate tax from estates worth $1 billion, I do not \nunderstand it.\n  I do not understand it when we have so many other needs, such as the \nneed for income tax relief for middle-income families --not the wealthy \nestates--the need to enact a family farm program so the farmers have a \ndecent chance to make a living, the need to adopt a Patients' Bill of \nRights, the need to include a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nprogram--and do it soon. There are so many needs, and what you have \ndone is elevate the need for lifting the burden of the estate tax on \nthe largest estates in our country, saying: That is job No. 1. That is \nour priority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator made reference to an alternative to the \nRepublican proposal to eliminate the estate tax. I am reading from this \nalternative. I would like to have the comment of the Senator from North \nDakota. The Democratic alternative to change the estate tax would \nincrease the exemption from $1.3 million per couple to $2 million per \ncouple by 2002, and to $4 million per couple by 2010; meaning, if your \nestate is at $4 million, in the year 2010 you would not pay a single \npenny in estate taxes. This would eliminate the tax on two-thirds of \nthe estates currently subject to tax every year.\n  The Democratic alternative would also increase the family-owned \nbusiness exemption from $2.6 million per couple to twice that, of a \ngeneral exemption, to $4 million per couple by 2002 and $8 million per \ncouple by 2010. This would remove almost all family-owned farms and 75 \npercent of family-owned businesses from the estate tax rolls.\n  So the Democratic alternative eliminates two-thirds of the families \npaying estate taxes in America, 75 percent of the family-owned \nbusinesses, and virtually all of the family farms under the Democratic \nalternative, for a fraction of the cost of the Republican approach.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota has made it clear that the \npeople who are left at that point paying the estate tax, under the \nDemocratic approach, would include, if I have not mistaken his comment, \nthe Forbes top 400 wealthiest people in America. They would still be \npaying the estate tax.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota if I am not \nmistaken. Did he not say that the Republican approach, as opposed to \nthe Democratic approach, would mean for the top 400 wealthiest people \nin America, the Republican tax break would be $250 billion? Was that \nthe comment made by the Senator from North Dakota? It would be a $250 \nbillion tax break for 400 people in America? That is the Republican \npriority that they want to bring to the floor, and not consider \neverything else the Senator from North Dakota has raised?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  Let me give you another piece of information. The largest 374 estates \nwould get an average tax cut of $12.8 million. The largest 1,062 of the \nestates in this country--about five-hundredths of 1 percent of the \nestates--would get an estimated average tax cut of $7 million each.\n  The point isn't to say that having made money in this country is \nwrong or you should be penalized for it. That is not my point. My point \nis not that. This is a wonderful place in which some people do very \nwell. Many of them who do very well do so because they work day and \nnight. They have a certain genius --and good for them. There are \nothers, however, as all of us know, who are fortunate to inherit a \nsubstantial amount of money --and good for them as well.\n  But our proposition is simple enough; that on those largest estates \nin this country--I am talking about the very largest estates--should \nthere not be the retention of some basic estate tax to create some \nrevenue that can be used then to invest in the future of this country, \ninvest in its children, invest in its family farmers, invest in our \nsenior citizens? Because we now receive that revenue. If we decide to \nrepeal that revenue, the question is, measured against what? Is this \nthe most important, or are there other areas that are more important? \nThat is what we ought to be discussing.\n  That is why the motion to proceed, I think, is the place to discuss \nthis. We have on a postcloture motion a number of hours within which we \ncan discuss this issue. I hope my colleagues will also take some time.\n  I know it is popular to say: You know something, this is a death tax. \nThe reason they say that is they have pollsters who poll the words, and \nthey have discovered that if they use the words ``death tax,'' it is a \nkind of pejorative that allows people to believe: Well, OK, let's \nrepeal the death tax.\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\n  It is much more than that. It is a tax on a decedent's estate that \napplies at certain levels and at certain times. I would agree with the \nmajority party, if they say the exemption isn't high enough. It should \nbe much, much higher. We want to make it much higher. But I would not \nagree, and do not agree, if they say: Let us repeal the estate tax \nburden on the largest estates in this country.\n  Again, let me say that there are many who have amassed very \nsubstantial estates who believe we should not repeal the estate tax \nburden. Incidentally, a substantial amount of charitable giving in this \ncountry is stimulated by the presence of an estate tax. I would not use \nthat to justify its presence, but I would say that one additional \nresult of a total repeal for the largest estates will, I think, have a \nvery significant impact on foundations and charities in this country.\n  But we are going to have a very substantial discussion as we move \nalong. This is a very important issue dealing with a lot of revenue. I \nmust say, it is interesting that the issue is brought to the floor of \nthe Senate without even going to the Finance Committee. I would expect \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee would express \ngreat concern about that. This is an issue that has just bypassed the \nFinance Committee, just being brought right to the floor of the Senate, \nwith no hearings, no discussions, no markup in the Finance Committee.\n  It is also a circumstance where the majority leader has indicated he \nwants to bring this up, but he does not want people to offer amendments \nreally. And if they are to offer amendments, he wants them to be \nrelevant with respect to the decision of relevancy in the Senate, not \nwith respect to what is relevant or nonrelevant about the subjects that \nare on the floor of the Senate.\n  For example, if the proposal is to substantially cut revenue by \nexempting the largest estates in this country from any estate tax \nburden, if that is the proposal, it would not be relevant in the Senate \nto say: I have another idea. Why don't we retain the tax burden on the \nlargest estates, exempt the tax burden on the other estates, and then, \ninstead of costing the extra $50 or $60 billion for the first 10 years \nand substantially move over the next 10 years, let's use that \ndifference to provide a middle-income tax break, or let's use that \ndifference to provide a larger tax credit for college tuition to send \nyour children to college. Let's use that difference to provide a \nbenefit of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. Let's use that \ndifference to pay down the Federal debt that now exists at around $5.7 \ntrillion--all of those ideas would be out of order and considered, \nunder the arcane Senate rules, as nonrelevant.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6415-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6415-S6417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecess today from the hours of 12:30 to 2:15 in order for the weekly \nparty conferences to meet. I further ask unanimous consent that the \ntime count against the postcloture debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I know Senator Wellstone \nhas been here a long time, and I have been here a long time. Is there \nany way we can work out an order of recognition when we come back after \nthe conference lunches? I ask Senator Roth if that would be possible.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nthink it would be a good idea if we could work out an order, and I am \npleased to do so.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I request that the Democratic side give us a \nlist of the order, and we will try to develop one as well. Then when \nthe manager comes back for the Democratic side, we will see if we can't \nwork that out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend, Senator Dorgan, after the party \nluncheons, if he intends to continue to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As we have it now, it is Senator Wellstone first and \nmyself second. I would defer to our ranking member and the chairman to \nwork this out. If you could take that into consideration, I will not \nobject to the request.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I wonder whether I \ncould ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak since I have \nbeen here all morning, when we come back from the break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have to repropound his \nrequest.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan and myself will work this \nout. We will try to work it out so we can alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the unanimous consent as originally \npropounded, is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I have a parliamentary question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota yielded for a \nunanimous consent to be propounded. The floor returns to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the facts are not very evident with \nrespect to this debate in most cases.\n  I thought it would be useful to quote from an interesting \npublication, the ``Farm and Ranch Guide''--it is a well-known \npublication to most farmers and ranchers--an article by Alan Guebert, \n``A Tax Break for the Rich Courtesy of Family Farmers'' is its title.\n  He points out that in 1997, according to Internal Revenue Service \ndata, 1.9 percent of the more than 2 million Americans who died paid \nany estate tax at all; only 1.9 percent paid any estate tax at all.\n\n       As skinny as that slice was, an even skinnier 2,400 estates \n     paid almost 50 percent of all estate taxes . . .\n\n  His point was, there are not many estates that are subject to an \nestate tax. I believe we ought to enact a generous exemption for family \nfarms and small businesses so that no family farms or small businesses \nwill be caught in the web of an estate tax.\n  It is not as if this is a riveting debate, of course. The estate tax \nis a complicated issue. It can be highly emotional. As we see in the \nSenate today, it is not going to keep people glued to their seats.\n  I suggest, however, the purpose of taxation is to pay for things we \ndo in this country together. We build roads together because it doesn't \nmake sense for each of us to build a road separately. We build schools \nbecause it makes sense that we do that together. We provide for a \ncommon defense. It requires taxes to pay for all this. It is what we do \nas Americans.\n  I probably shouldn't name particular cities, but go mail a letter in \nsome cities around the world and see how quickly that letter moves. Go \ndrive on some roads in rural Honduras and see how well your tires hold \nup. Go take a look at some of the services in other parts of the world \nand then evaluate what your tax dollar buys in this country. That is \npart of our investment in America. Some say that the payment of taxes \nis something we don't like very much--I think all of us share that \nfeeling--so let's relieve that burden. They come to the floor with a \nplan. The plan is in writing and says, what we want to do is relieve \nthe burden of the estate tax.\n  We say: That's all right. Let us relieve the burden so that nobody of \nordinary means is going to have to pay an estate tax.\n  They say: No, that is not what we mean. Our idea is more than that. \nOur idea is, we want to remove the estate tax from everybody, including \nthe largest estates in the country. So they say: our idea is to reduce \nthe amount of revenue the Government has and to do it by relieving the \nburden of the estates tax on the largest estates.\n  We say: Well, that is an idea, but here is another idea. If we are \ntalking about $250 billion in 10 years of tax relief, why go just to \n400 of the wealthiest Americans? Why not provide some of that to the \nrest of the American folks?\n  How about to working families? How about some relief from the high \npayroll taxes people pay? How about some more relief from the cost of \nsending kids to college?\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\n  We have some ideas. But we are told: Your ideas don't matter. We are \ngoing to deal only with our own ideas, and those are ones that would \nbenefit the upper-income folks. But we want to put clothes on it to \ndisguise it a little because we know it doesn't sell very well to talk \nabout providing tax relief to billionaires. We are going to disguise it \nto make it look different and call it tax relief for family farmers and \nsmall businesses.\n  But we support such relief. Let's do that right now. In fact, perhaps \nthe Senator from Nevada could put forth a unanimous consent request. We \ncan legislate like they do--don't go to the committees, don't have \nmarkups; just bring it to the floor and put forth a unanimous consent \nrequest. They have done that on the estate tax. Yesterday, they did it \non the H-1B proposal. Perhaps we can say we support eliminating the \nestate tax for small businesses and family farmers and do it their way. \nThat is not a good way to legislate, but let's try that. Then we can \nget that off the table so all that remains is the question, Are we \ngoing to provide a very substantial amount of tax relief to those 400 \nor so estates that represent the largest accumulation of wealth in the \ncountry? If that is the priority, what is it measured against--against \nthe other priorities? Is it the most appropriate? Is it the most \nlogical thing to do? Or are there other uses of that revenue that would \nmake more sense for this country?\n  In summary, that is something that I think will be subject to a \nsubstantial amount of debate in the coming weeks. I wish to close where \nI began and say that there is a profound difference that exists between \nmany of us and the majority party on the subject of whether the largest \nestates in this country should be relieved of the burden of paying an \nestate tax. I think there is a better use for those funds than tax \nrelief for billionaires. On the other hand, there is no difference \nbetween us on whether we ought to make a quantum leap and provide a \nvery significant exemption for the transfer of family farms or small \nbusinesses. And for a dramatic and substantial increase in the unified \nexemption from the current roughly $675,000 level, I would support \ntaking that to the $4 million level for a husband and wife. I think we \ncan do that. There certainly should be agreement on that. We can take \nthat step, and what is left is an idea to relieve the rest of the \nburden by some of the majority, and other ideas that we would have for \nthe use of those funds, including middle-income tax relief. Let's have \nthat debate. It seems to me that would be the simple way of proceeding.\n  I wanted to make some of those points. I appreciate my colleagues who \nare also going to make some points in the postcloture discussion. Then \nwe should have this debate, with amendments. I think time agreements \ncould be developed, and I think at the end of the debate we would see \nwhere the votes are in the Senate on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request, \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have discussed this with the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. After the recess, which will be in a few \nminutes, we would like these Senators to speak. On our side of the \naisle, the order of speakers would be Senators Wellstone, Boxer, \nFeingold, Kennedy, Durbin, and Harkin on postcloture regarding this \nestate tax matter. On the Republican side, the speakers who have been \nrequested are Senators Burns, Kyl, and Grams so far. We will alternate \nback and forth. The majority will fill in a couple more speakers so \nthere would be a requisite number on each side. People on my side have \nindicated they would take a half hour or so, but we won't lock in the \ntime at this time, only the order of speakers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be able to do that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Idaho allowed to complete \nhis time?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, under a unanimous consent agreement, we are \nslated to recess at 12:30, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak for a few \nmoments. Senator Dorgan was on the floor talking about the character of \nhis State and the character of this issue of estate tax or death tax, \nwhatever we wish to call it. I call it that which destroys the American \ndream.\n  I have always been amazed that anyone who serves in public life can \njustify the revenue they spend for the sake of Government as somehow \ndestroying someone else's life or property. Yet over the years, \nclearly, the estate tax provision of our national Tax Code has done \njust that.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of Wyoming. I am from Idaho. \nMuch of our States are made up of farmers, ranchers, and small business \npeople. Really, the character of the business and industry of our \nStates is made up of small businesses.\n  Some of us strive all of our lives in a small business to create a \nlittle estate that we then want to hand to our children, if they choose \nto carry on that which we have developed. Yet in nearly every instance \ntoday, under current law, to be able to carry on that small Main Street \nbusiness or that farm or that ranch, you have to re-buy it. You have to \nsell it to get the revenue to pay off the Federal Government, and then \nyou spend the rest of your life, as the person who is the inheritor, \npaying for the business.\n  That is not the American dream. That is not what built the basis of \nwealth in our country which has generated this tremendous economy, \nwhich employs the men and women who make up the workforce of our \neconomy. That is why I and others have consistently argued that, \nclearly, we needed to either eliminate the estate tax or do it in a way \nthat recognizes those small- and medium-size proprietorships and \nbusinesses that are not held in stock or in corporations. That is \nexactly what we are attempting to do.\n\n  I am always amazed that the other side will come to the floor and \nsay: Well, this is a great idea, but then again we ought to consider \nthis or that, and maybe we ought not to do that, and that somehow it is \nwrong to generate wealth in our society and to want to be able to pass \nit on to our children and grandchildren.\n  Shame on those who want to deny the American dream. Shame on those \nwho want to deny the energy and the spirit that has created this \ncountry and made it the greatest country ever known on the face of the \nEarth--a country great for its ability to allow individual citizens to \ngrow and generate wealth in business. That is what this debate is \nfundamentally about. So anybody who wants to come to the floor and deny \nus as a Congress, as a people, the right to deal with this issue in a \nfair and equitable way simply denies the average citizen of this \ncountry the American dream.\n  Let us not get lost in the words. Let us not get lost in the \nphraseology about a little bit here and a little bit there, and we have \nto have all this money to spend in Government. This is the time of the \ngreatest prosperity in the history of this country. There are articles \nout there saying that the surplus is going to double and triple into \nthe trillions of dollars; yet we still have in the law a situation that \nsays: If you die, you lose. If you die, the Government gets your work. \nIf you die, all of the lifetime you have spent building a little \nbusiness, a farm, or a ranch is somehow no longer yours.\n  I am sorry, but I am not going to get fouled up in the rhetoric, and \nI am going to continue to come to the floor to try to cut through the \nsilly philosophy that somehow the Government has a right to all your \nmoney. What we have here is a responsible and legitimate piece of \nlegislation to change the tax law of this country to gradually move us \nout of the situation that says if you die, you sell your business and \nthe Government gets the money. What is wrong with medium- and small-\nsize businesses that are not large corporations or stock-held \nbusinesses? What is wrong with allowing your children to have them, if \nthey want them to continue that business and continue that legacy?\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\n  That is the issue that is before us.

I ask unanimous \nconsent the full study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, June 21, 2000]\n\n       Estate Tax Repeal: A Windfall for the Wealthiest Americans\n\n                     (By Iris J. Lav and James Sly)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       On June 9 the House passed legislation that would repeal \n     the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer \n     tax by 2010. The Senate is expected to consider estate tax \n     repeal in July.\n       Repealing the estate tax would provide a massive windfall \n     for some of the country's wealthiest families.\n       In 1997, the estates of fewer than 43,000 people--fewer \n     than 1.9 percent of the 2.3 million people who died that \n     year--had to pay any estate tax. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation projects that the percentage of people who die whose \n     estates will be subject to estate tax will remain at about \n     two percent for the foreseeable future. In other words, 98 of \n     every 1,000 people who die face no estate tax whatsoever.\n       To be subject to tax, the size of an estate must exceed \n     $675,000 in 2000. The estate tax exemption is rising to $1 \n     million by 2006. Note than an estate of any size may be \n     bequeathed to a spouse free of estate tax.\n       Each member of a married couple is entitled to the basic \n     $675,000 exemption. Thus, a couple can effectively exempt \n     $1.35 million from the estate tax in 2000, rising to $2 \n     million by 2006.\n       The vast bulk of estate taxes are paid on very large \n     estate. In 1997, some 2,400 estate--the largest five percent \n     of estates that were of sufficient size to be taxable--paid \n     nearly half of all estate taxes. These were estates with \n     assets exceeding $5 million. This means about half of the \n     estate tax was paid by the estates of the wealthiest one of \n     every 1,000 people who died.\n       If the estate tax had been repealed, each of these 2,400 \n     estates with assets exceeding $5 million would have received \n     a tax-cut windfall in 1997 that averaged more than $3.4 \n     million.\n       As these statistics make clear, the estates of a tiny \n     fraction of the people who die each year--those with very \n     large amounts of wealth--pay the bulk of all estate taxes.\n       Moreover, a recent Treasury Department study shows that \n     almost no estate tax is paid by middle-income people. Most of \n     the estate taxes are paid on the estates of people who, in \n     addition to having very substantial wealth, still had high \n     incomes around the time they died. The study found that 91 \n     percent of all estate taxes are paid by the estate of people \n     whose annual incomes exceeded $190,000 around the time of \n     their death. Less than one percent of estate taxes are paid \n     by the lowest-income 80 percent of the population, those with \n     incomes below $100,000.\n\n\n                   small businesses and family farms\n\n       Very few people leave a taxable estate that includes a \n     family business or farm. Only six of every 10,000 people who \n     die leave a taxable estate in which a family business or farm \n     forms the majority of the estate.\n       Nevertheless, it often is claimed that repeal of the estate \n     tax is necessary to save family businesses and farms--that \n     is, to assure they do not have to be liquidated to pay estate \n     taxes. In reality, only a small fraction of the estate tax is \n     paid on small family businesses and farms. Current estate tax \n     law already includes sizable special tax breaks for family \n     businesses and farms.\n       To the extent that problems may remain in the taxation of \n     small family-owned businesses and farms under the estate tax, \n     those problems could be specifically identified and addressed \n     at a modest cost to Treasury. Wholesale repeal of the estate \n     tax is not needed for this purpose.\n       Farms and family-owned business assets account for less \n     than four percent of all assets in taxable estates valued at \n     less than $5 million. Only a small fraction of the estate tax \n     is paid on the value of farms and small family businesses.\n       Family-owned businesses and farms are eligible for special \n     treatment under current law, including a higher exemption. \n     The total exemption for most estates that include a family-\n     owned business is $1.3 million in 2000, rather than $675,000. \n     A couple can exempt up to $2.6 million of an estate that \n     includes a family-owned business or farm.\n       Still another feature of current law allows deferral of \n     estate tax payments for up to 14 years when the value of a \n     family-owned business or farm accounts for at least 35 \n     percent of an estate, with interest charged at rates \n     substantially below market rates.\n       Claims that family-owned businesses have to be liquidated \n     to pay estate taxes imply that most of the value of the \n     estate is tied up in the businesses. But businesses or farms \n     constitute the majority of the assets in very few estates \n     that include family-owned businesses or farms. A Treasury \n     Department analysis of data for 1998 shows that in only 776 \n     of the 47,482 estates that were taxable that year--or just \n     1.6 percent of taxable estates--did family-owned businesses \n     assets (such as closely held stock, non-corporate businesses, \n     or partnerships) equal at least half of the gross estate. In \n     only 642 estates--1.4 percent of the taxable estates--did \n     farm assets, or farm assets and farm real estate, equal at \n     least half of the gross estate.\n       Furthermore, the law can easily be changed to exempt from \n     the estate tax a substantially larger amount of assets \n     related to family-owned farms or businesses, and this can be \n     done without repealing or making other sweeping changes in \n     the estate tax. When the House considered the estate tax on \n     June 9, Ways and Means Committee ranking member Charles \n     Rangel offered an alternative that would have exempted the \n     first $2 million of a family-owned business for an individual \n     and $4 million for a couple, without requiring any estate \n     planning.\n\n\n       effective estate tax rates much lower than marginal rates\n\n       The estate tax is levied at graduated rates depending on \n     the size of the estate; the highest tax rate is 55 percent. \n     This sometimes leads people to conclude that when someone \n     dies, half of their estate will go to the government.\n       It normally is not the case, however, that half of an \n     estate is taxed away. Effective tax rates for estates of all \n     sizes are much lower than the marginal tax rate of 55 \n     percent. On average for all taxable estates in 1997, estate \n     taxes represented 17 percent of the gross value of the \n     estate. A combination of permitted exemptions, deductions, \n     and credits, together with estate planning strategies, \n     reduced the effective tax rate to less than one-third of the \n     55 percent top marginal tax rate.\n\n\n              repeal of the estate tax carries a high cost\n\n       Repealing the estate tax would be very costly. According to \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation, the House bill would cost \n     $105 billion over the first 10 years, as it phases in slowly. \n     Once the proposal was fully in effect--and the estate tax had \n     been repealed--the proposal would cost about $50 billion a \n     year. The cost of the proposal in the second 10 years--from \n     2011 to 2020--would be nearly six times the cost for 2001-\n     2010.\n       Under the House bill, the estate tax would be reduced \n     gradually over the next decade, leading to full repeal in \n     calendar year 2010. Under current law, CBO projects the \n     estate tax will bring in $48 billion a year by 2010.\n       In the 10 years between 2011 and 2020, the estate tax \n     likely would bring in at least $620 billion under current \n     law. The House bill includes a provision, relating to the \n     valuation of capital assets when a person dies, that would \n     offset a small portion of the revenue loss from repeal of the \n     estate tax. The offsetting revenue gain is likely to be in \n     the range of $5 billion to $10 billion a year.\n       The net effect of the House bill when fully phased in thus \n     would be a revenue loss likely exceeding half a trillion \n     dollars over 10 years.\n       The very high cost of repeal would be felt fully in the \n     second decade of this century. That is the period when the \n     baby boomers begin to retire in large numbers, substantially \n     increasing the costs of programs such as Social Security, \n     Medicare, and Medicaid. Repealing the estate tax would \n     subsequently reduce the funds available to help meet these \n     costs and to facilitate reforms of Social Security and \n     Medicare that would extend the solvency of those programs, as \n     well as to meet other priority needs such as improving\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\n     educational opportunities, expanding health insurance \n     coverage, and reducing child poverty. It also would leave \n     fewer funds for tax cut targeted on average working families.\n\n\n              most estate taxes are paid by large estates\n\n       Most estate taxes are paid by large estates rather than by \n     small family-owned farms and businesses. As noted above, the \n     first $675,000 of an estate is exempt from taxation in 2000, \n     with the exemption scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006. \n     In addition, an unlimited amount of property can be \n     bequeathed to a spouse free of estate tax.\n       Moreover, each member of a married couple is entitled to \n     the basic $675,000 exemption. A number of simple estate \n     planning devices are available under the law, the net effect \n     of which is to double the amount a couple can exempt from \n     estate taxation. Thus, a couple can effectively exempt $1.35 \n     million from estate tax in 2000, rising to $2 million by \n     2006.\n       As a result of these exemptions and other provisions, such \n     as unlimited deductions for charitable giving, only about two \n     percent of all deaths result in estate tax liability. Of the \n     2.3 million people who died in 1997, for example, fewer than \n     43,000 had to pay any estate tax.\n       Of those estates that are taxable, the largest pay most of \n     the estate tax. An analysis by IRS of the 42,901 taxable \n     estates filing in 1997 showed that the 5.4 percent of taxable \n     estates with gross value exceeding $5 million paid 49 percent \n     of total estate taxes. In other words, about half the estate \n     tax was paid by the estates of just 2,400 people--about one \n     out of every 1,000 people who died. The 15 percent of taxable \n     estates with gross value exceeding $2.5 million paid nearly \n     70 percent of total estate taxes.\n       The average estate tax payment for the 2,400 taxable \n     estates with assets exceeding $5 million in 1997 was $3.47 \n     million. If the estate tax had been fully repealed for 1997 \n     filers, the 2,400 wealthiest people who died thus would have \n     received a tax-cut windfall averaging about $3.5 million \n     each. A few hundred of the very wealthiest people who left \n     estates exceeding $20 million would have received a tax-cut \n     windfall of more than $10 million each.\n\n\n                 estate tax payers also are high-income\n\n       A new analysis by the Treasury Department looks at the \n     annual income of decedents who pay estate taxes. The Treasury \n     analysis finds that virtually all estate taxes--99 percent--\n     are paid on the estates of people who were in the highest 20 \n     percent of the income distribution at the time of their \n     death. Some 91 percent of all estate taxes are paid on the \n     estates of individuals who had annual incomes of more than \n     $190,000 around the time of their death.\n\n\n     effective tax rate on estates is far lower than marginal rates\n\n       It often is claimed that estate tax rates are too high and \n     that the government should not be taking as much as half of a \n     person's lifetime savings when he or she dies. The assertion \n     that the government takes half of a person's estate stems \n     from the fact that the estate tax is levied at graduated \n     rates, with the highest marginal rate of 55 percent applying \n     to estates with a value exceeding $3 million.\n       Data on estate taxes actually paid, however, show that \n     estate taxes represent one-sixth the value of the average \n     estate, not one-half. As shown in Table 1, estate taxes paid \n     equaled 17 percent of the gross value of taxable estates for \n     which estate tax returns were filed in 1997. The smallest and \n     the largest estates had the lowest effective tax rates. In \n     estates valued between $2.5 million and $20 million, the \n     effective tax rate was approximately one-quarter of the \n     amount of the gross estate.\n\n\n  small businesses and farms make up only a small fraction of taxable \n                                estates\n\n       IRS data show that farms and small, family-owned businesses \n     make up only a small proportion of taxable estates. Farm \n     property, regardless of size, accounted for about one-quarter \n     of one percent of all assets included in taxable estates in \n     1997. Family-owned business assets, such as closely-held \n     stocks, limited partnerships, and non-corporate businesses, \n     accounted for less than four percent of the value of all \n     taxable estates of less than $5 million. (Farm and family-\n     owned business assets together accounted for about 10 percent \n     of all assets in all estates and less than four percent of \n     the value of taxable estates of less than $5 million.)\n       Of particular significance is a Treasury Department \n     tabulation of 1998 data. It shows that in only 776 out of the \n     47,482 taxable estates that year did family-owned business \n     assets (closely held stock, non-corporate businesses, or \n     partnerships) equal at least half of the gross estate. \n     Similarly, on only 642 out of these 47,482 taxable estates \n     did farm assets or farm assets and farm real estate equal at \n     least half the gross estate. Thus, for 1,418 estates out of \n     the approximately 2.3 million people who died that year--or \n     six out of every 10,000 people who died--did family-owned \n     businesses or farms form the majority of the estate. The \n     Treasury analysis found that estates that included these \n     assets paid less than one percent of all estate taxes.\n       Most farms have relatively modest value. The Agriculture \n     Department estimates that in 1998, fewer than six percent of \n     all farms had a net worth in excess of $1.3 million, the \n     amount of an estate that is completely exempt if the estate \n     includes a family-owned farm. Only 1.5 percent of farms have \n     net worth over $3 million.\n\n\nsmaller, family-owned business already eligible for favorable treatment\n\n       Family-owned businesses and farms already are eligible for \n     special treatment under current law.\n       Under current law, family-owned businesses and farms may be \n     valued in a special way that reflects the current use to \n     which that property is put, rather than its market value. \n     This provision generally reduces the value that is counted \n     for purposes of estate tax; the reduction in value can be as \n     much as $770,000 in 2000. This amount is indexed annually for \n     inflation.\n       To use the special valuation, the decedent or other family \n     members must have participated in the business for a number \n     of years before the decedent's death, and family members must \n     continue to operate the business or farm for the following 10 \n     years. This assures that the benefit of this special \n     valuation goes to relatively smaller businesses and farms \n     than are family owned and operated.\n       The amount of an estate that is exempt from taxation is \n     higher for family-owned businesses and farms than for other \n     types of estates. Instead of the $675,000 exemption (which \n     rises to $1 million in 2006), the 1997 tax law increased the \n     total exemption for most estates that include family-owned \n     businesses to $1.3 million.\n       In addition, when the value of a family-owned business or \n     farm accounts for at least 35 percent of an estate, current \n     law allows deferral of taxation. The tax payable on such an \n     estate may be stretched over up to 14 years, including \n     deferral of annual interest payments for five years, followed \n     by up to 10 annual installments of principal and interest.\n\n\n       is it difficult to qualify as a ``family-owned'' business?\n\n       Proponents of estate tax repeal often claim that increasing \n     the exemption for family-owned businesses is not a sufficient \n     remedy, because the law makes it too hard to qualify for \n     treatment as a family-owned business. In fact, the definition \n     of a family-owned business is very expansive so long as the \n     family owns and operates the business and intends to continue \n     doing so.\n       If a business is wholly owned and operated by the person \n     who died, it easily qualifies for treatment as a family-owned \n     business under current estate tax law. Otherwise, there are \n     two key factors that determine whether the business or farm \n     qualifies as a family-owned business.\n       The first factor is the relationship of the person who died \n     to others who own a share in the business or help run it. For \n     purposes of the estate tax, the term ``family'' is quite \n     broad; it includes, for example, grandchildren and great-\n     grandchildren and their spouses as well as nieces and nephews \n     and their spouses.\n       The second consideration is whether the family actually \n     owns and operates the business.\n       The family must own at least 50 percent of the business. \n     However, if more than one family owns the business, the \n     family of the person who died may own as little as 30 percent \n     of the business.\n       Either the person who died or any family member (as family \n     member is broadly defined) must have owned and materially \n     participated in the business for at least five of the \n     previous eight years. In general, material participation \n     means working at the business and taking part in management \n     decisions.\n       Businesses that manufacture or sell a product, provide a \n     service, or engage in farming qualify for the special \n     treatment. A business that is solely a holding company for \n     managing other investments would not qualify.\n       The company cannot be publicly-traded. If stock in the \n     business has been publicly-traded within three years of the \n     person's death, the business does not qualify as family-\n     owned.\n       The heirs also must continue to operate the business for a \n     period of time. In the decade after the person's death, each \n     qualified heir or a member of his or her family must \n     materially participate in the business for at least five of \n     any eight consecutive years. If three siblings inherit a \n     business, for example, the test would be met if any one of \n     them participated. It also would be met if one sibling's \n     daughter were the only participant.\n       If payments are deferred and paid over time in \n     installments, a below-market interest rate of just two \n     percent applies to the tax attributable to the first \n     $1,030,000 in value of a closely held (family) farm or \n     business. There also is a preferential rate on the tax \n     attributed to the remaining value of the family farm or \n     business.\n\n\nestate tax relief for family farms and small businesses can have modest \n                                  cost\n\n       There are a number of ways the estate tax burden could be \n     substantially relieved for these family businesses and farms \n     without repealing or making fundamental changes in the rest \n     of the estate tax. A proposal offered in the House Rep. \n     Charles Rangel, the ranking minority member of the Ways and \n     Means Committee, as an alternative to repealing the estate \n     tax included such a provision.\n       A provision in the Rangel proposal would have raised the \n     exclusion for family-owned farms and small businesses from \n     $1.3 million to $2 million. It also would have allowed the \n     transfer of any unused portion of the exclusion between \n     spouses. As a result, a married\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\n     couple with a farm or small business interest would receive a \n     $4 million exclusion. (Under current law, a couple can \n     receive a $2.6 million exclusion for a farm or small business \n     interest if they engage in some estate tax planning. The \n     Rangel provision would have provided the $4 million exclusion \n     without the need for estate tax planning.)\n       This type of substantial additional tax relief for family \n     owned farms and businesses carries a cost that is only a tiny \n     fraction of the cost of fully repealing the estate tax. This \n     provision would cost about $2 billion a year, compared to the \n     approximately $50 billion-a-year cost of the Archer proposal \n     when fully in effect.\n\n\n              repealing the estate tax carries a high cost\n\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the bill the \n     House passed to reduce and ultimately eliminate the estate \n     tax would cost $104.5 billion over the 10-year period from \n     2001 through 2010. Full repeal of the estate tax would be \n     effective for people who die in 2010 and years after that. \n     The full revenue effect from repealing the estate tax would \n     not be felt until two to three years after that, because \n     estate taxes are rarely paid in the year of death; it takes \n     two to three years to settle an estate and file the estate-\n     tax return. As a result, the cost of repealing the estate tax \n     is not reflected in any year in the 10-year period covered by \n     the revenue estimate for the bill.\n\n\n       repealing the estate tax would reduce charitable bequests\n\n       Current estate tax law includes an unlimited charitable \n     deduction; no estate tax is due on funds bequeathed to \n     charities. For the largest estates that are subject to the 55 \n     percent marginal estate tax rate, each additional $1,000 \n     given to charity reduces estate taxes by $550.\n       In 1997, more than 15,500 estates took advantage of this \n     provision, making--and deducting--donations worth more than \n     $14 billion. (This includes the charitable deductions taken \n     by all estates required to file estate tax returns in 1997, \n     some of which were taxable and some of which had sufficient \n     total deductions and credits to eliminate estate tax \n     liability.)\n       The charitable deduction is most heavily used by the \n     largest estates. In 1997, charitable deductions equaled 30 \n     percent of the total gross assets of taxable estates valued \n     over $20 million, as compared to about three percent of the \n     assets of smaller estates. Over half of the taxable estates \n     of more than $20 million took a deduction for charitable \n     bequests in 1997; these estates gave a total of $7.5 billion \n     to charity, averaging more than $41 million in donations per \n     estate. This is one of the reasons the effective estate tax \n     rates are lower for estates valued at $20 million or more \n     than for estates valued between $1 million and $20 million. \n     (See Table 1.)\n       The research on the effect of the estate tax on charitable \n     giving has consistently shown that levying estate taxes \n     increases the amount of charitable bequests. The most recent \n     study, by Treasury Department economist David Joulfaian, \n     analyzed the tax returns of people who died in 1992. \n     Joulfaian found that eliminating the estate tax would reduce \n     charitable bequests by about 12 percent overall. Had there \n     been no estate tax in 1997, charities thus would likely have \n     received about $1.7 billion less in bequests than they did.\n       The actual loss to charity is likely to be greater than is \n     implied by looking solely at bequests, however, because some \n     people with significant estates make charitable contributions \n     while they still are alive with the intention of reducing \n     both their income taxes and the amount of their assets on \n     which the estate tax will be levied. If a person gives to \n     charity through the popular device known as a charitable \n     remainder trust, for example, the assets do not show up in \n     the estate tax statistics. Under a charitable remainder \n     trust, the person transfers assets to the trust. The trust \n     provides the person a stream of income for the remainder of \n     his or her life, and whatever remains in the trust at the end \n     of the person's life goes to charity. The person gets an \n     immediate income tax deduction for the amount that will go to \n     charity, computed based on his or her life expectancy (as \n     determined actuarially). In addition, amounts transferred in \n     this manner are considered to have been transferred prior to \n     death and are not included in the estate when the donor dies. \n     In 1997, a total of 82,176 charitable remainder trusts were \n     in existence, containing assets totaling $60.5 billion. \n     Charitable remainder trusts are just one example of \n     charitable donations that may take place toward the end of \n     life that reduce both income taxes and estate taxes.\n       Under current law, CBO projects the estate tax will bring \n     in $48 billion a year by 2010. In the 10 years between 2011 \n     and 2020, the estate tax likely would bring in at least $620 \n     billion under current law. Repealing the estate tax \n     consequently would result in the loss of the entire $620 \n     billion over the 10-year period. The House bill also includes \n     a provision relating to the valuation of capital assets when \n     a person dies that would offset a small portion of the \n     revenue loss from repeal of the estate tax; the offsetting \n     revenue gain is likely to be in the range of $5 billion to \n     $10 billion a year. Thus, the net effect of the House bill, \n     when fully phased in, would be a revenue loss likely to \n     exceed half a trillion dollars over the 10-year period from \n     2011 through 2020.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Last week, President Clinton pointed out the cost of \nthis repeal, helping the top wealthiest 2 percent of our population. It \namounts to $100 billion over the first 10 years and then $750 billion \nover the next decade.\n  I will speak for some period of time, and I know other Senators will \nspeak as well, about what we could be doing and should be doing instead \nof repealing this inheritance tax helping the top 2 percent of the \npopulation.\n  Instead of this repeal helping the top 2 percent of the population, \nwe could help renew our national vow of equal opportunity for every \nchild. We could start by making sure families in our country are helped \nwith affordable child care. I can't think of a more important issue, \nespecially for younger working families. I don't know how many times in \nMinnesota, or anywhere I go in the country, I have people coming up to \nme--maybe they make $40,000 a year or $35,000 a year, and the child \ncare expenses range anywhere from $6,000 a year to $12,000 a year. We \ncould have a refundable tax credit. It could be for families under \n$30,000. You could put it on a sliding fee scale basis. We could go up \nto $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, which would help families afford \nchild care. Why don't we do that?\n  The Federal Government--that means the Senate, that means the House \nof Representatives--could be a real player in pre-K education. By the \nway, child care--whether a family provider, whether in a child care \ncenter, or whether or not a child is at home with a parent--is all \nabout education. Those children who are able to receive developmental \nchild care, who were nurtured, who were intellectually stimulated, will \ncome to kindergarten ready to learn and they will do well.\n  For many families, and not only low-income families, this is a \nsalient issue. The way this is drafted right now, going to the \nwealthiest 2 percent of Americans, we could--and I intend to have an \namendment that focuses on this--have some tax credits that go to \nfamilies so they can afford child care.\n  This is an emergency situation in many of our States. At best, 20 \npercent of the children in 20 percent of these families are receiving \nany help whatsoever. There was a powerful piece in the Washington Post \nlast weekend talking about the fact that not only can families not \nafford this, but there is almost a 40-percent turnover of child care \nproviders every year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article, ``Burdened Families Look \nfor Child Care Aid,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 6, 2000]\n\n               Burdened Families Look for Child-Care Aid\n\n                          (By Dale Russakoff)\n\n       Woodbridge, N.J.--Debra Harris, a single mother, quit her \n     $34,000-a-year job as an occupational therapist for the \n     summer because she can't afford full-time care for her two \n     children.\n       Kathy Popino, a receptionist, and her electrician husband \n     have gone into debt to keep their toddler and 8-year-old in \n     child care at the YMCA, after a bad experience with a lower-\n     priced home caregiver.\n       Mary O'Mara, a computer network administrator, and her \n     husband, a factory worker, have junked the conventional \n     wisdom of ``pay your mortgage first.'' They sometimes pay a \n     late fee on their home loan to cover child care first, lest \n     they lose coveted spaces in a center they trust.\n       Child care is in slow-motion crisis for middle-income \n     families, and Middlesex County, N.J., is in the thick of it. \n     With three of four mothers working outside the home--near the \n     national average--this swath of suburbs dramatizes the cost \n     to working families of the national political consensus that \n     child care is a private, not public, responsibility.\n       For 30 years, politicians have promised to shift the burden \n     for families in the middle, with little result. Vice \n     President Gore recently called for tens of billions of \n     dollars in spending and tax breaks over a decade to improve \n     care from infancy through adolescence--a proposal advocates \n     called impressive in its reach, but short on resources and \n     details.\n       Texas Gov. George W. Bush has proposed initiatives only for \n     the poor, saying working families can apply his proposed \n     income tax cut to child care bills.\n       Would-be beneficiaries here had a feeling they'd heard that \n     before.\n       ``I was so hopeful when the Clintons came in,'' said \n     Popino, 34. ``I saw Hillary as a working mom's best friend. I \n     remember she said, `It takes a village.' Okay, it's been \n     eight years. When are they going to get to my village?''\n       The politics of welfare reform has focused national \n     attention and money on the vast\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\n     child care needs of women in poverty, which remain unmet. And \n     the economic boom is helping affluent families pay full-time \n     nannies or the $800- to $1,000-a-month fees at new, high-\n     quality centers.\n       But with a record 64 percent of mothers of preschoolers now \n     employed, and day care ranked by the Census Bureau as the \n     biggest expense of young families after food and housing, \n     officials say middle-income families routinely are priced out \n     of licensed centers and homes. The median income for families \n     with two children is $45,500 annually, according to the \n     Census Bureau.\n       ``Basically, we have a market that isn't working,'' said \n     Lynn White, executive director of the National Child Care \n     Association, which represents 7,000 providers.\n       In a booming economy in which almost any job pays better, \n     day care centers now lose a third to more than half of their \n     staffs each year, and licensed home caregivers have quit \n     in droves, according to national surveys.\n       The average starting wage for assistant day care teachers \n     nationally rose 1 cent in eight years--to $6 an hour. Weekly \n     tuition at centers in six cities rose 19 percent to 83 \n     percent in the same period, as states tightened regulations.\n       Most industrialized countries invested heavily in early-\n     childhood care as women surged into the work force in the \n     1970s, but Congress and a succession of presidents left the \n     system here mostly to the marketplace, directly subsidizing \n     only the poorest of the poor.\n       A federal child care tax credit, enacted in 1976, saves \n     working families $3 billion, but advocates say it has fallen \n     far behind inflation. (It saved Debra Harris $980 last year, \n     leaving her cost at more than $7,000.)\n       When the military faced the same crisis of quality, \n     affordability and supply a decade ago, Congress took a \n     strikingly different approach. It financed a multibillion-\n     dollar reform in the name of retaining top recruits and \n     investing in future ones.\n       The result was a system of tightly enforced, high-quality \n     standards for day care, home care and before- and after-\n     school care. It included continual training of workers and \n     more generous pay and benefits.\n       Advocates hail the system as a model. With 200,000 children \n     in care, it costs an average of $7,200 a child, which the \n     government subsidizes by income.\n       ``The best chance a family has to be guaranteed affordable \n     and high-quality care in this country is to join the \n     military,'' concluded an analysis by the National Women's Law \n     Center.\n       Debra Harris used to drop her kids at Pumpkin Patch Child \n     Development Center in working-class Avenel every morning at 7 \n     in a weathered Ford Escort. She popped buttered bagels in the \n     center's microwave for their breakfasts before heading to \n     Jersey City, where she was a school occupational therapist.\n       A bus took Whitney, 9, and Frankie, 7, to school and \n     brought them back at day's end to Pumpkin Patch, which they \n     complained was cramped and a bit boring. Their mother \n     considered it the safest and best care she could afford.\n       This summer, though, Whitney and Frankie's needs would have \n     grown before- and after-school care (total: $440 a month) to \n     full-day care at Pumpkin Patch's camp (total: $1,400 a \n     month). Harris recently went back over the match, incredulous \n     at the results.\n       ``I can make $25 an hour on a per-diem basis,'' she said. \n     ``If I work 40 hours a week, that's $4,000 a month, $3,200 \n     after taxes. If I take out $1,400 for my mortgage and $1,400 \n     for full-time day care, that leaves $400--$100 a week to buy \n     food and gas, pay bills, go to the shore on the weekend. This \n     is crazy!''\n       So Harris decided to quit her job for the summer, find \n     part-time work and draw down her savings.\n       At 30, Harris prides herself on providing for her children \n     ``without ever using the welfare system, thank God,'' despite \n     difficulties that include an ex-husband who is more than \n     $6,000 behind in child support, according to her records.\n       Child care was never easier when she was married, and not \n     just because of her husband's paycheck, Harris said. Early in \n     their marriage, they were stationed in Germany with the Air \n     Force and had access to German-subsidized child care. They \n     paid $40 a month per child for full-time care in a stately, \n     19th-century building within walking distance of their home.\n       ``I find it really discouraging that my own government says \n     I shouldn't need help with child care,'' Harris said. ``Now \n     is when I really need some help.''\n       The first time Washington tried to help--and failed--was \n     1971. Congress passed a $2 billion program to help \n     communities develop child care for working families, but \n     President Richard M. Nixon vetoed it as ill-conceived, \n     writing in his veto message that it would ``commit the vast \n     moral authority of the National Government to the side of \n     communal approaches to child-rearing over . . . the family-\n     centered approach.''\n       Mothers of school-age children kept going to work anyway. \n     In 1947, 27 percent was employed at least part time; in 1960, \n     it was 43 percent; in 1980, 64 percent; in 1998, 78 percent. \n     State governments took the lead in setting child care \n     standards, which vary dramatically, as do fees and quality.\n       In the late 1980's, with the number of children in care \n     surging, Congress again took up the cause of middle-income as \n     well as poor families. The resulting Act for Better \n     Childcare, signed by then-President George Bush in 1990, \n     vastly increased aid to the poor, whose needs were the most \n     urgent. But middle-income families were left out.\n       Poor families' needs became even more pressing in 1996 with \n     the passage of welfare reform, which sent women from \n     assistance rolls to the work force. A federal child care \n     block grant aimed at families making up to 85 percent of a \n     state's median income is going overwhelmingly to families in \n     or near poverty, reaching only 1 in 10 eligible children, \n     according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       In 1988, President Clinton moved to expand the child care \n     tax credit but was blocked by Republicans who said it \n     slighted mothers who stayed home with their children.\n       This election year could be different, several analysts \n     said. Although most voters care less about child care than \n     Social Security and taxes, the issue rates highest with women \n     younger than 50, particularly those under 30, a crucial \n     voting bloc for both Bush and Gore.\n       Unlike 1996, when these women were solidly for Clinton, \n     their concerns now have political cachet, according to Andes \n     Kohut of the Pew Research Center for the People and the \n     Press.\n       At the same time, advocates are linking quality child care \n     to school readiness, hoping to tap into the national focus on \n     education. They emphasize that the government subsidizes \n     higher education for all families, but not ``early ed,'' as \n     they call child care, which hits young families, who have \n     fewer resources.\n       Another political impetus comes from recent reports of the \n     U.S. military program's success. Newspaper editorials in \n     almost every region of the country asked why the civilian \n     world can't have the same quality child care.\n       Kathy Popino has been asking for years. Her husband, \n     Warren, was in the Coast Guard when their son, Matthew, was \n     born, and they paid $75 a month--subsidized by the Department \n     of Defense--to a home caregiver trained by the DOD. ``She was \n     wonderful. The military inspected all the time,'' Popino \n     said.\n       When Warren left the Coast Guard to become an electrician, \n     they moved to Metuchen, N.J., but couldn't find licensed care \n     at even twice that price. They opted for an unlicensed home \n     caregiver who cared for Matthew for $80 a month, along with \n     two other children.\n       But Matthew, then 2, began crying nights, and ``his \n     personality did a 180,'' Kathy said. Unable to sleep herself \n     or concentrate at work, Kathy moved him to a state-of-the-art \n     KinderCare Learning Center they couldn't afford. ``Visa \n     became our best friend,'' she said.\n       Ultimately, they moved him to the YMCA, where they now pay \n     about $800 a month for high-quality, full-time care for \n     Gillian, 1\\1/2\\, and after-school care for Matthew, 8. The \n     program there includes weekly swim lessons, daily sports and \n     homework help in spacious, sun-filled rooms.\n       In the process, Popino has developed a keen class \n     consciousness. ``When summer camp starts, you pay every \n     Monday, and everybody who pays with credit cards walks out to \n     our used cars we owe money on. The people paying by check \n     walk out and get in their new Lexus,'' she said.\n       The Y's fees are lower than prices at similar, for-profit \n     centers, but cost pressures are rising as the labor market \n     tightens. Child care director Rose Cushing said turnover \n     rates are well over 30 percent, even with the agency paying \n     health benefits to its teachers.\n       Twenty minutes south on U.S. Route 1, at Pumpkin Patch, \n     where fees, teacher pay and the facilities are more modest, \n     proprietor Michelle Alling has held on to four of her head \n     teachers for five years, mainly because of their loyalty to \n     the children.\n       On a recent morning, as one teacher baked chocolate-chip \n     cookies with flour-blotched 3- and 4-year-olds, Alling \n     acknowledged that they all desperately needed higher wages.\n       But ``then you have families literally handing you their \n     entire paycheck,'' she said, ``and where does it come from?''\n       Mary O'Mara, the mother who sometimes makes ends meet by \n     paying late fees on her mortgage, said politicians who look \n     past this issue must live in a different world than hers. She \n     wishes she could show them what she showed her mother, who \n     used to tell her to relax and stay home with her children.\n       ``I sat her down with a calculator, and I gave her a \n     month's worth of bills--food, mortgage, child care, \n     gasoline,'' O'Mara said. ``There was almost nothing left, and \n     that's with two middle-class incomes.\n       ``She looked at me like she didn't believe it. She said, `I \n     didn't realize how tough it was out there.' ''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, instead of the repeal of the \ninheritance tax going to the wealthiest 2 percent, we could provide \nsome tax credit assistance for working families so they could better \nafford child care for their children. Why can't we do that?\n  The evidence is irrefutable. The evidence is irreducible. These are \nthe critically important years. Families in our States tell us how \nimportant this is. What are we doing moving forward on repealing an \ninheritance tax for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, not \ntargeting it to family farmers and\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nsmall businesses but across the board, instead of using some of this \nmoney--$100 billion over the first 10 years, but $750 billion over the \nsecond 10 years--to make sure families in our country can afford good \nchild care for their children?\n  By the way, even when I talk about tax credits invested in affordable \nchild care, it breaks my heart because this will not even be near \nenough. The truth is, we have to get serious about good developmental \nchild care, and that means men and women who work in this field should \nnot make $8 an hour or $6 an hour with no benefits at all, but we \nshould value the work of adults who work with children; that we not \ncontinue to pay men and women who work in child care centers half of \nwhat we pay men and women who work in zoos taking care of animals.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am absolutely confident that I am \nreflecting the priorities of Minnesotans when I say repeal of this \nestate tax, now crafted in such a way that it goes to the wealthiest 2 \npercent of Americans, is hardly a priority for people in Minnesota or \npeople in the country. I would prefer to see us make the investment in \nchild care. I intend to offer an amendment that deals with additional \ntax credits which will provide help for working families.\n  I will not use statistics, but every Senator, Democratic and \nRepublican, knows intuitively that in today's economy, one of the most \nimportant indicators of whether or not a young person--or not such \nyoung person, since many of our students are no longer 18 and 19 living \nin a dorm but they are 40 and 50 years of age going back to school--can \nsucceed is whether or not they are able to complete higher education. \nYet we have this huge gap between the number of young people, or not \nsuch young people, from low- and moderate-income backgrounds who are \nable to complete college versus those who come from upper-income or \nupper-middle-income families, and it is because of the cost of higher \neducation.\n  We have not fully funded the Pell Grant Program where we get the most \nbang for the buck, and when we passed the Hope Scholarship Program and \nsaid there would be a $1,500 tax credit for students to afford the \nfirst 2 years of school, it was not a refundable tax credit. So for a \nlot of the students in the community colleges in Minnesota, if they \ncome from families with incomes under $30,000 a year, $28,000 a year, \nthey do not get any benefit because it is not a refundable tax credit.\n  What could we be doing instead of moving forward on an agenda that \nrepeals this inheritance tax that benefits the wealthiest 2 percent of \nthe population? What we could do instead is provide refundable tax \ncredits for our students so they can afford to go on to colleges and \nuniversities and do better for themselves and do better for their \nchildren. I say better for their children because, again, I have \nreached the conclusion, having spent a lot of time on campuses in \nMinnesota, that the nontraditional students have become the \ntraditional students, and probably the majority of our students are now \nin their thirties and forties with children going back to school so \nthey can do better for their kids.\n\n  Are we committed to education? Here is where we could be a player. \nInstead of repeal of this estate tax that the majority party wants us \nto move forward on, why are we not talking about a commitment to \neducation? Why are we not, as Senators, making a difference where we \ncan make a difference?\n  Yes, we can make a difference in kindergarten through 12th grade, but \nwe can make a huge difference, it is our role to make a difference \nprekindergarten: to make a commitment to affordable child care so \nchildren coming into kindergarten are ready to learn; to make sure \nevery child has an opportunity to do well; to make sure our students \ncan go on and afford higher education so they can do better by \nthemselves.\n  Why are we not making this commitment to education? What are we doing \nout here, trying to move forward this piece of legislation that is \ngoing to cost $100 billion over the first decade and then up to $750 \nbillion over the next decade, with all of this money and all of these \nbenefits flowing, roughly speaking, to the wealthiest 2 percent of the \npopulation? I have a bill, as does Barney Frank in the House of \nRepresentatives, that basically says: What we can do is agree that we \nare talking about, by definition, very wealthy Americans; that we are \ntrying to repeal this inheritance tax. We are saying--and I quote \nBarney Frank--``If you're old, rich, and dead, we're with you. If \nyou're old, sick, and middle class, you're out of luck.'' I do not know \nthat I would put it quite that way, but basically we could take this \n$750 billion over the second 10 years, $100 billion over the first 10 \nyears, and finance prescription drug benefits so seniors will be able \nto afford prescription drugs.\n  I come from a State where fully 65 percent of senior citizens have no \nprescription drug coverage at all. All of us can talk about people who \nare spending up to $300, $400, $500 a month to cover prescription drug \ncosts, and maybe their total monthly budget right now, based upon what \nbenefits they have, is $1,000 or $1,200. We can talk about people who \ncut pills in half, though that is dangerous. We can talk about people \nwho are faced with the choice: Can I afford prescription drugs or can I \nafford to eat but not both?\n  What in the world are we doing trying to proceed on a piece of \nlegislation which is not at all targeted, which provides huge benefits, \nwhich basically busts our budget and robs our ability to invest in \nother decisive areas that are so important to people in our States and \nprovides the benefits to the wealthiest 2 percent?\n  This debate is really a debate about our priorities and, and I will \ndraw a bit from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: In 1997, \nthe estates of fewer than 43,000 people--fewer than 1.9 percent of the \n2.3 million people who died that year--had to pay any estate tax. That \nis 1.9 percent, roughly speaking, among the wealthiest 2 percent in the \nUnited States of America. It is going to cost us $100 billion over the \nfirst 10 years, and it is going to cost us $750 billion over the next \n10 years.\n\n  You know what. If we had an unlimited amount of money, and we did not \nhave other needs--such as affordable child care, making sure we have \nhealth security for families, making sure people have a pension, making \nsure young people and not so young people can go on and afford higher \neducation, and making sure families can do well by their kids so they \ncan do well by their country--I might be all for it.\n  But what about these other decisive needs? Don't they come first?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One of our colleagues was saying he was visited by an \nextremely successful gentleman who was worth in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 billion. The gentleman was \ndiscussing with this particular Senator this repeal of the estate tax \nfor the wealthiest in our Nation, for the billionaires, if you will, \nfor the most wealthy among us. This very wealthy person was making the \npoint that he was not for this repeal for the very wealthy.\n  He said we could fix it for some of the family farmers, the small \nbusinesses, with which, by the way, Democrats on the whole have agreed. \nBut he said: Do you know how I made my money? A lot of people have \nworked for me. He said: Those people have worked really hard for me. \nThey didn't grow up to be millionaires. They got up every day, and they \nworked for my business. He said, in a sense, if his children had to pay \nsome of the inheritance back, and we took the funds here and put them \ninto education and job training and health care and prescription drugs, \nhe would feel pretty good about it.\n  Now, granted, this is a type of a person you do not run into that \noften. Most people are not that selfless. But I think that gentleman \nreally put it out there for us to contemplate.\n  This is the greatest nation in the world. With a good idea, people \ncan come up from poverty and they can make it to the top. Their heirs \nperhaps may not be that hard working, but maybe they are. But the fact \nis, this gentleman has focused on this, to say to this great country: I \nwant to see it continue to be great. There is a notion about that, that \nthis gentleman, I believe, has focused upon.\n  I offer that up to my friend because he points out how much work we \nhave to do for ordinary people who get up\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nand face problems every day. It seems to me to be a very small price to \npay, for very few people at the very top who have, in a sense, made it \nmostly because of these hard-working people, that their estates give \nback a little bit to this great country to defend itself, to be able to \nafford to educate its young, et cetera. I want my friend to just \ncomment on that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nactually would like to comment on her point in two ways.\n  First of all, let me point out, right now the total exemption for \nmost estates that include a family-owned business is $1.3 million in \n2000. That is what it has gone up to. A couple can exempt up to $2.6 \nmillion of an estate that includes a family-owned business or farm.\n\n  I would have no problem further targeting that. I do not think my \ncolleague from California would, either. But the proposal out on the \nfloor by the Republican majority--a sort of across-the-board repeal \nthat amounts to $850 billion of lost revenue over the next 20 years--\nhas to be considered alongside what we are about as a nation, what we \nare about as a people. I think the Senator from California speaks to \nthe whole question of community.\n  My definition of community is that we all do better when we all do \nbetter. The interesting thing is that many people in Minnesota who are \neconomically very successful--I do not know if they are the wealthiest \n2 percent; I can think of some for whom I think I can speak who would \nsay: Look, in all due respect, in terms of the scheme of your \npriorities, my gosh, get it right first for children. Get it right by \nway of helping families and helping children. Get it right by investing \nin education.\n  We now have 44 million people with no health insurance whatsoever. We \nhave probably twice that number who are underinsured. We have senior \ncitizens for which Medicare does not pay for prescription drug benefits \nin many of our States, or cover very little of it, who are faced with \nthose expenses. We have a lot of elderly people--we do not talk about \nthis much--who are terrified that they are going to have to go to the \npoorhouse before anybody will help them with catastrophic expenses, if, \nGod forbid, they can't live at home.\n  Right now--my colleague from Wisconsin knows this well; this has been \none of his priorities--we have not put anywhere near the resources we \nshould put into assisted living so people can stay at home and live as \nnear a normal circumstance as possible. That is a big family issue.\n  Let's think about this for a moment. From little children--under 4 \nfeet tall, who are beautiful, all of them--to people who are elderly \nand are having a hard time paying their health care bills, and \nespecially at the very end of their lives, who are frail and are \nwondering can they stay at home and live with dignity and wondering who \nwill help them, or if, God forbid, they have to be in a nursing home \nbecause of Alzheimer's disease or whatever the case may be, that across \nthe board we have not made the investment.\n  There is a lot we need to do as a nation. These are important \npriorities, not only for our country, not only for California or \nMinnesota. That isn't the right way to say it. These are important \nfamily values. I say to Senator Boxer from California, what I am asking \nis: Where are our priorities that focus on family values?\n  To me, it is a family value to come out and talk about tax credits or \na direct investment of money to make sure child care is affordable. It \nis a family value to make sure people, at the end of their lives, or \ntoward the end of their lives, who have worked hard and have built this \ncountry, should not have to be in terror that there won't be anybody to \nhelp them stay at home, or, if they are in a nursing home, nobody to \nhelp them with their expenses.\n  The United States of America--I love this country--is the only \ncountry where you have to go to the poorhouse before you are eligible \nfor any help--Medicaid, Medicare assistance. Clearly, as a nation, in \nterms of our own priorities, we are going to have to start valuing the \nwork of adults who work with children. We are going to have to start \nvaluing the work of adults who work with elderly people. We pay them $6 \nor $7 or $8 an hour, with no health care benefits. This cannot be done \non the cheap.\n\n  We have all these challenges. We are talking about $100 billion the \nfirst 10 years, and then the second 10 years, $750 billion. That is \nwhat this costs to provide a blank check benefit to the wealthiest 2 \npercent of the population.\n  We have all these challenges before us in terms of Medicare, in terms \nof Social Security, in terms of making sure there is health security \nfor families, in terms of making sure we get it right for our kids. \nThey are the ones who we are going to be asking a lot of by the year \n2020.\n  In the words of Rabbi Hillel: If not now, when? If we can't invest in \nour children now, when will we? If we can't invest in the health and \nthe skills and the intellect of our children now, when will we ever do \nthat?\n  So I say to my colleagues, I just mention one amendment which I hope \nto be able to bring to the floor on this bill, which will talk about \nrather than all of these benefits just going to the wealthiest 2 \npercent, how about an additional refundable tax credit to help families \nafford child care expenses?\n  I say to my colleague from California, and other colleagues as well, \nI am for patient protection, I am for passing legislation that provides \nnot only patient protection but provides caregivers protection. \nDemoralized caregivers are not good caregivers. I think doctors and \nnurses ought to be in the kind of position to practice medicine the way \nthey thought they could when they were in nursing or medical school.\n  But the other issue is all the people who fall between the cracks who \nhave no health security. I am amazed that universal health care \ncoverage is not back on the table. I do not believe for a moment that \nthe United States of America, the wealthiest country in the world, with \na booming economy, and record surpluses at the moment, cannot provide \nhealth security for American citizens, for families in this country.\n  You can't have it all ways. If my Republican colleagues want to come \nout and say their priority is to provide a great tax benefit for the \nwealthiest 2 percent of the population, which is going to cost us $850 \nbillion over the next 20 years, then not only are we not going to be \nable to do right by Medicare, not only are we not going to be able to \nprovide prescription drug costs, but we are not even going to begin to \nbe able to talk about how we reach the goal of health security for \nevery American citizen, for all the families in this country.\n  What are our priorities? Instead of moving forward on this piece of \nlegislation, we ought to be focusing on health security for American \ncitizens. Not that we need to look to the polls to give us guidance, \nbut not surprisingly, along with education, health security for \nfamilies and citizens, emerge as top issues.\n  I will mention two other issues in terms of what we could be doing \nand what we should be doing, instead of repealing the estate tax \nblanket repeal, across the board, benefits going to the wealthiest 2 \npercent of the population. I think I speak for every Senator, Democrat \nand Republican, on this one. In 1997, we passed what was called the \nBalanced Budget Act. Some people voted for it; some people voted \nagainst it. I am glad I voted against it. Different people vote \ndifferent ways. If it wasn't then, it is crystal clear now that what we \nhave done to the Medicare reimbursement by so dramatically cutting it \nhas had a catastrophic effect on our hospitals and on our nursing \nhomes, especially in our rural communities.\n  I attended a recent gathering at White Hospital in Hoyt Lakes, up on \nthe Iron Range. Hospitals in a State such as Minnesota, where we don't \nhave the fat in the system, do not make excessive profits at all. They \nare going to go under. We are going to have more and more hospital \nclosings. These hospitals are community institutions. These hospitals \nare important to communities, not only because rural America doesn't do \nwell; when people are trying to decide if they want to live in a rural \ncommunity, they want to know whether they can afford to live in the \ncommunity: will there be a job at a decent wage? Can they afford to \nfarm? Are they going to get a decent price?\n  The second thing they want to know is whether they want to live in a \nrural\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\ncommunity. If they don't have good health care and good education, they \nare not going to do it.\n  Last year, we said we fixed this problem. We restored about 10 \npercent of the cuts. Again, I am not now talking about universal health \ncare coverage, although I believe our country must embrace this idea. I \nwill introduce a bill next week, working with the Service Employees \nInternational Union. It is a decentralized health insurance program. I \nlike it a lot. I want to get it back on the agenda. I think it is \nimportant that we have a constituency to fight for it in the country.\n  I am not even talking about prescription drug benefits. I am not even \ntalking about major reform. I am saying, I don't know how in the world \nwe go forward with this kind of across-the-board blanket repeal with \nthe benefits going to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population when \nwe aren't even getting it right in terms of getting the reimbursement \nthat our health care providers actually deserve back in our States.\n  I will mention one other issue. Senator Feingold is here on the \nfloor, along with Senator Boxer, Senator Reid, and Senator Burns. \nInstead of going forward with this tax scheme, why aren't we dealing \nwith a core issue: reform. Why aren't we debating campaign finance \nreform? There is probably a pretty strong correlation. Some of the \nprograms I have talked about and some of the values I have talked \nabout, the people who would most benefit are not the heavy hitters, not \nthe givers. They are not the investors and big contributors. Clearly, \nthe wealthiest 2 percent of the population are among the ranks of the \nbiggest givers, although there is not a one-to-one correlation. \nClearly, at the very top, many people I know in Minnesota and I think \naround the country think we ought to get our priorities straight. We \nought to start with some of the priorities I have talked about.\n\n  Why aren't we dealing with reform? When are we going to get to \ndealing with the ways in which money has come to dominate politics? \nThere is the McCain-Feingold bill. There is the clean money/clean \nelection efforts in different States. I have introduced that \nlegislation. One of the things I would like to do is to at least change \nthree words of the Federal election code which would enable States, if \nthey want to, to apply clean money/clean election to Federal races. If \nthe State of Wisconsin or Minnesota said it would like to apply this to \nState legislative races but also to Federal races, it ought to be able \nto do that.\n  Whatever your own preference, I think people in our country are \nbegging us to move forward on a reform agenda and to give them a \npolitical process in which they can believe. I think citizens in our \ncountry are yearning for politicians they can believe. They are \nyearning for a Senate and House of Representatives in which they can \nbelieve. They are yearning for a political process in which they can \nparticipate. Right now there is so much disillusionment and \ndisengagement, it should worry all of us who believe in public service. \nI can't think of anything we could do that would be more important than \nto pass significant, substantive campaign finance reform, instead of a \ntax scheme in its present form providing the benefits to the wealthiest \n2 percent.\n  Couldn't we be talking about campaign finance reform? Couldn't we be \ntalking about renewing democracy in America? Couldn't we be talking \nabout how to restore confidence in the Government and the political \nprocess? Couldn't we be talking about renewing our national vow of \nequal opportunity for every child and affordable child care? Couldn't \nwe be talking about how to help families do well by their kids so they \ncan do well by our country and could do well by our States? Couldn't we \nbe talking about how to help men and women who want to go on to higher \neducation afford higher education? Couldn't we be talking about making \nsure elderly people can afford prescription drugs? Couldn't we be \ntalking about how to have more health security for people in our \ncountry? So many citizens fall in between the cracks; so many citizens \nfeel so insecure. Couldn't we be talking about all of that and more \nwith a booming economy and record surpluses? Couldn't we now get some \nresources back in the communities so our families could do better, so \nour children could do better, so that we all would be doing better \nbecause we all would be doing better, which is what a community is \nabout? I think we could. That is where we ought to be focusing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Montana yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been advised by the two managers of \nthe Interior appropriations bill--and this has been approved by the two \nleaders--that we would ask all Members to notify their respective \nCloakrooms and/or Senator Byrd or Senator Gorton that by 6 o'clock \ntonight they should get all their amendments to either the Cloakroom or \nto the two leaders. It will be a finite list of amendments. Then the \ntwo leaders, the two managers of the bill can work through that and at \nsome time have the actual amendments in their hands. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my friend \nfrom Minnesota on this issue. I am not really sure if he was talking \nabout families or not. The standard of living that this country enjoys \nhas to be attributed in part to parents, moms and dads, grandmas and \ngrandpas, and their ability to pass on some of their wealth to the next \ngeneration.\n  We all work hard for our kids. I don't know of a parent who doesn't \nwork for their kids in this country. While we were doing that, we \nelevated the standard of living and the wealth of this country for more \npeople than any other society on the face of the planet.\n  I didn't come from very wealthy folks.\n  My dad was a small farmer in Missouri with 160 acres, two rocks, and \none dirt. But last year, I lost one of my elderly aunts, a sister to my \nfather. In her estate, I inherited only one thing in the will--a 1991 \nLincoln Town Car. I have never owned a Lincoln in my life. But you know \nwhat happened to that old car? It was sold in the estate sale to pay \nfor the taxes. I was mad. Well, I am not saying we are doing badly now; \nwhat I am saying is, forget about the top 2 percent that the other side \ntalks about because they don't pay estate taxes, folks. They have CPAs \nand lawyers. They can set aside trusts and do a lot of things to guard \ntheir fortunes and pass it on to the next generation of the family. It \nis the middle who gets hit. It is the man and wife who started off as a \nyoung couple and built a business. They pass on, the Government taxes \nit again after it has been taxed all of those years.\n  So how much do you want these folks to give? We could have been \ntalking about a lot of things today. We could have already had an H-1B \nvisa bill, which is being blocked by the other side. They didn't like a \nlockbox for Social Security. They didn't like education reform, so they \nblocked that too.\n  Now we are talking about a simple estate tax. To give you an idea, I \nhave some good friends who live up in the middle part of Montana, and \nthey are not wealthy, either. But this is who gets hurt. This is real \nstuff, not pie in the sky. This is not philosophical. This is plain old \nmiddle America.\n  These folks lost their father and were given, starting in 1991, \nestate taxes of $4,584.81. Then they started making regular payments. \nIn 1992, $13,000; in 1993, $15,000; in 1994, $14,000; in 1995, $14,000; \nin 1996, $16,000; in 1997, $15,000; in 1998, $12,000; in 1999, $12,000, \nand they have another payment coming up this December. They have been \npaying on this for their father who has been dead for 13 years. These \naren't wealthy people. I know them personally. That is who this falls \non. The top 2 percent? That is a myth and everyone should know it.\n  Some folks in Polson, MT, have a series of small theaters. They are \nin little bitty towns in Montana. They are scared to death of this \nthing. They are getting to the age now where they are starting to \nworry. They have to set up some ways to shield themselves, but they are \nfinding out that being that small, they can't. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to me, dated July 10, \n2000, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 10, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Please eliminate the estate tax. My \n     husband and I and our children have worked for thirty years \n     to build a stable family business which provides us with a \n     modest living. We expected to pass it on to our grown \n     children who are working with us, but upon our death they \n     will be forced to sell pay the estate tax.\n       We own movie theaters in seven small towns in Montana and \n     one is in Idaho, populations ranging from 2,500 to 10,000. We \n     purchased the first one in 1971 a few months before our \n     youngest daughter was born and the last theater was in 1992. \n     It has been a family business, our daughters grew-up in the \n     theater business, earning their first money selling popcorn. \n     Now our oldest daughter and her husband are working full time \n     as film booker and general manager. We would like to leave \n     this operating business to our children, but it will not be \n     possible if they must pay an estate tax on the appraised \n     value of the business and buildings it has taken us years to \n     accumulate and renovate.\n       The income of our business could not support the extra \n     expense of the estate tax. The theater business is similar to \n     other small business and farms where the value of the land, \n     buildings, and equipment does not equate with the small \n     profit derived from it. A huge tax on the value of the \n     business is an extra expense the business can not pay. \n     Therefore, upon our death, the theaters must be sold to pay \n     the taxes.\n       When this business, our family has built, is sold it will \n     leave our son-in-law and daughter with no means of support \n     after devoting half their life to the company. They will be \n     forced to start over at middle age. Yes, they will have some \n     money, the amount remaining after taxes, real-estate, \n     accountants, and lawyers fees, but certainly not enough to \n     support them through old age. if the operation is not \n     disrupted they can continue to be a stable tax payer and \n     employer. I would also expect they would continue to provide \n     quality movie theaters and possibly add more theaters in \n     other small towns.\n       Please, this family has worked thirty years to build a \n     profitable stable business we expected to continue into the \n     next generations, please eliminate the Estate Tax.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ayron Pickerill.\n\n  Should we be talking about this? Yes. Should we be talking about an \nenergy spike? Yes. I have a situation in Montana where I have one \nconcentrator that concentrates copper ore. They were shut down because \nof an electricity spike because of a policy of not allowing \nconstruction or the ability to generate more electricity. Maybe we \nbetter start talking about that. Yet some would embrace a policy to \ntear down the hydrodams on the Snake River and the Columbia River. \nMaybe we should start talking about that because that is going to throw \na lot of moms and dads out of work. A lot of grandmas and grandpas \naren't going to like that, either.\n  Who it hits is the small farmer. I can look around this body and I \nsee my good friend from Wisconsin, where there are small farms over \nthere; most of them are in the dairy business. They feed a few cattle, \nand they have hogs and a few sheep. They will find it very difficult to \npass that along to their next of kin without paying a big tax. Why? \nBecause during all this time we have been told of this great economic \nboom--and it has been on paper--rural America has not participated. \nPrices on the farm have not been that frisky, and they are not this \nyear, either. What happens is that you are land rich and cash poor. \nShould something happen to the principal on that farm, it will probably \nsell at the steps. They will have to give it up to pay the estate taxes \nbecause, as land has gone up in value, just because of the demand for \nthe land, not for what it will produce, it will have to sell.\n  If you want open areas and you want to protect the environment, do \naway with this estate tax and allow the open areas of America to stay \nopen areas of America. As I have stated before, the truly wealthy do \nnot pay that tax because they have CPAs and lawyers. They have an army \nof folks. They make sure they won't ever have to pay this tax. So it \nfalls on the middle.\n  Large estates are still subject to capital gains. The other side \nwon't talk about capital gains reform. Nonetheless, the large estates \nis where capital gains fall. Study after study shows that this tax \nimposes significant costs on the economy in terms of lower economic \ngrowth and less job creation. We are hurting enough in Montana.\n  We have to get our agriculture out of the doldrums. We have to be \nable to build an estate with a future, with the ability to give it to \nthe next generation, letting it grow again, because we are a small \nbusiness in Montana. I guess I am worrying about the folks who are on \nthe land because I have participated in some of those sales. I am an \nauctioneer and proud of it. I never had the handle of being a lawyer--\nonly an old cowboy who sputters numbers pretty well. I have sold out \nthose folks and I know what they feel like. In fact, I sold out one, \nand when the sale was over and the settlement was all done, I gave them \nback my commission because, had I not done that, they would not have \nhad anything.\n  If you want to do something for the children of this country, you \nought to do something for education. If you want to do something about \nthe quality of life in your sundown years, then allow estates to grow \nand allow them to be passed on to the next generation. We all work for \nour kids. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about a \nvalue we have had in this country since its inception. That is why we \nhave grown. That is why we have more people who enjoy the good life in \nthis society than in any other society.\n  That is what it is all about. We have a way in times of surplus of \nbuilding even more wealth in your hometown rather than the wealth in \nWashington, DC. That wealth is in a bureaucracy that produces nothing. \nLet communities build. Don't jerk that money out of those communities. \nLet it grow. Let it grow at home. Let's pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe under a previous order I will be \nnext to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I hope people have been listening to this debate today \nbecause, frankly, I think it has been an important one so far. There \nare many people who are students of politics, and sometimes they get \nlost in what one party stands for versus what another party stands for. \nI think when you listen to these debates on the floor, many times you \nwon't get the differences. But I think today you will get the \ndifferences between the parties. I think that is important. Regardless \nof what side you agree with, I think you need to know where people \nstand.\n  One of the absolute rights of the majority in the Senate--regardless \nof whether it is Republicans in charge, which is what we have now, or \nthe Democrats, which we had when I first arrived here--is that the \nleaders have the very strong ability to set the agenda. That is one of \nthe good things you get when you are in the leadership. You get to \ndecide what you want to come to the floor. You get to take a look at \nthe array of issues with which we deal, whether it is education or the \nenvironment or whether it is our children or our elderly or \nprescription drug benefits or Patients' Bill of Rights or pro-business \nlegislation--whatever it is that you believe are the most important \nthings. You get to decide which one of those things should come before \nthe Senate.\n  As our majority leader has said many times, we are pressed for time. \nWe have very few days remaining in this legislative agenda. We are in \nan election year. In many ways that limits our ability because of the \npress of time and the need to go to conventions, et cetera.\n  I think what this majority chooses to bring before us says a lot \nabout who they are, whose side they are on, and in what they believe. \nThe way my side of the aisle--the Democratic side of the aisle--\nresponds to that agenda says a lot about who we are, whose side we are \non, what we believe in, and for what we are going to fight. Today is a \nperfect day to draw the contrast.\n  Senator Lott has chosen to put before us a repeal of the estate tax. \nI think you need to look at what that really means. What does it cost \nus in hard, cold dollars to repeal the estate tax? The answer is almost \n$1 trillion over 20 years.\n  Who in our society benefits from this repeal? What else could we do \nwith that money if we decided to put this particular issue perhaps a \nlittle bit lower down on the priority list?\n  Once you look at all of these questions, I believe you will get a \nclear distinction of where the Democratic\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\nParty is and where the Republican Party is. I think that is good. You \nmay come out supporting the Democratic Party, thinking they are on your \nside, or you may come out supporting the Republican Party and say they \nare on your side. That is what politics is all about. That is what \ndebating is all about. But most important to me is that there are these \ndefining differences and there is one of those defining differences.\n  Senator Burns spoke about how repealing the estate tax is going to \nhelp ordinary Americans, and how important it is to help ordinary \nAmericans.\n  I say to him that if he looks at the estate tax today, there are some \ninequities we can fix, and that we should fix that deal with family \nfarms and smaller businesses and individuals. But to repeal the entire \nestate tax is helping those at the very top of the ladder. When I say \ntop of the ladder, I mean those earning hundreds of millions of dollars \nand whose estates are worth hundreds of millions of dollars--perhaps \ninto the billions of dollars.\n  If that is considered helping the ordinary person, then I guess I \ndon't get it because when I travel around my State, the ordinary people \nand the average person are working really hard every day. Do you know \nwhat they are bringing home? They are bringing home $30,000 a year, \n$40,000 a year. And in California where we have to earn more, we have \ncouples working. If they really do well, they may bring in $60,000, \n$70,000, or $80,000 a year. They are struggling at that range to buy a \nhome. They are struggling at that range to find child care that is \naffordable and that is quality. They are struggling to help their \nparents meet their medical bills, yes, their pharmaceutical costs or \nperhaps long-term care or college tuition. They are struggling.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that to couch this \nrepeal of the estate tax as helping the average person is terribly \nmisleading. Let me tell you why.\n  Right now, we have an estate tax that essentially says to a couple: \nYou are exempted if you are worth up to about $1 million. It is exactly \n$1.2 million. You are exempt. There is an argument to be made that is \nnot high enough given the value of housing, and so on. I can see why \nthat ought to be raised.\n  The Democrats have an alternative. We raise it to $4 million for a \ncouple so that in the future, children of couples who leave an estate \nof $4 million would have to pay nothing but only under $4 million. Do \nyou know how many estates? That is a very small number of estates. \nProbably a percent and a half or so.\n  We say to farmers and small businesses: Yes, we understand the \nproblem. We are going to increase the exemption for you from $2.6 \nmillion for a couple to $8 million per couple by 2010. So we are saying \nthat to the small farmer and the businesspeople who for $8 million or \nless there is no estate taxes. Yes, it is going to cost something for \nour proposal, if we were offering it, because right now we haven't even \ngotten an agreement from the majority that we can offer our \nalternative. But it would cost $61 billion over 10 years compared to \n$105 billion over 10 years on the Republican side. It would cost over \nthe next 10 years $300 billion compared to $750 billion.\n  The interesting thing is in our plan we essentially exempt almost \neverybody, except the very tiptop of the wealth scale. Yes, the Donald \nTrumps, the Leona Helmsleys, the Bill Gates of the world, who did so \nwell in this the greatest country of all. Yes, their heirs may have to \npay something to help the people who want the same chance they had. \nBecause what do we do with the estate tax? It goes into defending our \ncountry. It goes into educating our people. It goes into health \nresearch to find a cure for Alzheimer's. The people at the very top of \nthe ladder who I talk to say: You know, Barbara, you have a lot of work \nto do. One of them isn't worrying about me. I am good. I am OK. My \nheirs can pay a little bit. It is OK.\n  But what do the Republicans do? They want to repeal the estate tax--\nnot just for the small family farms, as we want to, and the small \nbusinesses and make sure that if they are worth $8 million they don't \nhave to pay anything. They want to protect the people who are worth $10 \nmillion, $12 million, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200. Do I hear \nmore? Yes, I do because there is no top. If you are worth $1 billion, \nyour estate doesn't have to pay anything under their proposal.\n  To stand here and say that is protecting ordinary people--the average \nAmerican--is just not true. I would prefer, if this was an honest \nstatement, to say that we are going to help the richest people in this \ncountry because that is what they are doing. That is what they are \ndoing.\n  This is an honest statement: Helping the richest people in this \ncountry who are worth $1 billion, $2 billion. You name it; there is no \ncap. To do that, it will cost $850 billion over the next 20 years.\n  We can fix the problem with the estate tax for less than half of \nthat, and we can do some wonderful things with the rest of the funds \nthat we save. What can we do? Why don't we look at the Tax Code. Why \ndon't we understand that people who send kids to college have a very \nbig expense. They could use a little help with a tax deduction or a tax \ncredit.\n  I held a hearing on the crisis in quality child care. In California \ntoday--and I assume it is similar in Nevada--for every five kids who \nneed quality child care, only one can get a slot. It is so expensive \nthat people are saying they have to choose between paying their \nmortgage late and being assessed a late fee and paying child care.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I was in San Francisco recently and saw a headline in the \nnewspaper that in San Francisco, nannies--people who take care of \nkids--are being paid an average of $60,000 a year.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is out of control.\n  Mr. REID. What does that do to people who work for $30,000 a year who \nhave a child or children? It makes it impossible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We had testimony from parents and teachers who said \nsometimes parents are dropping their kids off at places where one would \nnot want to drop a pet off, let alone a child.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for another question, the Senator \nfrom California has led the Congress in afterschool programs. We need \nmore money for afterschool programs. Some people have no money for the \n2 or 3 hours after their child gets out of school and they get home. So \nwe have latchkey kids, kids running in gangs.\n\n  Is that where it goes bad?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is absolutely correct. My friend is right. We \ntried so desperately in this Senate to simply get the funding for \nafterschool care up to the President's level. We failed.\n  Where were my friends who say they are fighting to repeal the estate \ntax, to help ordinary people? Where were they when I had a chance to \ntake another million kids off the waiting list and put them into \nafterschool care so they wouldn't join gangs? They could not find the \nfunds for that.\n  That is why I think this debate we are having today, I say to my \nassistant Democratic leader, is so important. It is all about \npriorities. The other side gets the chance to set the agenda. They \noverlook the people who need child care. They overlook the people who \nneed afterschool. They do not want to do school construction. They do \nnot want smaller class sizes. They do not want a real Patients' Bill of \nRights. They do not want a guaranteed prescription drug benefit. Any \ndon't even look at other tax breaks that are going to help people who \nsend their kids to college with a tuition tax break.\n  They come out here, with their hearts full, and fight for the \nwealthiest people in this country. It is a fact.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for another question, does the \nSenator recall how much money she was begging for on the elementary and \nsecondary education bill, as well as on other occasions for afterschool \nprograms? Remember how little that was?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Initially, it was little. Now we are simply asking for \nthe President's level, which would be a couple hundred million dollars. \nI say to my friend, it is a lot less than this bill loses over the 20-\nyear period.\n  Mr. REID. I further say to the Senator, as I understand it, in the \nsecond 10 years of this bill, we are talking not about millions; we are \ntalking about billions. We are talking $750 billion.\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\n  The Senator is saying if we had the Cadillac of afterschool programs, \nit would cost $200 million?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If we had another $200 million, that would help reduce \nthis waiting list. We were not able to get any increase whatever out of \nthis particular Congress this year.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, for each child who is kept from \ngraduating from school, does the Senator recognize the cost on our \nsociety when that child drops out of school?\n  Mr. President, 3,000 children drop out of school each day. It costs \nour society untold suffering. That child unable to graduate from high \nschool is less than they could be. It adds to the cost of the criminal \njustice system. It adds to the cost of the welfare system. It adds to \nthe cost ultimately of the education system. Is the Senator also aware \nthat 84 percent of the people who are in prisons in America today have \nno high school education?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was not aware it was 84 percent, but my friend has been \na leader on the whole issue of dropouts. His point is well taken.\n  We are looking at $850 billion over the next 20 years, just on this \ntax break, and they have others they will come up with, that are not \ncapped, also, that will give to the top people. Yet they don't want to \nspend money on what will really make our society strong.\n\n  The point the Senator makes is so correct because I remember in the \ndays I was in the House with the Senator, tracking the costs of a high \nschool dropout to society every year. It was hundreds of millions of \ndollars in the course of their lifetime.\n  The Senator is exactly right, if we are talking about crime, if we \nare talking about drug abuse, if we are talking about alcohol abuse, if \nwe are talking about people who are not productive, who cannot hold \ndown jobs, who feel undervalued because they don't have a high school \neducation. These are the competing priorities.\n  It amazes me how our friends can come with so much passion for the \nDonald Trumps, for the Leona Helmsleys, for the people who make all \nthis money, and not have even a speck of compassion, it seems to me, \nfor ordinary people.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator recognizes that the minority, the Democrats, \nrecognize this, and we want to increase the size of the estates that \nare not subject to the inheritance tax.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. It would increase the general exemption from $1.35 million \nper couple to $2 million per couple in 2 years, by the year 2002; and \n$4 million per couple by the year 2010.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I spoke about that.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware this makes just a few estates every \nyear even subject to the tax?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly. We move also on the exemption for farms and \nsmall businesses, and we go up to $8 million per couple by 2010 on that \nladder, as well.\n  We are only talking about extremely large estates and a tiny \npercentage of people in this country. It is in the hundreds, really, \nwho will wind up paying any type of estate tax--only those who have \nmade it so big that, yes, maybe they can just give back a little bit to \nthis country to pay for the defense of this country.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand the Senator, the Senator is saying the \nminority wants to raise the exemption of the estate tax. We want to, in \neffect, exclude most every small business and small farm in America \nfrom the estate tax.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. In addition to that, we are saying the really rich in this \ncountry, rather than give them a tax break, we should look at giving a \ntuition tax credit for people who want to send their children to \ncollege.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. REID. We believe there should be some slack cut for child care \nprograms that we have discussed on the Senate floor. And it would not \nbe a bad idea to do something with afterschool programs and a number of \nother areas that help the working men and women of this country, and \nnot the super rich--and I mean super rich. We are talking about a tax \nfor not a millionaire, not a multimillionaire tax, but we are looking \nat maybe a billionaire tax.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is what we are essentially saying. We really are \nsaying that. That is why I say the question, whose side are you on, is \nvery relevant to this debate.\n  We recognize the fact there has been inflation. We need to take \nanother look at this estate tax. We are willing to make sure we help \nour family farmers. We want to help our small businesses. We want to \nhelp our individuals so their kids do not find themselves in a bind \nwhen they inherit the wealth from their families. We are willing to do \nthat. We know President Clinton is willing to sign such a bill. We know \nhe is going to veto the Republican version because he believes it is \nunfair to the middle class. He believes it is unfair.\n  What we are saying is we can take care of the problem and help those \nwho have kids in college or who have kids in day care. We can give a \nprescription drug benefit that is guaranteed through Medicare to our \nseniors. We can do all these things and still have enough to do some \ndebt reduction and a little bit for afterschool programs. That is how \nexpensive this repeal is.\n  Mr. REID. Under the Senator's time, will she yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator represents by far the largest populated State \nin the country, 33, 34 million people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Its neighbor, the State of Nevada, the State I represent, \nhas approximately 2 million people. The State of Nevada, under the old \nformula, does the Senator understand, has only 308 taxable estates?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, 308.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 308.\n  The other thing I ask the Senator is every State--I should not say \nevery State because I am not certain it is true but I believe it is \ntrue--every State in the Union has an inheritance tax; if not every \nState, virtually every State. The State of Nevada 10 years ago passed \nits own inheritance tax.\n  Does the Senator realize there is an offset; that is, of the Federal \ntax that is collected, if a State has an inheritance tax of its own, it \ncomes out first and goes to the State of Nevada or the State of \nCalifornia, for example, rather than the Federal Government?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, 25 percent of the tax, as I understand it, goes back \nto our States.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator if she knows, as I said, a portion of the \nestate tax goes to the States via estate tax credits as a \nrevenuesharing provision with the States? In Nevada, 100 percent of the \namount received through this estate tax credit is used for education, \n50 percent is used for State university support, and 50 percent is used \nfor elementary and secondary education. I ask my friend: Is it more \nimportant that we continue that, paid by only a fraction of the people \nin this country? In Nevada, instead of 308, under the new formula, it \nwould be probably less than 100 estates, maybe closer to 70 estates.\n  The question is, Isn't it better we have--and I do not mean to \ndenigrate him because he has done good things for the country; Bill \nGates is worth $70 billion. If some misfortune overtook Bill Gates, \nshouldn't that huge estate pay some amount of money for education to \nthe people of the State of Washington?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I answer that question in this way: I was discussing with \nanother Senator a conversation he had with a very wealthy man who had \nmade hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of dollars, in the course \nof his lifetime in this country. Maybe this person is unusually kind \nand good hearted.\n\n  This person was saying to him: This great country made it possible \nfor me to have this kind of accumulation of wealth, which is far beyond \nwhat any of my heirs need to have.\n  He can take care of his heirs for generations to come.\n  He said: But I have to admit that I earned all this money because a \nlot of folks worked for me, and those people got up every day. They did \nnot become millionaires, but they did fine, and I want to make sure \nthat, yes, I can help their kids.\n  That is what happens with an estate tax. How do we spend it? We \ndefend the country for those kids. We help with\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\neducation. We help with health research. We may find the cure for \nAlzheimer's for one of Bill Gates' future generations because of the \nfunds we are able to put into health research.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle, in the name of helping \nordinary people, are ignoring the fact that the Democratic \nalternative--which at this point we do not have permission to offer but \nI am very hopeful we will get that chance; it would be wonderful; they \ncan support our alternative. They can ease the burden on the small \nfamily farms. They can ease the burden on the small businesses. They \ncan ease the burden on couples who have accumulated wealth through, \nsay, buying a house, for example, which went up greatly in value, such \nas they have in California. I do not want those kids to have to sell \nthe home. That is why I am supporting the Democratic alternative.\n  We have an excellent alternative that costs less than half of what \ntheirs does and allows us to help people pay for college. It will help \ngrandmas and grandpas get prescription drugs. If our friends on the \nother side of the aisle really want a bill to become law, they should \njoin hands with us because President Clinton said he will sign that \nbill. He will not sign the bill that he believes is helping people who \nare worth billions of dollars.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Even in Silicon Valley, where there has been tremendous \nsuccess and which has been the driving force of the high-tech industry, \nwith the expensive homes, the Democratic version would help people \nthere, wouldn't it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe so.\n  Mr. REID. Of course it would, I say to my friend, because even though \nthe estates there are bigger than a lot of places, we are talking about \nraising this to millions of dollars.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. REID. Four million dollars.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All the people who need the help will be helped under the \nDemocratic alternative.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, even the very rich will be helped; \nisn't that true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no doubt about it. If you define wealthy as $5 \nmillion, $6 million, $7 million, you are not going to have to pay \nanything if you are handing down a business, and up to $4 million for \njust the normal family exemption.\n  I say to my friend, another point I think we have not made strongly \nenough is that it is estimated by people on the Finance Committee that \nthe Republican plan could discourage $250 billion in charitable \ncontributions over 10 years. Why is that? We know people look at their \nestate planning and they look at different ways they are going to \nhandle it. They say: OK, I will give so much to Uncle Sam, but I also \nwant to give some to my favorite charities.\n\n  The charities are up in arms about this. My friends on the other side \nof the aisle are often saying how important the role of charities are, \nand they are right; they are very important. Yet we have estimates that \nsay the drain on charitable pursuits could go down $250 billion. That \nis not good news for those folks out there who run the community \nsymphonies and the ballets and the various nonprofits.\n  If we proceed with the Democratic alternative, we will be easing the \nburden on the people who need the burden eased; it is costing less than \nhalf of what the Republican plan will cost; it is saying to the \nwealthiest among us--and I am talking about the superwealthiest, as my \nfriends put it--we want you to do well, but we know you understand the \nfacts of life which are if we take this kind of money out of the \nFederal Government, we cannot do enough for our child care tax credits \nand for our afterschool programs. We cannot do enough for those in the \nmiddle class who are sending their kids to college. That costs a lot.\n  The fact is, we have other things we can do that can bring much more \nrelief to ordinary, average American families.\n  I am going to close the way I opened, and that is to reiterate that I \nthink this debate today has been a very important debate. It is true we \nare taking some time here, but many times people complain they do not \nsee the differences between the parties; they do not understand what we \nstand for.\n  If they did nothing more than to look at the Democratic alternative, \nwhich cures a problem but is fair in its reach, if they did nothing \nmore than take a look at the things that we still need to do, the \nunfinished business around here, to help our people--if I have to hear \none more story about a patient in California who tells me that she \ncannot afford her prescription drugs, when I know we have the \nresources; just look at the Republican proposal--if you just exempted \nthose who need it, you would have enough left over to take care of the \ngrandma and the grandpa and the person sending their kid to college and \nthe person struggling to pay for child care; we would have enough to do \nthe things we need to do.\n  I hope the American people will take heed of this debate because in \nthe end it is whose side are you on. I think at the end of the debate \nthey can truly answer the question: Whose side are the Republicans on? \nThe Donald Trumps, the Leona Helmsleys. Whose side are the Democrats \non? Ordinary working, middle-class families are who we want to help.\n  I yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand it, what the Senator is saying is, yes, we \nDemocrats are willing to lower the taxes on the wealthy, but we do not \nwant to take them away completely?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right. We are simply looking at the wealthy \npeople, who we believe are not being treated fairly because perhaps \ntheir wealth is tied up in a family farm, in a small business, in a \nprivate home, and we say, fair enough, we do not want to see your \nfamily be forced to sell these assets. We do not want that to happen. \nIn our alternative, we take care of this. But we do it in a way that is \nfiscally responsible, that leaves enough to take care of the pressing \nneeds of our people, which everybody seems to think we have--\nprescription drugs, afterschool care, making sure that our kids get a \ndecent quality education. Frankly, if we can just be moderate in our \napproach, we can do all of those things and come out on the side of \nordinary Americans and be proud of ourselves.\n  I only hope that as this debate moves forward, the Democrats have a \nright to offer our alternative, and that some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle will recognize that if they join with us, we \nwill have a bill that is fair, that is good, that can take care of our \nother needs, and that the President will sign into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of \nthe House legislation that would repeal the death tax for working \nAmericans. I support this bill because death taxes are just basically, \nbottom line, anti-American, antifamily, antieconomic, and antijob \ngrowth. The death taxes are just plain unfair. They are unjust, and \nthey must be eliminated.\n  I know our friends on the other side of the aisle are just so \nenamored by being able to take some dollars from somebody so they can \ndirect them to the causes they believe are the best. They want to \ndirect where the money goes. They are saying we should take these \ndollars from these individuals or these families or these groups and \nbring it to Washington so we can decide in Washington how the money \nshould be spent--not the individual who earned the money, not the trust \nfunds that they might set up.\n  They always throw around the names of Bill Gates, Donald Trump, and \nLeona Helmsley. I do not see anything wrong with what they have done \nand what they have contributed. But somehow if they want to direct or \ncontrol their money, even after death, somehow my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have a problem with that. In fact, if I am not \nmistaken, I think Mr. Gates has already set up a huge trust fund of \nabout $20 billion to be given to charitable causes.\n  I hear over there that there would be a reduction in charitable \ngiving. So somehow, if the Government took less of the money from you \nin taxes, you, in turn, would say: I have more money now, so I am going \nto give less to charity, or somehow, if the Government takes more from \nyou in taxes, you are going to be more charitable with the little bit \nyou have left.\n  I think the real debate here is, again, fairness, equity, and who is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\ncontrol or direct the money. Are we going to listen and have it all \ndirected from here; That somehow they know better how to spend the \nmoney? They want to generate, control, and grow more Government, that \nit is more efficient, can deliver better services, and is more fair to \nAmericans.\n  To me, this is nothing but greed on behalf of some politicians who \nwant to control people. As I said, even after they are dead, they want \nto take even more money from them.\n  But their estates give back just a ``little bit'' in taxes. I do not \ncall 55 percent of everything you worked for, and managed to save, put \naway, a ``little bit.'' Fifty-five percent--give back a ``little bit.'' \nOr the heirs should be happy to get half of the estate that your family \nhas worked for, for nothing. You have probably been a part of it. And \nthen after death, the Government can come in and grab 55 percent, and \nyou should be happy because you get what is left over. Don't say \nanything. Just sit there and be happy because the Federal Government, \nin all its wisdom, is going to direct those dollars to the best causes \nand, indirectly, somehow they are going to benefit you and every other \nAmerican.\n  There might be waste, fraud, and abuse going through the systems we \nhave today, but if we only pump a little more money into it, or if we \ncan only create more Government, somehow this is better than allowing \nan individual to decide how that money is going to be spent, what \ncharities that individual wants to give to, what educational programs \nthey want to support. But, no, somehow it is better if it comes to \nWashington.\n  But as you know, the Federal death tax is similar to the income tax. \nIt was first imposed as just a temporary measure to finance World War \nI. Ronald Reagan said: There is nothing more permanent than a temporary \nGovernment program.\n  This is just a great example. The excise tax on the telephone--that \nwas just repealed here a little while ago--imposed 100 years ago as a \ntemporary tax is another great example.\n  Here is a temporary tax to help finance World War I. It was \ntemporary. But once people get their hands on the money, they somehow \nbelieve they have more of a right to your labor than you do, that \nsomehow they have more of a right to the money that you have worked for \nor generated than you do.\n  Why? When death taxes became permanent in 1916, estates under $9 \nmillion--that is in today's dollars--were not taxed at all. Death taxes \nlater evolved to supposedly prevent the buildup of inherited wealth. \nThe Government wanted to prevent the buildup of inherited wealth.\n  This idea of social engineering has made the death taxes, which now \nrange from 37 percent to 55 percent, substantially higher than any \nother Federal taxes. The lowest estate tax rate is almost as high as \nthe highest income tax rate, which is now, thanks to President Bill \nClinton and the Democratic bill passed in 1993, the highest income tax \nrate, 39.6 percent.\n  Keep in mind the death taxes are levied on earnings and assets that \nhave already been subject to income, payroll taxes, and other taxes at \nthe Federal and State level. In other words, you have worked all your \nlife. You have paid taxes up front on your income, on your profits. \nThis is moneys that you have taken home after taxes, where you built an \nestate and somehow now they believe that you should pay just a ``little \nbit'' more--just a ``little bit''--and, oh, by the way, only on the \nmost wealthy in this country. If you have a farmer with $1 million out \nthere driving a 1975 pickup, and he happens to die unexpectedly, he is \namong those wealthy individuals that we talk about.\n  Yes, they throw around the names of Bill Gates and Donald Trump, as \nif somehow they are bad people, but what they do is they try to \ncamouflage the real reason for this bill, and that is, to get their \nhands on additional moneys. Despite the efforts by liberals, deaths \ntaxes have failed to accomplish their stated purposes and instead have \ncreated inequality and injustice that hurts millions of Americans. \nInstead, this is one of the most expensive taxes imposed, and it does \nsome of the most damage on the individuals who this money is taken \nfrom.\n  In fact, I think there are studies out there that have said, if we \neliminated the inheritance tax, the estate tax, the death tax, that it \nwould almost be a wash to the Federal Treasury because it costs \nbillions of dollars today to administer because of all the audits and \neverything that has to be done.\n  It is costing billions of dollars to impose this tax. Then when we \nlook at the damage it does to farms, to small businesses, to \nindividuals, jobs that are lost, businesses that are lost, tax dollars \nthat are lost, of course, in the process, the Government comes out \nprobably a loser. There are many who would bet that if we could \neliminate this death tax today, it would not affect the revenues and, \nin fact, we would probably have even larger economic growth; that the \nrevenues to the Federal Treasury would be even larger because of it.\n  It is a punitive, mean-spirited, unfair, unjust, antijob, \nantieconomic tax that the other side of the aisle seems to like to \nimpose on Americans, successful Americans or Americans just trying to \nhang on to their farm or their small business.\n  Let me give a few examples of how death taxes are hurting working \nAmericans. My good friends on the other side of the aisle say they \ndon't want to hear any more of these stories, but we have a lot of \nthese stories because they affect millions of Americans every year.\n  John Batey of Tennessee runs a 500-acre family farm that has been a \npart of the Batey family for about 192 years. John has spent all of his \nlife on his family's farm and, as most other farmers, he plans to be a \ngood steward of the land, to save and to build his assets and some day \nleave the farm to his children.\n  After the death of his father 5 years ago and the death of his mother \nlast June, John began to settle his parents' estate. As he was about to \ntake over the family farm, the IRS sent him a death tax bill for a \nquarter of a million dollars, on a 500-acre farm in Tennessee, a \nquarter of a million dollar tax bite. The value of the farmland had \nincreased significantly, but the death tax exemption has never been \nindexed. John had no choice but to sell some other assets. He also had \nto dip into their life savings and even borrow money to pay Uncle Sam.\n  Now, when we talk about wanting to have a prescription drug benefit, \neverything else, what kind of a financial shape has it put this family \nin? It has taken them from being able to pay and make due for \nthemselves and exposed them to financial ruin and the need possibly of \nhaving to come to the Government begging for help because we have taken \nall their money. Now they are in debt, have less of their assets, and \ntheir savings are gone so they can pay Uncle Sam this unfair, unjust \ndeath tax. Somehow the big spenders in Washington needed that money \nmore than John and his family needed it for their own well-being.\n  The story of Lee Ann Goddard Ferris, who testified during the Senate \nFinance Committee hearing, is another disheartening story. This isn't \nthe Bill Gates of the world. This isn't Donald Trump, Leona Helmsley. \nThis is Lee Ann Goddard Ferris. Her family owns a cattle ranch in Idaho \nwhich prospered through 60 years of hard work by her grandfather and \nfather. By the way, they accumulated this after they paid the taxes on \nall of their income up to this point. In the fall of 1993, her father \nwas accidentally killed when his clothing got caught in farm machinery. \nThe unexpected death was devastating on the family, but so was the news \nfrom their attorney. Later on he told them: There is no way you can \nkeep this place, absolutely no way. They said: Well, how can this be? \nWe own the land. We have no debt. We lost my father, but now how are we \ngoing to lose the ranch? We don't have a mortgage on this place.\n  According to Lee Ann, in her testimony before the Finance Committee:\n\n       Our attorney proceeded to pencil out the estate taxes . . . \n     and we all sat back in total shock.\n\n  When their mother dies, the lawyer told the family, estate taxes will \nbe $3.3 million. I know that is just a little bit, just giving back a \nlittle bit of what has been generated by Washington and this great \neconomy, not by the hard work of millions and millions of Americans. \nYou didn't do anything to create this economy. It all came out of here,\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\nout of Washington. You have benefited from it because of the \nbenevolence and the wisdom out of Washington, not your hard work, not \nyour brainpower, but Washington created this environment. We have heard \nthis on the floor, that because Washington has done this, you have been \nthe one who has taken advantage of it. So you should give back just a \nlittle bit to help, $3.3 million for a family in Idaho from a cattle \nranch, just a little bit.\n  According to Ferris, the family had to sell off a parcel of land. \nThey did this so they could buy a $1 million life insurance policy for \nher mother in the event that she should suddenly die. That would pay \noff one-third of the estate tax. The question still is, How will they \nhandle the remaining $2 million? They already had to sell some assets \nto go out and buy this huge insurance policy. That only takes care of \n33 percent. Who will pay the remaining $2 million? Ferris says she \ndoesn't know. When her mother passes away, they are going to have to \nfigure out another way of paying the other $2 million. Will that be in \nthe sale of more of their assets, selling off more of the farm, \nbasically driving them off the land and putting them somewhere else?\n  Timothy Scanlan, from my State of Minnesota, owns a family business. \nHis family has built their business over the last 80 years. Their \nbusiness has created many jobs. It has offered fine products. Again, \nthey have paid taxes all their lives on everything. You are taxed to \ndeath the way it is now; the estate tax just finishes the job. They \npaid taxes, and they have never asked the Government for a handout. \nWhen his father and mother died a few years ago, the estates tax took \nnearly 60 percent of the value of his family business. Mr. Scanlan \nsays:\n\n       I am now trying to plan for the fourth generation to take \n     over. As of today, it can't be done. We've worked so hard to \n     create something good that we've created a company that has \n     so much value that we would have to sell it in order to pay \n     the taxes. Families, companies and farmers like us are a \n     small minority working hard for generations only to have our \n     government tax us out of our family business.\n\n  This isn't Bill Gates. This isn't Donald Trump. This isn't Leona \nHelmsley. These are average Americans.\n  There are many more stories such as these clearly showing that the \ndeath tax has hurt hard-working Americans the most. Not the rich; the \nrich can hire the lawyers. They can hire the estate planners to avoid \nall these taxes. We are not talking about tax relief for the wealthy, \nas some claim. I am not here trying to defend the wealthy. They are \ngoing to take care of themselves. It might cost them a couple million \ndollars to go out and hire people to set up the shelters they need. \nThey will do that.\n  Why are we doing this? Why are we costing millions of dollars in the \nprivate sector, billions of dollars in the public sector to try to levy \nan unfair, unjust, antieconomic tax that hurts millions of Americans?\n\n  Realizing this injustice, the Republican-controlled Congress began to \nprovide death tax relief in 1997 to farmers and small business owners \nby increasing the exemption from $600,000 to $1.2 million. When I \ntalked about how increasing taxes of the Federal Government or \neliminating the estate tax would almost be a wash, statistics show that \nabout one-third of the surpluses we enjoy today are the direct result \nof the tax cuts in 1997. It means if we can reduce taxes, the economy \ngrows. The economic pie gets bigger. The economic opportunities are \nbetter. The wages can improve. But, no, if you tax something, you get \nless of it. If that is what we want to do, continue to tax Americans \ninto submission with these death taxes and having to break up or sell \ntheir businesses and farms, that is exactly what this unfair tax does.\n  There are crocodile tears about how if we can only collect this \nmoney, how much good can we do with this. Washington can do so much \ngood. Just let us collect this tax, just a little bit of it--by the \nway, 55 percent--let us collect it, and we will continue these great \nGovernment programs. In fact, we will even create some new ones to go \nalong with them.\n  Last year, we passed the Taxpayers Refund Act. For the first time \never, we voted to completely repeal the Federal death tax. Despite the \nfact that the President's own White House conference on small business \nmade death tax repeal a top legislative priority, President Clinton \nvetoed this tax relief legislation.\n  When I travel around the State of Minnesota, I talk to hundreds of \nfarmers. The one thing they tell me would help them most is the repeal \nof the death tax.\n  The average age of the majority of the farmers in Minnesota is 58. \nWithin 10 years, there is going to be a tremendous shift of wealth of \nfarmland and farm assets in Minnesota. Right now a lot of those assets \nare going to go to the Government, and it is going to drive the next \ngeneration off the farm because they won't be able to afford to do it.\n  I don't know where those farm assets are going to end up, but, \nbecause of this unfair tax, the majority of farmers in Minnesota tell \nme that would be their No. 1 priority. If we want to help rural \nAmerica, if we want to help rural Minnesota, rural Wisconsin, the best \nthing we could do is help these farmers by getting rid of this death \ntax to allow them to pass their assets from generation to generation.\n  But again, despite the fact that the President's White House \nConference on Small Business made the death tax repeal a top \nlegislative priority, President Clinton vetoed this tax relief \nlegislation. This is an administration that does not want to give one \ndime in tax relief--not one dime. In fact, the President's own bill \nthat he submitted this year, which had a tax relief component included, \nwould actually raise taxes this year by $9 billion. That is the \nPresident's version of tax relief. We will raise your taxes $9 billion \nthis year. That is real tax relief.\n  Here is another example of a President who doesn't want less taxes \nbut more taxes. It is supported by our good friends on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Our Democratic colleagues insist that a cut in the death tax is a tax \ncut for the rich, and they ``can hardly justify a costly tax cut that \nbenefits some of the wealthiest taxpayers.''\n  That is simply wrong. As I said earlier, it is the family farms and \nthe small business owners whom the death tax particularly harms; it is \nnot the rich. That is just cover, a smokescreen. That is the magician \nsaying: Look at this hand, not at what I am doing here with this other \nhand. Concentrate on the super rich, but don't worry about the average \nmiddle-income taxpayer or small businesses.\n  A typical family farm could be valued at several million dollars due \nto land appreciation and the expensive farm equipment needed. I have \nsaid so many times that a farmer can die and can be worth $2 million or \n$3 million, but it is all in assets, value, and equipment. He has \nprobably never driven a new pickup in his life and has worn his gloves \nuntil he can't hold them anymore. Yet, when he dies, he is a \nmillionaire who should ``give just a little bit back.'' Don't pass on \nthe family farm; let Washington have it.\n  Many farms may never even earn a penny of profit. When the head of \nthe household dies, the family can't come up with the money for estate \ntaxes. They don't have a quarter million dollars in cash-flow. \nEverything they have is normally invested in the farm, in the assets \nand equipment. But they have to come up with money to pay the estate \ntax, and that means they have to sell equipment or land--in other \nwords, break up the family farm.\n  This is the main reason we lose about 1,000 family farms each year in \nmy State of Minnesota alone. They are driven out of business because of \nthe estate tax. Are these rich people? No, they are hard-working \nAmericans. I strongly believe Government policies should not punish \nthose who have worked hard and been out there building up farms and \nbusinesses. There are many compelling reasons to end this unfair and \nunjust death tax:\n  First, the American dream is to work hard and make life better for \ntheir children. Here, if you work hard and put everything into it, you \nbreak your back to do it, if you are successful, they are going to \npenalize you. You may have built a business from the ground up, brick \nby brick, acre by acre, founded on persistence and determination, but \nif you are successful, they are going to break you.\n  Years of hard work eventually pay off. Their business thrives, farms \nprosper, and when the time comes to retire or leave the world, they are \nproud to\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\npass something on to their children. But, wait, there is the tax man. \nBy allowing them to build upon the success their parents and \ngrandparents had achieved, they know they have given their children a \ngood head start--again, until the tax collector steps in to demand \nWashington's share, taking up to 55 percent of the estate. As the \nwitness said earlier in her testimony before the Finance Committee, her \nattorney said, ``There is no way you can continue to operate this farm \nbecause you have to pay the taxes.''\n\n  Once the Federal Government has finished taking its portion of the \nestate, few family businesses and farms can survive. Their heirs may be \nforced to sell off all or part of the business --again, just to satisfy \nthe tax bill. All of the years of hard work poured into the creation of \na piece of security for their family and their future evaporates. Oh, \nno, this is only for the rich, for the wealthiest. Again, that is a \nsmokescreen to divert your attention, saying: Good, tax the rich \npeople. But those ``rich'' people are many, many Americans--not a few \nbut many average Americans.\n  Newt Gingrich once said, ``You should not have to visit the \nundertaker and the tax man on the same day.''\n  I think Mr. Gingrich was right. Research shows that 70 percent of \nfamily businesses do not survive through the second generation. Eighty-\nseven percent don't make it through the third generation. The death tax \nis a major factor contributing to the demise of family businesses and, \nas I said earlier, family farms. Nine out of ten successors whose \nfamily-owned businesses failed within 3 years of the principal owner's \ndeath said it was trouble paying the estate taxes that contributed to \nthe company's demise.\n  I think Senator Burns earlier talked about the year after year after \nyear of payments a family had to make to the Government--$14,000 a \nyear, $15,000 a year, $17,000 a year, and their dad had died 13 years \nearlier. So they were still trying to make a profit and pay the bills \nand then pay the tax man over and above their other taxes.\n  In fact, under the current tax system, it is cheaper to sell the \nfamily-owned business before death--cheaper to sell it before you die--\nrather than pass the business on to one's heirs. That is what happens a \nlot of times. You can't afford to die, so you have to sell the business \nbeforehand so you can pay less taxes, and you help your family more \nthan by waiting until you die.\n  No growing business can remain competitive in a tax regime that \nimposes tax rates as high as 55 percent upon the death of the founder \nor owner. Clearly, the Nation's estate tax laws penalize those who have \nworked the hardest to get ahead. Instead of encouraging family-owned \nbusinesses, the Federal Government has enacted tax policies that are a \nbarrier to a better economy and better jobs.\n  A good question would be: On what moral ground should the Federal \ndeath tax be allowed to continue to punish hard-working Americans? If a \ndeath tax is unfair on somebody with a $500,000 estate, or a $50,000 \nestate, or if it is unfair to somebody with a $2 million estate--and \nnow our good friends on the other side of the aisle say we will even \ngrow that to $10 million--if it is unfair to a $10 million estate, how \ncan it become fair or morally right on anything above that? On what \nmoral ground should the Federal death tax be allowed to continue?\n  Revenue from death taxes accounts for about 1 percent of Federal tax \nreceipts. But the real loss to the Federal Treasury could be much \ngreater. It takes 65 cents to collect every dollar. Again, I told you \nit is a very expensive tax to go out and try to collect because of all \nof the auditing and everything that has to be done. So it takes 65 \ncents to collect a dollar. If we take in $20 billion a year, we have \nspent about $13 billion to collect it. It is an unfair tax, an immoral \ntax, which can drive these families out of business; and we lose even \nmore revenue in lost jobs, lost productivity, not to mention the \nrevenue loss from payroll, income, and other taxes when businesses are \ndestroyed and those jobs are lost.\n\n  The death tax provisions are so complicated that family-owned \nbusinesses must spend approximately $33,138 over 6.5 years on \nattorneys, accountants, and financial experts to assist in estate \nplanning.\n  Eliminating the estate tax would have a nominal impact on \nWashington's $1.8 trillion budget. When you look at the money we would \nsave and the additional tax revenues, we could probably gain from the \npayroll and other taxes--and, again, this could be a wash--and we don't \ndisrupt or destroy businesses, lives, and jobs.\n  But by encouraging savings, investing, and the establishment of more \nfamily-run businesses, the economic benefits for average Americans \nwould be tremendous. There are many average Americans out there losing \ntheir jobs every time one of these businesses has to close or have \nassets sold off. So it disrupts many people, not just the owners of the \nbusiness, but many who rely on the business for a livelihood to support \ntheir families.\n  Research shows that repeal of death taxes will create more than \n275,000 jobs in the next 10 years. It will create 275,000 jobs if we \ncan get rid of the death tax. We heard one claim that somehow there \nwould be a reduction in charitable giving. So, somehow, if the \nGovernment takes less, you are not going to give as much to your \nfavorite charity. I think if you had more money in your pocket at the \nend of the year, you might give more.\n  Americans are the most charitable people in the world, giving tens of \nbillions of dollars a year. But the Government wants to take some of \nthat because the Government, again, can be more benevolent or \ncharitable with your money.\n  I wrote this point down, too. The Democrats said, ``We want to \nhelp.'' Who? How? By taking money from some people so they can decide \nhow to disburse it to others, rather than letting the individuals who \nown the assets make the decisions on charitable giving, whether to \ntheir schools, or their alma mater, churches, groups in their \ncommunity, the Boy Scouts. Billions of dollars a year are distributed \nthis way in charitable giving.\n  I don't think we need the Government to step in and say: No, we can \ndo that better.\n  Again, research shows that repeal of death taxes will create more \nthan 275,000 jobs in the next 10 years; that it will increase the gross \ndomestic product by more than $1 trillion; and it could increase \ncapital stock by $1.7 trillion.\n  It sounds to me as if there is another side of this argument --that \ngetting rid of this unfair, unjust, and immoral tax would actually be \nan economic benefit to millions of Americans and to the Federal \nGovernment, for one. With such economic growth, Federal revenues would \ngrow higher as well. Even Washington would benefit if we could get rid \nof this tax. But they can't see past the blinds. They say: No, we have \nto continue to penalize these people; we have to continue to take their \nmoney; we dare not to do that.\n  Congress can and should help working Americans keep their family \nassets by eliminating the damaging estate tax. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote to repeal this tax.\n  In the next few weeks, the Senate will be considering other important \nlegislation to provide meaningful tax relief for working Americans, \nsuch as marriage penalty tax relief. I believe all of these efforts are \ncritical to help ease the tax burden on American families against the \nmarriage penalty.\n  Why do they call it a penalty? It is an unfair tax because, if a \ncouple decides to get married, the Government wants to take more money \nunfairly. It is unjust. The estate tax is not different.\n  I know President Clinton said one time at a news conference a couple \nof years back, well, it might be an unfair tax but Washington needs the \nmoney--something in that respect. I am not quoting him word for word. \nBut that was the gist of it; that somehow Washington needed the money \neven though it was unfair to take it, or it wasn't the right means of \nextracting more money from Americans, but somehow Washington needed it. \nNow we need even more because Washington can do better.\n  I believe all of these efforts, however, are critical. If we can get \nrid of the death tax and help to ease or eliminate the marriage penalty \ntax, it would help ease the tax burden on American families.\n  I again quote these numbers. It says here that research shows the \nrepeal of the death tax will create more than\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n275,000 jobs in the next 10 years. It will increase our gross domestic \nproduct by more than $1 trillion. It will increase capital stock by \n$1.7 trillion. There would be a lot of financial advantages.\n  I also hope in the second reconciliation legislation Congress can \nconsider and pass tax relief for American seniors by repealing all of \nthe taxes on their retirement benefits.\n  Again, this administration and this President decided to increase \ntaxes on the senior citizens receiving Social Security. They increased \ntheir taxes in 1993. That is another tax that I think we should repeal.\n  We talk about seniors not having enough money; that they have to \ndecide between meals and medicine. They have to do that because \nWashington has decided to take more of their money. We need to repeal \nthat tax on our senior citizens as well.\n  I challenge President Clinton to sign these tax relief measures into \nlaw so the American people can keep a little more of their own money \nfor their own priorities and so they can make the decisions on how that \nshould be done.\n  Again, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of repealing \nthe estate tax--the death tax--along with these other taxes to give \nAmericans the ability to keep a little more of their hard-earned money.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as you know, this is one of those days \nthat you actually look forward to when you are running for the Senate. \nI had an opportunity to be on the floor for virtually the entire debate \ntoday concerning the estate tax. It is actually a very welcome debate. \nBut let me be clear. Democrats, as well as Republicans, welcome the \nopportunity to eliminate the estate tax for middle-income Americans and \nfamilies who own small businesses and family farms.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, believe that we can completely abolish \nthe estate tax for the overwhelming majority of American families who \nthis tax affects at a fraction of the cost of the Republican proposal. \nWhy is that? It is because, unfortunately, the Republican proposal \nfocuses so much of the revenue that is available on the superwealthy.\n  When Senators give examples, as they have done today, they are often \nusing one kind of example that the Democratic alternative would take \ncare of, but their proposal actually spends great amounts of revenue on \npeople who are actually not in the same position as the families which \nvarious Senators have described.\n  For example, the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, came out and \nvery appropriately referred to the various Wisconsin farmers, dairy \nfarmers, hog farmers, and feed farmers. He said this was the purpose of \nthe repeal of the estate tax. But the fact is, you don't need to \ncompletely repeal the estate tax for everyone in the United States of \nAmerica in order to take care of the problem of every family farmer in \nWisconsin with regard to the estate tax. In fact, most of them don't \nface an estate tax at all given the exemptions under current law.\n  So this notion that somehow the Democrats are against taking care of \nthe problems of farmers who are land rich and cash poor is simply \nuntrue. It is not the Democratic position. In fact, it is just the \nopposite.\n  Senator Grams of Minnesota comes out and gives the example of the \nfamily from Idaho that faces a $3.3 million tax burden on the estate \ntax. He fails to point out that, under the Conrad-Moynihan proposal, \nthat family would get at least substantial estate tax relief, and, we \nbelieve, although we would have to check it, perhaps a complete \nexemption from the estate tax. So the very example that the Senators \nfrom the other side of the aisle have used do not support their point. \nThose examples would be taken care of, I believe, under the Conrad-\nMoynihan proposal.\n  It is really a bit of a bait-and-switch approach. You come out and \ngive the very appropriate examples of families who may need some estate \ntax relief, but the actual proposal spends a great deal of available \nrevenue in this country on folks who, frankly, are not as desperately \nin need of this kind of relief.\n  This debate is very welcome because it gives us a chance to talk \nabout what is most important. This motion to proceed allows us an \nopportunity to actually contrast the majority's priorities with those \nof the American people. This is a thread that has gone through the \ncomments today of many of us on our side of the aisle--Senator Dorgan \nof North Dakota, to Senator Wellstone, to Senator Boxer. They pointed \nout that this is a great chance to talk about what the priorities are \nfor the American people.\n  That is another thing I imagined I would have a chance to do when I \ncame to the Senate. We like to deal in specific subjects and try to \ngive a little expertise and show that we know something specific. But \nthere are also days when we come out and, say, take this subject and \nthat subject and compare them and see what is the most important thing \nfor the American people. Fortunately, the debate today has allowed that \nopportunity.\n\n  By moving to this bill and by trying to pass this bill the way it is \nwritten with not just sensible estate tax reform but massive tax cuts \nfor the extremely wealthy, the majority makes clear that it favors tax \ncuts for the very wealthy above anything else.\n  No, the majority's priorities are not those of working Americans.\n  Let me begin by discussing the estate tax, and why the majority's \nplan to completely repeal the estate tax is wrong.\n  To begin with, the estate tax affects only the wealthiest property \nholders. In 1997, only 42,901 estates paid the tax. That is the \nwealthiest 1.9 percent. People are already exempt from the tax in 98 \nout of 100 cases. Let me repeat that. Already, under current law, 98 \nout of 100 cases are completely exempt from the Federal estate tax.\n  This year individual estates up to $675,000 are exempt from taxation, \nand each spouse in a couple can claim that $675,000 exemption. So a \ncouple can already, under current law, effectively exempt $1.35 million \nfrom the tax. To add to that, Congress has already enacted useful \nexpansions of the exemption that have not yet taken effect.\n  By 2006, individual estates up to $1 million will be exempt and, \ntherefore, couples will be able to exempt $2 million in tax. Had those \nexemptions been in effect in 1997, more than 44 percent of the estates \nthat paid tax--remembering that most of them didn't pay tax in the \nfirst place anyway at that point--those still paying tax in 1997 would \nhave been completely exempt.\n  In 1997, Congress also raised the exemption for family farms and \nsmall businesses, the ones that the Senators on the other side of the \naisle have cited needing relief. In 1997, we raised the exemption for \nthe family farm and small businesses to $1.3 million for an individual \nand $2.6 million for a couple. Small businesses and farms can also \nexclude part of the value of real property used in their operations. \nThose very few businesses and farms that are still subject to tax can \npay it in installments over 14 years at below market interest rates.\n  In 1997, Congress went a long way toward making the estate tax less \nof a burden. Already in 1997, the superwealthy were paying most of the \nestate tax. The wealthiest 1 in 1,000 with estates larger than $5 \nmillion paid half the estate tax that year. That is why the Republican \nidea--and this is the Republican idea not to cut the estate tax, as \nthey will say when they are giving their example--the Republican idea \nis to repeal the estate tax completely. That is tilted too heavily to \nthe very wealthy. The Republican estate tax repeal would give the \nwealthiest 2,400 estates, the ones that now pay half the estate tax, an \naverage tax cut just on the estate tax of $3.4 million each. Remember, \nwe are talking about a situation where 98 out of 100 people get zero, \nnothing, from this estate tax cut.\n\n  Last month, Forbes magazine estimated that Mr. Bill Gates is \npersonally worth about $60 billion. If, heaven forbid, Mr. and Mrs. \nGates were to pass away and the Republican bill was fully in effect, if \nthey otherwise would have paid the same average effective tax rate that \nthe largest estates paid in 1997, then, believe it or not, this bill \nwould give Bill Gates' heirs alone, just for those people in that \nfamily inheriting the money, an $8.4 billion tax break; $8.4 billion in \nrevenue that we currently collect would go to this one family.\n  Think of how hard we worked on this Senate floor in bill after bill \nto find\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nsavings in deficit reductions that would somehow come together to reach \nthat large figure, $8.4 billion. Think of how hard we debated programs \nand tax cuts that cost much less than $8.4 billion. Is the $8.4 billion \ntax cut for the family of Bill Gates the highest and best use of \nwhatever budget surplus we may have? That is why Democrats can \neliminate the estate tax for the vast majority of estates at a fraction \nof the cost.\n  As I noted, 44 percent of estates that paid tax in 1997 would have \nbeen completely exempt from tax if the exemption were raised to $1 \nmillion. Fully 85 percent of the estates would have paid no tax if the \nexemption had been raised to $2.5 million.\n  Senators Conrad and Moynihan have been working on a proposal that \nwill eliminate the estate tax for most people for whom it would apply \ntoday, and to do so for substantially less cost than the majority's \nbill. I think the Democratic alternative is a good substitute. We ought \nto pass it. We ought to send it to the President for his signature.\n  If the majority fails to adopt that reasonable amendment, however, we \nwill have others. One of the reasons I welcome this debate is because I \nam looking forward to offering an amendment that will try something \nelse, that will simply maintain the estate tax on estates of $20 \nmillion or more. We are talking about estates of $20 million. We are \ncertainly no longer talking about upper-middle-income families. We are \ntalking about estates of $20 million. I don't think we are talking \nanymore about small businesses the way most people understand that \nterm. In 1997, there were only 329 estates in the country that amounted \nto more than $20 million. But those 329 estates are worth $25 billion. \nWe are talking about estates that average $75 million each. The \nmajority's estate tax bill gives the heirs of estates such as those 329 \nmultimillionaire estates a tax cut that averages $10.5 million each.\n  I am looking forward to this debate to see if the majority can at \nleast keep itself from giving this massive tax cut, averaging $10.5 \nmillion each, to the wealthiest 1 in 10,000. We will see.\n  The point of amendments such as these is that an estate tax for the \nsuperwealthy does, in fact, serve some important social purposes. Yes, \nsome sensible reforms are in order to increase the exemption to the \nestate tax for middle-income Americans, and certainly to address the \nspecial needs of small businesses and farmers. But the majority's \nposition is too extreme. We live in a time of an increasing \nconcentration of wealth. Last September, the Wall Street Journal \nreported in 1997 the Nation's wealthiest 10 percent owned 73 percent of \nthe Nation's net worth. That is up from 68 percent in 1983. With the \nstock market boom of the 1990s, the wealthiest have done very well, \nindeed.\n\n  Those who hold this great wealth are in a better position to shoulder \nsome of the costs of our society. An estate tax for the superwealthy \nmakes them help out. It is ironic, just when the very wealthiest are \ndoing as well as they have since the gilded age, the Republicans decide \nthat the very wealthy deserve--and what we most need to do--is another \ntax break. An estate tax for the superwealthy also serves as a backstop \nto the income tax, ensuring that some income on which income tax is \ndeferred or avoided is ultimately subject to at least some tax.\n  For example, because the income tax law steps up the basis of per \ncapita gains on the value of a piece of property at the time of \ninheritance, no one pays income tax on capital gains that an individual \nbuilt up on property the individual owns at the time of death, and, \ntherefore, the estate tax provides the worthwhile social purpose, I \nbelieve, that the superwealthy have to at least make up for some of \nthat.\n  I think there is a worthy point that has been debated a little bit in \nthe last hour. An estate tax for the superwealthy does encourage \ncharitable giving as Senator Boxer from California pointed out. A \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax would land a devastating blow on \ncolleges, churches, museums, and other charitable institutions that \nrely on donors to leave gifts. The majority's repeal of the estate \ncould well reduce charitable gifts and bequests by $6 billion annually.\n  The majority bill would be immensely expensive. The Joint Committee \non Taxation projects that the majority bill would cost $105 billion \nover 10 years. Because the bill is phased in slowly over 10 years, its \ncost would actually explode even more in the second 10 years. When \nfully phased in, the bill would cost at least $50 billion a year, or \nmore than $500 billion a decade. In fact, the Treasury Department says \nthe figure would be about $750 billion over the decade.\n  Are tax cuts for the superwealthy the first place that we as a Nation \nwant to spend more than half a trillion or three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars of the surplus?\n  Yes, it is true; some of the speakers on the other side have said \nAmerica's economy is still strong. The Nation is enjoying the longest \neconomic expansion in its history. Unemployment is at lowest in three \ndecades, and home ownership is at the highest rate on record at 67 \npercent.\n  Several causes contributed to the current economic expansion, and it \ncannot be denied that a key contributor to our booming economy has been \nthe Government's fiscal responsibility since 1993. I am very proud of \nthat, as are many Members. The first tough vote I took was to support \nthe President's deficit reduction plan in 1993. It worked, and it \nworked very well.\n  This responsible fiscal policy means that the Government has borrowed \nless from the public than it otherwise would have, and will have paid \ndown $300 billion in publicly-debt held by October of this year. The \nGovernment no longer crowds out private borrowers from the credit \nmarket. The Government no longer bids up the price of borrowing--that \nis, interest rates--to finance its huge debt.\n  Because of our fiscal responsibility, interest rates are, so far, \nlower than they otherwise would be. Because of our fiscal \nresponsibility, millions of American have saved money on their \nmortgages, car loans, and student loans. Because of our fiscal \nresponsibility, businesses large and small have found it easier to \ninvest and spur yet more new growth.\n  Massive tax cuts like the one before us today I think pose the \ngreatest single threat to that responsible fiscal policy, and to the \nstrong economy to which it has contributed. It is no secret and it has \nbeen essentially admitted to by the previous speaker, the Senator from \nMinnesota: The majority intends to pass--in one bill after another--a \nmassive tax cut plan reminiscent of the early 1980s.\n  The majority leader said as much in a Republican radio address over \nthe recess. After rattling off a series of tax cuts, the majority \nleader said, ``Put all this together and we call it `First Things \nFirst' ''\n  I think it is supremely ironic that the majority leader chose to use \nthose exact words, ``first things first,'' for in so doing, he echoed \nwhat President Clinton said in his 1998 State of the Union Address, \nwhen he said, ``What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a \nsimple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.''\n  That is, after all, what this debate is about: What should come \nfirst?\n  As I and other Democrats have said, and demonstrated by our votes, we \nsupport estate tax reform for middle-income Americans, small \nbusinesses, and family farmers. But as we debate what ``first things'' \nshould come first, shouldn't we remember our commitments to Social \nSecurity and Medicare?\n  In the decade of 2011 to 2020, just as the costs of the bill before \nus today will begin to explode, the baby boom generation will begin to \nretire in numbers. Social Security's trustees project that, starting in \n2015, the cost of Social Security benefits will exceed payroll tax \nrevenues. Under the trustees' projections, this annual cash deficit \nwill continue to grow. By 2037, the Social Security trust fund will \nhave consumed all of its assets. Similarly, by 2025, the Medicare \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund will have consumed all of its assets.\n  I almost hesitate to say this, but when I look at the young people in \nfront of me who work so hard for us every day, they are the ones who \nwill not get their Social Security if we are not responsible, if we do \nnot make sure we put first things first.\n  According to the trustees, we can fix the Social Security program so \nthat it will remain solvent for 75 years if we\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\nmake changes now in either taxes or benefits equivalent to less than 2 \npercent of our payroll taxes. But if we wait until 2037, we will need \nto make changes equal to an increase in the payroll tax rate of 5.4 \npercentage points. We have a choice of small changes now or big changes \nlater.\n  That is why it makes sense to see to our long-term obligations for \nSocial Security and Medicare before we enact either tax cuts or yes, \nspending measures that would spend whatever that surplus might be. \nBefore we enter into new obligations, we need to steward the people's \nresources to meet the commitments we already have.\n  I will tell you, when I think of Social Security, the generations \nthat come after us, that is commitment No. 1.\n  Which is putting first things first: saving Social Security and \nMedicare or cutting estate taxes for the very rich?\n  As part of updating Medicare for the 21st century, we have to ensure \nthat our elderly have access to lifesaving prescription drugs. Three \nout of five Medicare beneficiaries make do without dependable \nprescription drug coverage. We on this side of the aisle believe that \nit is a priority to create a voluntary Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that is accessible and affordable for all beneficiaries.\n  Which is putting first things first: helping provide needed \nmedications for our elderly or cutting estate taxes for the very \nwealthy?\n  We on this side of the aisle believe that one of our Nation's most \npressing unmet needs is the acute and growing demand for help with \nlong-term care. I have worked on this issue more than any other issue \nin my 18 years in public office. Our Nation's population is aging: \nToday, 4 million Americans are over 85 years old. By 2030, more than \ntwice as many--9 million Americans--will be. Already today, 54 million \nAmericans--one in five--live with some kind of disability. One in ten \ncopes with a severe disability. In four out of five cases, a family \nmember serves as that disabled person's primary helper, and, believe \nme, serves under a heavy burden in doing so. If the majority allows us \nto offer amendments, I will join with others on this side of the aisle \nin an amendment that will take some of the money that the majority \nwould use to cut taxes for the superwealthy and use it to help make tax \nbenefits available to these hard-working and financially strapped \nhelpers.\n  Again, which is putting first things first: helping people to provide \nlong-term care for elderly and disabled family members or cutting \nestate taxes for the very wealthy?\n  It seems that more and more these days, we see legislation like that \nbefore us today that benefits the very wealthy. At the same time, \nSenators feel increasing pressure to raise larger and larger sums of \nmoney from wealthy contributors. Observers could be forgiven for \nlinking the two phenomena. Observers could reasonably wonder whether \nthe contact Senators increasingly have with wealthy contributors could \nperhaps lead Senators increasingly to continually believe that the \nproblems of the very wealthy are the problems to which we must respond \nfirst.\n  The problem has only become worse with the large amounts of soft \nmoney being raised to get around the campaign finance laws. As the \nSupreme Court concluded in its decision this January in Nixon v. Shrink \nMissouri Government PAC: ``[T]here is little reason to doubt that \nsometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our \npolitical system, and no reason to question the existence of a \ncorresponding suspicion among voters.''\n  A number of us believe that it continues to be a matter of great \nurgency to stop this corrupting influence of soft money in our \nelections. We feel that in order to get our priorities right, we need \nto get our house in order. Although it was undeniably a good thing to \nreform disclosure of contributions by organizations that do business \nunder section 527 of the tax code, as we just did, that is by no means \nenough. Those of us fighting for campaign finance reform will forego no \nopportunity to offer an amendment to ban corrupting soft money once and \nfor all.\n  On that point, as we all know, only the tiniest fraction of the \nAmerican people will be affected by this tax legislation before us \ntoday. But the American people also understand that those wealthy \nenough to be subject to estate taxes tend to have great political \npower.\n  Those wealthy interests are able to make unlimited political \ncontributions, and they are represented in Washington by influential \nlobbyists that have pushed hard to get this bill to the floor.\n  The estate tax is one of those issues where political money seems to \nhave an impact on the legislative outcome. That is why I want to \nquickly Call the Bankroll on some of the interests behind this bill, to \ngive my colleagues and the public a sense of the huge amount of money \nat stake here. I talked about taxes, but now I am talking about \npolitical contributions.\n  Take for instance the National Federation of Independent Business. \nRepeal of the inheritance tax is one of the federation's top \npriorities, and the federation is considered one of the most powerful \norganizations in town.\n  They have the might of PAC and soft money contributions behind them.\n  NFIB's PAC has given more than $441,000 in PAC money through June 1 \nof this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive \nPolitics. That is on top of the incredible $1.2 million in PAC \ncontributions NFIB doled out during the 1997-1998 election cycle.\n  NFIB has also given soft money during the first 18 months of the \ncurrent election cycle--just over $30,000 so far.\n  Then there is the Food Marketing Institute, which represents \nsupermarkets, and has also made a powerful push to bring this bill to \nthe floor.\n  Behind that push was the weight of significant PAC and soft money \ncontributions, which I am sure is not a surprise to anybody.\n  Through June 1st of this election cycle, the Food Marketing Institute \nhas given more than $241,000 in PAC donations to candidates, after it \nmade more than a half million in PAC donations during the previous \ncycle.\n  FMI is also an active soft money donor, with more than $156,000 in \nsoft money to the parties since the beginning of this cycle through \nJune 1st of this year.\n  On top of these wealthy associations, there are countless wealthy \nindividuals who want to see the estate tax repealed. They are that tiny \nfraction of Americans who would benefit by the difference between the \nRepublican approach and the more modest and appropriate Democratic \napproach.\n  These folks want an end to the estate tax, and they are also able to \ngive unlimited soft money to the political parties to get their point \nacross.\n  Then there is the most interesting player in the push to repeal the \nestate tax--the mystery donors.\n  That is right, we don't know who is funding one of the major efforts \nto end the so-called death tax.\n  We don't know because the group paying for it is one of those \nsecretive 527 groups.\n  The group is called The Committee for New American Leadership, and \nwas founded, I am told, by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The \ncommittee, identified in news reports as a 527 ``stealth PAC,'' has \nbeen very busy pushing for the repeal of the estate tax, but nobody \nknows who is footing the bill for those efforts.\n  As I stand here today, these mystery donors are having a lot to say \nabout what gets debated in the Senate, and we have no way of really \nknowing who they are, or how much they gave. But thankfully, all of \nthat may be changing.\n  Thanks to the passage of the 527 disclosure bill, which the President \nalmost immediately signed into law, from here on in we will know a lot \nmore about who is writing the check to the Committee for New American \nLeadership, and the donors to every other stealth PAC that hid behind a \ntax loophole to evade public scrutiny.\n  So, reformers won a victory with passage of the 527 disclosure bill, \nand we are just getting started. We are going to keep pushing until we \naddress the other gaping loopholes in the campaign finance law that \nallow wealthy interests spend unlimited amounts of money to push for \nbills like this one, which serve the interests of the wealthy few at \nthe expense of most Americans.\n  Mr. President, again, to return to the central question, I ask: Which \nis putting first things first: ensuring honest elections, or cutting \nestate taxes for the very wealthy?\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n  The majority shows by proceeding to this bill that it wants to help \nout those who have benefitted most in the latest economic boom. But the \nweek before last, the business group the Conference Board released a \nreport that said:\n\n       Working full-time and year-round is, for more and more \n     Americans, not enough.\n\n  The report, called ``Does a Rising Tide Lift All Boats?'' finds that \nAmericans holding full-time jobs in the 1990s were just as likely to \nfall into poverty as Americans working full-time in the 1980s, and more \nlikely to fall into poverty than full-time workers were in the 1970s. \nAs The Wall Street Journal reported, economists attribute the problem \nin part to the erosion of the value of the minimum wage, which was in \ntoday's dollars worth about $7 in 1969, compared with the current \nminimum wage of $5.15 an hour.\n  We on this side of the aisle believe that it is a priority to enact \nan increase in the income of working Americans making the minimum wage. \nThe majority appears to believe that a tax cut for the very wealthy \nshould be addressed first.\n  So which is putting first things first: enacting a raise for working \npeople making the minimum wage, or cutting estate taxes for the very \nwealthy?\n  Even if we chose to confine ourselves strictly to cut taxes, should \nour highest priority for tax cuts be the very wealthiest 2 percent of \nthe population? The majority shows by proceeding to this bill that it \nfavors tax cuts for the super-wealthy before tax cuts for anyone else.\n  We on this side of the aisle believe that it is a priority to cut \ntaxes for working families struggling to stay out of poverty--families \nwho have some of the highest marginal tax rates in our tax system. The \nmajority's bill would give tax cuts to fewer than 43,000 upper-income \ntaxpayers a year. In contrast, the President's proposal to expand the \nEarned Income Tax Credit to reward work and family would provide tax \nrelief for 7 million working families, providing up to $1,155 in \nadditional tax relief a family.\n  Among other things, the President's EITC proposal would increase \nbenefits for working families with three or more children. The poverty \nrate for children in these larger families remains a stunning 29 \npercent, more than double the poverty rate among children in smaller \nfamilies. A decade ago, a bipartisan group of Wisconsin State \nlegislators enacted a substantially larger State EITC for families with \nthree or more children, and it has helped to lift thousands of \nWisconsin families from poverty.\n  Which is putting first things first: helping the kids in 7 million \nworking families keep out of poverty, or cutting estate taxes for the \nchildren who stand to inherit from the very wealthy?\n  This Senator believes that it is a priority to simplify taxes and \nfree people from paying income taxes altogether. One way to do this \nwould be to expand the standard deduction. That would reduce tax \nliability for millions of working Americans. If the majority ever gives \nus a chance to offer amendments, I intend to offer such an amendment on \ntax legislation this year. Right now, 7 in 10 taxpayers take the \nstandard deduction instead of itemizing. Expanding the standard \ndeduction would make it worthwhile for even more Americans to use that \neasier method and avoid the difficult and cumbersome itemization forms. \nAs well, expanding the standard deduction would free millions of \nmiddle-income working Americans from having any income tax liability at \nall.\n  So again, which is putting first things first: freeing millions of \nmiddle-income Americans from the income tax, or cutting estate taxes \nfor the very wealthy?\n  Simplifying taxes generally should be a priority. Some have proposed \nthat modest investors in mutual funds should be exempted from filling \nout the complicated capital gains schedule. Some have suggested \nstreamlining the complicated child credit. Some have proposed further \nsimplifying the Nanny Tax by raising the threshold for filing. These \nmodest steps would relieve millions of middle-income taxpayers from \nneedlessly complex and time-consuming tax forms, but they would also \ncost money.\n  So which is putting first things first: simplifying income taxes for \nmillions of middle-income taxpayers, or, again, cutting estate taxes \nfor a few hundred of the very wealthy?\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle believe that we should repeal the \ntelephone tax for residential users. Pretty much everyone pays the \ntelephone tax. Mr. President, 94 percent of American households have \ntelephone service. And remember, fewer than 2 percent, even under \ncurrent law, pay the estate tax. If the majority allows us to offer \namendments, I will join with others on this side of the aisle in an \namendment that will take some of the money that the majority would use \nto cut taxes for the super-wealthy and use it to repeal the telephone \ntax for residential users.\n  Now, the majority also wants to eliminate the telephone tax for \nbusinesses, which is just a tax cut for people who own stock in those \nbusinesses--not the most progressive of tax cuts--but cutting taxes on \nresidential telephone users is among the more progressive tax cuts that \none could imagine this Congress passing. But the schedule betrays the \nmajority's priorities.\n  Which is putting first things first: repealing a residential \ntelephone tax that nearly everyone pays, or repealing estate taxes that \nonly very wealthiest 2 percent pay?\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle believe that it is a priority to \nhelp working American families to save. The President's proposal last \nyear to encourage retirement savings through what he called USA \nAccounts made some sense. Similarly, this year, Vice President Gore's \nnew Retirement Savings Plus accounts--voluntary, tax-free personal \nsavings accounts separate from Social Security but with a Government \nmatch--are also a pretty good idea. Both USA Accounts and Retirement \nSavings Plus would help millions of middle-income Americans to save and \nbuild resources for retirement.\n  So again, when you look at that issue, which is putting first thing \nfirst: helping working American families to save, or cutting estate \ntaxes for the very wealthy?\n  As I said at the outset, this is really a welcome debate. Because the \nmajority's desire to increase tax breaks for the very wealthy paints so \nstark a contrast to the many ways by which Senators on this side of the \naisle really do want to help working Americans.\n  This is not an example of class warfare. To point out what is going \non, that is not what this is at all. In fact, what is class warfare is \nto maintain taxes on the vast majority of working Americans while \ncutting taxes only for the very wealthy Americans.\n  I have taken some time on this occasion to contrast the majority's \npriorities with those of the American people because the majority \nleader has made all too clear that he does not intend to allow a fair \nand full debate of this estate tax bill. I have made this case on the \nmotion to proceed rather than waiting for the bill itself because, if \nthe majority leader follows what has become his regular practice, he \nwill, in all likelihood, file cloture on the bill as soon as we get to \nit.\n  Mr. President, I have said this before at much greater length, but I \nwill say it again--others have said it better--this is not how the \nSenate was meant to work. This is the place where the Government was \nintended to consider policies fully and fairly.\n  The majority leader's all-too-rapid resort to cloture deprives \nSenators from debating priorities such as those I have discussed today, \nand so many more. That is why I have taken time during this debate on \nthe motion to proceed, which is not where we normally have this sort of \ndebate, to warn, before the majority leader files his cloture motion, \nagainst the dangers of invoking cloture on the estate tax bill.\n  This is a major bill. If enacted, it would take more than half a \ntrillion dollars, maybe three-quarters of a trillion dollars a decade \nthat would otherwise have gone to paying down the debt and put it in \nthe hands of the very few wealthiest members of society. It would be \nneither fitting nor appropriate to effect the transfer of more than \nhalf a trillion dollars without a full and fair debate.\n  And that is why we must debate this motion fully today. For if there \nis a remedy for the majority leader's abuse of the cloture process, it \nis a more rigorous use of the cloture process when it is abused.\n  New York's Governor Al Smith said in 1933, ``All the ills of \ndemocracy can\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nbe cured by more democracy.'' To paraphrase Governor Smith, the cure \nfor not honoring the spirit of the Senate's rules is to honor the \nSenate's rules to the letter.\n  Thus, if the majority lseader wants all the benefits of the cloture \nrule, then he will have to bear all the costs of the cloture rule, as \nwell. If the majority leader lays down a cloture motion, he should be \nprepared to have the full 30 hours of debate on the matter on which the \nSenate invokes cloture. If the Senate invokes cloture, it should expect \nto have to remain on the matter on which has invoked cloture.\n  Let's cut to the chase. The majority is moving to this complete \nrepeal of the estate tax at least in part as a purely political \ngesture. The Administration has stated in so many words that the \nPresident would veto this bill. The majority apparently wants the veto \nand the issue more than it wants a good law that would eliminate estate \ntaxes for the overwhelming majority of those who pay it.\n  Such a compromise is available if the majority is willing to take it. \nThe majority need only adopt Senator Conrad's and Senator Moynihan's \nsubstitute, and we can have meaningful estate tax reform this year.\n  But if the majority does not do so, then we will debate this bill at \nlength and vote on a series of amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say this in the form of a question because I want to \nfocus on one part of the Senator's speech. I know this is not an easy \nquestion to answer because it is coming from somebody I am going to try \nto compliment and applaud. Does the Senator recognize how appreciative \nthe rest of the Senators are on the Democratic side for his leadership \nin exposing what is wrong with campaign finance on the Federal level in \nAmerica? Is the Senator aware of how much we appreciate the work he has \ndone?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly know that the Senator from Nevada talks to \nme about this issue every chance he gets. I appreciate it. He has been \none of the persons who has made it possible for us to raise this issue \non the Senate floor. I appreciate the opportunity to occasionally come \nto the floor and point out, when we are on a particular bill, all the \nbig soft money contributions that are behind some of these bills. It is \npart of the story that the public needs to know.\n  Mr. REID. How many people are in the State of Wisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Over 5 million.\n  Mr. REID. In the State of Nevada, we have about 2 million people. The \nlast Senate election I was involved in, less than 2 years ago, in the \nsmall State of Nevada, in which at that time there weren't 2 million \npeople, the two candidates, the Republican candidate and Democratic \ncandidate, spent over $20 million. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe the Senator has shared that with me before, \nbut it is a horrifying number for any State, let alone a State the size \nof Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. That doesn't count independent expenditures. No one knows \nwhat they are.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We know about some of them, but there are whole \ncategories, such as these 527s, we are not even sure where they came \nfrom or exactly how much is being spent.\n  Mr. REID. Again, I hope the Senator from Wisconsin understands the \ngreat contribution he has made to the Senate, to the State of \nWisconsin, and the American people for not letting this issue die.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Nevada. That kind of \nencouragement is helpful because it is sometimes a lonely issue. What I \nhave found most effective in talking to people, if you mention the \nissue of campaign finance reform in general, to use that term, or in \nthe abstract, it is clear to people you are trying to do something that \nis important. But if you want to make it concrete for them, you have to \nshow the connection between all that money and particular bills coming \nthrough here that really don't belong here. This is a great example, \nthe estate tax. The idea that we give this huge tax break to a very few \npeople when there are all these other priorities raises the question in \npeople's minds: Why would elected officials do such a thing? I believe \npart of the answer is there is just too much money behind this bill.\n  Mr. REID. I want to ask two additional questions on the Senator's \ntime. First of all, is the Senator aware that this matter now before \nthe Senate has not had 1 minute of hearings in the Senate before the \nFinance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I was not aware it was quite that bad. I knew it had \nbeen very little. It came straight through from the House, as I \nunderstand.\n  Mr. REID. I think in the same breath we mention the Senator from \nWisconsin, it is fair to also talk about a real lone ranger, for lack \nof a better description, on the other side. That is the Senator from \nArizona, John McCain, who has stood shoulder to shoulder with the \nSenator from Wisconsin. He has not had the support of his Republican \ncolleagues as Senator Feingold has had on the Democratic side. Does the \nSenator from Wisconsin agree that the Senator from Arizona has shown \ncourage not only as a prisoner of war and as a fighter pilot but also \nhis courage on this issue of campaign finance?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. All of us who work on the issue with him consider him \nour commander, in effect. We, of course, are well aware not only of the \nfact that he worked so hard on this issue for years before his \nPresidential campaign, but he is also doing a tremendous job of \nchanneling enthusiasm from his campaign into actually getting things \ndone on campaign finance on the floor. That is how the 527s got \nthrough. Thanks to my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, \nabout whom we often have to talk in less than positive terms on the \ncampaign finance issue, almost every one of them supported us at least \non that issue. We are hoping that will lead to a momentum to actually \nban soft money and go beyond that. I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis questions.\n  To conclude, we will vote on priorities. We will vote on which is \nputting first things first: paying down the debt to help Social \nSecurity and Medicare or cutting taxes for the super-wealthy.\n  We will afford the majority a number of opportunities to let us know \nhow wealthy one has to be before even the majority considers one \nsuperwealthy. As I said earlier, I am looking forward to offering an \namendment that would simply maintain the estate tax on estates of $20 \nmillion or more, and preserve those funds to pay down the debt to help \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  But if that amendment should not succeed, then I look forward to \noffering an amendment that would simply maintain the estate tax on \nestates of $100 million or more, and preserve those funds to pay down \nthe debt to help Social Security and Medicare. If the majority does not \nconsider estates of $20 million to be the super-wealthy, then perhaps \nthey will agree that those worth $100 million are superwealthy.\n  If that amendment should not succeed, then I could have another that \nwould maintain the estate tax on estates of a billion dollars or more, \nand preserve those funds to pay down the debt to help Social Security \nand Medicare. If the majority does not consider estates of $20 million \nto be the superwealthy, and does not consider estates of $100 million \nto be superwealthy, then perhaps they will agree that those worth a \nbillion dollars deserve the title ``superwealthy.''\n  Ironically, some will then charge us on this side of the aisle with \nholding up the estate tax bill. But it is not we, but the majority who \nare thwarting the enactment of estate tax relief by clinging to their \nextreme repeal plan.\n  The choice for the majority is clear: The majority can persist in the \npolitical exercise of advancing the extreme bill that we are \nconsidering today. Or they can enact fiscally-responsible estate tax \nreform with overwhelming bipartisan majorities.\n  The opportunity is theirs to take, or to squander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nspeaking be that Senator Sessions be recognized for 15 minutes, Senator \nKyl for 15 minutes, and following that, Senator Murkowski for 10 \nminutes. Then we would go to a Democrat at that time. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. As a matter of parliamentary procedure, I ask the Chair \nthis: I\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\ndirect this comment more to the staff through the Chair. Maybe they can \nfind out the leader's intention. Are we going to keep working after \n6:30, or are we going to defense? We have a number of speakers lined \nup. When we learn what is going to happen, we can better arrange the \norder of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe it is time for us to quit \nnibbling around the edges and to eliminate the estate tax on the \nAmerican people. It is an abysmal tax. It is an unfair tax. It taxes \npeople on money they have already made. They pay taxes on that money. \nThen, after that, they may invest and buy property. When they die, the \ntax man reaches in and grabs up to 55 percent of the value of that \nestate. That is an astounding fact. The Federal Government is taking 55 \npercent from people for this tax. A majority of the people who have an \nestate have to go through the estate tax computation. It is an unfair \ntax.\n  I believe we ought to reduce taxes across the board. I was a leader \nand fought hard for the $500-per-child tax credit for middle-income \nAmerican families. I think that was one of the finest things we ever \ndid. It provided $1,500 in extra money --without taxes--for a family of \nthree. That is $100-plus a month they can spend on their children. I \nsupported equality in making insurance premiums deductible that don't \napply to small businesses. We fought for the capital gains tax \nreduction. People said that was a tax for the rich. When we reduced the \ncapital gains tax, more people were willing to buy, sell, and trade \nproperties, stocks, and other things, and they paid more taxes. \nRevenues to the Government went up.\n  We will talk about the marriage penalty. It is absolutely \nunjustifiable to raise taxes on a couple who are married by $1,400 a \nyear--$100 a month for a man and woman who are out working. When they \nget married, they have to pay more in taxes than if they lived single. \nIt pays a bonus, in effect, for people who get a divorce. That is not \nthe kind of public policy we ought to have. I want us to remember that \nnearly 70 percent of the American people oppose this estate tax. They \nknow it is unfair and it ought to be eliminated.\n  I want to share a few insights into this subject, other than \ndiscussing the matter in general. I have had the opportunity to meet \nwith people from Alabama--environmental experts--who shared with me \nthat with regard to landowners and timber owners, the estate tax is one \nof the single most damaging environmental pieces of legislation that \nexists. They tell me that routinely, people who inherit timber land and \nproperty who owe large amounts of taxes have to go out and prematurely \nclear-cut the timber on the property and sell it to pay the estate tax. \nWhen you are talking about a 55-percent tax, what are you going to do \nif you are the widow or child of a person who worked and saved all his \nlife and did everything right? You have to sell off the property or cut \nthe timber--every stick of it--to pay the tax man in Washington. That \nis not good for families and for the environment.\n  The estate tax hurts farmers. Farmers are particularly property \nwealthy, but cash poor. They take what they have and plow it back into \ntheir land and equipment. When they die, they may have a very large tax \nburden. Perhaps they are making only a small amount on each acre they \nfarm, but they are making an income from it. But maybe the problem is \nthe land now is next to an interstate and the land now would be good \nfor a motel and they want to value it at $100,000 an acre. All of a \nsudden, they are multimillionaires, and the family is hit for $1 \nmillion or $2 million or $5 million in taxes.\n  The farmers in this country are universally opposed to this tax. \nEvery farm organization in my State tells me every time I meet with \nthem, ``Eliminate this estate tax, Jeff, whatever you do. That is \nrotten and we need to get rid of it.'' That is driving the issue before \nus today.\n  This tax savages small business. Every generation of farmers and \nsmall businesspeople have a debt. That business or family must absorb \nthe cost of paying the estate tax. No such tax falls on the large, mega \ncorporations, the giant international, multinational corporations. They \nnever die. They never pay this tax. But every generation of small \nbusiness has to face it. Every generation of farmers has to face it. Is \nit any wonder why large paper companies can buy up thousands of acres \nof land that have to be sold off by farming families who can't afford \nto pay the taxes on it, and then they never pay that tax? This is not a \ngood tax for this country. It is wrong for this country. It punishes \nmiddle America, those who have done the right things by saving and \naccumulating some wealth.\n\n  This kills off competition. I know the story of an autoparts company. \nThe family had built up an autoparts dealership. They had maybe as many \nas 27 stores; they were all about the State. You could see those \ncompanies there and they were growing. All of a sudden, the father who \nowned the company died, and they were faced with a huge tax burden. \nWhat could they do? They could borrow millions of dollars to pay the \ntax man, they could sell off a large part of their stores but lose the \nadvantages of scale that they were gaining by growing and getting \ncompetitive with bigger companies, or they could sell out. The company \nfamily had to make a decision.\n  They sold the company to a major national autoparts company, and \neverybody would recognize their name. That large company would never be \nfaced with that kind of capital crisis as a result of a death. But the \nsmaller companies are. Maybe, just maybe, that 27-store autoparts \ncompany would have continued to be able to grow. Maybe, just maybe, \nthey would not have had to shut down the distribution center in the \nsmall town in Alabama, as they did when it sold out to the big \ncorporation. Maybe they could have grown and become a competitor to the \nmajor parts company distributing in this country and provided more \ncompetition, driving down the price of autoparts for the average \nAmerican citizen who is out to buy what he needs to fix his automobile, \ntruck, or farm equipment.\n  I think this thing has to be viewed in the overall context of how it \nimpacts economic growth and competition in this country. I believe we \nneed to make sure that we have not ingrained in our law a tax that \nreaches down, and when you have a big bush, a big growth of a plant \nthat is growing big, maybe it is a Wal-Mart or Kmart or maybe a Car \nQuest, and it is getting bigger and bigger, and this little plant grows \nup and starts competing with it and gets a little sunlight and starts \ngetting bigger, all of a sudden, somebody comes out and cuts the top \noff of it. That is what the estate tax does; it cuts the top off of \nsmall businesses. It savages them and makes them less competitive \nagainst the international, multinational, mega corporations. It is an \nanticompetitive act.\n  I believe we ought to do something about it. It brings in less than 2 \npercent of the income to this country. I reject this demagogic attack \nthat because somebody made $20 million, they are somehow evil and rich \nand ought to be made to pay a huge amount of tax on that money. Well, \nit was said the Republicans are for this bill. It is a Republican idea \nand that is all bad. But in the House, even though those Democratic \nRepresentatives were under the most intense pressure from their \nleadership to hang to the party line, 65 of them rejected the pressure \nand stood firm and voted to completely eliminate this tax.\n  I think that shows it is not limited to a Republican idea. It is a \nbroad bipartisan idea that has the overwhelming support of the American \npeople. We only do it on estates of $20 million or more. I want to talk \nabout that directly.\n  They say: Well, for an estate of $75 million, we ought to have no \nsympathy for them. We ought not to feel any concern that the tax man \ntakes 55 percent of it. What is 55 percent of $75 million? It is $40 \nmillion. Who says it is fair to take $40 million of an estate that \nsomebody has worked all of their life to build up with after-tax money, \nand you are just going to rip it out and send it to Washington? I don't \nbelieve that is just.\n  Again, those are the kinds of companies and businesses that are \ngetting competitive. They have the ability to compete in the \nmarketplace. If we savage them, we are knocking down small industries \nand businesses that might be\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\ncompetitive against the established order.\n  I think it is healthy for America to have growing companies worth \n$100 million or $150 million. I see no need to attack them when we \ndon't attack Wal-Mart, Kmart, or GM, and Nestle's, and those kinds of \ncompanies.\n  Now we hear this talk about Social Security. Oh, yes, if we vote to \neliminate the estate tax, we are going to oppose Social Security.\n  Let me tell you that we are going to protect Social Security. We are \nnot going to allow Social Security to fail. We support it on this side \nof the aisle. We fought aggressively for a lockbox to lock up any \nSocial Security surplus and guarantee it would not be spent by the big \nspenders that are here. The Democrats across the aisle opposed it and \nwould not allow us to pass that bill. We set it aside anyway. But we \ndon't have the protection to do it year after year as we would if we \nhad passed a lockbox.\n  Why wouldn't they support that, if they like Social Security so much? \nThe reason is they want more money to spend, spend, spend. That is the \nmentality--spend, spend, spend; ask for more votes for the people to \nwhom you give money, and keep them in power year after year. By the \nway, we know more in Washington how to spend your money than you do.\n  Make no mistake, this is a classic case of taxes and who has the \npower. You give more money to the Federal Government and have less for \nyourself. Then the Government is empowered and you are diminished.\n  We ought to ask ourselves: How is it that the percentage of the total \ngross domestic product that goes to the Federal Government since \nPresident Clinton took over in 1992 has gone from 17.9 percent to 20.7 \npercent, higher than at the peak of World War II?\n  To say we can't conduct our business, take care of the needs of this \ncountry, and keep that tax rate from rising every year and the rising \npercentage of money going every year to Washington is a mistake. It is \na fundamental choice that we as Americans have to make. Will we \ncontinue to allow the erosion of the independence, freedom, and \nautonomy of individual American citizens to be eroded in favor of a \nbloated and growing political Washington establishment?\n  Those are the choices we are dealing with. We ought to eliminate bad \ntaxes. This estate tax is one of the worst. It costs an incredible \namount for the Federal Government to collect. It costs an incredible \namount for the families who have to go through the estate tax process \nto have to try to figure out ways to create trusts and so forth to \nminimize it. It is extremely painful to families. It brings in less \nthan 2 percent of our national budget. Let's get rid of the tax. Let's \nnot keep it anymore. Let us reject this cause that we are going to \neliminate it for some but we are going to keep it on these other groups \nthat make $20 million because they are evil, and we can take 55 percent \nof their money; that is all right. I don't believe that is a legitimate \nprinciple on which to operate.\n\n  I believe the tax rate ought to be fair. We have increased our \nFederal maximum tax rate on the wealthy now to 39 percent of what they \nmake. That is a high amount--39 percent of everything somebody makes at \nthe margin. Why do we now need to reach into the grave and take out \nwhat they have accumulated after paying those taxes?\n  I think we are going to eliminate this tax sooner or later. The \nAmerican people support it overwhelmingly. The farmers and the small \nbusiness groups support the elimination. So do the American people.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Jon Kyl for his \nleadership in consistently, effectively, and brilliantly promoting this \nlegislation from the beginning.\n  We are at a point where we are going to bring it up for a vote. We \nhad to have cloture to get it here. I appreciate that the majority \nleader has favored that. I look forward to hearing the Senator from \nArizona's remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Arizona \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Alabama \nfor his kind remarks.\n  Mr. President, I heard some astonishing claims this morning and \nsomewhat this afternoon. I would like to try to respond to some of the \nthings that have been said by some of our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Let me, first of all, note for those who might be watching this that \nthe primary object of those on the minority side is to stop us from \nhaving a vote on the repeal of the death tax. That is the last thing in \nthe world they want. That is why they are trying to confuse the issue \nby suggesting that they want to offer all kinds of amendments that have \nnothing whatsoever to do with the death tax in order to prevent us from \never getting to a vote on the death tax.\n  When we keep talking about cloture, I will explain to those who \naren't familiar with Senate terms that it is required because the \ndistinguished minority leader will not reach an agreement with the \nmajority leader on the terms under which we could bring this up for a \nvote. So we have to get 60 Senators who will agree to finally bring \nthis matter to a close so we can actually have a vote. That will be a \nvery important vote. Whether or not we get 60 votes, we don't know. But \nI am counting on a great deal of bipartisan support because we have \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives which voted \noverwhelmingly for H.R. 8, which is the bill before us. There are nine \nDemocratic sponsors of the Kyl-Kerrey bill, which is part of H.R. 8. \nThat is the bill we introduced to repeal the death tax which was then \nincorporated in the House bill.\n  Just a quick reminder that the House bill and what we are debating \nhere today will reduce the rates over a 10-year period and in the tenth \nyear repeal the estate tax altogether by, in effect, replacing it with \na capital gains tax. That is one of the points I will get to later. We \nare not forgoing all of this revenue, as people on the other side of \nthe aisle have argued.\n  Actually, the taxes that will be collected when property is \neventually sold and taxed under capital gains is just about the same \namount that would be collected under the death tax. Anyway, chances are \nthere won't be much revenue lost, even if that is a concern in this era \nof many hundred-billion-dollar surpluses. I want to start with those \nparticular comments.\n  As I said, I was astonished by some of the claims made here. Let me \nmention two:\n  One by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, who in effect said \nthat the estate tax should be imposed on successful people as the price \nfor the privilege of living in America and making a lot of money.\n  That turns the American dream on its head. The American dream, as I \nunderstand it, and as folks with whom I have talked in Arizona \nunderstand, is being able to work hard, to save, to invest, and to be \nable to create a situation where the next generation can have a little \nbetter opportunity than you had. That is the American dream. We all \nlive for that, for our kids and our grandkids. It is exactly the \nopposite as expressed by some on the other side--that if you are \nsuccessful, by golly, the Government is going to come in and take it \nall from you. No, excuse me--take half it from you when you die. First, \nthey are not taking it from you. They are taking from your employees, \nfrom your kids, and from your grandkids. That is not fair. That is not \nthe American dream.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, employing some of the new \nGore rhetoric, said it all boils down to a question of, Whose side are \nyou on? Well, I will accept that challenge. Whose side are we on here?\n  Mr. President, I have a list of about 100 different organizations \nthat strongly favor the repeal of the estate tax. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Family Business Estate

I will not read the entire list. It includes not only \norganizations that we are familiar with such as the American Farmer \nBureau Federation, the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nNational Newspapers Association, the Small Business Legislative \nCouncil, and groups similar to that. It also includes groups such as \nthe National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business \nAssociation, the National Association of Neighborhoods, U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, the Texas Conference of Black Mayors. Also, \nenvironmental organizations such as the Wildlife Society, the Isaak \nWalton League, Wildlife Management Institute, International Association \nof Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and more.\n  Whose side are you on? We are on the side of the American people who \nbelieve, by percentages of 70 to 80 percent, the death tax ought to be \nrepealed. That is whose side we are on. If we could ask the American \npeople, 70 percent to 80 percent of whom believe this ought to be \nrepealed, how do they vote, they vote to repeal it. That is whose side \nwe are on.\n  The second point was, we should soak the rich; after all, they can \nafford it. There was a suggestion by Senator Feingold a moment ago \nthat, after all, this property never gets taxed unless we can tax it at \nthe time of death. That is not what this bill says. We replace the \ndeath tax with the capital gains tax. Death is taken out of the \nequation. There is no tax when someone dies. But when the heirs decide \nto sell the property, if they ever do, they pay a capital gains tax, as \nthe original owner would. They pay it on the basis of the original \nowner's cost in that.\n  This is why, according to the President's own budget, the Analytical \nPerspective of the Budget of the United States, for this next fiscal \nyear, notes that the step-up basis of capital gains on at death--the \ncurrent law--in effect costs the Federal Government almost $153 billion \nover a 5-year period. That is about the tax collections from the \ninheritance tax.\n  While I am not suggesting this is going to be a complete wash, I am \nsuggesting there is not going to be all that much revenue lost to the \nTreasury, if you are concerned about that and with multihundreds of \nbillions of dollars of surplus. I am not concerned about revenue to the \nTreasury. If that is your concern, be not concerned. According to the \nPresident's own budget, the step-up in basis loses the Federal \nGovernment about $153 billion. If you calculate the amount of the \nestate tax that will be collected over 5 years, it is not a great deal \nmore than that.\n  What is this business of step-up in basis? Senator Feingold said this \nproperty is never taxed and that is why we have to have a death tax. It \nis taxed. First, your income is taxed. You are then going to buy things \nwith it. You buy stock; you will invest in other kinds of investment. \nOf course, you spend a great deal of it. Whatever you spend, you are \nspending with after-tax\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\ndollars. It has already been taxed. However, if you want to tax it \nagain, the fair way to tax it again is not at death, over which the \ndecedent has no control, but rather as a capital gain by the individual \nor people who end up selling the asset, if and when they sell. That is \nan economic decision taking tax consequences into account. That is what \nwe do here.\n  I am afraid some on the other side have not read the bill. What it \ndoes is, in effect, replace the estate tax with a capital gains tax. \nBut a 20-percent capital gains rate is a whole lot better than a 55-\npercent death tax rate. The voluntary decision to sell the property and \naccept that tax burden is a whole lot more fair than having to pay the \ntax at death. This is not property that is not being taxed and, in \nfact, it is taxed as a result of the way we have structured this \nlegislation.\n  Let me make another point about soaking the rich. It is simply not \nthe case that it is the wealthiest estates that are paying most of the \nestate tax. I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed piece by Bruce \nBartlett, appearing in the Washington Times, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 19, 2000]\n\n                    The Real Rap on Death and Taxes\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       On June 9, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to \n     abolish the estate and gift tax in the year 2010. \n     Predictably, liberals denounced the action in the strongest \n     possible terms. Bill Clinton called it ``costly, \n     irresponsible and regressive.'' The New York Times said, \n     ``Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so \n     few.'' Robert McIntyre of the far-left Citizens for Tax \n     Justice told CBS News that supporters of repeal have done \n     nothing but lie about their plan, which he views as nothing \n     but a giveaway to the ultrawealthy.\n       The truth is that the burden of the estate tax falls \n     primarily on modest estates, not those of the Bill Gates and \n     Warren Buffets of the world. The latest data from the \n     Internal Revenue Service tell the story. In 1997, more than \n     50 percent of all estate and gift taxes were collected from \n     estates under $5 million. Only 20 percent came from the very \n     wealthy, those with estates of more than $20 million.\n       Furthermore, the effective tax rate (net tax as a share of \n     gross estate) is significantly higher for estates between $5 \n     million and $20 million than on those of more than $20 \n     million. An estate between $2.5 million and $5 million \n     actually pays a higher rate than that paid by estates of more \n     than $20 million--15 percent for the former and 11.8 percent \n     for the latter.\n       How can this be the case when estate tax rates are steeply \n     progressive, taxing estates of more than $3 million at a 55 \n     percent rate? The answer is that estate planning can \n     eliminate the tax if someone wants to spend sufficient time \n     and money setting up trusts and organizing one's affairs for \n     that purpose. Those with great wealth are far more likely to \n     engage in estate planning than a farmer, small businessman or \n     someone with a modest stock portfolio. Hence, the heaviest \n     burden of the estate tax falls not on the very wealthy, but \n     the slightly well-to-do.\n       The government gets more than two-thirds of all estate tax \n     revenue from estates under $10 million. The idea that taxing \n     the stuffing out of such estates does anything to equalize \n     the distribution of wealth in America is ludicrous. All it \n     does is prevent those with modest assets from becoming \n     wealthy. Academic research has shown that estate taxes \n     squeeze vital liquidity out of small businesses, often \n     forcing them to sell out to larger competitors. Thus the \n     estate tax makes it more difficult for small firms to grow \n     and become large.\n       Of course, the same people who support high estate taxes \n     also support aggressive use of the antitrust laws to break up \n     big businesses like Microsoft because they lack competition. \n     Yet the estate tax destroys many potential competitors in \n     their cribs, before they are strong enough to challenge \n     entrenched corporate elites.\n       One could, perhaps, make a case for a heavy estate tax if \n     there were evidence a large share of the nation's wealthiest \n     families got that way through inheritances. But this, in \n     fact, is not the case in America and never has been. A 1961 \n     study by the Brookings Institution found that only 6 percent \n     of the wealthy acquired most of their assets through \n     inheritance. Sixty-two percent reported no inheritances \n     whatsoever.\n       A 1995 study by the Rand Corp. got similar results. It \n     found that among the top 5 percent of households, ranked by \n     wealth, inheritances accounted for just 8 percent of assets. \n     A 1998 study by U.S. Trust Corp. found that among the \n     wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, inheritances were a \n     significant source of wealth for just 10 percent of them.\n       The truth is that most of the wealthy in America--even the \n     billionaires--made it themselves. They weren't born with \n     silver spoons in their mouths, living off the industry of \n     their parents or grandparents. Most of the very wealthy got \n     that way because they started businesses and took enormous \n     risks that paid off. According to the latest Forbes 400 list \n     of America's wealthiest people, 251 were self-made.\n       And among the modestly wealthy, with fortunes in the low \n     seven digits, many got that way simply because they saved and \n     invested for retirement the way all financial advisers say \n     people should. The T. Rowe Price website, for example, \n     advises that people need $20 in saving for every $1 they will \n     need in retirement over and above Social Security. This means \n     that to have $50,000 per year in retirement income a couple \n     will need $1 million in assets.\n       It simply defies logic to tell people they need to save for \n     retirement and then punish them for doing so by threatening \n     to confiscate their estates after death. And it is absurd to \n     tell such people they are the unworthy rich, who merely won \n     life's lottery, when every penny they have came from their \n     own hard work and investment. Yet that is what those fighting \n     estate tax repeal are doing.\n       If it were only the very wealthy supporting estate tax \n     repeal, there is no way estate tax repeal would have garnered \n     279 votes, including 65 Democrats. It is precisely because \n     the estate tax is more of a tax on the middle class than the \n     left believes it to be that the repeal effort has gotten so \n     far. It is not Bill Gates and Warren Buffet out there pushing \n     for repeal, but ordinary Americans who just don't want the \n     Internal Revenue Service to be their estate's primary \n     beneficiary.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will read from part of this piece. He is a senior fellow \nwith the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n\n       The latest data from the Internal Revenue Service tells the \n     story. In 1997, more than 50 percent of all estate and gift \n     taxes were collected from estates under $5 million. Only 20 \n     percent came from the very wealthy--those with estates more \n     than $20 million.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       An estate between $2.5 million and $5 million actually pays \n     a higher rate than that paid by estates of more than $20 \n     million--15 percent for the former and only 11.8 for the \n     later.\n\n  How can this be, he asks, when estate tax rates are steeply \nprogressive, taxing estates of more than $3 million at a 55-percent \nrate? The answer is, that estate planning can eliminate the tax if \nsomeone wants to spend enough money and enough time in setting up \ntrusts and organizing one's affairs for that purpose.\n  Those with more wealth obviously take advantage of that, whereas the \nsmall farmer, the small businessman or someone with a modest stock \nportfolio is not going to do it, and, in fact, doesn't, according to \nthe statistics. The Government gets more than two-thirds of all estate \ntax revenue from the estates under $10 million. The idea that taxing \nthe stuffing out of such estates does anything to equalize the \ndistribution of wealth in America, he says, is ludicrous. All it does \nis prevent those with modest assets from becoming wealthy. Academic \nresearch has shown that estate taxes squeeze vital liquidity out of \nsmall businesses, often forcing them to sell out to larger competitors.\n  I told the story earlier in this debate about a family in Arizona in \nwhich that is precisely what happened.\n  Thus, he concludes, the estate tax makes it more difficult for small \nfirms to grow and become large.\n  He makes another point:\n\n       One could, perhaps, make a case for a heavy estate tax if \n     there were evidence that a large share of the nation's \n     wealthiest families got that way through inheritances. But \n     this, in fact, is not the case in America and never has been. \n     A 1961 study by the Brookings Institution found that only 6 \n     percent of the wealthy acquired most of their assets through \n     inheritance. Sixty-two percent reported no inheritance \n     whatsoever.\n       A 1995 study by the Rand Corp. got similar results. They \n     found among the top 5 percent of households, ranked by \n     wealth, inheritance accounted for just 8 percent of assets. A \n     1998 study by U.S. Trust Corp. found among the wealthiest 1 \n     percent of Americans' inheritances were a significant source \n     of wealth for just 10 percent of them.\n\n  He concludes his piece with this:\n\n       It simply defies logic to tell people they need to save for \n     retirement and then punish them for doing so by threatening \n     to confiscate their estates after death. It is absurd to tell \n     such people that they are the unworthy rich who merely won \n     life's lottery, when every penny they have has come from \n     their own hard work and investment. Yet that is what those \n     fighting estate tax repeal are doing.\n       It is precisely because the estate tax is more of a tax on \n     the middle-class that the left believes it to be that the \n     repeal effort has gotten so far.\n\n  It seems to me, that the argument we have to keep this because it is \nimportant to soak the rich flies in the face of the studies I have \ncited. It is not the rich, in fact, who are getting soaked.\n  There has also been a suggestion, and Senator Dorgan made the point, \nthere\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nare all kinds of ideas for how to spend the money collected by this \ntax. I am sure those who like to tax and spend, who like to \nredistribute wealth, who believe in the liberal class warfare rhetoric, \nwill find lots of ways to spend money. As I pointed out, we already \nhave a huge surplus. This doesn't even make a dent in it.\n  Their argument is, therefore, we ought to be voting on other issues \nrather than voting on this. One of them was we should vote on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We already voted on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. The other side lost. They don't like to accept the fact they \nlost, but it is called accept majority rule. That is what democracy is \nall about.\n  They also want to vote on drug benefits. We are going to have votes \non drug benefits.\n  Everybody in America understands that you do things in order. The \nHouse passed the estate tax repeal. It is now before the Senate. Let's \nget it done and then we can take up that other legislation the other \nside wants to take up. It will be taken up. Let's do this now.\n  What is the reason not to? It all boils down to politics. That is the \nunfortunate proposition.\n  There is another point I find very interesting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will make this point briefly. One of the \nalternatives suggested by the other side is to increase the amount of \nthe exemption. The problem with that is there has never been a way to \ndefine who qualifies for the exemption in a simple enough way for it to \nbe effective. In fact, we have a lot of tax experts who point out that \nfew people are able to take advantage of the exemption today because it \nis just too difficult with which to comply.\n  In fact, the American Bar Association condemned it because it, in \neffect, created too much malpractice risk for lawyers who could not \nfigure out how to make it work for their clients. It is considered the \nmost dangerous section of the tax law because of the risk of \nmalpractice claims.\n  I point out that currently there are 149 tax cases that have been \ndecided and reported involving issues relating to section 2032A. The \nIRS has challenged the validity of section 2032A in estate planning, \nand the IRS has won approximately two-thirds of those cases.\n  Now section 2057, the successor, is the most dangerous and, if \nchanged as suggested here, is going to be even worse, but it will, of \ncourse, create billions of dollars in legal and accounting fees. That \nis not what we should be all about, Mr. President. We should be about \nsaving money for those who would no longer have to spend all of these \nmillions of dollars to plan against the possibility of the estate tax. \nThat is a huge amount of money that could be saved, about as much as is \npaid in estate taxes, by the way, and we can get back to a situation \nwhich is fair; namely, there will be a tax, but it will be a tax when \nthe property is sold, not when the death occurs.\n  That is the basic fairness of this proposition. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture so we can vote for H.R. 8 and repeal \nthis unfair death tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Arizona for \nhis forthright address on this very important subject that certainly \nneeds to be resolved by this body.\n  As we continue the debate on repealing the death tax, there is a \nfundamental question to which we all must respond: Should the Federal \nGovernment have the right to confiscate as much as 60 percent of the \nassets that an individual or family business has built over a lifetime?\n  That is what this debate is all about, not the class warfare \narguments we have heard from the other side, to a degree.\n  In my view, whether the estate tax is 60 percent or 40 percent or 20 \npercent, the estate tax is morally indefensible. It causes businesses \nthat have been developed over a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice to \nbe broken up just so Uncle Sam can take what some think is the \nGovernment's rightful share of that business.\n  I ask another question: Why do we have an estate tax? It may be \ninteresting to go into the background. The reason is quite simple. Up \nuntil 1913, the Federal Government was primarily financed by tariffs. \nEstate taxes were periodically imposed to primarily finance wars or the \nthreat of a war. For example, to finance the Spanish-American War, the \nFederal Government imposed a temporary estate tax in 1898. It was \nrepealed in 1902. With the advent of World War I and the drop in tariff \nrevenue, Congress adopted an estate tax with rates ranging from 1 \npercent to 10 percent.\n  What must be recognized about the estate taxes adopted in the 19th \nand early 20th centuries is the simple fact that there were no Federal \nincome taxes to finance the Federal Government at that time. So the \nGovernment looked at estate taxes. As a result, all of the wealth that \naccumulated in estates had never before been taxed.\n  By contrast, when an individual dies today, his or her estate \nconsists of assets that have been built with aftertax money. The \nelderly woman who dies with several hundred thousand dollars worth of \nTreasury notes in her estate has paid Federal income taxes every single \nyear on those notes. The businesses that have been built up over a \nlifetime have paid income taxes and, in many cases, have paid corporate \ntaxes to the Federal Government. Why, after accumulating wealth and \nhaving paid income taxes on that wealth, does the Federal Government \nhave the right to confiscate that wealth? I do not think it has that \nright.\n  While I believe this is a moral question, I also look at the \nrealities of estate planning and conclude that when confronted with an \nunfair and confiscatory tax system, Americans overwhelmingly reject the \nidea that the Government has such a right.\n  With proper estate planning, it is clear that many Americans can \nstructure their affairs in such a way that they can entirely avoid \npaying any estate taxes. In fact, of the estates valued at more than \n$600,000, more than half, or 55 percent, paid not a single dollar in \nestate taxes. Of the richest Americans, those with estates valued over \n$20 million, nearly one-third paid no estate tax.\n  It seems to this Senator that the estate tax has become a bonanza for \nestate planners and tax accountants and an unfair and onerous burden to \nthe small businesses and farmers of America who do not have the \nresources nor the time to take advantage of sophisticated estate \nplanning schemes. As a result, more than 60 percent of the burden of \nthe estate tax falls on estates valued at $5 million or less.\n  As my colleagues know, the primary asset in many of these smaller \nestates is the family business, whether a small retail or wholesale \noperation or a family farm. When it comes time to pay the estate tax, \nmany of these family businesses are forced to liquidate a portion of \nthe business or even, in some cases, the businesses themselves; or sell \nthe farm to basically pay the taxes. That is unconscionable especially \nwhen it has taken decades to build a business.\n\n  The ability to pass on the assets that have been built up over a \ngeneration to another generation is made unrealistic by the tax burden \nassociated with the estate tax and, in the case of those who have not \nbeen fortunate enough to do estate planning, many of these people feel \nthey have been unjustly penalized by their Government, and I agree with \nthem. When it comes time to pay the estate tax, many of these family \nbusinesses, as I have indicated, are forced to liquidate.\n  The other option for many of these businesses is to saddle a business \nwith a large debt to pay the tax. This only heightens the cash-flow \nproblems that many small businesses confront as a matter of everyday \nactivity.\n  Of course, when sophisticated estate planning is available, many of \nthese small business estate problems would undoubtedly go away, but \nthen we as policymakers should ask ourselves: What is the sense in \nconstructing a tax that primarily produces a livelihood to those who \ncan advise others on how to avoid the tax?\n  I will repeat that because I think it bears a little reflection. We \nas policymakers really must ask ourselves: What is the sense in \nconstructing a tax that primarily provides a livelihood to\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nthose who can advise others on how to avoid the tax? It is a bit \nironic.\n  The time for the death tax has passed. I hope we will not see a \nfilibuster of this measure that will help maintain the growth and \ndevelopment of our dynamic economy and protect the small businesses \nthat are the backbone of our Nation.\n  Seeing no other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand under the previous agreement \nthat I have up to 1 hour in debate at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are following the Senate \nproceedings, they are probably aware of the fact that we are involved \nin something called a motion to proceed, which is basically an \nintroduction or a leadup to a debate on an issue.\n  We are proceeding to an issue on the question of the estate tax. The \nestate tax has been around, I think, since President Theodore Roosevelt \nin the last century. It is a source of revenue for the Federal \nGovernment that is imposed on the estates of some people after they \npass away.\n  It is the position of the Republican majority that when you come to \nreforming the Tax Code of America, the first and highest priority is to \ndeal with the estate tax. The basis for that statement on my part is \nthe fact that it is the first matter of any consequence in terms of its \ncost that is being brought to the floor of the Senate by the Republican \nleadership.\n  So they believe, looking at the Tax Code--that affects literally \nevery American, every individual, every family, every business--and \nsearching out an inequity in it, that the estate tax is the source of \nan inequity, an unfairness, and it should be the first thing that we \naddress if we are going to reform the Tax Code.\n  That is an interesting observation because when you consider how many \nAmericans are affected by the estate tax, it turns out that they are \nliterally very few in number.\n  In 1997, the estates of fewer than 43,000 people in America had to \npay any Federal estate tax. That is 43,000 people out of 2.3 million \nwho passed away in that year. So less than 2 percent--1.9 percent--of \nthe estates of those passing away in the year 1997 had any obligation \nto pay the Federal estate tax--43,000 people.\n  What the Republicans have suggested as a way to eliminate this estate \ntax is to take money out of our anticipated surplus in the budget to \nmake sure that those 43,000 in the future will not have to pay any \nestate tax.\n  What does this cost us out of the surplus? In the first 10 years or \nso, the estimates are somewhere in the $100-$150 billion range. But in \nthe next 10-year period of time, it grows dramatically, and the cost of \nthis tax relief for literally 1.9 percent of the people who die in a \ngiven year is some $750 billion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I apologize for the interruption, but I was going to make \nan inquiry about the time schedule. I heard the Senator indicate he had \n1 hour under an agreement. Are there other time agreements that have \nbeen entered into on each side?\n  Under the rule, you can get up to an hour. So we never got a time \nlimitation?\n  Then, also, I believe earlier we had indicated we would go to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill tonight between 6:30 but not \nlater than 7 o'clock. Has there been any agreement with regard to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of one.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding so that I could get some \nfeel for the time. I will discuss it with the leadership on the other \nside. I still hope that while we have had debate on both sides today, \nfor the most part on the death tax issue, we would still be able to \nkeep our verbal commitment to Senator Warner and Senator Levin that not \nlater than 7 o'clock tonight we will go to the DOD authorization bill \nand see if we can make some progress on that.\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator for allowing me to interrupt him to \nget a clarification on that. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to the majority \nleader to clarify the procedure.\n  Back to the point I was making. We are dealing with an estate tax \nthat affects very few Americans--people in higher income categories. \nThe decision has been made by the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate that if we are going to change the Tax \nCode as it affects any American, any individual, any family, any \nbusiness, the first and highest--obviously one of the most expensive--\npriority is to eliminate this estate tax.\n  I find that curious because I think if you went to the American \npeople and said to them: When it comes to the taxes that you are likely \nto pay in your life and those that you believe are particularly unfair, \nwould you believe that the estate tax ranks high on that list? It is \nnot likely they would. They may object to taxes in general. They may \nobject to this tax in particular. But the likelihood that the average \nAmerican, even one who has done pretty well in life, is going to end up \npaying the Federal estate tax is minimal. Less than 2 percent of those \nwho die each year pay the tax. If a spouse dies and leaves all the \nproperty to another spouse, there is no taxable event--no Federal \nestate tax is paid.\n  When you consider the fact that 98 out of every 100 people who die \neach year face no Federal estate tax, the obvious question is, Why is \nthis the highest priority when it comes to the Republican agenda for \ntax reform? Wouldn't you think it would be a tax that would help out a \nlot more people than, say, 43,000 in 1997, some of the wealthiest \npeople in our country? Wouldn't you think it might be a tax that \naffects the payroll tax that hundreds of thousands of workers pay each \nweek? Or taxes that businesses pay? Or changing our Tax Code so a \nbusinessman can offer health insurance to his employee, for example? \nNo, it is not. It turns out, when they drew up their list of \npriorities, the Republican leadership came to the conclusion that the \nmost important group to single out for assistance would be the \nwealthiest among us, with this estate tax.\n  I might tell you, this is not a cheap, inexpensive undertaking. To \nthink we are going to spend some $750 billion for this estate tax \nreform that is being asked for by the Republican side means, frankly, \nthat money will not be there to be spent for other purposes, which is \nthe reason I am on the floor tonight to discuss this estate tax in the \ncontext of choices that are to be made, decisions that are to be made. \nWhen the Republicans drew up the line of Americans who needed help the \nmost, they put in the front of the line, in the first place in the \nline, the wealthiest in our country. That is not new. That is what \nGeorge W. Bush has proposed when it comes to tax cuts: First help the \nwealthiest. When it comes to their agenda on the floor of the Senate, \nthe Republican leadership has said: Before you do anything else, help \nthe wealthiest people in our society.\n  Frankly, I come to this argument with a different perspective. I \nbelieve our obligation is to the entire Nation, not only to those who \nare financially articulate; those who are the largest contributors; \nthose who have made the most of their lives by making the most of their \nincome. It appears that I see this somewhat differently than those who \nare on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Let me concede at the outset that the estate tax should be changed. \nThe estate tax, as it is currently written, has not kept pace with \nreality. We have not increased the exemption under that estate tax as \nwe should have, and we on the Democratic side are going to propose, as \npart of a reform of the estate tax, something I think will be of great \nassistance to the vast majority of families who are barely qualifying \nto pay an estate tax.\n\n  This is what we are going to propose on the Democratic side. We are \ngoing to increase the general exemption from\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n$1.35 million per couple to $2 million per couple by 2002, and $4 \nmillion by 2010. That means that by 2010, if your estate is worth $4 \nmillion, you will not pay a penny in Federal estate tax. How many \npeople will be eliminated from Federal estate tax liability because of \nthe Democratic proposal? Two-thirds of the estates currently subject to \ntax would not be subject. So we are really taking those who are on the \nlower end of liability and removing that liability.\n  We go a step further because there is a legitimate concern in \nIllinois and around the country that many family farms, for example, \ncannot be passed on by a surviving spouse to the children; family \nbusinesses, small businesses that have been created cannot be passed on \nto children to carry on. I am sensitive to that. I have met a lot of \nfarmers and a lot of businesspeople who have said: This is something we \nbuilt our lives around, our family built their lives around. Then when \nwe die, the value of the business is such we could not leave it to our \nkids.\n  I think we have to find a way to deal with it. The Democratic \nalternative does. Let me tell you how. We increase the family-owned \nbusiness exemption from $2.6 million per couple to twice that of the \ngeneral exemption of $4 million per couple by 2002; $8 million by 2010. \nThe net result of it is this: This will remove virtually all family-\nowned farms from liability under the estate tax and 75 percent of \nfamily-owned businesses from the estate tax rolls.\n  I think this is a realistic and honest reform of the estate tax. I \ncan go back to my home State of Illinois and say, for individuals as \nwell as family farms and small businesses, we heard their pleas for \nassistance and relief and we responded in a way that I can defend. The \ncost of our approach, over a 20-year period, is some $300 billion. The \ncost of the Republican approach is $750 billion because, you see, they \ngo all the way. They take the tax off virtually everyone. So if people \nhave been so fortunate, living in this country, prospering in this \ncountry, to die with estates that are worth billions of dollars, then, \nfrankly, the Republicans say they should not owe this country a nickel; \nat this point we are going to take the tax off of them; we are going to \ngive them a tax break.\n  Let me show some charts to illustrate this tax and its impact. This \nis estates subject to the current estate tax--97 percent of the current \nnonfarm, non-small business estates pay no estate tax; 3 percent of \nsmall businesses and family farms might face some liability. So it is a \ntax, as I indicated earlier, that affects very few.\n  Look at this, too, in terms of the share of the estate tax burden. \nThe bottom 98 percent of people who pass away in this country pay zero \nin Federal estate tax. The top one-tenth of the wealthiest 1 percent of \nestates in America pay 50 percent. We are talking about the highest \nrollers in America, the people who have done the best, who would end up \npaying over 50 percent of the income that comes to this country from \nestate taxes. Those are the people the Republicans say should be first \nin line when we talk about tax relief.\n\n  I see it a different way. Let me tell you some of the things we might \nconsider doing instead of providing this kind of tax relief to people \nwho are in such high-income categories.\n  We could take the difference between the Democratic and Republican \nplan, some $450 billion over 20 years, and pay down our publicly held \nnational debt. I think that is of value to everybody in this country, \nrich and poor alike, families, individuals, businesses--big business \nand small business. Why? As the Government borrows money to pay down \nits debt, it is money taken out of the system that could have been used \nfor the creation of businesses and capital creation. As the Government \nborrows money, it competes for available funds in the marketplace and \nraises interest rates. As we pay down our national debt, we reduce the \nburden of taxpayers to service that debt and, frankly, give to our \nchildren the very best legacy. We do not leave them the mortgage that \nwe incurred for our debts during our lifetime.\n  Many of us believe that is a more responsible thing to do than to \ngive a tax break under the estate tax to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. The Republicans disagree. They say the highest priority is not \nbringing down our national debt; the highest priority tax relief is for \npeople who are literally making millions of dollars a year.\n  Let me give an example. The Republican estate tax bill gives the \nForbes magazine's 400 richest Americans, read this now, a $250 billion \nwindfall tax break. Money that could have been spent to reduce our \nnational debt, to say to future generations we are going to take that \nburden off your shoulders--instead is being given to literally the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  That is the idea of tax justice being propounded on the Republican \nside of the aisle. I don't think it works. I don't think it is \nconsistent with the values and ethics of most American families.\n  There are other things that can be done and may not be accomplished \nbecause of this Republican strategy to eliminate the estate tax in its \nentirety. Let me address one that is so very important to so many \npeople. It is the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. When the \nMedicare program was created in the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson did \nsomething which literally changed America. He decided, with the help of \nthe Democratic Congress, that we would create a health insurance plan \nfor the elderly and disabled in America.\n  At that point in time, they were on their own. If they had the \nresources to pay for health insurance, or they were wealthy enough not \nto care, they were taken care of. But the vast majority of people going \ninto retirement were really vulnerable. They no longer had a paycheck--\nmaybe a Social Security check, but they had little else to turn to. \nWhen they faced a huge hospital bill or a doctor bill, they were on \ntheir own. So we created Medicare.\n  As good as Medicare has been--and it is a proven success because \nseniors are living longer--it didn't include prescription drugs. You \nknow what that means today? When you go to a doctor and say, ``I don't \nfeel well,'' the doctor says, ``Let me write out a prescription. Take \nthe pills and see if it helps.'' So you go to the drug store and get \nthe medicine. Maybe it will help, and in most cases it does. But the \ncost of those drugs continues to increase. A lot of seniors on fixed \nincomes can't afford to pay for the prescription drugs.\n  I have had hearings in the State of Illinois, and people have told \nstories that are sad but true, where they have had to make hard \nchoices. There were seniors who were literally deciding whether or not \nto fill their prescriptions or to fill their grocery orders; seniors \nwho would go into a supermarket and go to the pharmacy first to decide \nwhether or not they could afford their medicine before they shopped for \nfood; seniors who didn't fill prescriptions because they couldn't \nafford it, or they may take half a pill instead of what they were \nsupposed to take because they couldn't afford to pay for the full \nprescription. That is a reality of life in America today.\n  When the Republicans say our highest priority has to be the \nelimination of an estate tax, which means a $250 billion windfall tax \nbreak to the 400 richest Americans, I think they have it all wrong. I \nthink our highest priority should be a prescription drug benefit. After \nwe have paid down this national debt, we should take a portion of it \nand put it in a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. That will \nhelp more people. It is certainly going to improve the quality of their \nlives.\n  If I had to list my highest priority after paying down the national \ndebt, it would be to help with the prescription drug benefit. Now, the \nRepublicans in the House proposed their own version of a prescription \ndrug benefit. It is clearly something supported by the drug companies \nand pharmaceutical industry because it would allow them to continue to \ncharge their high prices. What it would say is that basically they \nwould subsidize people buying insurance to pay for their prescription \ndrugs. But when you take a close look at it, it falls apart.\n  First off, the insurance industry doesn't offer that kind of \nprescription drug insurance by itself. If they do, it is extremely \nexpensive. The reason they don't offer it is something called ``adverse \nselection.'' If you happen to be very ill and need prescription drugs, \nyou would go and try to buy such a policy. Of course, insurance works \nwhen people who are buying the insurance include not only those who \nneed a payout immediately, but those who are going to pay premiums \nregularly until\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nthey do. Well, for that reason, the insurance industry already has said \nthe Republican plan is not likely to ever result in any help to any \nsenior citizens.\n\n  Plus, there are a lot of people who have misgivings about turning \nover prescription drugs and their future to insurance companies. They \ncan recall what many of these same insurance companies did when it came \nto HMOs and managed care. They forgot about the patient and even forgot \nabout the doctor. We had insurance clerks making decisions on health \ncare. Frankly, the losers ended up being patients and their families.\n  I recall going to a hospital in Springfield, IL, and doing rounds \nwith a local doctor. He made a decision that a woman should stay in the \nhospital over the weekend before important and delicate brain surgery \non Monday. He had to call the insurance company in Nebraska and ask for \npermission for her to stay in the hospital. The insurance company clerk \nsaid: No, send her home. The surgery is not until Monday.\n  He said: She is elderly and frail, and she loses her balance; I don't \nwant her to hurt herself, and I want her here Monday for this important \nsurgery.\n  The insurance clerk was overruling the doctor. The doctor hung up the \nphone and said: Leave her in the hospital and I will appeal this later \non.\n  That is the kind of insurance company situation the Republicans want \nto turn to when it comes to prescription drugs. They want these same \ninsurance companies to decide whether or not you get your prescription \ndrugs filled. Well, we have seen what they have done with managed care \nand with HMOs. It is no wonder that a lot of Americans are skeptical \nabout the Republican approach to this. They would much rather see a \nplan for prescription drugs under Medicare, one that is universal and \ncovers everybody. Medicare currently covers everybody. I also recall \nthat in the last couple years some 1.3 million seniors have seen their \nMedicare HMO plans canceled by the insurance companies. So they are \nhigh and dry and are looking for insurance coverage.\n  When the Republicans say we can trust the insurance companies when it \ncomes to prescription drugs and health care, human experience tells us \notherwise. These companies make decisions based on the bottom line \nprofit. These companies will cut off people in terms of their coverage \nwhen they no longer think they are turning a profit, and they will \nleave the people high and dry.\n  The other thing that is fundamentally flawed in the Republican \napproach on prescription drug benefits is they don't even address the \nquestion of pricing. You can create a prescription drug benefit that \nlooks beautiful on paper. It will be easy to sit down with any number \nof Americans and come to that conclusion. But if you don't address the \nincreasing cost of prescription drugs, it is a guarantee that that \nbenefit and that program will fail. The Republicans do not even address \nthat.\n  If we bring this program under Medicare, as the Democrats have \nsuggested, we will have bargaining power. What is that worth when it \ncomes to prescription drug benefits? You have heard stories, as I have, \nabout people who go to Canada and buy the same drugs for a fraction of \nthe cost in the United States. They are exactly the same drugs, made in \nthe U.S., approved by the Federal Government, sent to Canada, where \nthey charge a fraction of the cost. Why is this? It is because of the \nbargaining power of the Canadian Government. They sit down with the \ndrug companies and they say: We are not going to agree to a price \nincrease every month or to the prices going through the roof. If you \nwant your drugs as part of our health care system in Canada, you will \nkeep the prices under control.\n\n  Do you know what. The same drug companies--American drug companies--\ndo just that. They keep prices under control in Canada, but they charge \nAmericans skyrocketing drug prices.\n  The Republican plan on prescription drug benefits doesn't even \naddress this. If you don't address the pricing of drugs, frankly, you \nare offering no benefit whatsoever--no prescription drug benefits. Do \nAmericans want it? You bet they do, in overwhelming numbers. That is a \nhigh priority. But to take a look at this, the highest priority for the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate is not prescription drug benefits \nfor the elderly and disabled; it is the elimination of the estate tax, \nwhich gives the Forbes magazine 400 richest American families a $250 \nbillion windfall tax break.\n  Which would help America more? Prescription drug benefits so seniors \ncan remain independent and strong and healthy for a longer period of \ntime or a windfall tax break to the wealthiest people in this country? \nI think the answer is obvious. But it really betrays the statement from \nthe Republican side that they are in tune with the American people when \nthey would come up with an estate tax change of such magnitude and \nwhich is so generous to the wealthiest among us, when the American \npeople are looking for something much different from this Congress.\n  We want to make sure the drug benefit is available to everybody. We \nwant to make sure you have your choice, that your doctor will be able \nto prescribe the necessary drugs for you and that they will be filled. \nWe want to make sure that it is done under Medicare.\n  We think the effort of the Republicans to take this out of Medicare \nmay be the beginning effort to basically tear down Medicare. This has \nnever been a program the Republicans have cheered over. When we want to \ntry to protect Medicare, it is usually a lonely voice on the Senate \nfloor. They have not been willing to come forward. They understand it \nwas a creation of Democratic leadership, and I guess they are not \nlistening to their seniors and disabled at home who understand the \ncritical importance of this program.\n  There are other things we can be doing in terms of the Tax Code that \nwould help real people and families. One of them is the full \ndeductibility of health insurance. The fact that self-employed people \nin this country cannot fully deduct their health insurance premiums is \nwhat I consider one of the major injustices in the Tax Code. If you \nstart a small business and you want to provide health insurance for \nyourself, your family, or for some of your employees, you might find \nyourself in a position where you cannot deduct the full cost of the \nhealth insurance premiums from your taxes. Large corporations can; \nsmall businesses can't. Big corporations can do it; family farmers \ncannot.\n  That doesn't make any sense. It is unjust. It is a loophole in the \nTax Code which should be changed to protect the small businessman and \nto protect the family farmer and the people who work for them.\n  If I draw up a list of priorities when it comes to tax reform, I \ndon't start off with the 400 richest Americans and give them a $250 \nbillion windfall tax break. Instead, I deal with real families, real \nbusinesses, and real people who are trying to find health insurance to \ncover members of their family.\n  I also think we should be considering a tax credit for small \nbusinesses that offer health insurance to their employees. We know in \nAmerica that there are some 4 million people who have no health \ninsurance whatsoever. I think that is a scandal. Frankly, in a nation \nas prosperous as we are and at a time when we are talking about \nliterally trillion-dollar surpluses, it is incredible to me that we \ndon't have the political will on a bipartisan basis to start talking \nabout health insurance coverage for all sorts of American families and \nbusinesses. But we haven't done it. Instead, we hear from the \nRepublican side of the aisle that before we talk about health \ninsurance, before we start talking about tax credits to businesses, \nbefore we start talking about prescription drugs, let's take care of \nthe richest people in America. That is their highest priority. That is \nthe group they put on the front of the line. We see it differently on \nthe Democratic side. We believe there are things we can do to improve \nthe quality of life of many people.\n  Let me also tell you about another proposal on which I prepared \nlegislation. It is called caregivers insurance. We have a plan now for \nchildren across America. Many of the States are implementing it. If \nchildren don't have health insurance, we help States pay for that \nhealth insurance. That is a good plan. I voted for it. I supported it. \nI think we should extend it to the next\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nphase--to what I call caregivers insurance. When I make reference to \ncaregivers, I am talking about people who work in day-care centers, \nthose who are literally in charge of our children and grandchildren \nevery single day. The people who work for a minimum wage, or slightly \nmore, have no benefits. There is massive turnover in their jobs. I \nthink we ought to be talking about extending health insurance for those \ncaregivers in day-care centers, those who work in personal attendance \nof the disabled, home health care workers who take care of people so \nthey can stay home and not have to go to nursing homes, and for those \nworking in convalescent nursing homes.\n  Those are caregivers who have very little benefits. Yet we trust them \nwith our parents, with our grandparents, with our children, and \ngrandchildren.\n  I think that is the kind of thing many American people would like to \nsee. It will help them pay for child care. It won't raise the cost. We \nwill provide the health insurance through a program of our own at the \nFederal level. I would like to vote on it. I think it would be well \nreceived. I might not get that chance because the vote we will face in \nthe next few days is whether or not, instead of helping caregivers who \nget up and go to work every day and take care of our kids and parents, \nwe are going to give to the 400 richest Americans a $250 billion \nwindfall tax break with the Republican proposal to eliminate the estate \ntax.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Illinois will \nyield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in the discussion offered \nby the Senator from Illinois. In fact, I was interested in the \ndiscussion earlier by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, who was \ncomplaining about some comments I made earlier in the day.\n  As I understand the Senator from Illinois, he indicated earlier--and \nI did earlier today as well--that he would support an amendment that \nwould effectively say we will repeal the estate tax for all small \nbusinesses and family farms up to $8 million. So there is no \ndisagreement in this Chamber on that. We will repeal the estate tax for \nthose estates up to $8 million. The difference is the majority party \nsays that is not enough. We want to repeal the estate tax for estates \nover $8 million as well.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois seems to be saying, as I said this morning, \nthat the loss of revenue by repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest \nestates in this country is something that ought to be measured against \nother alternatives, such as providing a tax cut for middle-income \npeople, for example, or a range of investments that might be made to \nstrengthen this country.\n  The Senator from Arizona, I noted, was saying: Well, people who think \nlike that are big-spending liberals.\n  Who are the real big spenders? They are the folks who say: You know, \nwe ought to spend money by deciding that a $1 billion estate should be \nrelieved of the burden of having any estate tax at all, and decide that \nrelieving an estate tax burden from the largest estates in this country \nis more important than investment in education, it is more important \nthan a middle-income tax cut, it is more important than paying down the \nFederal debt.\n  Who are the big spenders, I ask the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator hit the nail on the head. What the \nRepublicans are prepared to do is spend our surplus by providing tax \nbreaks for the wealthy people in this country. The Senator and I happen \nto see it differently. We believe we can reform the estate tax and \nbasically protect small businesses, family farms, and estates of people \nleaving $8 million, and still have money left for valid programs in \nthis country. It will help a lot of working families and family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it a fact, more than reforming the estate tax, that \nthe Senator from Illinois and the Senator from North Dakota and others \nwould say let's effectively repeal the estate tax for estates up to $8 \nmillion for small businesses or family farms? In fact, the Senator from \nIllinois is saying let's repeal the estate tax to that level. But he \ndoesn't want to go the next step as proposed by the majority party of \nsaying no, that is important to do, but let's do something that is even \nmore important. Let's make sure the repeal of the estate tax burden \napplies to people who leave estates of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Is that a priority? It seems to me that it ought to be measured \nagainst a range of other things that we ought to do.\n  I just make the point that I always smile a little when I hear these \npejoratives about big spenders. It is sort of yesterday's news. It so \nhappens that folks standing on this side of this Chamber are the ones \nwho cast the tough votes that put this country back on track of getting \nrid of the burgeoning Federal deficits a few years ago when there was \nwell over $300 billion in Federal deficits, and now, of course, to \nbalance the budget. We cast the tough votes to do that. I don't need to \nhear much from people about who the big spenders are. We put this \ncountry back on track.\n  There are those who insist the largest estates in America should be \nrelieved of their estate tax burdens and are suggesting that those of \nus who believe there are other alternatives that might be more \nappropriate--more middle-income tax relief, or other things--are called \nbig spenders. I think that is yesterday's language in a wornout \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Without losing the floor, I would be happy to yield to \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding this time \nfor a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                   Interior Appropriations Amendments\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments \nbe the only first-degree amendments in order to the Interior \nappropriations bill and subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Those amendments are as follows:\n\n       B.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no later than \n6:30 p.m. tonight, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered with respect to \nthe amendments offered and debated tonight occur beginning at 11:30 \na.m. on Wednesday, with no second-degree amendments in order, where \napplicable, and 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, and that \nthere be 2 hours prior to the 11:30 a.m. votes to be equally divided \nprior to proceeding to H.R. 8.\n  To sum up, we would complete the remaining debate time between now \nand 6:30 on the death tax issue. Then we would go to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill for debate on amendments tonight. Those \nvotes on amendments, if any are required, would occur at 11:30.\n  When we come in at 9:30 tomorrow, we would have 2 more hours for \ndebate time on the estate tax/death tax issue with no second degrees in \norder, and there will be 2 minutes prior to each recorded vote at \n11:30, prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, first of all, \nwe are advised that we have a number of Senators who will have 15 \nminutes each to speak in the morning. I don't think we need to agree to \nthe motion. We consent to going to H.R. 8, if that is OK with the \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Prior to the agreeing to the amendments, to proceed, which \ncould be done.\n  Mr. REID. We want to do it by consent rather than agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I modify it to say that there will be 2 \nhours prior to 11:30 a.m., with 2 minutes equally divided before votes \nto be equally divided as we go to H.R. 8.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we just received a phone \ncall. I think this is a good agreement, but I need to call a Senator. I \nsay to the leader, if I handle this, the leader doesn't need to be on \nthe floor and I can agree to the unanimous consent request proposed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold my unanimous consent request at this time. I \napologize for interrupting speakers. If Senator Reid can make this call \nand we can renew this request momentarily, I would like to do it. I \nneed to go to a retirement event for Senators and House Members. \nHopefully, we can complete this momentarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I mentioned earlier, the issue before the Senate is \nthe Republican proposal to abolish the estate tax. This is a tax which \nis paid by less than 2 percent of the people who die in America. Those \nwho pay it are in the very highest income categories. When the \nRepublican leadership put together its list of priorities of the most \nimportant things to be done under the Tax Code, they said the first and \nmost important thing to do, and one of the most expensive things we can \ndo, is to relieve the wealthiest people in America from paying an \nestate tax. That, to me, raises a question of priorities.\n  Who will be first in line on the Republican side of the aisle to \nbenefit from this congressional action? According to the Republican \nleaders, the first in line will be the people who are first in line in \nthe world--the wealthiest in this country, the wealthiest who will \nbenefit from the elimination of this estate tax.\n  The New York Times editorial on June 11 of this year summarizes the \nimpact of this Republican proposal:\n\n       Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so \n     few. Abolishing the estate tax would have severe \n     consequences. When fully phased in, the bill would cost about \n     $50 billion a year. Repeal would also threaten the Nation's \n     finest universities and museums. Wealthy families no longer \n     facing estate tax cuts might well decide to leave more money \n     to their families, and less to charity.\n       The Democrats offered a more than reasonable alternative. \n     Yet the House swatted the alternative aside, demonstrating \n     that a large majority of Members were less concerned with \n     rescuing family farms and businesses than with enriching \n     their wealthiest supporters.\n\n  Another editorial worth making part of the Record is from USA Today \non June 9:\n\n       But behind the caterwauling about the ``death tax'' the \n     truth is quite different. Most people will never be affected \n     by inheritance taxes: 98 percent of all estates aren't big \n     enough to be liable. Even among the elite 2 percent, very few \n     are farmers and small businesses. But there are better ways \n     to spend $50 billion a year than handing it to the heirs of \n     the wealthiest people in the country. Take your pick: Middle \n     class tax cuts, improved health benefits for seniors or \n     paying down the national debt for starters.\n\n  That is what this is about.\n  The question we have to ask ourselves, Whose side are we on? Are we \non the side of the wealthiest people in this country in terms of \nhelping them out or will we be on the side of businesses, family farms, \nand families who are struggling to get by?\n  Another topic we are debating that relates to this debate on the \nestate tax is something called an H-1B visa.\n  Mr. LOTT. I apologize.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The H-1B visa is a request by many people in private \nindustry to increase the number of those who can come into the United \nStates by the tens of thousands to fill well-paying, highly skilled \njobs. The argument of these businesses is that they can't find workers \nin America with the skills necessary. We find these arguments coming \nout of Silicon Valley and similar high-tech areas. They just cannot \nfind skilled American workers to fill the jobs. They ask us to change \nthe law and allow immigrants to come from other countries to fill these \njobs. They have a legitimate concern.\n  Many Members believe we should do something to help them. If the \nalternative to bringing in people working in this country is shipping \nthe jobs overseas, that certainly doesn't do our economy any good. \nIsn't it interesting that we are considering the shortages in skilled \nworkers and allowing immigrants to come in to fill these jobs, instead \nof discussing as part of a program a way to improve education and \ntraining in America so we have these skilled workers?\n  If we are going to improve that education and training, it will cost \nmoney. Instead of putting the money into education to help kids go to \ncollege and to get special skills, the Republicans think we should put \nthe money into tax relief for the wealthiest people in this country. \nThat is the reprise we hear over and over again on the Republican side: \nJust make the wealthiest people in this country wealthier and America \nwill be a better place to live.\n  I think the wealthy people can take care of themselves. They do \npretty well. The people who need a helping hand are families trying to \nput their kids through school.\n  One of the tax benefits which most of us on the Democratic side \nsupport, one that has been proposed by President Clinton, allows \nworking families to deduct the cost of college education from their \ntaxes. That means if we have a tuition bill of $10,000, the Federal \nGovernment will basically help pay for college education expenses up \nto, say, $2,800 a year. That is a direct helping hand from the \nGovernment. It doesn't go to the wealthiest among us but to\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\npeople who are struggling to make sure their kids have a better chance \nin this world than they had.\n  I have often thought to myself, when a new child is born into a \nfamily, after everybody has come around and admired the child and tried \nto figure out if he or she looks like mom or dad or grandma or grandpa, \none of the things usually said is: Boy, by the time this little one \nreaches college age, how will we ever afford to pay for it? That is a \nreal conversation I have heard over and over again.\n  Seldom, if ever--in fact, never--have I heard families say, boy, this \nlittle one here, I am worried about how much of my estate I will be \nable to leave when I die. People think in terms of the needs of the \nliving. And the needs of the living include college education. On the \nRepublican side, this is not a priority. It is certainly not as \nimportant a priority as giving a tax break to those with the most \nextensive and largest estates in America.\n  I can recall back in the late 1950s when the Russians launched \nSputnik. There was a fear in the United States that they had a \nscientific advantage on the U.S. and that this advantage that launched \nthe satellite into space might lead to a military superiority. Congress \ndecided for one of the first times in its history to provide direct \nassistance to students. We created something known as the National \nDefense Education Act. The reason I recall that so fondly is because I \nhappened to be one of the beneficiaries of that Federal program. It was \na loan program. You could borrow money to go to college, complete your \ndegree, and pay it back to the Government. It was the best deal I ever \nhad. I like to think the money I received was money well spent for me \nand my family and perhaps for the country.\n\n  Isn't this a time in our history where we ought to be stepping back \nand, instead of trying to come up with an estate tax break for the \nwealthiest families in America, shouldn't we be thinking about ways to \nhelp families across America pay for college education and training so \nwe in America have a workforce ready for the 21st century? I think \neducation should be the first priority when it comes to tax breaks. I \ndon't think the first priority should be the estate tax repeal that the \nRepublicans have proposed. I think the wealthiest among us, as I said \nearlier, can take care of themselves. If we can find ways to help \nfamilies pay for college education, then I think we will be doing \nsomething meaningful, something that is responsive to families, to what \nfamilies across America are looking for. As I said earlier, the basic \nquestion is, Whose side are we on in Congress?\n  I also find it interesting that we have the time, whatever it takes, \nto spend debating and passing tax relief for wealthy Americans, but no \ntime to address the question of an increase in the minimum wage. There \nare 350,000 people in my home State of Illinois who got up this morning \nand went to work making a minimum wage. Some of them are teenagers in \ntheir first jobs, but, sadly, many of them are folks who are working \none, two, and three jobs trying to keep the families together. For \nyears, literally for years, the Democrats have been asking for an \nincrease in the minimum wage across America. Mr. President, $5.15 an \nhour is not enough. It is not enough to raise yourself, let alone a \nfamily. Unfortunately, the Republicans have opposed our efforts to \nincrease the minimum wage by $1 over a 2-year period of time.\n  They say they are fearful of the impact it might have if we give \npeople something closer to a living wage, but they obviously have no \nfear in spending $750 billion in a tax break for the wealthiest among \nus, people who are literally making, on average, over $190,000 a year \nin the year of their death. Those are the ones the Republicans believe \nneed help from Congress. Those who get up every morning and go to work, \ncleaning tables in a restaurant, making the food in the kitchens, \nmaking the beds in the motels, watching our kids in day-care centers, \nthe Republicans believe they do not need an increase in their minimum \nwage.\n  What a difference in priorities. I would put those folks who are \nworking hard for America and doing the right thing in the front of the \nline. The Republicans put the wealthiest, those who have made the most \nin this great country of ours, as the highest priority when it comes to \naction by Congress.\n  Time and again, when given choices between increasing health care for \nworkers and their families, giving tax benefits to small businesses so \nthey can offer health insurance, giving people the means to pay for the \ncollege education of their kids, offering such things as long-term care \ninsurance or help for the care of their aging parents, the Republicans \nhave said: No, it is not on our priority list. Our priority list starts \nwith the wealthiest people in America, the people who Forbes magazine \nidentified as the 400 richest families in America who would benefit \nfrom the Republican estate tax repeal to the tune of $250 billion. That \nis where they believe we should spend the money.\n  Frankly, that is what elections are all about. Those of us on the \nDemocratic side who believe we can have a better Nation, that we can \ntake our anticipated surplus and invest it in the people of this \ncountry, think the Republicans are fundamentally wrong. We can reform \nthe estate tax, we can exempt the vast majority of families, over 99 \npercent of the families in America, we can exempt virtually two-thirds \nor more of those who are currently paying the tax, and we can exempt \nfamily farms and small businesses--75 percent are currently paying the \ntax--and do it in a way where we will have money left to invest in \neducation and health care. No, the Republicans, frankly, say every \npenny has to go to the wealthiest people in this country.\n  We ought to keep a running score on the proposals on the Republican \nside and what they are going to cost. This one is worth about $750 \nbillion. If I am not mistaken, the George W. Bush tax cut for wealthy \npeople--a separate tax cut--is worth over $1 trillion, and the George \nW. Bush proposal to privatize Social Security will cost some $800 \nbillion and have benefits reduced under Social Security. To that \nextent, this gives us an idea of how the Republicans time and time \nagain want to spend the surplus which we are now enjoying in this \ncountry. That is something many of us think is very shortsighted.\n  The President's belief, and one I share, is that the first commitment \nof any surplus should be in paying down the national debt so we carry \nless of a burden for paying interest on that debt and less of a burden \nfor our children. We should take that money in our surplus and invest \nit in Social Security and Medicare so they are strong for a long time \nto come, and then target tax cuts to middle-income families, those who \nare struggling, as I said, to pay for basic expenses, whether it is day \ncare, college education, or long-term care for their parents.\n  That is the difference in philosophy. That is the choice in the \nelection year. For the Republicans, the first group in line will always \nbe the wealthiest among us. That is their party. That is in what they \nbelieve. They think if the wealthy are treated right, America is a much \nbetter place to live. A lot of us believe differently. We think \ninvesting in our people is a much better investment.\n  I want to speak for a moment about prescription drugs, too, because I \nsaid earlier this is a priority among Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents alike. They believe prescription drug benefits should be \npassed by this Congress. The Republican answer to that is the same \nanswer they came up with on a Patients' Bill of Rights: They turned to \nthe insurance industry and said to insurance companies: How can we make \nsome money for you in terms of a Patients' Bill of Rights pricing?\n  They came up with this notion we would somehow subsidize insurance \nplans to pay for prescription drugs. I think Americans are skeptical of \nthat approach. They understand the Democratic approach which would use \nthe Medicare system, which would be universal, and is a tried-and-true \nsystem under Medicare to provide benefits to families across America \nand would give the Medicare system bargaining power to keep drug prices \nunder control.\n  The Republicans want to subsidize insurance companies. It is no \nsurprise Americans are skeptical of whether those insurance companies \nwill be responsive to the needs of families when it comes to \nprescription drugs. That is why we have a serious difference between \nthe two parties on this issue. The Republican bill does not give \nseniors a choice of guaranteeing coverage under Medicare. That is the \nmost important single thing that seniors ask\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nfor: guaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare. The \nRepublican plan does not respond to that.\n  The Republican plan also provides subsidies to insurance companies, \nand yet there is no guarantee that the insurance companies will even \noffer the coverage, and they will not be offering a Medicare-type plan.\n  The Republican approach on prescription drugs does nothing about fair \nprices. As I said earlier, the pharmaceutical companies must be \ncheering this idea. The Government is going to subsidize some sort of \ninsurance scheme to pay for prescription drugs, and yet the prices \ncontinue to go through the roof. We understand that such a plan will \nnever work. What insurance company is going to sign up to pay your \nprescription drugs with no guarantee of any control on price? The \nRepublicans, obviously, are insensitive to the price issue.\n  In addition to accessibility to prescription drugs insurance, price \nis also important. Americans understand that drugs in Canada, made in \nthe United States, sell for a fraction of the cost. One can take the \nsame pill and order it at the veterinarian for one's dog and go across \nthe street and order it for oneself and find a dramatic difference in \ncost. It is because the drug companies are gaming the system, and they \nare very open about it. They are going to charge the highest price to \nthose who will pay it, and those who will pay for it in our country are \nthe Medicare beneficiaries--the seniors and disabled.\n  Once again, Republicans have failed to respond to the basic need in \nthis country: a prescription drug benefit. It is no surprise the \nRepublicans do want to use the Medicare system as the Democrats have \nproposed. We believe we can provide to seniors the choice of a \nguaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare, but the \nRepublicans are opposed to that. They have been critical of Medicare \nsince its creation. They have talked about privatizing this benefit of \nprescription drugs, leading many to believe that ultimately they are \nhoping to privatize Medicare.\n\n  When we tried, incidentally, to privatize a portion of Medicare \nrecently--we said to Medicare recipients: You can buy an HMO plan--the \ninsurance companies, after a year or two, turned around and said they \nwere not going to write coverage anymore. It has happened in Illinois \nand across the country and a million seniors have been left high and \ndry by an insurance market that is driven almost exclusively by profit.\n  That is, unfortunately, where the Republicans have turned again, to \nthe insurance industry, to try to provide some help with prescription \ndrugs. It is not going to work, and the American people know better. \nThey are going to hold this Congress accountable. If the best we can \ncome up with is the estate tax relief for the wealthiest estates in \nAmerica and nothing when it comes to prescription drug benefits, then \nwe have failed the most basic test, and that is whether we respond to \nthe common need in this country. The common need clearly is for a \nprescription drug benefit, as well as a Patients' Bill of Rights so you \ncan go to your doctor with confidence, and when that doctor makes a \ndecision about you and your family's health, it is not going to be \noverruled by someone who works for an insurance company.\n  Those are the basics: Minimum wage, prescription drug benefit, \nPatients' Bill of Rights. These are things Republicans have not added \nto their list of priorities. No, their highest priority when it comes \nto spending and tax relief still turns out to be the wealthiest people \nin America. We believe that is wrongheaded. It does not take into \naccount the folks who built this country and made it strong for so many \nyears.\n  I conclude by saying this estate tax is really a test of the \npriorities of the political parties. Who will be the first in line in \nthe U.S. Congress for help? Who would you turn to first with $750 \nbillion to provide some equity under the Tax Code? Which group of \nAmericans would you single as needing the most help? The Republicans \nhave answered those questions with the repeal of the estate tax. They \nbelieve the people who need the help the most are the folks who have \nthe most in America. I do not believe that is what America is all \nabout.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. On behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that notwithstanding the DOD authorization bill, I be \nrecognized for up to 12 minutes for debate on the estate tax issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine may proceed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is disappointing to hear the rhetoric \nfrom some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, implying \nthat if we give our family farmers and our family business owners much \nneeded relief from confiscatory death taxes that we will somehow not be \nable to afford prescription drug coverage for our senior citizens, or \neducation for our children. That is simply not true. It is \ndisheartening to hear these distortions from some of my colleagues.\n  I rise today as a longtime supporter of death tax relief for family-\nowned businesses and farms. In fact, the very first bill I introduced \nas a Senator in 1997 was to provide targeted estate tax relief for our \nfamily-owned businesses. I was very pleased when key elements of my \nlegislation were incorporated into the 1997 tax reform bill.\n  I first became interested in this issue in my role as director of the \nCenter for Family Business at Husson College in Bangor, ME, where I \nserved prior to coming to the Senate. The center sponsored a seminar on \nhow a family business should plan to pass a business on from generation \nto generation. It soon became very clear to me that a major obstacle to \nthis goal, and a significant reason why so few family businesses \nsurvive to the second, third, or fourth generation, is the onerous \nestate tax.\n  To illustrate this fact, let me share with my colleagues the story of \nJudy Vallee of Portland, ME. Ms. Vallee's father started a restaurant \nin Portland, ME. He worked very hard. The whole family worked hard. \nEventually he was able to build his business from one restaurant in \nPortland, ME, to a chain of 25 restaurants up and down the east coast.\n  Unfortunately, he died. The family was hit with a whopping estate tax \nbill of about $1 million--a bill they simply did not have the cash to \npay because their assets were tied up in these restaurants. The result \nwas the dismantling of this business, this very successful family \nbusiness, which Mr. Vallee had labored a lifetime to build.\n  The ultimate result was that the family was forced to sell off all \nthe restaurants but the one they started with in Portland. That is \nsimply wrong. It is unfair when our tax policy forces a family to \ndismantle a lifetime of work. It is unfair that a parent cannot pass on \nto the next generation the fruits of that hard work.\n  The need for death tax relief is something that small businesses and \nfarmers tell me about every time I am back home in Maine. And that is \nevery weekend. I recently talked with auto dealers from all over the \nState, including an auto dealer in Bangor, ME, who has built a \nsuccessful business that he very much wants to leave to his sons.\n  I have also talked with funeral directors, with bakery owners, with \nlumber dealers--with a host of businesses of all sizes and kinds \nthroughout the State--who simply have the goal of working hard, \ncreating jobs, building their businesses, and being able to leave those \nbusinesses to the next generation. Many of these businesses are capital \nintensive but cash poor. That is why they are hit so hard when the \nowner dies and they are subjected to onerous estate tax rates.\n  In many small towns throughout the State of Maine, these family \nbusinesses are the heart and the soul of the community. They are the \nbusinesses that support the United Way, sponsor the Little League team, \nand contribute generously to other local community-based charities. \nThey are the businesses that are always there to help because they \nemploy their friends, their neighbors, and their family members. They \nare so closely linked to the economy of the small towns in which they \nexist.\n\n  I know that small business owners across the State of Maine were so \npleased to see the House of Representatives approve H.R. 8 last month \nwith\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nsuch a strong bipartisan vote. I stress, the vote was, indeed, broad \nbased and bipartisan. A total of 65 House Democrats--both moderate and \nliberal Members--constituting more than 30 percent of the entire House \nDemocratic caucus, joined Republicans in voting for the bill.\n  Here in the Senate there is also broad bipartisan support for the \ndeath tax relief bill introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator \nJon Kyl, who has been such a leader in this effort.\n  As a matter of sound, long-term tax policy, H.R. 8 seeks to make a \nvery fundamental and noteworthy change to the Tax Code. It recognizes \nthat it is the sale of the asset, not the death of the owner, that \nshould trigger a Federal tax. H.R. 8 would establish the principle that \nif family members inherit assets or property--a family business or a \nfarm, for example--the Federal Government would tax those assets when \nthey are sold by the heirs by imposing a capital gains tax.\n  Furthermore, the legislation before us would allow the Government to \nuse the decedent's basis for determining the taxable amount of the \ninherited assets. So if a family businessperson dies and leaves the \nassets and property of their business to his or her children, they can \ncontinue running the business if they choose to do so without having to \nworry about the Federal Government's death tax bill forcing them to \nbreak up the business or sell the farm. This change would represent a \ngiant step forward for many small businesses and family farms \nthroughout Maine and the country.\n  There are two other points that I want to make about the impact of \nthe death tax. The first is that it has a very unfortunate impact on \njobs. The National Association of Women Business Owners, a group I was \npleased to work with in my time with the Small Business Administration, \nhas written a letter endorsing passage of this legislation. This \norganization surveyed many of its members and found that, on average, \n39 jobs per business, or 11,000 jobs of those businesses surveyed, have \nalready been lost due to the planning and the payment of the death tax. \nYou can multiply that death tax time and again to see the deleterious \nimpact of the death tax on job creation.\n  I know a bag manufacturer in northern Maine who told me that he \nspends tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance in \norder to be prepared in case he dies so that his family would not be \nhit by the estate tax. That is money he would like to invest right back \ninto his business in order to hire more people or to buy new equipment \nor to expand his company. But instead, he is having to divert this \nmoney into planning for the estate tax. That is a point that is missed \nby my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  They claim that only 2 percent of the people are affected by the \nestate tax. In fact, it is so many more than that because of businesses \nthat spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance or \nestate tax planning in order to avoid the imposition of the death tax.\n  The second point that I want to make is the impact of the death tax \non the concentration of economic power in this country. I think this is \nan issue that has been largely overlooked in this debate.\n  When a small business is sold because the children cannot afford to \npay the death tax, it is usually sold to a large out-of-State \ncorporation which is not subject to the death tax. When that happens, \nit generally results in layoffs for local employees, diminished \ncommitment to the community, and a greater concentration of economic \npower. Surely, we should not want that to be the result of our Federal \ntax policy.\n  The time has come for Congress to act this year to provide overdue \ndeath tax relief to our Nation's small businesses and family farms.\n  In doing so, we will take a giant step forward in making our tax \npolicy far fairer. No longer will it be the death of an owner that \ntriggers the imposition of tax but, rather, the sale of the asset when \nincome is realized. That makes so much more sense as a matter of tax \npolicy. We will also be telling people who have worked so hard over a \nlifetime to build their business that we, too, believe in the American \ndream.\n  I yield back any time I may have remaining, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6448-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6448-S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the hearing the Armed \nServices Committee held April 6 on the issue of security clearances \nrevealed a shocking lack of concern within DOD for protecting our \nnational security secrets.\n  As a result of that hearing, I proposed an amendment. My amendment, \nagain, is simple. It would prevent DOD from granting security \nclearances to those who are under indictment for, or have been \nconvicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term \nexceeding 1 year.\n  It would also disallow a clearance for anyone who is a fugitive from \njustice; is an unlawful user of, or addicted to any controlled \nsubstance; has been adjudicated as a mental defective; or has been \ndishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces.\n  As I said on the floor earlier, in an investigative series by USA \nToday, it was reported that DOHA, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals, granted clearances routinely to felons, including a murderer, \nindividuals with chronic alcohol and drug abuse problems, a pedophile \nand an exhibitionist, and a convicted cocaine dealer. All received \nsecurity clearances to work for defense contractors. Another individual \nwas awarded a clearance while on probation for bank fraud, yet another \nwas allowed to keep his clearance after taking part in a $2 million \nfraud against the Navy. Another had a history of criminal sexual \nmisconduct for which he was still undergoing therapy.\n  Common sense dictates that one convicted murderer--or one convicted \ndrug dealer with a security clearance--is one too many.\n  One individual can wreak havoc on national security. The damaging \nlegacy of Aldrich Ames, Jonathan Pollard, the Walkers, and now suspect \nspy, Wen Ho Lee, is well-known to all of us who deal with national \nsecurity issues. We simply cannot afford to have loose standards when \nit comes to protecting our secrets--and protecting lives.\n  Let me just add that during the Armed Services Committee hearing on \nthis issue, the witness from DOD's C3I,\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nwhich oversees the Defense Security Services, said this in response to \nmy questioning:\n\n       I agree wholeheartedly with your observation that one \n     unqualified person for a clearance is one too many, and \n     clearly, I think zero defects is the goals for all of us.\n\n  Zero defects--that is what DOD said its goal is for security \nclearances--well, I agree with that completely, but we have to take \nmeasures to reach that goal--not just talk about it as an ideal.\n  Realistically, we cannot take all of the risk out of the system, but \nwe can at least take a practical approach to denying clearances to \nthose people who have broken the law by serious infractions. And we can \nsend a message to DOHA that it has been far too lenient in granting \nclearances. This amendment sends that message.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 3210.\n  The amendment (No. 3210) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADDITIONAL MATTERS FOR ANNUAL REPORT ON TRANSFERS \n                   OF MILITARILY SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY TO COUNTRIES \n                   AND ENTITIES OF CONCERN.\n\n       Section 1402(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65; 113 Stat. 798) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) The status of the implementation or other disposition \n     of recommendations included in reports of audits by \n     Inspectors General that have been set forth in previous \n     annual reports under this section.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in section 1402 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2000, Congress \nrequired annual reports by the agency Inspectors General on the \ntransfers of militarily sensitive technology to countries and entities \nof concern. The first report was issued this spring and focused on so-\ncalled ``deemed exports'' or the release of technical data to a foreign \nnational working in or visiting a federal facility in the United \nStates.\n  The DOD IG found that Defense Department research centers released \nmilitarily valuable information to foreign visitors without ever \ndetermining whether export licenses were required. For example if \nforeign scientists (whether Chinese or Swedish) visit DOD or other \nfederal labs, export licenses are not being requested before \ninformation is transferred. The IG found that Defense Department \nlaboratories and research facilities lack procedures for determining \nwhether export licenses are required, and the auditors found that the \nservices were not even aware of the concept of ``deemed'' exports.\n  During FY99, DOD never asked for a deemed export license and out of \n783 deemed export license applications to the Department of Commerce, \nonly five came from the federal government (2 from NASA and 3 from DOE) \ndespite wide-ranging scientific exchange programs with foreign \nnationals coming to our labs. (The 778 other licenses were requested by \nindustry.)\n  The IG's report reveals another in a long line of security weaknesses \nrecently uncovered. Militarily useful technology is leaking out of the \nU.S. in many different ways--either by direct commercial sale through \nrelaxed export controls or by lax security procedures and information \nsecurity polices that encourage effective espionage by nations who do \nnot share U.S. interests. Deemed or knowledge exports are becoming ever \nmore important to U.S. national security. It makes little sense for the \nU.S. to control the sale of weapon systems abroad, if we allow our \npotential adversaries to obtain the underlying know-how behind our \nweapons systems technology and manufacturing processes through \nscientific exchanges and knowledge transfers.\n  The Inspectors General made a series of recommendations to address \nthe problems with deemed exports policies and procedures in order to \nbetter protect U.S. technology. It is anticipated that the IGs will \nmake many more recommendations regarding export control procedures over \nthe next 7 years. Historically, there is always a problem with \neffective implementation of any oversight recommendation. Without \neffective follow-up or interest shown by Congress, many IG \nrecommendations are only partially implemented or not at all. The \namendment I am offering ensures that Congress will receive a record of \nthe status of agency implementation of recommends made by the \nInspectors General on not only this year's deemed exports report, but \non the next 6 annual export control reports. This will serve as a basis \nfor possible legislation next year and in the future if agencies are \nbehind schedule in implementing the IGs' recommendations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3765) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3761\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the concurrent payment to surviving spouses of \ndisability and indemnity compensation and annuities under the Survivor \n                          Benefit Plan (SBP))\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Bryan and Robb, I \ncall up amendment No. 3761 which would provide for concurrent receipt \nby a surviving spouse of survivor benefit plan benefits and VA \ndependency and disability compensation.\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. It has been \ncleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nDomenici, Murray, Gorton, Thompson, Frist, and Murkowski in offering \nthis amendment. This amendment, which is based on my bill, S. 1756, \nwill strengthen the ways the Department of Energy's national labs and \nfacilities can collaborate with industry to achieve their mission--\nsomething that's increasingly important now that industry funds 70 \npercent of our national R The labs simply cannot stay on the cutting \nedge of technology and do their national security and science missions \nwithout rich and effective collaborations with industry.\n  A key provision of this amendment is a three year pilot program, \ncalled the Technology Infrastructure Program, authorizing the national \nlabs to promote the development of ``technology clusters''--the \nphenomena seen most famously in Silicon Valley--that will help the labs \nachieve their national security and science missions. The basic idea is \nfor the labs to harness the innovative power of technology clusters to \ndo their missions by strengthening collaboration in the regions around \nthe labs.\n  Mr. President, let me explain this a little more. We know from places \nlike Silicon Valley, or our own states, that a special innovative \nprocess can get started when enough institutions in an industry or \ntechnology come together in one place. For example, if you're \ninterested in Internet businesses, Northern Virginia is an excellent \nplace to be. For cars and, I believe, office furniture, you ought to \nthink about Michigan.\n  Paradoxically, the Internet makes these regional processes more \nimportant, not less. Why? Because when it's cheap and easy to move \ninformation around, less mobile things like your labor force and \nspecial research facilities and how they interact with each other will \nbe what makes the difference in how well you turn information into \ninnovation. Consider how Silicon Valley has not dissipated, despite its \nmany high costs. And, if companies move from there, they may go to \nAustin or Northern Virginia, but not just anywhere they can plug in a \nmodern.\n  Now, the Technology Infrastructure Program will support projects that \nwill help the labs do their missions by strengthening the institutions \nand relationships that aid collaborative innovation. Every project \nfunded under this program must, as a threshold test, show that it will \nhelp a lab ``achieve technical success in meeting'' DOE missions. Here \nare some possible example projects: a small business incubator or a \nresearch park by the lab; a special training program for technicians in \na technology used by the lab and local businesses; or a specialized \ndesign and research facility at a local university in a technology of \ninterest to the lab and local businesses.\n  I think you can see from my examples that it would be hard to link \nthese sorts of projects to the labs' missions unless they are done near \nthe labs. So, that's what will happen in most cases. The money \nauthorized for the pilot program is modest--no more than $10 million a \nyear. But, I believe it could well prove to have an immodest result.\n  Here is another way to think about what we're trying to do with the \nTechnology Infrastructure Program. Given the mission of the labs, the \nreason they exist as organizations with all sorts of sophisticated \nequipment and scientists is that they together in one place people \nworking on related subjects, so they can collaborate with each other \nand share special facilities.\n  Well, the Technology Infrastructure Program will help extend that \ncollaboration to outside a lab's gates, to firms and other institutions \nthat are not part of the lab but that can help it do its mission better \nbecause they're nearby. Because the projects will be cost shared. DOE \ncan save the taxpayer's money while effectively building out the labs \nbeyond their gates. And, because the projects will help the labs \nleverage commercial technology, the labs will get more cutting edge \ntechnology at a lower cost.\n  In short, the labs' interest in collaborating with industry to \nachieve their missions means that they also have an interest in \npromoting a strong network of local collaborators.\n  Other provisions of this amendment will: create a small business \nadvocate at the labs to get small businesses\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nmore involved in lab research and procurement; create a ombudsman at \nthe labs to informally settle disputes over technology partnerships; \nestablish a series of studies to investigate other ways to improve \ncollaboration between the labs and industry; give DOE a highly flexible \n``other transactions'' research authority like the one DoD has; and \nestablish a DOE Office of Arctic Energy to focus on the special energy \nproblems and opportunities in Arctic regions of the United States.\n  Of course, I'm well aware this amendment would be good for the \ncommunities around the labs. But, just as those of us with labs in our \nstates have seen that what's good for the labs can be good for our \ncommunities, what's good for our communities can also be good for our \nlabs.\n  In summary, this amendment takes the next steps in improving the \nability of DOE's national labs to collaborate with academia and \nindustry, and I think it will prove of great benefit to our national \nsecurity, the labs, and the labs' communities. I greatly appreciate the \nsupport of Senators Warner and Levin for including it in this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment has been cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3770), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Nuclear Weapons \n     Complex Conversion Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 3192. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian nuclear weapons complex has begun closure \n     and complete reconfiguration of certain weapons complex \n     plants and productions lines. However, this work is at an \n     early stage. The major impediments to downsizing have been \n     economic and social conditions in Russia. Little information \n     about this complex is shared, and 10 of its most sensitive \n     cities remain closed. These cities house 750,000 people and \n     employ approximately 150,000 people in nuclear military \n     facilities. Although the Russian Federation Ministry of \n     Atomic Energy has announced the need to significantly \n     downsize its workforce, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, it \n     has been very slow in accomplishing this goal. Information on \n     the extent of any progress is very closely held.\n       (2) The United States, on the other hand, has significantly \n     downsized its nuclear weapons complex in an open and \n     transparent manner. As a result, an enormous asymmetry now \n     exists between the United States and Russia in nuclear weapon \n     production capacities and in transparency of such capacities. \n     It is in the national security interest of the United States \n     to assist the Russian Federation in accomplishing significant \n     reductions in its nuclear military complex and in helping it \n     to protect its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and \n     nuclear secrets during such reductions. Such assistance will \n     accomplish critical nonproliferation objectives and provide \n     essential support towards future arms reduction agreements. \n     The Russian Federation's program to close and reconfigure \n     weapons complex plants and production lines will address, if \n     it is implemented in a significant and transparent manner, \n     concerns about the Russian Federation's ability to quickly \n     reconstitute its arsenal.\n       (3) Several current programs address portions of the \n     downsizing and nuclear security concerns. The Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job \n     opportunities for employees who are not required to support \n     realistic Russian nuclear security requirements. Its focus \n     has been on creating commercial ventures that can provide \n     self-sustaining jobs in three of the closed cities. The \n     current scope and funding of the program are not commensurate \n     with the scale of the threats to the United States sought to \n     be addressed by the program.\n       (4) To effectively address threats to United States \n     national security interests, progress with respect to the \n     nuclear cities must be expanded and accelerated. The Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for an immediate \n     increase in investment which offers the potential for prompt \n     risk reduction in the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and \n     Zheleznogorsk, which house four key Russian nuclear \n     facilities. Furthermore, the Nuclear Cities Initiative has \n     made considerable progress with the limited funding \n     available. However, to gain sufficient advocacy for \n     additional support, the program must demonstrate--\n       (A) rapid progress in conversion and restructuring; and\n       (B) an ability for the United States to track progress \n     against verifiable milestones that support a Russian nuclear \n     complex consistent with their future national security \n     requirements.\n       (5) Reductions in the nuclear weapons-grade material stocks \n     in the United States and Russia enhance prospects for future \n     arms control agreements and reduce concerns that these \n     materials could lead to proliferation risks. Confidence in \n     both nations will be enhanced by knowledge of the extent of \n     each nation's stockpiles of weapons-grade materials. The \n     United States already makes this information public.\n       (6) Many current programs contribute to the goals stated \n     herein. However, the lack of programmatic coordination within \n     and among United States Government agencies impedes the \n     capability of the United States to make rapid progress. A \n     formal single point of coordination is essential to ensure \n     that all United States programs directed at cooperative \n     threat reduction, nuclear materials reduction and protection, \n     and the downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the \n     nuclear weapons complex effectively mitigate the risks \n     inherent in the Russian Federation's military complex.\n       (7) Specialists in the United States and the former Soviet \n     Union trained in nonproliferation studies can significantly \n     assist in the downsizing process while minimizing the threat \n     presented by potential proliferation of weapons materials or \n     expertise.\n\n     SEC. 3193.

ADJUSTMENT OF COMPOSITE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE \n                   LEVELS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS.\n\n       (a) Layover Period for New Performance Levels.--Section \n     1211 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1998 (50 U.S.C. App. 2404 note) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence of subsection (d), by striking \n     ``180'' and inserting ``60''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Calculation of 60-Day Period.--The 60-day period \n     referred to in subsection (d) shall be calculated by \n     excluding the days on which either House of Congress is not \n     in session because of an adjournment of the Congress sine \n     die.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to any new composite theoretical performance \n     level established for purposes of section 1211(a) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 that \n     is submitted by the President pursuant to section 1211(d) of \n     that Act on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion about \nthis amendment. My understanding is that the order is for an hour \nequally divided between the proponents and the opponents of the \namendment. I do not believe that time will be necessary. I certainly do \nnot intend to take the time to explain all of the aspects of the \namendment because I did so in a previous floor speech several weeks \nago. I think, in the interest of moving things along tonight, I should \njust say to any who are interested in the issue to go back to my \nearlier floor speech, which was complete with charts and visual aids, \nand all of the other bells and whistles that we sometimes bring to the \nfloor, and read that, and you will see how I feel about this amendment.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, had great concerns about \nthe issue we are discussing. This amendment has to do with export \nlicenses for technical material, most particularly computer material \nthat might be exported in such a way as to allow some foreign power to \ngain a computer capability that would enhance their military power \nagainst the United States.\n  Senator Thompson and I have been talking about this for weeks, if \nmaybe not as long as a month or so, in an effort to find some \naccommodation to the concerns that he very legitimately raises about \nour national security and at the same time recognizes the reality of \nthe marketplace, which is that these chips, if they are not exported \nfrom the United States, will get to the world market from Japan, \nGermany, Holland, and in one instance China itself.\n  We would like to make sure the international market is as dominated \nby American chips as we can possibly get it to be, which is why we are \ntrying to shorten all of the time connected with this. Senator \nThompson, who has his own concerns about it, has been asking that we \nnot shorten the period as drastically as this amendment would do.\n  If I were offering the amendment entirely in a vacuum--that is, a \nlegislative vacuum--I would like the amount shortened from 180 days to \n30 days for the congressional action with respect to these items \nbecause I think 30 days is long enough.\n  I point out, at the moment, if we are going to export an F-16 to some \nforeign government, Congress has only 30 days to comment.\n  Some of these computers, to put it in the context of how rapidly \nthings are moving, can be purchased at Toys ``R'' Us right now and be \navailable for some foreign agent, if he wanted to come into the \ncountry, to tuck under his arm, walk through customs, go home to his \ncountry, and have a computer powerful enough in that toy that could do \nthings that as recently as 3 years ago would seem miraculous.\n  So I have abandoned my 30-day desires because of the very significant \nlegislative situation in which we find ourselves.\n  The 60-day requirement, which is in my amendment, has passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 415-8. I am told that if one \ncomma is changed in the amendment that passes the Senate from the form \nin which it passed the House, it will run into problems in conference. \nSo because I do not want it to run into problems in conference--I want \nit done--I have decided, as has the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, that \nwe will forgo our desire for the 30-day period. We will endorse the 60-\nday period because that is in the House bill.\n  Now, the Senator from Tennessee has some legitimate concerns about \nthe way this is done. I have discussed with him privately and now \npledge to him publicly that I will work with him to find a way to \ninject the General Accounting Office into the congressional review \nprocess, something that is not called for at the moment. It is entirely \nhaphazard at the moment. GAO gets involved if some Member of Congress \nasks them to get involved but not if that request is not made.\n  I am more than willing to say to the Senator from Tennessee that I \nwill work with him to try to inject the GAO into the process, but I do \nbelieve that the proper and prudent thing for us to do tonight is to \nadopt the amendment in exactly the same language as it passed the House \nand thereby make sure it is not a conferenceable item and is something \nwe will be certain will take place when the conference report is \nfinally approved.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have nothing further to say, unless other \nMembers of this body want to talk about the specific merits of it. I \nthank my friend from Tennessee for his willingness to work out the \nessential elements of this and pledge to him again publicly, as I have \ndone privately, that I will work with him to see that we do our very \nbest to accomplish the goal he seeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before he does leave the floor, I express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Utah. He has been a real leader on \nthis issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him. It seems we have \nbeen working on this for many months, which we have. In fact, it has \nbeen nearly a year. This is a very important time in the history of \nthis country when this legislation will pass. I hope it will pass \ntomorrow.\n  Based upon that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment. It is my understanding the vote is going to be set for 11:30 \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Boxer, \nBaucus, Kerry, Reid of Nevada--I am already on the amendment--Bennett, \nDaschle, Bingaman, Robb, Kennedy, Cleland, and Murray be added as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Utah leaves the \nfloor, I want to tell him how much I appreciate his work on this issue. \nThe work that has been done is very important.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee, he is a real advocate. He has \nworked very hard. He has a different view as to what should happen. He \nhas formulated these ideas with great study and his staff has been easy \nto work with, but in this instance we believe we are right and that he \nis not quite right.\n  Based upon his advocacy, I, along with the Senator from Utah, am \nwilling to work with the Senator from Tennessee. He has an idea that \ndoesn't shorten the time whatsoever but would add another element; \nnamely the General Accounting Office. Senator Bennett has pledged that \nhe would work with him on this issue, and I do so publicly also. We \nwill try to find another vehicle to work with him on his legislation.\n  More than 50 percent of America's companies' revenues come from \noverseas sales. Also, more than 60 percent of the market for \nmultiprocessor systems is outside the United States. What we are \ntalking about is allowing the United States to maintain its position as \na paramount producer of computers. That is what it amounts to. Things \nare changing very rapidly.\n  I can remember a few years ago I went to Clark County, in Las Vegas, \nNV, to the third floor of the courthouse. The entire third floor was \nthe\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\ncomputer processing system for Clark County. Then Clark County was much \nsmaller than it is now. Today the work that is done on that entire \nthird floor could be done with a personal computer, a laptop; things \nhave changed so rapidly. That is why we need to allow changes.\n  This little computer that I carry around, this ``palm,'' as they call \nit, does remarkable things. I can store in this basically the Las Vegas \nphonebook. It has a calculator. It has numerous features that were \nimpossible 2 years ago. It is now possible. That is what this amendment \nis all about: to allow the American computer industry to remain \ncompetitive and to allow sales overseas.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. He has worked \non this matter for many months, along with Senator Enzi and Senator \nJohnson. I appreciate their support on this legislation.\n  The amendment, which has broad support from the high-tech industry \nand from a majority of the Members of the Senate, simply shortens the \ncongressional review period for high performance computers from 180 \ndays to 60 days and guarantees that the counting of those days not be \ntolled when Congress adjourns sine die.\n  We are operating under cold war era regulations and if we want to \nremain the world leader in computer manufacturing and in the high-tech \narena, we must make this change immediately.\n  I have worked for the last year and a half with Senators Gramm, Enzi, \nand Johnson on the Export Administration Act, but a few members of the \nmajority have succeeded in blocking its passage. That bill is not \nmoving and therefore, Senator Bennett and I would like to simply pass \nthis portion of the Export Administration Act to provide some temporary \nrelief. The congressional review period for computer exports is six \ntimes longer than the review of munitions.\n  In February, the President, at my urging and the urging of others, \nproposed changes to the export controls on high performance computers, \nbut because of the 180-day review period, these changes have yet to be \nimplemented and U.S. companies are losing foreign market share to \nChinese and other foreign competitors as we speak. This is already July \nand a February proposed change, which was appropriate at the time, and \nis nearly out-dated now, has yet to go into effect.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan effort and one that we need to pass. \nCongress is stifling U.S. companies' growth and we can't stand for it, \nI can't stand for it. This underscores another point: the importance of \nexports to the U.S. computer industry. More than 50 percent of \nAmerica's companies revenues come from overseas sales. If we give the \ninternational market to foreign competition in the short term, we will \nnever get it back in the long term, and not only our economy, but our \nnational security will founder.\n  A strong economy and a strong U.S. military depend on our leadership. \nU.S. companies have to be given the opportunity to compete worldwide in \norder to continue to lead the world in technological advances.\n  According to the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports, U.S. \ncomputer export regulations are the most stringent in the world and \ngive foreign competitors a head start. More than 60 percent of the \nmarket for multiprocessor systems is outside of the U.S. The U.S. \nindustry faces stiff competition, as foreign governments allow greater \nexport flexibility.\n  The current export control system interferes with legitimate U.S. \nexports because it does not keep pace with technology. The MTOPS level \nof microprocessors increased nearly 5-fold from 1998 to 1999--and \ntoday's levels will more than double when the Intel Itanium, I-Tanium, \nchip is introduced in the middle of this year. New export control \nthresholds will not take effect until the completion of the required \nsix month waiting period--by then, the thresholds will be obsolete and \nAmerican companies will have lost considerable market share in foreign \ncountries.\n  The current export control system does not protect U.S. national \nsecurity. The ability of America's defense system to maintain its \ntechnological advantage relies increasingly on the U.S. computer \nindustry's ability to be at the cutting edge of technology. It does not \nmake sense to impose a 180-day waiting period for products that have a \n3-month innovation cycle and are widely available in foreign countries. \nRight now American companies are forbidden from selling computers in \ntier three countries while foreign competitors are free to do so.\n  As I indicated earlier, the removal of items from export controls \nimposed by the Munitions List, such as tanks, rockets, warships, and \nhigh-performance aircraft, requires only a 30-day waiting period. The \nsale of sensitive weapons, such as tanks, rockets, warships and high-\nperformance aircraft, under the Foreign Military Sales program requires \nonly a 30-day congressional review period. One hundred eighty days is \ntoo long.\n  The new Intel microprocessor, the Itanium, is expected to be \navailable sometime this summer with companies such as NEW, Hitachi and \nSiemens already signed on to use the microprocessor. The most recent \nexport control announcement made by the Administration on February 1 \nwill therefore be out of date in less than six months.\n  Lastly--a review period, comparable to that applied to other export \ncontrol and national security regimes, will still give Congress \nadequate time to review national security ramifications of any changes \nin the U.S. computer export control regime. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and to allow our country's computer companies to \ncompete with their foreign competitors and thereby continue to drive \nour thriving economy.\n  I believe that 30 days is the proper amount of time for the review \nperiod, but have agreed, with my colleague from Utah, to offer the \nidentical language that passed in the House by a vote of 415 to 8. Less \nstringent language passed out of committee in the Senate, and there is \nno reason that this shouldn't pass with a large majority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce endorsing this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2000.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector and region, offers our \n     support of Senator Harry Reid's (D-NV) Amendment 3292 to the \n     Defense Appropriations FY 2001 bill, which changes the \n     regulations governing the export of high-speed computers. \n     This measure will be considered today by the U.S. Senate.\n       Section 1211 of H.R. 1119, the ``National Defense \n     Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 1998'' (Public Law 105-85) \n     imposed new restrictions on exports of certain mid-level \n     computers to various countries, even though similar \n     technology is readily available in the international market \n     place. (Mid-level is defined as operating at over 2,000 \n     million theoretical operations per second (MTOPS). Section \n     1211 also authorized the president to establish a different, \n     higher performance threshold for these restrictions but \n     required a 180-day delay in the implementation of this new \n     threshold, pending Congressional review of a report \n     presenting the justification for the new threshold.\n       Our concern is that these computers--often mis-labeled \n     ``supercomputers'' or ``high-performance computers''--\n     incorporate technology that is already in fairly wide use \n     here and abroad. As with so many other efforts to \n     unilaterally control the availability of relatively common \n     technology, the result of this provision was another \n     competitive disadvantage for U.S. firms in the global \n     markets.\n       Earlier this month the House of Representatives approved \n     similar legislation that reduced from 180 to 60 days the time \n     frame for Congress to review the administration's \n     justification for any changes in the performance thresholds \n     for controlling these computer exports. This is important \n     because the 180-day period often exceeds the life cycle of \n     the computers and is longer than the congressional review \n     period for removing various weapons from a list of defense \n     items subject to export controls. While allowing time to \n     address national security issues, this legislation also \n     reduces the chances that computer transactions will languish \n     in Congress and become obsolete before they are permitted to \n     move forward.\n       In this regard, the U.S. Chamber remains committed to \n     repeal of section 1211 for the reasons stated above. \n     Amendment 3292 to the Defense Appropriations for FY 2001 bill \n     is a major step in the right direction.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe Information Technology Industry\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nCouncil, which is representative of the employment of some 1.3 million \npeople in the United States, in support of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     United State Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to follow-up on earlier \n     correspondence to reaffirm the fact that ITI strongly \n     supports the bipartisan Reid/Bennett amendment to the defense \n     authorization bill. We urge your colleagues to support your \n     amendment, and also to oppose any efforts to further water \n     down what is already a compromise position for the computer \n     industry.\n       The Reid/Bennett amendment would provide overdue relief \n     from the current 180-day waiting period whenever US computer \n     export thresholds are updated. Accordingly, this letter is to \n     inform you and your colleagues that ITI anticipates including \n     votes pertaining to computer exports in our annual High Tech \n     Voting Guide. As you know, the High Tech Voting Guide is used \n     by ITI to measure Members of Congress' support for the \n     information technology industry and policies that ensure the \n     success of the digital economy.\n       ITI is the leading association of U.S. providers of \n     information technology products and services. ITI members had \n     worldwide revenue of more than $633 billion in 1999 and \n     employ an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States.\n       As you know, ITI has endorsed your legislation to shorten \n     the Congressionally mandated waiting period to 30 days. While \n     we strongly support our country's security objectives, there \n     seems no rationale for treating business-level computers that \n     are widely available on the world market as inherently more \n     dangerous than items being removed from the nation's \n     munitions list--an act that gives Congress just 30 calendar \n     days to review.\n       Make no mistake. Computer exports are critical to the \n     continued success of the industry and America's leadership in \n     information technology. Computers today are improved and \n     innovated virtually every quarter. In our view, it does not \n     make sense to have a six-month waiting period for products \n     that are being innovated in three-month cycles. That rapid \n     innovation is what provides America with her valuable \n     advantage in technology, both in the marketplace and \n     ultimately for national security purposes--an argument put \n     forth recently in a Defense Science Board report on this very \n     subject.\n       As a good-faith compromise, ITI and the Computer Coalition \n     for Responsible Exports (CCRE) backed an amendment to the \n     House-passed defense authorization bill that established a \n     60-day waiting period and guaranteed that the counting of \n     those days would not be tolled when Congress adjourns sine \n     die. The House passed that amendment last month by an \n     overwhelming vote of 415-8.\n       We thank you for your leadership in offering the bipartisan \n     Reid/Bennett amendment as a companion to the House-passed \n     compromise provision. We trust that it will pass the Senate \n     with a similar overwhelming majority.\n       We have been heartened in recent weeks by the bipartisan \n     agreement that the waiting period must be shortened. The \n     Administration has recommended a 30-day waiting period. The \n     House, as mentioned above, endorsed a 60-day waiting period. \n     And Gov. George W. Bush has publicly endorsed a 60-day \n     waiting period in recognition that commodity computers widely \n     available from our foreign competitors cannot be effectively \n     controlled.\n       We thank you for your strong and vocal leadership in this \n     matter and look forward to working with you and other \n     Senators to achieve a strong, bipartisan consensus on this \n     and other issues critical to continuing America's \n     technological pre-eminence.\n           Best regards,\n                                                  Rhett B. Dawson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Again, I express my appreciation to the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Utah and look forward to an overwhelming \nvote tomorrow to send this matter to the House so it can be sent to the \nPresident's desk as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \nstatements. I think they accurately state the conversations we have \nhad. I welcome their commitment to try to work with me toward finding \nanother vehicle in order to alleviate some of the concerns I have had.\n  I intended to offer a second-degree amendment to this amendment, but \nI can count the votes. The better part of valor is for me to accept the \ncommitment and assistance from my colleagues in order to try to \ninterject some expertise into the consideration of the MTOP level \nissues in the future.\n  What we are seeing with regard to this amendment is a manifestation \nof a discussion that is going on in this country that is very \nimportant. We obviously are leading the world in terms of high \ntechnology. We are building supercomputers that no one else has. It is \nnatural that our people want to develop their markets and have an \nexport market. That is important to them from an economic standpoint. \nMany people in the computer industry are under the impression that if \nthey can build something, it is immediately available worldwide, \ninternationally, by everyone. I respectfully disagree with them on \nthat. But they are of that opinion, and they are moving aggressively in \nCongress and otherwise to try to raise the level of the computers they \ncan ship without an export license.\n  Let's keep in mind, that is the issue: What is going to be shipped \nwithout a license or with a license. We are not talking about stopping \nany sales. We are talking about time periods and how fast computers can \nbe sold and what can be sold with or without a license. That is one \nside of what is going on in the country today in this discussion.\n  The other side is that all of the statements about our capabilities \nand our need to market and all those kinds of things may be true. But \nthere is another side to the story, and that is the danger that \nsometimes is being interjected into the world by the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n  We have been told in no uncertain terms by the Cox committee, and \nothers, that the Chinese, for example, are using our technology. They \nare specifically using our high-performance computers to enhance their \nown nuclear capabilities. Potentially, they will be used against our \nown country. We know the Chinese are selling and supplying technology \nto rogue nations around the world--a big problem. That is a part of the \ndiscussion we are going to have over these next few weeks, I hope, in \nterms of how we address that with the Chinese.\n  So while it is important to have a viable high-tech market, and while \nthe technological ``genie'' is out of the bottle to a great extent, \nthere are some of us who still believe we should not abrogate all of \nour export control laws. And on what we are dealing with here tonight, \nCongress should have an adequate time to consider how much we want to \nraise the MTOP levels and how liberal we want to be in terms of \nallowing these computers to be exported--again, mind you, without a \nlicense. They can still export them at any level, theoretically. But \nthey have to go through a license process.\n  Is the congressional review too long? Is 180 days too long? I point \nout that, I believe as late as a year ago--I think July of last year--\nwhile it was not in law, the practice was for the review time for \nCongress to take between 18 and 24 months. So 6 months kicked in just \nabout a year ago. So we have gone from 18 to 24 months a year ago, and \nnow Congress has 6 months. We narrowed it to 6 months now that we have \nto review it, when the administration decides it wants to raise the \nMTOP levels and become more liberal with exports. Now under this bill, \nwe are narrowing the time further to 60 days--from 6 months to 60 \ndays--for Congress to review the raising of a particular MTOP level.\n  I have a great problem with that. I know there is tremendous momentum \nin this Congress to accede to those who want Congress to have less and \nless a part in this process. I agree with colleagues who said Congress \nhas not always done its due diligence, has not always used that process \nto its best advantage; we have sometimes sat on our hands.\n  What I am trying to do, and what I was going to do by my second-\ndegree amendment, which I will now, with the help of colleagues, try to \ndo separate and apart, is to say, OK, we will go down to 60 days, \nalthough I don't like it; but we will say, within that 60 days, let's \nhave GAO take a look at it; let's have some expertise from the people \nwho are used to analyzing these things because they don't always agree \nwith the administration, as to what the foreign availability is or what \nthe mass marketing for a particular component is. So why do we want to \nfly blindly on something that is so technical and important? We need to \nhave GAO in this process and then give Congress just 10 days after the \nGAO does its work, after 50 days, to look at what GAO has come up with, \nand then we can act if we want to.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  So I think it is a very compressed timeframe. But I understand the \nmomentum for this. I hope we are not making a mistake. I hope we are \nnot placing too much faith in an administration that I think has been \nentirely too lax in terms of matters of national security, our export \nlaws, the security of our laboratories, and everything else. I hope we \nare not making that mistake. But I know it is going to happen now. It \npassed overwhelmingly in the House, and I expect it to tomorrow. I can \ncount as well as the next person. But I am hopeful that within the next \nfew days, as I say, we can interject into this process at least a \nlittle bit of extra deliberation by the GAO and those with the \nexpertise to tell us what they think about a particular increase in the \nMTOP levels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield back all time for the proponents \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield back all time of the opponents \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, subject to the leadership, I think I can \nannounce the time of the vote. The vote on this amendment will occur at \n11:30 a.m. tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to withdraw my amendment \nto the fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill. As the matter \nbetween the U.S. Air Force and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has \nbeen resolved, the need for legislative language to rectify this matter \nis no longer necessary.\n  At this time, I would like to show my appreciation to the Secretary \nof the Air Force and his staff for their professionalism and \ncooperation in helping bring about an expeditious and satisfactory \nresolution to this matter. I would like to thank the staff members of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, in particular Mike McCord, for \ntheir assistance in seeing this matter through.\n  The reimbursement from the Air Force to the New Jersey Forest Service \nwill help enable the men and women of this vital department to continue \ntheir important duties in protecting the forests and state parks of New \nJersey from disaster.\n\n\n                            redstone arsenal\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of engaging the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, \nCommittee on Armed Services to discuss a matter of some great interest \nrelating to an Army installation located in my State. As the chairman \nknows, the Redstone Arsenal is located in Alabama, near the city of \nHuntsville. Although Redstone is not an arsenal in the traditional \nsense, there are certain provisions of Title III, Subtitle D, Sections \n331 and 332 of the bill that I understand will apply to Redstone \nArsenal. Specifically, the provision of the bill which would codify the \nARMS Act and its facility use contracts and in-kind consideration \nprovisions, and the provision on Centers of Industrial and Technical \nExcellence that would allow the government owned, government operated \nindustrial facilities to pursue partnerships and arrangements with \nprivate sector entities to more fully utilize the plant and equipment \nat these facilities. In my own state there is interest of at least one \nprivate sector entity currently doing business on Redstone Arsenal with \nothers to follow:\n  By using the Facilities Use and In-Kind Consideration provisions of \nARMS, the Logistics Support Facility has been able to establish a \npresence on Redstone Arsenal. Using these innovative approaches, the \nLogistical Support Facility has been able to utilize existing Army \nfacilities that might otherwise have been deemed to be excess. This is \ncertainly a win-win situation for both the company and the U.S. Army: a \nwin for the LSF which gets facilities that are close to their \ncustomer--the U.S. Army, and a win for Redstone Arsenal, which receives \nconsideration for the use of an otherwise empty facility which it might \notherwise have to pay to maintain or demolish.\n  Am I correct in my belief that Section 332 will allow the Logistical \nSupport Facility and other similarly situated operations to operate on \nRedstone Arsenal?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is exactly the sort of arrangement which you have \noutlined that the language in Title III is intended to promote. It is \nthe committee's hope that additional government facilities will pursue \nsuch initiatives in order to increase their efficiency. The ARMS act \nwas intended to breathe new life into facilities for which the Army \nmight otherwise have less use. It is a model program and we are trying \nto incorporate those aspects of the ARMS program which make sense in a \ngovernment owned, government operated industrial facility. This is \nindeed a win/win situation for business, for the Department of Defense, \nand for the American taxpayer.\n\n\n                TRANSFER OF LAND ON VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma to facilitate the resumption of critical live-fire \ntraining at the Naval training range on the island of Vieques. He has \nvisited the island and has dedicated himself to trying to resolve this \nimportant issue.\n  I believe, given the differences between the provision in the Senate \nbill and those in the House bill, that this will be a matter of \nconsiderable discussion and debate in conference. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Inhofe and other Members of the Senate and House \nto address these differences and achieve a resolution that maximizes \nthe possibility of resuming live-fire training as soon as possible.\n  I am concerned that the Senate bill does not authorize the transfer \nof all the surplus land on the western side of the island, as requested \nby the President pursuant to his agreement with the Governor of Puerto \nRico. I believe that only the full implementation of those directives \nwill restore the Navy's credibility with the local population. \nSecretary Danzig has emphasized to us the importance of the conveyance \nof this land as a demonstration of good faith prior to the referendum \non the Navy's continued use of Vieques. Therefore to avoid undermining \nthe Navy's position on Vieques, the conference report should adopt the \nlanguage in the House bill that would authorize this transfer.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of Senator \nLandrieu. I look forward to working with her and others on this \nimportant issue in conference. As you noted, as chairman of the \nReadiness and Management Support Subcommittee I have spent considerable \ntime looking into this matter and I believe that this facility is \nessential to the readiness of the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  I understand the concern raised by some that a failure to transfer \nthe western land as requested by the President would frustrate the \nlong-term goal of rebuilding relations between the Navy and the people \nof Vieques and resuming live-fire training on the island. However, I \nrecently visited Vieques and spoke with some of the local residents who \nwere not as enthused by the proposed transfer of land as the \nGovernors's office has led us to believe. Furthermore, they asked that \nif any land is transferred, that it be transferred directly to the \npeople of Vieques rather than to the Commonwealth Government. However, \nI understand that this may not represent the views of all residents of \nthe island and I will continue to look very seriously at this issue \nduring the conference and will continue to speak with the residents of \nVieques before I make a final decision.\n  I also want to ensure that whatever approach we take, we do not \nundermine the chances of the resumption of live-fire by providing a \nreverse incentive. I strongly support the Navy and Marine Corps' goal \nof resuming live-fire training in Vieques. As stated by the senior \nofficers of the Department of Defense, this training is critical to our \nreadiness. I will continue to speak with these officers on the issue, \nincluding the impact of not transferring the western land, as we \nproceed through\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nconference. I am committed to resolving this matter in a way that \nmaximizes our opportunity to provide our military personnel with the \ntraining they need to ensure they are not unnecessarily put at risk \nwhen they are deployed into harm's way.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his commitment on this matter \nand look forward to working with him in the weeks ahead.\n\n\n                      acquisition programs at nsa\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I note to the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee an issue in the committee report accompanying the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, S. 2549. on \npage 126, the report deals with acquisition programs at the National \nSecurity Agency (NSA). I fear that the language of the report could \nhave unintended consequences for the on-going efforts to modernize the \nNational Security Agency. The report mandates that the NSA manage its \nmodernization effort as though it were a traditional major defense \nacquisition program. If this mandate were applied to each of the \nindividual technology efforts within the NSA, such a requirement could \nimpede NSA's flexibility to modernize and upgrade its capabilities. I \nwould ask the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee whether this was \nthe Committee's intent?\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Shelby. I believe we both agree that the National Security \nAgency should better address its acquisition issues. However, I note \nthe concerns you raise and agree that the report should not be read to \nmandate treating each individual technology effort within NSA as a \nmajor acquisition program. As the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee knows, the Department of Defense (DoD) has an extensive \neffort to develop various technology projects that could ultimately \ncontribute to one or more major DoD acquisition programs. DoD does not \nmanage these individual technology projects as major acquisition \nprograms, despite the fact that they may contribute to successful \nfielding of a program being managed as a major acquisition program.\n  It was the committee's intent to ensure that each of the major \nmodernization efforts that NSA must undertake will receive appropriate \nmanagement attention. it was not the committee's intent that individual \ntechnology projects that are contributing to those broader efforts be \nmanaged as major acquisition programs on a project-by-project basis.\n  I look forward to working with you to ensure that NSA properly \nmanages its acquisition programs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of my distinguished ranking \nmember and myself, we submit to the Senate the following time \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, when the \nSenate resumes the DOD authorization bill, Senator Byrd be recognized \nfor up to 30 minutes for debate on his amendment, with a Roth statement \nto be inserted at that point following the debate, and following the \ndisposition of the amendment and notwithstanding the managers' package \nof amendments, the following amendments be the only remaining first-\ndegree amendments in order, that they be limited to 1 hour equally \ndivided unless otherwise stated, and that with respect to the second-\ndegree amendments, they be under no time restraints and limited to \nrelevant second-degree amendments unless otherwise stated. Those \namendments are as follows:\n  Feingold, re: D5 missile, 40 minutes equally divided; Durbin, re: NMD \ntesting, 2 hours equally divided with no second-degree amendments; \nHarkin, secrecy; Kerry of Massachusetts, environmental fines.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \npending Byrd amendment and the listed amendments, the bill be advanced \nto third reading, and the Senate proceed to the consideration of the \nHouse companion bill, H.R. 4205, all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, the text of the Senate bill be inserted, the House bill be \nadvanced to third reading, and passage occur, all without any \nintervening action, and the Senate bill be then placed on the calendar.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at the time of the stacked \nrollcall votes, there be up to 10 minutes equally divided provided for \nclosing remarks with respect to only the Kerrey amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Finally, I ask the time limit with respect to the Harkin amendment \nonly be vitiated prior to 12 noon on Wednesday, at or upon the request \nof the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nobviously won't because this is a very good unanimous consent \nagreement, I believe in reading the last two lines my good friend from \nVirginia left out the word ``may'' so that ``it may be vitiated.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague is correct. I shall reread \nit.\n  Finally, I ask that the time limit with respect to the Harkin \namendment only may be vitiated prior to 12 noon on Wednesday, upon the \nrequest of the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, has that now been adopted?\n  Mr. WARNER. That has been accepted. This is a momentous occasion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank all who worked so assiduously to make this \npossible. As we said in World War II: Praise the Lord and pass the \nammunition. We have this bill on its final track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia. There has been a lot of \nhard work, indeed, that has gone into this agreement. I do want to see \nif our understanding is correct on this. It was not explicit in the \nunanimous consent agreement. That is that following the disposition of \nthe Byrd amendment tomorrow evening, and notwithstanding the managers' \npackage of amendments, that the following amendments be--and then they \nare identified.\n  It is our expectation and intention that that proceed immediately \ntomorrow night, to consideration of those listed amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct in that \ninterpretation, that we will hear from our distinguished former \nmajority leader, member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Byrd, \nfor 30 minutes. A statement will then be placed in the Record on behalf \nof Senator Roth, and we will proceed immediately to the amendments as \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. After disposition of the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. After disposition of the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that will all occur tomorrow night?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer and my good friend from \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6461-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe Senate once again on the subject of military construction projects \nadded to an appropriations bill that were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense. The bill that passed by voice vote prior to the \nJuly 4th recess contains more than $1.5 billion in unrequested military \nconstruction projects. More importantly, I would like to spend a few \nminutes discussing Congress's role in the budget process and its utter \nlack of fiscal discipline. There is $4.5 billion in pork-barrel \nspending in this bill, $3.3 billion of that total in the so-called \n``emergency supplemental.''\n  Webster's, Mr. President, defines ``emergency'' as ``a sudden, \ngenerally unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances demanding \nimmediate action.'' What we have here is the antithesis of that \nconcept. It is highly questionable whether $20 million for abstinence \neducation should be included in a bill the purpose of which is to \nprovide emergency funding that will not count against budget caps.\n  For months this body made a deliberate decision not to act quickly \nand deliberately with regard to legitimate spending issues involving \nmilitary readiness and the crisis in Colombia. The decision was made \nnot to treat these essential and time-sensitive activities as \nexpeditiously as possible. Now, after many months and seemingly endless \nlegislative maneuvering, we were presented with an $11 billion bill \nreplete with earmarks that under no credible criteria should be \ncategorized as ``emergency''--and this is in addition to the over $1.5 \nbillion added to the underlying military construction appropriations \nbill for strictly parochial reasons.\n  As everyone here is aware, I regularly review spending bills for \nitems that were not requested by the Administration, constitute \nearmarks designed to benefit specific projects or localities, and did \nnot go through a competitive, merit-based selection process. I submit \nlists of such items to the Congressional Record, generally prior to \nfinal passage of the spending bill in question. In the case of the \nMilitary Construction bill for fiscal year 2001, I submitted such a \nlist, along with a statement critical of the process by which that bill \nwas put together, particularly the over $700 million worth of military \nconstruction projects added to that bill that were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense--an amount, I reiterate, that was doubled in \nconference with the other Body.\n  This is an institution that has proven itself incapable of passing \nlegislation on an expedited basis that genuinely warrants the \ncategorization of ``emergency.'' Funding for ongoing military \noperations that strains readiness accounts is a case in point. The one \nthing, Mr. President, we can pass without hesitation and consideration \nis money for pork-barrel projects. Just prior to final passage back in \nMay of the Military Construction appropriations bill, the \nAppropriations Committee pushed through $460 million for six new C-130J \naircraft for the Coast Guard--the very aircraft that we throw money at \nwith wanton abandon as though our very existence as an institution is \ndependent upon the continued acquisition of that aircraft.\n  That funding and those aircraft are in the bill that emerged from \nconference with the House. A consensus exists, apparently, that we must \nhave six more C-130Js in addition to the ones added to the defense \nappropriations bill despite a surplus in the Department of Defense of \nC-130 airframes that should see us through to the next millennium and \nbeyond. And this, Mr. President, despite the General Accounting \nOffice's finding, based upon the Coast Guard's own study, that the \nservice's existing fleet of HC-130s will not need to be replaced until \n2012-2027. And this, Mr. President, despite an ongoing Coast Guard-\ndirected study designed to determine precisely what types and numbers \nof aircraft and surface vessels it will require in the future. Message \nto parents saving up for little junior's college education: invest in \nthe stock of the company that makes C-130s; the United States Congress \nwill ensure your offsprinq never need student loans.\n  Compared to the $460 million for the C-130s, it hardly seems worth it \nto mention the $45 million added to this emergency spending measure for \nyet another Gulfstream jet, other than to point out that it is \nmanufactured in the same state as the C-130s. The decision to include \nfunding for this jet, intended for the Coast Guard commandant, an \nemergency spending bill lends further credence to the notion that our \ninterest in the integrity of the budget process is nonexistent.\n  It was reassuring that a compromise was reached on the issue of \nhelicopters for Colombia. It is extremely unfortunate, however, that an \nissue of life and death for Colombian soldiers being sent into combat \nto fight well-armed drug traffickers and the 15,000-strong guerrilla \narmy that protects them was predicated upon parochial considerations. \nValid operational reasons existed for the decision by the Department of \nDefense and the Colombian Government to request Blackhawk helicopters, \nand the Senate's decision to substitute those Blackhawks for Huey IIs \nwas among the more morally questionable actions I have witnessed within \nthe narrow realm of budgetary decision-making by Congress.\n  Specific to the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal \nYear 2001, it continues to strain credibility to peruse this \nlegislation and believe that considerations other than pork were at \nplay. How else to explain the millions of dollars added to this bill \nfor National Guard Armories, which, in a typically Orwellian gesture, \nare now referred to as ``Readiness Centers?'' Whether the $6.4 million \nadded for a new dining facility at Sheppard Air Force Base: the $12 \nmillion for a new fitness center at Langley Air Force Base; the $5.8 \nmillion for a joint personnel training center at Fairchild Air Force \nBase, Alaska; the $3.5 million added for an indoor rifle range and $1.8 \nmillion for a religious ministry facility at the Naval Reserve Station \nin Fort Worth, Texas; the $4 million added for the New Hampshire Air \nNational Guard Pease International Trade Port; the $4 million for a \nKentucky National Guard parking structure; and the $14 million added \nfor New York National Guard facilities all constitute vital spending \ninitiatives is highly questionable.\n\n  There are one-and-a-half billion dollars worth of projects added to \nthis bill at member request. Not all of them, in particular family \nhousing projects, warrant criticism or skepticism. There are important \nquality of life issues involved here. The public should be under no \nillusions, however, that over a billion dollars was added to this bill \nsolely as a manifestation of Congress' unrestrained pursuit of pork.\n  As mentioned, far more disturbing than the pork added to the military \nconstruction bill is the damage done to the integrity of the budget \nprocess by the abuse of the concept of emergency spending. Permit me to \nquote from the opening sentence from the Washington Post of June 29 \nwith regard to this bill: ``Republicans are trying to grease the skids \nfor passage of a large emergency spending bill for Colombia and Kosovo \nwith $200 million of `special projects' for members, and one of the \nbiggest winners is a renegade Democrat being courted by the GOP.''\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\n  That, Mr. President, summarizes the process pretty well. Military \nreadiness and the situation in Colombia are not in and of themselves \nimportant enough to warrant support for this spending bill. It seems \nthis Senate must have its pork. It must have its $25 million for a \nCustoms Service training facility at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, a \nsite most certainly chosen for its bucolic charm and operational \nattributes rather than for parochial reasons. It must have its $225,000 \nfor the Nebraska State Patrol Digital Distance Learning project. It \nmust have over $3 million earmarked for anti-doping activities at the \n2002 Olympics, in addition to the $8 million for Defense Department \nsupport of these essential national security activities on the ski \nslopes of Utah. It must have $300,000 for Indian tribes in North \nDakota, South Dakota, Montana and Minnesota. The hard-working taxpayers \nof America deserve better.\n  Those of us who had the misfortune of witnessing one of the most \ndisgraceful and blatant explosions of pork-barrel spending in the \nannals of modern American parliamentary history, the ISTEA bill of \n1998, should be astounded to see the projects funded in this emergency \nspending bill:\n  $1.2 million for the Paso Del Norte International Bridge in Texas;\n  $9 million for the US 82 Mississippi River Bridge in Mississippi;\n  $2 million for the Union Village/Cambridge Junction bridges in \nVermont;\n  $5 million for the Naheola Bridge in Alabama;\n  $3 million for the Hoover Dam Bypass in Arizona and Nevada;\n  $3 million for the Witt-Penn Bridge in New Jersey; and\n  $12 million for the Florida Memorial Bridge in Florida.\n  These, Mr. President, are but the tip of the iceberg--an iceberg that \nshall not stand in the way of the icebreaker added to this bill, albeit \nfor more credible reasons than the vast majority of member add-ons.\n  As I stated earlier, tracking the process by which the bill came \nbefore us was a truly Byzantine experience. The addition of $600,000 \nfor the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System in South Dakota serves as \nsort of a tribute to the unusual path down which this legislation has \ntraveled. The most skilled legislative adventurers would be hard \npressed to follow the trail this bill followed before arriving at its \ndestination here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the significance of piling billions of \ndollars in pork and unrequested earmarks into a bill that was \ncategorized for budgetary purposes as ``emergency.'' Consider the \ndistinction between emergency spending essential for the preservation \nof liberty and to deal with genuine emergencies that cannot wait for \nthe usual annual appropriations process, and the manner in which \nCongress abuses that concept and undermines the integrity of the \nbudgeting process. When I review an emergency spending measure and read \nearmarks like $2.2 million for the Anchorage, Alaska Senior Center; \n$500,000 for the Shedd Aquarium/Brookfield Zoo for science education \nprograms for local school students; $1 million for the Center for \nResearch on Aging at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in \nChicago; and $8 million for the City of Libby in Montana, plus another \n$3.5 million for the Saint John's Lutheran Hospital in Libby, I am more \nthan a little perplexed about the propriety of our actions here.\n  Is the American public expected to believe that a spending bill \nessential for national security should include emergency funding for \nDungeness fishing vessel crew members, U.S. fish processors in Alaska, \nand the Buy N Pack Seafoods processor in Hoonah, Alaska, research and \neducation relating to the North Pacific marine ecosystem, and the \nlease, operation and upgrading of facilities at the Alaska SeaLife \nCenter, and the $7 million for observer coverage for the Hawaiian long-\nline fishery and to study interaction with sea turtles in the North \nPacific. Finally, and not to belabor the point, is the $1 million for \nthe State of Alaska to develop a cooperative research plan to restore \nthe crab fishery truly a national security imperative?\n  When the bill was on the floor of the Senate, my friend and colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator Gramm, referred to the sadly typical smoke and \nmirrors budgeting gimmickrey pervasive in the legislation. I am always \ndisturbed when such budgeting gimmicks designed to prevent Congress \nfrom complying with the revenue and spending levels agreed to in the \nBudget Resolution are employed. While I am grateful that a deal was \nstruck by which they will be reversed in another bill, the use of such \ngimmicks is a betrayal of our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' \ndollars responsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best \ninterests of all Americans. It is a betrayal of the public trust that \nis essential to a working democracy.\n  The bill, as currently written and signed into law, waives the budget \ncaps to allow for more discretionary spending. It also waived the \nfirewall in the budget resolution between defense and nondefense \nspending on outlays. The end result would be that Congress would have \nthe freedom to move the $2.6 billion the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee did not spend on much-needed readiness into non-defense \nspending.\n  The recently-passed legislation further changes current law and \nshifts the payment date for SSI, the Supplemental Security Income \nprogram, from October back to September. What that would do is shift \nmoney into fiscal year 2000. In the process, it would allow $2.4 \nbillion more be spent in fiscal year 2001 by spending that same amount \nof money in the previous year. The legislation also includes the \ngimmick of moving the pay date for veterans' compensation and pensions \nfrom fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2000. Both of these provisions are \nfurther examples of the irresponsible budget gimmickry that allows the \nCongress to spend more without any accountability. I am thankful that a \ncommitment was made to reverse these decisions in subsequent \nlegislation; I abhor the fact that they will almost certainly be used \nagain in the future.\n  To conclude, the Military Construction and Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill passed prior to recess, and without members of the \nSenate having a realistic opportunity to review that multibillion \ndollar commitment, is a travesty, a thorough slap in the face of all \nAmericans concerned about fiscal responsibility, national security, the \nscourge of drugs on our streets, and the integrity of the \nrepresentation they send to Congress. We should be ashamed of ourselves \nfor passing this bill.

Mr. President, on June 30, the Senate passed S. 2553, \nthe Fiscal Year 2001 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, by a vote \nof 52-43. I voted against this measure because of my belief that it \nprovides an unjustified increase in federal spending and employs a \nvariety of gimmicks that are meant to hide the true size of its costs.\n  As my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, recently pointed out, the \nfiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS bill increases discretionary spending by \nmore than 20\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\npercent when compared to last year's bill. As it is, this is incredible \ngrowth in discretionary spending; however, to truly emphasize the \nenormity of this increase, my colleagues should consider that this \ngrowth in spending is roughly 10 times the current rate of inflation.\n  The bill hides this massive increase in discretionary spending by \nusing a variety of gimmicks. First, it proposes to offset the new \nspending by making cuts in crucial mandatory programs, such as the \nSocial Services Block Grant (SSBG), the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program (S-CHIP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF). After a number of colleagues and I expressed our concern over \nusing these programs as spending offsets, Appropriations Committee \nChairman Stevens pledged his support to vitiate these cuts when the \nLabor-HHS bill is considered in Conference. While I commend Chairman \nStevens for his commitment to restoring these funds, it is my belief \nthat the Appropriations Committee never should have tapped into these \nprograms in the first place. It is my hope that the Conferees will, as \nthey remove these offsets, look to decrease the overall level of \ndiscretionary spending in the bill rather than search for other \nsources.\n  Second, the bill moves up by 3 days the first Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI) payment date of Fiscal Year 2001 so that it falls, \ninstead, in Fiscal Year 2000. Although such a change sounds innocuous, \nthe ramifications of this action are tremendous.\n  As my colleagues know, the start of the next fiscal year begins on \nOctober 1, 2000. By moving the first SSI payment date of the year a few \ndays earlier, it will fall in the waning days of fiscal year 2000 and \nbe paid for out of the fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus. The end \nresult of this gimmick is that not only does it increase spending in FY \n2000 by $2.4 billion, which is, by the way, money I would rather see go \nto debt reduction. But it also frees up another $2.4 billion in Fiscal \nYear 2001 for Congress to spend.\n  Finally, despite the fact that the bill increases discretionary \nspending by a whopping 20 percent, it still fails to prioritize and \ntarget resources towards those programs that are the responsibility of \nthe federal government, such as fully funding our commitment under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The high cost of \neducating disabled students continues to place a heavy burden on our \nlocal school districts. If the federal government met its obligation to \nfund IDEA at the level it promised in 1975, local communities would \nhave resources left over to fund their own education priorities.\n  Instead, this appropriations bill, while increasing funding for IDEA \nby $1.31 billion over last year's bill and by $984 million above \nPresident Clinton's request, does not make enough progress on IDEA. \nBefore the federal government increases spending on new programs, it \nshould be fully funding its promise to supply up to 40 percent of the \ncost of educating disabled children.\n  Mr. President, what Congress has done in this Labor-HHS bill proves \nthat we must face facts: Congress is addicted to spending. We will use \nany gimmick, any trick, any scheme we can think of to spend money. \nOften, it is for things that we don't need, things that are not a \nfederal responsibility or things that we cannot afford.\n  Instead of using cuts in mandatory programs and accounting shifts to \npay for massive increases in discretionary programs, we need to \nprioritize our spending and make the hard choices when necessary. We \nhave used budgetary shenanigans far too often to obfuscate the size of \nspending increases, and it is long past time for this practice to end.\n  It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that I felt compelled to vote \nagainst the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, and I do not believe that I \nam alone in my concerns regarding this legislation. It is my sincere \nhope that when the conferees meet to put together the final version of \nthis legislation, they will consider and address the items that I have \nmentioned.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to take this opportunity to voice my \nconcern over the conference report to H.R. 4425, the Military \nConstruction Appropriations bill, which the Senate approved on June 30 \nby a voice vote. If it had been the subject of a roll call vote, I \nwould have voted against final passage of this bill.\n\n  My concern with this legislation does not rest with the Military \nConstruction portion of the conference report. Indeed, I voted for the \nbill when it originally came before the Senate in May. Rather, my \nconcern lies with what was added to the bill since the time the Senate \nfirst passed it.\n  While in conference, the Military Construction Appropriations bill \nbecame the vehicle to which Fiscal Year 2000 emergency supplemental \nappropriations were attached. In times of true emergency, Mr. \nPresident, I believe that Congress has an obligation to ensure that \nsupplemental funds are provided to cover unexpected expenses. That is \nwhy I have no objection to providing emergency funds for our operations \nin Kosovo and to those unfortunate Americans who have been the victims \nof natural disasters.\n  However, I do not believe that we should provide emergency funding \nfor items that are not true emergencies in an effort to avoid budget \nrules. Unfortunately, that is precisely what H.R. 4425 does. This bill \nprovides taxpayer dollars for such ``emergencies'' as the winter \nOlympic Games, a sea life center in Alaska and a new top-of-the-line \nGulfstream jet aircraft for the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  In recent years, we have seen remarkable growth in the use of \nemergency designations as a way to bypass the spending caps so that \nCongress can avoid making tough choices. Fiscal year 2000 is certainly \nno exception. In fact, we will be setting a new record for \n``emergency'' spending in this fiscal year with a final tally of more \nthan $40 billion.\n  I should also add, Mr. President, that H.R. 4425 speeds up government \npaydays and uses other accounting shifts to move nearly $12 billion of \nfiscal year 2001 spending into fiscal year 2000. Just as with the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Bill, the conference committee used this \ngimmick in order to free up an additional $12 billion for Congress to \nspend in Fiscal Year 2001.\n  Mr. President, rather than devising new, more ingenious ways to avoid \nfiscal discipline, we should be endeavoring to restore honesty and \nintegrity to the congressional budget process. As I have stated on \nprevious occasions, if any American was to cook his or her books the \nway the federal government does, that individual no doubt would be sent \nto jail very quickly. We cannot continue to apply a double standard. We \nmust live within our means, delineate responsibility between the state \nand local governments and the federal government and pay for those \nitems accordingly, and for Heaven's sake, if we have any on-budget \nsurplus funds, use those funds to pay down the National Debt.\n  I will continue to monitor the progress of the remaining \nappropriations bills, and I encourage my colleagues to work with me to \nmake sure that we spend federal tax dollars wisely.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6464-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6464-S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in 1994 we passed the original \nViolence Against Women Act, creating programs that addressed the many \nforms of domestic violence all-too prevalent in the United States \ntoday. The bill helped communities create shelters, build partnerships \namong law enforcement agencies to respond to violence against women, \nand provide legal assistance to battered women. The bill also \nestablished a domestic violence hotline that receives hundreds of calls \ndaily from people concerned about violence in their families. Now, we \nhave the opportunity and responsibility to reauthorize this legislation \nto give women and children a way out of violent and unhealthy \nsituations.\n  For groups that strive to combat domestic violence, the original \nViolence Against Women Act was a turning point in their battle. In my \nstate, the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence stands as \nan outstanding example of the great work that groups devoted to the \nnoble cause of stamping out domestic violence can do when Congress acts \nappropriately. With the added funding provided by the Violence Against \nWomen Act, the Coalition was able to quadruple its staff, increase the \nbudgets of its shelters to\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nmeet their day-to-day needs, and increase services to under-served \nparts of the population of West Virginia. Many of the women who escape \nfrom violent homes cannot afford legal services, but thanks to grants \nauthorized under the Violence Against Women Act, thirteen civil legal \nassistance programs are now in place around West Virginia providing \nfree representation for women.\n  The Coalition also computerized its entire network, enabling instant \ncommunication with offices in other parts of rural West Virginia. By \ncreating a database that compiles information on offenders from all \nover the state, they were able to work with regional jails, sheriffs, \nand other law enforcement agencies to use this valuable resource. I am \nproud to say that several other states have used West Virginia's system \nas a model, helping to combat domestic violence within their borders.\n  Passing the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 not only sustains \nexisting programs, but creates several new initiatives that extend help \nto different groups and communities. The bill establishes a new formula \nfor calculating some of the grants, enabling small states like West \nVirginia to continue to expand their services. In addition, it augments \ncurrent policies with protections for older and disabled women, and \nbuilds on legal assistance programs to further expand coverage.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the passage of this legislation conveys the \nimportant message that the federal government considers domestic \nviolence to be a serious issue. Those of us in Congress share in this \nconcern with the people we serve. We can take some pride that by acting \nto address these problems, we may have moved some State governments to \nimprove their services to abused spouses and children, and to increase \nthe penalties meted out to the abusers.\n  By paying attention to this enormously important issue, and by \nenhancing the current legislation, we are taking steps in the right \ndirection. Although the measures in the original legislation have \nhelped to alleviate the problem, we must continue to wage a persistent \nfight as long as anyone feels unsafe in their homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6465-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FY 2000 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on the Friday before the July 4 recess, \nthe Senate passed the military construction appropriations bill, which \nincluded the supplemental spending package, by voice vote. Although \nthere were a number of meritorious items in that bill, if there had \nbeen an up or down vote, I would have voted against it for a number of \nreasons.\n  I was extremely disappointed in the Conferees' decision to drop the \n$5 million in emergency methamphetamine cleanup funds from the \nsupplemental package.\n  There was strong support for this provision from both Democrats and \nRepublicans. And it was included in both the House and Senate \nsupplemental packages.\n  So, it doesn't make sense why it was suddenly dropped--especially \nwhen we're talking about dangerous chemical sites that are left exposed \nin our local communities. Without this provision, the bill provides \nhundreds of millions to help a foreign country fight a drug war, but \nturns a blind eye to one of the biggest drug problems right in our own \nback yards. That is unacceptable.\n  Our failure to fund the cleanup of these labs is all the more \ndisappointing because this bill is bloated with pork. There is $700 \nmillion here for the Coast Guard alone, including $45 million for a C-\n37A aircraft for the Coast Guard. The C-37 is a Gulfstream V executive \njet. It's not even your average corporate jet, but one of the most \nexpensive, top-of-the-line crafts\n  Why should the American taxpayers pay $45 million so the Coast Guard \nofficers can fly in luxury, when the military has trouble keeping its \nplanes aloft because they lack spare parts? There is a drug crisis in \nthis country and an immediate need for funds for peacekeeping \noperations, but that's no reason to buy luxury jets in an emergency \nspending bill.\n  Mr. President, without the meth funding, states and local communities \nwill have to bear the burden of cleaning up these highly toxic sites \nthat are found every day in Iowa and throughout the Midwest, West and \nSouthwest.\n  In recent years, the Drug Enforcement Agency has provided critical \nfinancial assistance to help clean up these dangerous sites, which can \ncost thousands of dollars each.\n  Unfortunately, in March, the DEA ran out of funds to provide \nmethamphetamine lab cleanup assistance to state and local law \nenforcement. That's because last year, this funding was cut in half \nwhile the number of meth labs found and confiscated has been growing.\n  In late May, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from \nother Department of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab \ncleanup. And I believe that will help reimburse these states for the \ncosts they have incurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of \nIowa has already paid some $300,000 of its own pocket for cleanup since \nMarch.\n  However, we've got months to go before the new fiscal year--and the \nnumber of meth labs being found and confiscated are still on the rise. \nMy $5 million provision in this emergency spending package would have \nprovided enough money to pay for costly meth lab cleanup without \nforcing states to take money out of their other tight law enforcement \nbudgets.\n  If we can find the money to fight drugs in Colombia, we should be \nable to find the money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We should \nnot risk exposing these dangerous meth sites to our communities.\n  So I urge the Senate to support adding the $5 million in emergency \nmeth cleanup funds to the FY 2001 Foreign Operations spending bill or \nanother appropriations vehicle. It is unfair to force our state and \nlocal communities to shoulder this financial burden alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6465-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MADELYN CREEDON\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

I had the privilege of working \nclosely with Madelyn while she served on the minority staff for the \nStrategic Forces Sub-Committee. I have great respect for her ability \nand judgment, and I'm confident she will do an excellent job for \nGeneral Gordon and the country. In addition to being skillful and \nreliable, Madelyn's knowledge of DOE issues is absolutely unsurpassed. \nBesides her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, she was the \nAssociate Deputy Secretary of Energy for National Security Programs at \nDOE, General Counsel for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission, majority Counsel for the Senate Armed Services Committee \nunder the Chairmanship of Senator Sam Nunn, and finally, trial attorney \nand Acting Assistant General Counsel with the DOE.

As a member of the Senate, you rarely get the \nopportunity to vote on the nomination of someone you have observed as \nclosely as I have observed Madelyn. Having done so, I lend her my \nunqualified support. Mr. President, I have but to note the vote of \nsupport by the members of the Armed Services Committee. The high esteem \nthat I hold Madelyn is reflected throughout. This Chamber will be proud \nof its vote today, and we will be lucky to have Madelyn serve her \ncountry in this capacity.

LIACOURAS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a dear \nfriend who retired after an outstanding tenure at one of our great \npublic research universities. On June 30, 2000, Peter J. Liacouras \nstepped down as President of Temple University in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania after eighteen years of service in this capacity.\n  A Temple professor of Law for almost 40 years and a former Dean of \nTemple University's Beasley School of Law, Mr. Liacouras served as the \nUniversity's chief executive since June of 1982. Under his leadership, \nTemple University achieved national and international prominence as a \ncenter for research, teaching, and public service.\n  With vision and confidence, he presided over a university with nearly \n29,000 students; a world-class faculty; 16,000 full-time and part-time \nemployees; a renowned Health Sciences Center, the Temple University \nHealth System, Inc., with seven hospitals and two nursing homes; \n210,000 proud graduates throughout the world; an annual budget of more \nthan $1 billion; successful, long-established campuses in Rome, Italy, \nand Tokyo, Japan; and educational programs in Great Britain, France, \nJamaica, Greece, Israel, Ghana, the People's Republic of China, and \nother nations.\n  Throughout his career at Temple, Mr. Liacouras worked vigorously and \ntirelessly in the pursuit of excellence. The bedrock of his \nadministration was a commitment to improving undergraduate, graduate, \nand professional education within his institution, and he restructured \nTemple's schools and colleges to meet the needs of students and the \nworld they enter after graduation.\n  He was an advocate of opening colleges and universities to persons \nfrom historically underrepresented groups--an effort which led to \nTemple becoming the first university to receive the U.S. Labor \nDepartment's coveted Exemplary Voluntary Effort (EVE) Award. As Dean of \nthe Law School, this son of Greek immigrants earned national \nrecognition for developing fair and sensible admissions policies for \nprofessional schools.\n  President Liacouras was also a leader in bringing change to his \nUniversity and anticipating even greater change in the future. His \n``Report to the Board of Trustees on Strategic Initiatives'' helped \nTemple reposition itself in a radically changing environment for higher \neducation. With his direction, the University launched Virtual Temple, \na for-profit subsidiary to market courses on the Internet.\n  He dramatically improved his university's town-gown relationship with \nits surrounding communities. While strengthening Temple's overseas \neducational programs, he led the way for the University and the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania to invest in the University's Main Campus, \nwith such projects as the Temple University Children's Medical Center, \nThe Liacouras Center, The Tuttleman Learning Center, and the \nIndependence Blue Cross Student Recreation Center.\n  His strategic vision for the Main Campus helped revitalize North \nCentral Philadelphia. As a result, community residents are seeing new \nhousing and new retail and entertainment projects in their \nneighborhoods--and Temple is experiencing an unprecedented influx of \ntalented students who want an education in a great city.\n  Mr. President, I doubt that few institutions could rival Temple \nUniversity for its accomplishments and progress during the remarkable \nstewardship of President Liacouras. I would like to thank my friend for \nhis extraordinary success in leading Temple University to new heights \nof greatness as one of America's important centers of higher \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6466-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6466-S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO NATALIE DAVIS SPINGARN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on June 6, 2000. we lost a very \ncourageous, brilliant, and dedicated American, Natalie Davis Spingarn. \nA noted writer, public servant, and leading advocate for cancer \npatients, Natalie was also a good friend who I miss greatly. She \nsuffered many health problems over the years, but she lived her life \nwith purpose, grace, and humor. Natalie built on her own experience as \na cancer patient to lead the cancer survivor movement and to work for \nimproved care and services for cancer patients.\n  I met Natalie in 1963, when she was the press secretary for the late \nSenator Abraham Ribicoff and I was a summer intern. Natalie made a \ngreat impression on me then and, quite a few years later, Natalie \nserved as a senior intern in my Senate office where she contributed her \nwealth of experience and knowledge to my efforts in the area of health \npolicy. Natalie was a trusted adviser, who endeared herself to my staff \nand me with her wisdom, energy, compassion, and wit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to \na wonderful article about Natalie Spingarn that appeared on June 7 in \nThe Washington Post. Natalie was a frequent contributor to the Health \nsection of the Post, and I know she would be proud to see Bart Barnes' \ntribute reprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                   Author Natalie Davis Spingarn Dies\n\n                            (By Bart Barnes)\n\n       Natalie Davis Spingarn, 78, an author and former federal \n     official who for 26 years had written books and articles \n     about her recurring bouts with cancer, died of pancreatic \n     cancer June 6 at the Washington Home Hospice.\n       Mrs. Spingarn, who initially was diagnosed with metastatic \n     breast cancer in 1974, was a leader in the cancer \n     survivorship movement, a writer on health care policy and a \n     patients' advocate with cancer patient support organizations.\n       Her writings included a 1988 ``Cancer Patient's Bill of \n     Rights,'' ``Hanging in There: Living Well on Borrowed Time'' \n     and ``The New Cancer Survivors: Living With Grace, Fighting \n     With Spirit,'' which was published by John Hopkins University \n     Press last year.\n       ``The biopsy is positive. You have cancer,'' she wrote in \n     ``The New Cancer Survivors,'' commencing her account of the \n     experience shared by an estimated 8.2 million Americans who \n     have a history of cancer.\n       ``Spingarn distills the diversity of the cancer survivor \n     experience, finding the commonality among them,'' wrote \n     Frances M. Cisco, a 12-year survivor of breast cancer and the \n     president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, in an \n     April 18 review of Mrs. Spingarn's book published in The \n     Washington Post. ``With compassion, insight and occasional \n     humor, Spingarn pulls the reader into the world of what she \n     terms `the new breed of cancer survivors.' These are not \n     passion victims but confident individuals, ready to speak up \n     to seek out what they need to lead quality lives.''\n       Mrs. Spingarn, a former staff assistant to Abraham A. \n     Ribicoff, both during is tenure as secretary of health, \n     education and welfare and as a Democratic senator from \n     Connecticut, was an officer of the War on Poverty in th late \n     1960's and early 1970's. She was also a freelance writer who \n     had written articles for The Washington Post and other \n     organizations.\n       She was active in Democratic Party politics and had been a \n     D.C. delegate to two Democratic National Conventions. During \n     the 19689 presidential campaign of Hubert H. Humphrey, she \n     traveled with the vice president as a speech writer.\n       Mrs. Spingarn, a resident of Washington, was born in New \n     York and graduated from Vassar College. She began her \n     professional career as a reporter on the New York newspaper \n     PM shortly after college, then came to Washington with her \n     husband after World War II.\n       She joined Ribicoff as his executive assistant at HEW in \n     1961 and remained with him after his 1962 election to the \n     Senate. In 1967, she returned to HEW as assistant director \n     for communications and training at the center for community \n     planning, which was established to coordinate urban efforts \n     in the War on Poverty. She remained on that job through the \n     early 1970s. Later, she was a public affairs assistant at the \n     Department of\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\n     Education and a D.C. General Hospital commissioner. She was a \n     White House volunteer in the Clinton administration.\n       In the years after her breast cancer was diagnosed in 1974, \n     Mrs. Spingarn wrote increasingly about issues related to \n     cancer treatment and care. She reviewed several books on \n     health care for the Health section of The Washington Post, \n     and she wrote first-person accounts about her own treatment \n     and care.\n       She had a family history replete with cancer. Her \n     grandmother died of cancer. Both her sisters had breast \n     cancer, and one died of pancreatic cancer. A son survived a \n     bout with lymphoma.\n       In 1977 and 1979, Mrs. Spingarn experienced new diagnoses \n     of cancer.\n       ``In my work, I write usually about health policy matters. \n     . . . In my life I am a patient, a role which takes time--too \n     much time,'' she wrote in The Washington Post in 1980. ``I am \n     living still in my Washington hospital bed. . . . A nurse \n     comes in to check on me. . . . `What's the matter with you?' \n     she wants to know . . . my disease seems to her my fault. She \n     makes no move toward me, even to inquire if I need anything, \n     and observes that I should have talked to the doctor about \n     avoiding its spread . . .''\n       In 1981, she wrote about her search for a holistic means of \n     dealing with cancer. ``I had flirted with the idea that my \n     emotions might affect my cancer pain during a period a few \n     years ago when I suffered especially nagging backaches. I had \n     discarded clumsy back brace, which made me sweat and my \n     clothes balloon. Doctors and a pain clinic had only given me \n     more pills . . . the latest had made my hands tremble.''\n       In the ensuing years, Mrs. Spingarn would write of needs \n     for long-term care and increased mental health services for \n     cancer patients, rules and regulations that often appeared to \n     be contradictory and cause unnecessary hardship, and waste, \n     fraud and inefficiency that many patients routinely \n     encounter.\n       She won an award at the John Muir Medical Film Festival for \n     a film, ``Patients and Doctors: Communication Is a Two-Way \n     Street,'' and she served on the boards of the National \n     Coalition for Cancer Survivorship and the International \n     Alliance of Patient Organizations.\n       Survivors include her husband, Jerome Spingarn of \n     Washington; two sons, Jonathan Spingarn of Atlanta and Jeremy \n     Spingarn of Norwood, Mass.; a brother; a sister; and two \n     grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6467-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SINDTS' 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

My wife, Janet, and I look forward \nto the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Sindts' commitment \nto the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted \nand recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6467-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SOUTH CAROLINA PEACHES\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize South \nCarolina's peach farmers for their hard work and their delicious \npeaches.\n  Today, peaches from my home State have been delivered to offices \nthroughout the Senate and the U.S. Capitol. Thanks to South Carolina's \npeach farmers, those of us here in Washington will be able to cool off \nfrom the summer heat with delicious peaches.\n  For a relatively small State, South Carolina is second in the Nation \nin peach production. In fact, this year farmers across my State planted \nmore than 16,000 acres of peaches. As my colleagues can attest, these \nare some of the finest peaches produced anywhere in the United States.\n  As we savor the taste of these peaches, we should remember the work \nand labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. While \nAmericans enjoy peaches for appetizers, entrees and desserts, most do \nnot stop to consider where they come from. Farmers will be laboring all \nsummer in the heat and humidity to bring us what we call the ``perfect \ncandy.'' What else curbs a sweet tooth, is delicious, nutritious and \nsatisfying, but not fattening?\n  The truth is, Mr. President, our farmers as too often the forgotten \nworkers in our country. Through their dedication and commitment, our \nnation is able to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, \nvegetables and other foods. In fact, our agricultural system, at times, \nis the envy of the world.\n  Mr. President, as Senators and their staff feast on these delicious \npeaches, I hope they will remember the people in South Carolina who \nmade this endeavor possible: The South Carolina Peach Council, David \nWinkles and the entire South Carolina Farm Bureau. They have all worked \nextremely hard to ensure that the U.S. Senate gets a taste of South \nCarolina.\n  I am sure everyone in our Nation's Capitol will be smiling as they \nenjoy these delicious South Carolina peaches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6467-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE DESTINATION IN IMAGI NATION TEAM FROM PIONEER MIDDLE \n                                 SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is not often that over 8,000 \nkids from all over the world are brought together to celebrate their \ncreativity and problem solving skills, but thanks to a program called \nDestination ImagiNation, it became a reality in May of this year when \nDestination ImagiNation held their Global Finals at Iowa State \nUniversity. A five-student team from Pioneer Middle School in \nWenatchee, Washington were able to participate in the D2K finals and \nwere a great success when they finished fourth in the ``Instant PUDDING \nImprov'' category.\n  Destination ImagiNation is a non-profit corporation that offers young \npeople a chance to participate in a global, youth-centered, creative \nproblem solving program. The Destination ImagiNation program has two \ncomponents: ``Instant Challenges'' that teach students to take what \nlife is handing them moment to moment and requires them to solve a \nchallenge on the spot; ``Team Challenges'' use art, technology, \nperformance, and real world relevance as they tackle one of the six \nchallenges, that can take from several weeks to several months to \ndevelop.\n  The team from Pioneer Middle School included Carly Faulkner, Kari \nOpp, Whitney Faulkner, Jessica Pinkston and Aaron Galbraith. Utilizing \ntheir critical thinking and problem-solving skills, these amazing \nindividuals were able to perform an improvisational story with only a \nhalf and hour to prepare. Not only were there time limits, but they \nwere given predetermined props and a list of 12 people, places, and \ntimes that had to be incorporated into their performance.\n  Can you imagine having to correlate Ghandi, the Egyptian Pyramids, \nTinkerbell, and someone winning a million dollars in the Lotto into a \ncoherent and entertaining piece? Successfully, the 8th graders were \nable to accomplish just that. Surely, this takes a tremendous deal of \nteamwork and quick thinking!\n  Their coach, Shelly Skaar, who is a librarian for the East Wenatchee \nSchool District, has been with the team twice at the D2K competition. \n``The impact on the kids has built their teamwork, problem solving \nabilities, and even incorporates acting into how they compete,'' says \nShelly.\n  Clearly, this is a confidence building tool that allows children to \ncapitalize on their creativity and be proud of their ideas. I applaud \nthe positive nature of Destination ImagiNation, and am glad that so \nmany children across the nation and around the globe are taking part in \nsuch an original competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6467-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF ``STEPMOTHER'S DAY''\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

I was sent a letter on May 21, 2000 from Mrs. \nJoyce Capuzzi informing me that the Sunday after Mother's Day would now \nbe Stepmother's Day.\n  Joyce's stepdaughter, Lizzie, came to this decision as she recognized \nthe importance of the relationship she has with her stepmother. I \ncommend both Joyce and Lizzie for embracing their new family members in \nthis manner.\n  Many people are blessed with step-relationships similar to the \nCapuzzis. However, none have ever illustrated that with the idea of \ncreating a holiday just for the recognition of this type of \nrelationship. It is wonderful that Lizzie Capuzzi holds so much love \nfor her stepmother, and it is my hope that they their relationship can \nbe an example for other stepfamilies.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6468-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n                   GORDON B.

The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to enact legislation as soon as possible \n     prohibiting the importation into the United States, or sale, \n     of domestic dog or cat fur or any product made in whole or in \n     part therefrom. For the purposes of this resolution, \n     ``domestic dog or cat'' means a dog (Canis familiaris) or cat \n     (Felis catus or Felis domesticus) that is generally \n     recognized in the United States as being a household pet and \n     shall not include coyote, fox, lynx, bobcat, or any other \n     wild canine or feline species.\n       2.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Tennessee relative to proposed ergonomics \n     standards; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 610\n\n       Whereas, Tennessee has enacted a comprehensive workers' \n     compensation system with incentives to employers to maintain \n     a safe workplace, to work with employees to prevent workplace \n     injuries, and to compensate employees for injuries that \n     occur; and\n       Whereas, Section 4(b)(4) of the Federal Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 653(b)(4), provides that \n     ``Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or \n     in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to \n     enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common \n     law or statutory rights, duties or liabilities of employers \n     and employees under any law with respect to injuries, \n     diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the \n     course of, employment.''; and\n       Whereas, The Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (``OSHA''), notwithstanding this statutory restriction and \n     the constitutional, traditional and historical role of the \n     states in providing compensation for injuries in the \n     workplace, has nevertheless published a proposed rule that, \n     if adopted, would substantially displace the role of the \n     states in compensating workers for musculoskeletal injuries \n     in the workplace and would impose far-reaching requirements \n     for implementation of ergonomics programs; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule creates in effect a special \n     class of workers' compensation benefits for ergonomic \n     injuries, requiring payment of up to six months of wages at \n     ninety percent (90%) of take-home pay and one hundred percent \n     (100%) of benefits for absence from work; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would allow employees to bypass \n     the system of medical treatment provided by Tennessee law for \n     workers' compensation injuries and to seek diagnosis and \n     treatment from any licensed health care provider paid by the \n     employer; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would require employers to treat \n     ergonomic cases as both workers' compensation cases and OSHA \n     cases and to pay for medical treatment under both; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule could force all manufacturers to \n     alter workstations, redesign facilities or change tools and \n     equipment, all triggered by the report of a single injury; \n     and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would require all American \n     businesses to become full-time experts in ergonomics, a field \n     for which there is little if any credible evidence and as to \n     which there is an ongoing scientific debate; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would cause hardship on \n     businesses and manufacturers with costs of compliance as high \n     as eighteen billion dollars ($18,000,000,000) annually, \n     without guaranteeing the prevention of a single injury; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule may force businesses to make \n     changes that would impair efficiency in distribution centers; \n     and\n       Whereas, This proposed rule is premature until the science \n     exists to understand the root cause of musculoskeletal \n     disorders, OSHA should not rush to make rules that are likely \n     to result in a loss of jobs without consensus in the \n     scientific and medical communities as to what causes \n     repetitive-stress injuries, and medical researchers must \n     answer fundamental questions surrounding ergonomics before \n     government regulators impose a one-size-fits-all solution: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred First General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to take all necessary \n     measures to prevent the proposed ergonomics rule from taking \n     effect; and be it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker and\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\n     the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives; the \n     President and the Secretary of the United States Senate; and \n     to each member of the Tennessee Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-534.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to the Internal Revenue \n     Code; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 48\n\n       Whereas, The Internal Revenue Code currently provides that \n     an individual's personal income tax filing status depends \n     upon whether that individual is considered married or \n     unmarried; and\n       Whereas, When a married couple elects the personal income \n     tax filing status of married filing jointly, their incomes \n     are aggregated which often places them in a higher income tax \n     bracket and increases their tax liability; and\n       Whereas, There are nearly 21 million working married \n     couples in the United States who, as a result of the current \n     Internal Revenue Code, pay an average of $1,400 more in taxes \n     than an unmarried couple of identical financial means; and\n       Whereas, For many Americans, especially for working couples \n     with lower incomes, $1,400 represents a considerable amount \n     of money that could be used for other necessities of life, \n     such as child care, college tuition or retirement savings; \n     and\n       Whereas, Many working married Americans view the payment of \n     these higher taxes as a marriage penalty which serves as an \n     incentive to dissolve their marriage; and\n       Whereas, Many unmarried working Americans view their \n     marriage penalty as a disincentive to enter into the bonds of \n     marriage, choosing instead to live together outside of \n     marriage; and\n       Whereas, Government policy should strengthen families and \n     encourage marriage rather than penalize those who choose to \n     marry; and\n       Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper that the \n     Legislature memorialize the United States Congress to enact \n     H.R. 2456, known as the Marriage Tax Elimination Act, which \n     amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that married \n     couples may file a combined return under which each spouse is \n     taxed using the rates applicable to unmarried individuals: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The General Assembly respectfully memorializes the \n     United States Congress to enact H.R. 2456, the Marriage Tax \n     Elimination Act, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code \n     to provide that married couples may file a combined return \n     under which each spouse is taxed using the rates applicable \n     to unmarried individuals. The Marriage Tax Elimination Act \n     would eliminate the marriage penalty tax and bring greater \n     parity between the tax burden imposed on similarly situated \n     working married couples and that placed on couples living \n     outside of marriage. Such an amendment to the Internal \n     Revenue Code will serve to strengthen marriages and families, \n     allow working married couples to retain more of their own \n     resources, reduce their financial pressures, and enable them \n     to provide for other important necessities of life, such as \n     child care, college tuition and retirement savings.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     health plan coverages; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 380\n\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania ranks second only to Florida in the \n     proportion of the total population of the State that is 65 \n     years of age and older; and\n       Whereas, In 1997 the Medicare+Choice program was \n     established to expand health plan options by permitting types \n     of plans other than health maintenance organizations to \n     participate in Medicare; and\n       Whereas, In response to excess payments made to \n     participating health plans, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     (Public Law 105-33, 111 Stat. 251) enacted payment revisions \n     in the Medicare+Choice program to reduce future excess \n     payments; and\n       Whereas, Participating health plans in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania, such as Highmark Blue Cross, Blue Shield's \n     Security Blue and Aetna/US Healthcare's plan, have either \n     increased rates substantially or reduced benefits; and\n       Whereas, Some counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     have been more severely affected by the problems of plan \n     withdrawals, increases in premiums and decreases in benefit \n     packages; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Health Care Financing Administration \n     is authorized to review and approve Medicare prepaid health \n     plan rates annually; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize Congress to \n     investigate health insurance premium increases for Medicare \n     health maintenance organization coverage and other types of \n     participating health plan coverage; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-540. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to \n     China; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 3459\n\n\n                         statement of purposes\n\n       The accession of China to the World Trade Organization \n     (``WTO'') would potentially add $1.6 billion by 2005 to the \n     annual tally of global U.S. exports of grains, oilseeds, \n     oilseed products, and cotton. Much of the $1.6 billion \n     represents direct sales to China in the listed commodities, \n     which would enjoy significantly greater access to the immense \n     Chinese market, and the referenced figure does not take into \n     account other commodities, such as fruit and vegetables, \n     animal products, and tree nuts, which would also enjoy \n     increased access once these duty reductions are implemented.\n       To underscore the importance of the Chinese market to the \n     United States economy, it is worth noting that U.S. \n     agricultural exports to China over the past twenty (20) years \n     have grown from negligible levels to $1.1 billion in fiscal \n     year 1999. Estimates of additional exports under China's \n     pending accession to the WTO are based on a preliminary \n     analysis by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic \n     Research Service (``ERS''), which analysis is based on \n     China's WTO commitments under the comprehensive bilateral \n     trade agreement with the United States.\n       In its efforts to join the WTO, China has already made \n     significant one-way market-opening accessions across \n     virtually every economic sector, including agriculture, \n     manufactured goods, services, technology, and \n     telecommunications. Farmers, workers and industries from all \n     over the fifty (50) states, as well as U.S. territories and \n     possessions, will greatly benefit from increased access to \n     China's market of over one (1) billion people.\n       In agriculture, tariffs on U.S. priority products, such as \n     beef, dairy and citrus fruits, will drop from an average of \n     31% to 14% in January 2004. China will also expand access for \n     bulk agricultural products such as wheat, corn, cotton, \n     soybeans and others; allow for the first time private trade \n     in said products; and eliminate export subsidies. In \n     manufactures, Chinese industrial tariffs will fall from an \n     average of 25% in 1997 to 9.4% in 2005. In information \n     technology, tariffs on products such as computers, \n     semiconductors, and all Internet-related equipment will fall \n     to zero by 2005. In services, China will open markets for \n     distribution, telecommunications, insurance, express \n     delivery, banking, law, accounting, audiovisual, engineering, \n     construction, environmental services, and other industries.\n       At present, China severely restricts trading rights, i.e., \n     the right to import and export, as well as the ability to own \n     and operate distribution networks, which are essential in \n     order to move goods and compete effectively in any market. \n     Under the proposed agreement, China will phase in such \n     trading rights and distribution services over three (3) \n     years, and also open up sectors related to distribution \n     services, such as repair and maintenance, warehousing, \n     trucking and air courier services. This will allow American \n     businesses to export directly to China and to have their own \n     distribution network in China, rather than being forced to \n     set up factories in China to sell products through Chinese \n     partners, as has been frequently the case until now.\n       At the same time, the proposed agreement offers China no \n     increased access to American markets. The United States \n     agrees only to maintain the market access policies that \n     already apply to China, and have for over twenty (20) years, \n     by making China's current Normal Trade Relations status \n     permanent. WTO rules require that members accord each other \n     such status on an unconditional basis.\n       If Congress does not grant China ``Permanent Normal Trade \n     Relations'' status, our European, Asian, Canadian and Latin \n     American competitors will reap the benefits of China's WTO \n     accession, but China would not be required to accord these \n     benefits to the United States.\n       In addition to purely economic considerations, China's \n     accession to the WTO will promote reform, greater individual \n     freedom, and strengthen the rule of law in China, which is \n     why the commitments already made represent a remarkable \n     victory for Chinese economic reformers. Furthermore, WTO \n     accession will give the Chinese people greater access to \n     information, and weaken the ability of hardliners in the \n     Chinese government to isolate China's public from outside \n     ideas and influences. In view of these facts, it is not \n     surprising that many of China's and Hong Kong's activists for \n     democracy and human rights--including Martin Lee, the leader \n     of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, and Ren Wanding, a prominent \n     dissident who has spent many years of his life in prison--see \n     China's WTO accession as the most important step toward \n     reform in the past two decades.\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\n       Finally, WTO accession will increase the chance that in the \n     new century, China will be an integral part of the \n     international system, abiding by accepted rules of \n     international behavior, rather than remain outside the \n     system, denying or ignoring such rules. From the U.S. \n     perspective, PNTR advances the American people's larger \n     interest to bring China into international agreements and \n     institutions that can make it a more constructive player in \n     the current world, with a significant stake in preserving \n     peace and stability.\n       For all of the above considerations, the Senate of Puerto \n     Rico joins in urging the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to pass a Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n     (``PNTR'') agreement with China at the earliest possible \n     moment, which will provide American farmers, workers and \n     industries with substantially greater access to the Chinese \n     market, to the ultimate benefit of the U.S. economy in \n     general and the American people in particular.\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To urge the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to approve a Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n     (``PNTR'') agreement with China at the earliest possible date \n     in order to promote security and prosperity for American \n     farmers, workers and industries by providing substantially \n     greater access to the Chinese market.\n       Section 2.-- This Resolution will be officially notified to \n     the Honorable William Jefferson Clinton, President of the \n     United States, to the Honorable Albert Gore, Jr., Vice-\n     President of the United States, to the Honorable Trent Lott, \n     United States Senate Majority Leader, and to the Honorable J. \n     Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, as well as selected Members of the United \n     States Congress.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution will be publicized by making \n     copies thereof available to the local, state and national \n     media.\n       Section 4.--This Resolution will become effective \n     immediately upon its approval by the Senate of Puerto Rico.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-541. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to Internal Revenue Code; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, many employees of the state of Louisiana \n     participate in one of the four public retirement systems \n     sponsored by the state, and these employees contribute to the \n     applicable system in order to provide benefits which are \n     payable to their minor children upon the death of any such \n     employee; and\n       Whereas, based on federal law, the federal Internal Revenue \n     Service allows five thousand dollars of such death benefits \n     payable from a state retirement system to the children of \n     deceased state employees to be excluded from gross income for \n     the purposes of taxation, but requires any amount of benefits \n     above that sum to be taxed as ``investment income'' under \n     Section 61(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, which is \n     contrary to the source and nature of such death benefits; and\n       Whereas, in contrast to state employment, there are many \n     more people who are employed in the ``private sector'', who \n     participate in the federal social security system and who pay \n     contributions to that system in order to provide benefits \n     which are payable to their minor children upon the death of \n     any such employee; and\n       Whereas, also in contrast to state employment, Section \n     86(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code provides an \n     exclusion from gross income in an amount equal to one-half of \n     death benefits payable from the social security system to \n     children of deceased private sector employees, with the \n     remaining half being treated as ordinary income, and prior to \n     the 1983 tax year all such benefits were excluded from \n     taxable income; and\n       Whereas, it is patently unfair to require a limit of five \n     thousand dollars for the exclusion from income of death \n     benefits payable to the children of public sector employees \n     and to treat all such benefits above that limit as investment \n     income, while simultaneously allowing an exclusion of one-\n     half of such benefits payable to children of private sector \n     employees and treating all such benefits above that limit as \n     ordinary income, but not as investment income: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to amend Section 86(a) \n     of the United States Internal Revenue Code, regarding the \n     children of deceased public sector employees who receive \n     death benefits from a state-sponsored retirement system, to \n     provide those children with an exclusion from gross income \n     equal to one-half of such benefits and to treat all such \n     benefits above that limit as ordinary income, but not as \n     investment income, and thereby bring equality of treatment to \n     children of deceased public and private sector employees; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-542 A resolution adopted by the City Council of \n     Westfield, Massachusetts relative to Vieques, Puerto Rico; to \n     the Committee on Armed Services.\n       POM-543 A petition from a Citizen of the State of Maryland \n     relative to the Environmental Protection Agency; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       POM-544.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the Coastal Wetlands \n     Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act Task Force; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and \n     Restoration Act (CWPPRA), known as the ``Breaux Act'' \n     sponsored by Senator John Breaux, provides approximately $40 \n     million per year in federal funding for the Louisiana \n     wetlands protection and restoration projects approved by the \n     CWPPRA Task Force; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's barrier islands are the primary line \n     of defense against waves from the Gulf of Mexico and protect \n     our extensive estuarine system and the mainland marshes; and\n       Whereas, barrier islands help keep one of the nation's most \n     productive fisheries vibrant, provide habitat to wildlife and \n     furnish storm protection for homes, roads, waterways, and oil \n     industry infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, these barrier islands provide valuable habitat for \n     migratory birds, nesting shorebirds and waterfowl, and \n     aquatic nursery habitats for fish and shellfish; and\n       Whereas, restoration is critical to sustaining the barrier \n     islands and reducing mainland marsh loss; and\n       Whereas, the erosion and breaching of barrier islands \n     reduces their effectiveness in preventing storm surges from \n     reaching mainland marshes and results in increased wave \n     damage to bay marshes; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana, which contains forty percent of the \n     wetlands in the forty-eight contiguous states, is losing \n     between twenty-five and thirty-five square miles of valuable \n     marine habitat a year, mainly due to erosion, subsidence, and \n     other forces; and\n       Whereas, the barrier islands are estimated to disappear by \n     about 2018 if nothing is done; and\n       Whereas, coastal restoration projects are selected by the \n     CWPPRA Task Force based upon the project's overall impact on \n     coastal restoration; and\n       Whereas, the current selection process does not adequately \n     appreciate the full repercussions of barrier island erosion \n     and loss on the entire coastline; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States and urges the CWPPRA Task \n     Force to support modifying the selection process for projects \n     under the Breaux Act to consider other benefits that barrier \n     island restoration projects provide in addition to vegetated \n     wetland benefits; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of the Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, to each member of \n     the Louisiana congressional delegation, and to the chairman \n     of the CWPPRA Task Force.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-547. A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Rhode Island relative to gasoline; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act \n     (CAA) mandated the addition of oxygenates in reformulated \n     gasoline (RFG) at a minimum of 2% of content by weight to \n     reduce the concentration of various types of air \n     contaminants, including ozone and carbon monoxide, in regions \n     of the country exceeding National Ambient Air Quality \n     Standards, and states that opted into the program; and\n       Whereas, Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MtBE), the most \n     commonly used gasoline oxygenate in the United States and \n     Rhode Island, is being detected in surface and groundwater \n     supplies throughout the United States due to leaking \n     underground petroleum storage tanks, spills, and other \n     accidental discharges; and\n       Whereas, Because MtBE is highly soluble in water, spills \n     and leaks involving MtBE-laden gasoline are considerably more \n     expensive and difficult to remediate than those involving \n     conventional gasoline; and\n       Whereas, A ``Blue Ribbon Panel'' of the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency called for the elimination of the federal \n     oxygenate requirement and for the reduction of the use of \n     MtBE in gasoline because of public health concerns associated \n     with MtBE in water supplies; and\n       Whereas, The prescriptive requirements in the 1990 Clean \n     Air Act Amendments for oxygenate content restrict the State's \n     ability to address groundwater contamination and air quality \n     issues: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the State of Rhode Island and Providence \n     Plantations respectfully urges and requests that the United \n     States Congress remove the requirement in the Clean Air Act \n     for 2% of content by weight oxygenate in reformulated \n     gasoline while maintaining the toxic emissions reductions \n     benefits achieved to date by the RFG program so that \n     additional alternate fuel mixtures may be available for use \n     in Rhode Island; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit a duly certified copy of \n     this resolution to the Honorable William J. Clinton, \n     President of the United States, the President of the Senate \n     and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     Congress of the United States and to each member of the Rhode \n     Island Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-548. A resolution by the Legislature of the State of \n     New York relative to the Great Lakes; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                         Legislative Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Water is a critical resource that is essential for \n     all forms of life and for a broad range of economic and \n     social activities; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes support 33 million people as well \n     as a diversity of the plant and animal populations; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes contain roughly 20% of the world's \n     freshwater and 95% of the freshwater of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes are predominantly non-renewable \n     resources with approximately only 1% of their water renewed \n     annually by precipitation, surface water runoff and inflow \n     from groundwater sources; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes Basin is an integrated and fragile \n     ecosystem with its surface and groundwater resources a part \n     of a single hydrologic system, which should be dealt with as \n     a whole in ways that take into account water quantity, water \n     quality and ecosystem integrity; and\n       Whereas, Sound science must be the basis for water resource \n     management policies and strategies; and\n       Whereas, Scientific information supports the conclusion \n     that a relatively small volume of water permanently removed \n     from sensitive habits may have grave ecological consequences; \n     and\n       Whereas, Single and cumulative bulk removals of water from \n     drainable basins such as interbasin transfers, reduce the \n     resiliency of a system and its capacity to cope with future, \n     unpredictable stresses, including potential introduction of \n     non-native species and diseases to receiving waters; and\n       Whereas, There is uncertainty about the availability of \n     Great Lakes water in the future in light of previous \n     variations in climatic conditions, climate change, demands on \n     water--cautions should be used in managing water to protect \n     the resource for the future; and\n       Whereas, A report from The International Joint Commission, \n     released March 15, 2000, recommends that Canadian and U.S. \n     federal, provincial and state governments should not permit \n     the removal of water from the Great Lakes Basin unless the \n     proponent can demonstrate that the removal will not endanger \n     the integrity of the Great Lakes Ecosystem; and\n       Whereas, Canada has already introduced legislation to amend \n     the Boundary Waters Treaty Act to prohibit bulk water \n     withdrawals from the Great Lakes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That this Legislative Body pause in its \n     deliberations to urge the New York State Congressional \n     Delegation to effectuate an amendment to the Boundary Waters \n     Treaty Act to prohibit bulk water withdrawals from the Great \n     Lakes to preserve the integrity and environmental stability \n     of the Great lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution, suitably \n     engrossed, be transmitted to each member of the United States \n     Congressional Delegation of the State of New York; to the \n     Vice President of the United States in his capacity as \n     President of the United States Senate; to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives; to the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives; to the Secretary of \n     the United States Senate; and to the Administrator of the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/11/senate-section/article/S6473-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HELMS, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2844: An original bill to amend the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 to authorize the provision of assistance to \n     increase the availability of credit to microenterprises \n     lacking full access to credit, to establish a Microfinance \n     Loan Facility, and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to provide for a land exchange to benefit the Pecos \nNational Historical Park in New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n        pecos national historical park land exchange act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Pecos \nNational Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2000. This bill will \nfacilitate a land exchange between the Federal government and a private \nlandowner that will benefit the Pecos National Historical Park in my \nState of New Mexico.\n  Specifically, the bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a \nprivate inholding within the park's boundaries in exchange for the \ntransfer of a nearby tract of national forest system land. The national \nforest parcel has been identified as available for exchange in the \nSanta Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and is \nsurrounded by private lands on three sides.\n  Pecos National Historical Park posses exceptional historic and \narchaeological resources. Its strategic location between the Great \nPlains and the Rio Grande Valley has made it the focus of the region's \n10,000 years of human history. The park preserves the ruins of the \ngreat Pecos pueblo, a major trade center and the ruins of two Spanish \ncolonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  The Glorieta Unit of the park protects key sites associated with the \n1862 Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, a significant event that ended \nthe Confederate attempt to expand the war into the west. This unit will \ndirectly benefit from the land exchange.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill I have \nintroduced today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pecos National Historical \n     Park Land Exchange Act of 2000.''\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to create an independent office in the Department of \nLabor to advocate on behalf of pension participants, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n            pension participants advocacy office legislation\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Pension \nParticipant Advocacy Act.'' A similar measure is being introduced by \nCongressman Rob Andrews in the House.\n\n  It is no secret that the elderly population in America is growing at \nan unprecedented rate. In 1996, about one in every eight Americans was \nage 65 or older--that amounts to 33.9 million Americans. That number is \nexpected to double by 2030.\n  Generally, people work for three main benefits, their salary or \nwages, their health care and their pensions. Of the three, most people \ntend to focus least on their pensions, at least till they near \nretirement. But, pensions are not only very important, they are highly \nvariable in their generosity.\n  Ideally, retirement is a three-legged stool. One leg is Social \nSecurity. It is\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\nrun by the federal government. Almost all employees and their employers \nare required to pay into Social Security. Appropriately, there is a \ngreat deal of legislative concern about Social Security, the only funds \navailable to many retirees. Another leg is regular personal savings \ngenerally outside of Congress' purview. And, the third is pensions. \nMillions receive pension benefits and unfortunately millions of others \ndo not.\n  In the United States, there is no mandatory requirement that an \nemployer provide a pension plan. But, the federal and state governments \noffer very significant tax benefits to both companies and individuals \nto entice them to save in a dedicated way for retirement.\n  Ensuring a secure retirement for all Americans is more than just a \ngoal. It's a fiscal necessity. We know from experience that a strong \npension system drastically eases the demands on our social safety net. \nSo, year after year, our government invests a large chunk of taxpayer \nmoney, revenues not collected, to promote pensions.\n  But while the Federal government has invested huge sums by forgiving \nand deferring taxes to entice investments in pensions, there has been \nlimited review of how well the system is treating average workers and \nretirees. But, unfortunately, there are not comparably large and \nsophisticated groups who speak for average workers.\n  Another problem is the very structure of the federal pension \nbureaucracy. Nobody has the assigned job of generally looking out for \nthe pension participant. Yes, the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation \ndoes provide benefits to participants when their plans go bankrupt. The \nTreasury and the IRS have the responsibility to make sure that the \npension laws in the Tax Code are fairly followed. But that is not their \nfocus. The Department of Labor has considerable pension responsibility. \nBut, their first focus is on the proper management of pension plans' \nfunds. And, the needs of the participants are sometimes in conflict \nwith the financial health of pension plans. In recent years, the \nCongress has funded programs where pension participants, employees or \nretirees, can ask some basic questions. But, there is a lack of any \nsystematic effort to uncover unfortunate or abusive practices. Let's \nlook at two pension problems I have recently tried to resolve.\n\n  Mr. President, as I wrote to the Department of Labor and Treasury \nthis past January, lump sum payments continue to deplete Americans' \npension payments by up to 50% with very little disclosure. Employers \ngive new retirees a sheet of paper with two numbers on it--a small, \nmonthly amount and a large, lump sum payment. Imagine getting that \npiece of paper. Which one would you take? Despite our disclosure law, \nmany employers will not tell you that the larger number actually equals \nhalf the value of the smaller number over time.\n  This has been going on for years, and who has spoken up for the \nparticipants? The Departments of Labor and Treasury took four months to \nrespond to my letter. If that is the kind of response a Senate office \ngets, where can pension participants turn when their livelihood depends \nupon getting answers? Let me tell you the story of Paul Schroeder, a \n44-year old engineer who has worked for Ispat Inland, Inc, an East \nChicago steel company, for 19 years. When the company converted to a \ncash balance plan, Paul calculated that his benefits would level off \nfor as long as 13 years. The company would be putting no money into his \npension for over a decade.\n  Meanwhile, new workers at the company would get added pension \nbenefits with each pay check. This is called the ``wear away'' system. \nIt is the period in which the cash balance benefit catches up to the \nvalue of the old plan benefit. Apparently, this practice is legal \nbecause of one sentence that was quietly inserted into an unrelated \nTreasury regulation just before it was approved in 1991. The EEOC is \njust now undergoing a detailed study to see if these plans violate age \ndiscrimination laws. After almost a decade of older employees having \ntheir pension assets frozen indefinitely, I ask you: who advocated on \ntheir behalf?\n  I only learned about this issue from a group of IBM employees who \nspent months clamoring to get our attention here in Congress. Those \nemployees told their story to anyone who would listen. But when pension \nproposals don't affect the well-connected, who speaks for the \nparticipants?\n  I have introduced legislation that has received 47 votes in the \nSenate to provide for payments and I will try to pass it again. But, we \nshould not need to pass a new law. The existing laws against age \ndiscrimination should have clicked in. For years, nobody was looking.\n  The bottom line is that no government agency is really looking out \nfor the interests of pensioners. There are a few private organizations \nthat are desperately trying to protect pension rights. But they're \nunderfunded, scattered around the country, and easily overpowered by \nthe better funded, better organized groups.\n  That is why I am proposing legislation to create an office whose \nspecific function is to advocate for the rights of pensioner \nparticipants, both when they are employees and when they are retired. \nOur nation's seniors depend on their pensions to keep them afloat in \nretirement, and Social Security was never meant to do it alone. As the \nelderly population grows, it is in our nation's economic interest to \nensure that pension legislation focuses on the best interests of \nparticipants.\n  Mr. President, The Office of Pension Participant Advocacy created in \nthis bill would:\n  Actively seek out information and suggestions on pension policies and \non Federal agencies which affect pension participants.\n  Evaluate the efforts of Federal agencies, businesses and industry to \nassist pension participants.\n  Identify significant problems faced by employees and retirees,\n  Make annual recommendations documenting significant pension problems \nand recommending legislative and regulatory solutions.\n  And examine existing pension plans and determine the extent to which \ncurrent law serves pensioners in those plans.\n  Mr. President, we have a strong economy. But we also have an \nobligation to save a place at the table for those who made it strong. \nOur nation's pensioners deserve a say in the policies that determine \ntheir livelihood. They deserve the right to have their interests \nrepresented.\n  In the last 25 years, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, \ncommonly known as ERISA has been extremely successful, but it has \ncreated a complex web of pension law that gives authority to multiple \nagencies with no central place people can turn to for help. Time and \ntime again, the needs of pension participants are ignored, and the \npensioners who don't have the time or the resources to navigate the web \nof pension authority are weeded out.\n  We need one central place where pension participants can turn to when \nproblems arise. We need one place in government whose sole obligation \nis to look out for the general pension interests of employees and \nretirees concerning their pensions. We need an office that will be an \nadvocate for pension participants. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2849\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 49. A joint resolution recognizing Commodore John Barry as \nthe first flag officer of the United States Navy; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n        john barry, first flag officer of the united states navy\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a joint \nresolution, recognizing Commodore John Barry as the first flag officer \nof the United States Navy. Commodore Barry had been described as the \n``Father of the American Navy'' by his contemporaries for his unfailing \nservice to the United States Navy. The Commodore, born in Tacumshin \nParish in County Wexford, Ireland and son to a poor Irish farmer, began \nhis maritime career at an early age. He rose through the ranks and, at \nthe outset of the American Revolution, was made responsible for \noutfitting the first Continental Navy ships. On March 14, 1776, the \nMarine Committee awarded Barry with a Captain's commission to the \nContinental Navy and his first warship, the brig Lexington. In his \nfirst conflict at sea with this ship, the Commodore brought the \nfledgling Navy its first victory at sea and captured the Edward, a \nBritish tender. Barry reported to the Congress, ``This victory had a \ntremendous psychological effect in boosting American morale, as it was \nthe first capture of a British warship by a regularly commissioned \nAmerican cruiser.''\n  While awaiting the completion of his second warship, the Effingham, \nBarry enlisted as a soldier in the Continental Army and served under \nGeneral John Cadwalader, fighting in the Battles of Trenton and of \nPrinceton. But it was not until his return to the Navy that the \nCommodore fought his most famed battle. Aboard the 36-gun frigate \nAlliance, Barry put up a brilliant defense against two British sloops, \nthe Atlanta and the Tresspassy. In his crusade, he was badly wounded in \nhis shoulder and lost a large volume of blood. His second-in-command \nreported that the ship was in a desperate condition and recommended \nthat the ship surrender. But the Commodore refused. He said, ``If this \nship cannot be fought without me, I will be brought on deck!'' Broken \nand bandaged, Commodore Barry continued forward with the battle. After \nalmost four hours, the Atlanta and the Tresspassy surrendered.\n  The Commodore's final battle in the American Revolution was also the \nfinal sea battle of the Continental Navy. Aboard the Alliance, Barry \nescorted the Duc De Sauzon, a ship carrying Spanish silver, and warded \noff the Royal Navy's Sybil, protecting the vital cargo destined for the \nContinental Congress. Even after his retirement from battle, Barry's \ncontributions to the Navy continued. In 1797, President Washington \ninvited Barry to receive Commission Number One in the Navy. His new \nposition placed him in charge of the new Navy and oversight of the \nconstruction and outfitting of its first frigates. The U.S.S. United \nStates and the U.S.S. Constitution were both built under his command.\n  Commodore John Barry served as Commodore under Presidents Washington, \nAdams and Jefferson until he died in 1803.\n  Before he died, the Commodore wrote a Signal Book for the Navy, which \nprovided a practical means of communication between ships. He also \nsuggested creating the Department of the Navy, a separate Cabinet \nposition from the Secretary of War. This vision was realized in 1798 \nwith the creation of the United States Department of the Navy. Most \nimportantly, Barry was responsible for training many Naval heros of the \nWar of 1812.\n  It is with great honor and pride that I introduce this joint \nresolution, recognizing Commodore John Barry, a fellow Irishman and \nNaval Officer, as the first flag officer of the United States Navy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 49\n\n       Whereas John Barry, American merchant marine captain and \n     native of County Wexford, Ireland, volunteered his services \n     to the Continental Navy and was assigned by the Continental \n     Congress as Captain of the Lexington, taking command of that \n     vessel on March 14, 1776, and soon afterward gave to American \n     liberty its first victory at sea with the capture of the \n     Royal Navy sloop Edward;\n       Whereas Captain John Barry was principally responsible for \n     organizing the crossing of the Delaware River which led \n     directly to General George Washington's victory at Trenton \n     during Christmas 1776, a victory in which Captain Barry also \n     served actively as a combatant;\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n       Whereas Captain John Barry rejected British General Lord \n     Howe's flattering offer to desert Washington and the patriot \n     cause, stating: ``Not the value and command of the whole \n     British fleet can lure me from the cause of my country.'';\n       Whereas Captain John Barry, while in command of the frigate \n     Alliance, successfully transported French gold to America to \n     finance the War for America Independence, and also won the \n     last sea battle of that war by defeating the HMS Sybille on \n     March 10, 1783;\n       Whereas when the First Congress, acting under the new \n     Constitution, authorized the raising and construction of the \n     United States Navy, it was to Captain John Barry that \n     President George Washington turned to build and lead the new \n     nation's infant Navy;\n       Whereas on February 22, 1797, President Washington \n     personally conferred upon Captain John Barry, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, the rank of Captain, with \n     ``Commission No. 1'', United States Navy, dated June 4, 1794;\n       Whereas it was as Commodore of the Navy that John Barry \n     built and first commanded the United States Navy and the \n     squadron which included his flagship the USS United States \n     and USS Constitution (``Old Ironsides'');\n       Whereas John Barry served at the head of the United States \n     Navy (the equivalent of the current position of Chief of \n     Naval Operations), with the title of ``Commodore'' (in \n     official correspondence) under Presidents Washington, Adams, \n     and Jefferson;\n       Whereas Commodore John Barry is recognized, with General \n     Stephen Moylan, in the Statue of Liberty museum as one of the \n     six foreign-born great leaders of the War for Independence;\n       Whereas pursuant to resolutions of Congress, ``Commodore \n     John Barry Day'' was proclaimed for September 13, 1982, by \n     President Reagan and for September 13, 1991, and September \n     13, 1992, by President Bush; and\n       Whereas in recognition of the historic role and \n     achievements of Commodore John Barry, and of the sentiments \n     of Navy and Merchant Marine veterans, of Irish-Americans, and \n     of the patriotic population generally that United States \n     history be properly told and heroes of the United States be \n     properly honored: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Commodore John Barry is recognized (effective as of February \n     22, 1797), and is hereby honored as the first flag officer of \n     the United States Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":
