Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1122, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:.\n\n       A bill (S. 1122) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Stevens (for Grassley) amendment No. 540 to reduce to \n     $500,000 the threshold amount for the applicability of the \n     requirement for advance matching of Department of Defense \n     disbursements to particular obligations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 540\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes of debate relative to the Grassley amendment No. 540 with a \nvote to follow thereon.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I control that 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls the time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not use all of that time for my amendment.\n  First of all, as to the amendment that is pending, authored by the \nSenator from Iowa, I thank the Senator from Alaska for offering my \namendment yesterday, and I thank the Senator from Alaska for asking for \na rollcall vote on my amendment, although this amendment has been \noffered 5 previous years and adopted 5 previous years without a \nrollcall. So, personally, I do not think it is necessary to have a \nrollcall vote. But if the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember of the committee want such a rollcall vote, that is OK with me. \nSo I will take then just a few minutes to speak about my amendment on \nmatching disbursements with obligations.\n  The American taxpayers would take for granted, they would expect, the \nnurturing of their tax dollars to be so well done at the Federal level \nthat Congress would not have to pass a special amendment which would \nsay that the Department of Defense cannot pay out $1 of taxpayers' \nmoney without being able to match it with an invoice and contract that \nspecified what goods or services they were buying. I hope in most of \nGovernment that is the case, but it has not been so with the Defense \nDepartment. In fact, I have been speaking for years on the subject of \nthe tens of billions of dollars that have actually been spent, and at \nthe time of payment, the department failed to match the particular \nservice or goods that are being paid for with their corresponding \ncontract.\n  I have had the support of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in setting in place policies that would gradually reduce the \namount of money that could be paid out without an invoice and contract \nto match. This policy has been incorporated in the last\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nfive appropriations bills--fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and \n1999. We are now working on the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill. \nIt is my understanding that the committee supports the amendment again \nthis year.\n  Under current law, the matching threshold is set at $1 million \neffective this month. This means that the Department of Defense \ndisbursing officials must match each payment of $1 million or more with \na corresponding obligation or contract before the payment is made. My \npending amendment would continue the process of ratcheting down the \nthreshold began 5 years ago. It would lower the threshold then from the \n$1 million in present law to $500,000. Reports of the General \nAccounting Office and inspectors general consistently show that this \npolicy is helping to reduce DOD's unmatched disbursement problems. As I \nunderstand it, the DOD has lowered the threshold to zero in most \ndisbursing centers.\n  I thank the Department of Defense for having adopted a policy that \nevery taxpayer would assume is a principle of good Government \nmanagement, and that is that they would not pay out one penny without \nbeing able to show what they ordered and received for that penny. That \nhas become a policy at some of the disbursing centers but not at all \nthe centers. So we want to see the threshold lowered to zero at all \nlocations because we think it is just sound business management that \nnot one penny of the taxpayers' dollars should be paid out if there is \nnot an invoice and contract for what has been bought and received, \neither goods or services, for that amount of money.\n  So we are not quite at zero all over the country with all of the \ncenters. Some Department of Defense disbursing centers still have \nproblems. This amendment will help keep the pressure on and hopefully \nin time will help the Department of Defense eliminate in the future all \nunmatched disbursements, so that the Senator from Iowa will never have \nto come to the Senate floor again and say we have these billions of \ndollars that the Pentagon paid out and they have never been able to \nshow exactly what they ordered and received.\n  If the threshold specified in this amendment is unworkable, then I \nhave asked the chairman to adjust the dollar level in conference, but I \nhope it is so obvious that we will be able to tell the taxpayers of \nthis country that we know what they are buying; that at least for the \nnext year we should keep the pressure on for the still fantastically \nhigh level of $500,000 that could be paid out under certain \ncircumstances without the invoice and contract immediately available.\n  I do not want to stand before the Senate and be embarrassed by saying \nthat we can somehow justify even a $500,000 check being written without \nknowing what goods and services were, in fact, ordered and received and \nbeing paid for.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Stevens, and I thank \nthe ranking minority member, Senator Inouye, for their continuing \nsupport of this amendment. Every year for the last 5 years I have \noffered this amendment, and every year for the last 5 years they have \nput the amendment in the bill, kept it there and protected it in \nconference. This effort, particularly with their respected leadership \nin the area of defense, is very positive toward the Department of \nDefense changing their attitude about unmatched disbursements and \nleading us to a point where we are reducing the amount of unmatched \ndisbursements.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their unwavering support, \nand I hope all my colleagues will support this simple but important \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  I have time left over, and if the Senator from Alaska wants some of \nmy time, he can have it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes.\n  I was pleased to offer this amendment for my good friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley. Senator Grassley's determined effort to improve the \nDepartment of Defense financial accounting standards, by demanding that \nfunds disbursed are matched by funds obligated--simply meaning that \nthey balance their checkbook and they let us know so the taxpayers will \nknow what the checks have been written for--his efforts has already \nyielded results in lowering the Department's unmatched disbursements.\n  To those who may be unfamiliar with this problem, as of the fiscal \nyear 1998, according to the Department's own inspector general, the \nDepartment reported a substantial problem with disbursements. That \nmeans that funds were reported having been disbursed to the Treasury \nbut not processed, or, in other cases, the Department's employees could \nnot match a disbursement to an obligated item.\n  There is a conflict here. We are trying to make certain those who \nprovide services to the Department of Defense are promptly paid. On the \nother hand, there is a requirement for the taxpayers that we know what \nthey have paid and what we have bought with the funds, as the Senator \nsaid.\n  The Appropriations Committee is pleased to work with Senator Grassley \nand the Department of Defense to ensure the Department makes steady \nprogress in reducing these problem disbursements. I do support the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa, and I believe all Senators seek to \nimprove the Department's control over the appropriation of taxpayers' \nfunds to the Department of Defense.\n  What time will the vote take place, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I remind Senators that first-degree amendments to this \nbill must be offered by 2:30 p.m. Additional amendments and votes are \nexpected through today's session. My colleague and I are working on a \npackage of amendments which we will submit as soon as this time has \nexpired and this amendment has been voted upon. At least we will \ndiscuss this package. It is my hope we will be able to finish this bill \ntoday. I am going to work to achieve that goal.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii wish to make any comments on this \namendment?\n  Mr. INOUYE. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what time is the vote scheduled to take \nplace?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 9:45.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n540. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nGrams) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

PROHIBITION ON USE OF REFUGEE RELIEF FUNDS FOR LONG-\n                   TERM REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR RECONSTRUCTION IN \n                   SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE.\n\n       None of the funds made available in the 1999 Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act (Public Law 106-31) for \n     emergency support of refugees and displaced persons and the \n     local communities directly affected by the influx of refugees \n     may be made available to implement a long-term, regional \n     program of development or reconstruction in Southeastern \n     Europe except pursuant to specific statutory authorization \n     enacted on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment, which I will \nagree to have set aside whenever the chairman decides to do so, is to \naddress the issue of the reconstruction of Kosovo and funds that might \nbe spent in Kosovo for reconstruction. The concept of reconstruction, \nof course, is something that is going to have to be dealt with by the \nCongress and the President over the next few months, no matter what \nhappens relative to the air war.\n  One of the concerns I have, and I think many Americans have, is that \nAmerica will end up paying a disproportionate cost of the \nreconstruction of Kosovo and potentially Yugoslavia. It is my opinion \nthat no American funds should be spent for the reconstruction of \nYugoslavia until Milosevic is removed as its leader.\n  It is further my view that America's participation in the cost of \nlong-term reconstruction of Kosovo should be extremely limited, that \nour cost should be minor, a fraction of the amount of the cost of \nreconstruction, and that the vast majority of the burden of \nreconstruction should be borne by the European nations.\n  As a nation, the United States has borne a disproportionate amount of \nthe cost of the war that has gone on in Yugoslavia. It is, after all, a \nEuropean issue more than an American issue. The United States had no \nnational strategic interest in this part of the world. Not until the \nhundreds of thousands of refugees were created did we really have any \nsignificant interest at all in this part of the world; the refugees, of \ncourse, being a function of part of the diplomacy of this \nadministration, which, in my opinion, has been a gross blunder in this \nregion of the world.\n  In any event, this is a European issue which should be addressed by \nthe European nations. Certainly, the reconstruction issue is a European \nissue which should be addressed by the European nations, and American \ntaxpayers should not be asked to bear the cost of it.\n  What my amendment does is simply state that the emergency \nappropriations, which we eventually pass for purposes of fighting the \nwar in Kosovo, will be limited in their application so they cannot be \nused for long-term structural reform of the economy or the capital \nneeds of Kosovo, without the President coming to Congress and \nrequesting those funds be used in that way and without him putting \nforward a strategic plan which reflects how much it is going to cost us \nas a nation to reconstruct the Kosovo infrastructure. Until we receive \nthat plan and it is approved by the Congress, these funds would not be \nmade available for that sort of effort.\n  It does not limit these funds being used for humanitarian purposes. \nIt does not limit these funds being used for the immediate needs of our \nown military, should our own military be interjected into Kosovo for \nsome reason. It does not limit the funds being used for things such as \nreplacing wells and getting people back in their homes with electricity \ntemporarily.\n  What it does limit is any long-term attempt to rebuild Kosovo's \ninfrastructure, which would be part of an overall plan for \nreconstruction, without us first getting such a plan and knowing\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\nhow much it is going to cost the American taxpayers. I do think the \nadministration has an obligation to be honest with the taxpayers and \ntell us exactly what they are really thinking we are going to have to \npay in terms of costs.\n\n  I have read news reports coming out of the European Union that \nsuggested the European Union position is that the U.S. taxpayer should \npay for half of the cost of the reconstruction of Kosovo. To me, that \nwould be unacceptable. I have read other news reports from folks who \nwork for our agencies saying the United States may be willing to pay up \nto 25 percent of the long-term cost of the reconstruction of Kosovo. We \nare talking about, potentially, 5, 10, 15 years, with significant \ncapital expenditures in that region of the world, and 25 percent would \nbe a huge number.\n  If that is the administration's position, we need to know what that \nnumber is before we start down that road. This amendment is a minor \nattempt to keep us from starting down that road and to get the \nadministration to be forthright as to what are these costs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will discuss this matter later, but I \nwill say that the Senator's amendment is consistent with my \nunderstanding of the purposes for which we passed the 1999 \nsupplemental. The moneys in that supplemental were for assistance to \nthe refugees and for conducting the air war. It is my understanding \nthat there was no money for the ground war, no money for the subsequent \nforce--whatever it may be--that follows after the cessation of \nhostilities in that area. As the Senator stated, it would be for the \nlong-term reconstruction and not for the temporary things that might be \ndone to assist the Kosovo refugees to go back to their former homes. I \nthink that will be probably something that will have to have money \nimmediately, once we have a cessation of hostilities, which I pray will \nbe very soon.\n  I think this ought to be a marker that we put down that we want to \nsee how these costs are going to be met in this area after the \nhostilities cease. The economy of the European Union now is greater \nthan ours. Their employment picture is even better than ours. I don't \nsee any reason why there should be an assumption that we will carry on \nat the past level of expenditures. There is no question that the \nexpenditures made in the war so far are overwhelmingly U.S. \nexpenditures. I do not deny the participation of the NATO allies in the \nactivities, but their costs are infinitesimal compared to ours when you \nview the long line that our supplies have to follow to get there and \nthe cost of maintaining our forces there as compared to those who go \nhome every night, in terms of the participants from the European Union.\n  I hope the Senate will take a very careful look at the Senator's \nsuggestion. I want to make sure that it does not impede the activities \nof our forces to really provide for their own protection, as well as \nthe facilities that will be needed by our people if they move into the \narea immediately after the cessation of hostilities. But I do think \nwhen we get to a long-range concept, a new Marshall Plan for this area, \nit is something that the Congress must be involved in, and the \ntaxpayers must know what our share is going to be before we commence \nsuch activities.\n  I urge the Senator to lay his amendment aside.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe my amendment is in sync with the \nopinions expressed by the chairman. I ask that my amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Of the funds appropriated in title III under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'', $51,250,000 shall be \n     available for the Information System Security Program, of \n     which $10,000,000 shall be available for an immediate \n     assessment of biometrics sensors and templates repository \n     requirements and for combining and consolidating biometrics \n     security technology and other information assurance \n     technologies to accomplish a more focused and effective \n     information assurance effort.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Department of Defense operates over two million separate \ncomputers and 25,000 distinct computer systems to conduct its mission. \nThese computer systems are integral parts of a wide variety of \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) programs. Many of these programs are \ncritical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence \nmissions; but other vital activities also affected include command and \ncontrol, satellites, inventory and transportation management, medical \nequipment, payment of checks, and personnel records.\n  The Department is now becoming aware that attacks on these systems \nmay be capable of significantly affecting our military power, just as \nsurely as a direct physical assault. Experience with ``hackers'' and \nDOD exercises indicate that defense systems, often globally-linked and \nreadily-accessed, are vulnerable to unauthorized penetration of their \ninformation networks. Newspapers have been filled with reports in \nrecent days about ``hackers'' attacking the web sites of the FBI, the \nWhite House, the Department of Interior, and even the Senate.\n  For example, I am told that by using unsophisticated ``hacker \ntools,'' intruders are able to crack systems passwords, establish \nsuper-user status (network control), search for and turn on microphones \nor cameras on personal computers connected to the installation campus \narea network. Hackers may then capture intra-office conversations and \nlive video and download it to their computers. A simple test of the \nmicrophone sensitivity revealed low-level conversations were easily \nheard from roughly thirty feet away. This is particulary critical in \nareas where classified and sensitive information is stored and \ndiscussed.\n  The compelling need for controlling access to our Nation's vital \ninformation networks through computers becomes immediately evident when \none considers just one battlefield scenario--the possibility that one \nof our important command and control outposts on the ground is overrun \nby hostile forces. Just imagine what leverage that would provide to a \ncomputer-sophisticated enemy. And, I am told that the Department has \nlearned from its experience in Kosovo that this kind of a threat is not \nlimited to major world powers.\n  At the present time, the basic process the Department relies upon to \nprotect its computer systems are some kind of card and/or passwords \nincluding random characters. Users often are required to have several \nsuch cards or passwords in connection with their work. This approach to \ninformation security has some serious drawbacks for the long run. \nPasswords can be forgotten, shared, or observed, and cards can\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nbe lost, stolen, or duplicated. Moreover, as the need for even more \nsecurity grows with advancing technology, the situation will become \nmore cumbersome and less effective. On the other hand, more \nsophisticated means are expected to become available to make unwanted \nintrusions, necessitating even more complex password and card systems.\n  There is an emerging technology available to the Department that \npromises to provide a more effective information security system, and \nthat is biometrics. Almost everyone is familiar with fingerprints. \nFingerprints are a biometric signature. Others are voice, face \nrecognition, the iris of the eye, and keystroke dynamics or typing \npatterns; and I understand there are others as well. With this \napproach, access to a particular computer or network of computers is \ncontrolled by comparing one or several biometric signatures of the \nperson asking to use the machine, with a template on file in a central \nlocation that contains the biometric identification of the authorized \nuser of that computer. There is no card. There is no password. The test \nis whether the potential user is who he or she claims to be. The system \nauthenticates a claimed identity from previously enrolled patterns or \ndistinguishable traits. I understand that in the commercial world there \nare some examples of biometric identification already in use. Some ATM \nmachines, for instance, now rely on iris signatures to permit access \nrather than the familiar card we all carry.\n  The Army has a particular interest in developing an effective control \nover the access to its information systems through computers, because \nof the far flung nature of its forces, and because its battle systems \nare becoming increasingly dependent on information networks.\n  This bill already includes $5.0 million in the Other Procurement, \nArmy, appropriation for an initial biometrics computer information \nassurance system prototype project. I understand that the Army has \nexhibited strong leadership in the exploration and development of \ntechnologies in the biometrics arena, and is a natural leading \ncandidate to be considered as the executive agent in this work for the \nDepartment of Defense and perhaps the federal government. The amendment \nI am offering is intended to respond to the immediacy of the critical \ninformation assurance requirement of the Army, and to build on the \nArmy's leadership role in biometrics technology. The amendment also \nbuilds on the biometrics prototype project to explore a more focused \nand synergistic effort to develop information assurance technology. \nFinally, it also builds on and anticipates a working relationship with \nthe Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI, which \nhouses and operates the world's finest single biometric data base--\nfingerprints. Specifically, my amendment provides an additional $10.0 \nmillion for an immediate assessment of biometrics sensors and templates \nrepository requirements, and for combining and consolidating biometrics \nsecurity technology and other information assurance technologies to \naccomplish a more focused and effective information assurance effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments will be laid aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not going to offer an amendment to \nthis bill. In fact, I am a member of the subcommittee and I commend the \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, for their leadership and work on this legislation. I am pleased \nto work with them on a range of issues that deal with the defense of \nthis country and with the strengthening of the Armed Forces. I think \nthey do an excellent job.\n  There is one area--and not just on this legislation--of the policy \ndebate in Congress I wanted to mention during the discussion on \nfunding, and that is the area of national missile defense. I do have \nsome concerns about the policy and direction of national missile \ndefense. I wanted to express them now because I think this is the \nappropriate place.\n  I don't quarrel with the question of research for national missile \ndefense. We have been involved in a robust research program on missile \ndefense. Hopefully, that research, at some point, will bear fruit \nsufficient that if a threat exists that would persuade us to deploy, we \nwould deploy a national missile defense system that is a workable \nsystem and one that provides real and significant protection to our \ncountry.\n  Last week--I think perhaps it was a week ago tomorrow--I was driving \non a road up in far northeastern North Dakota. I looked to my left and \nI saw this huge concrete structure. It is, of course, the only \nantiballistic missile system that was ever built in the free world. It \nwas built in the late 1960s, early 1970s. It was built in Nekoma, ND, \nup in the northeastern corner of our State. The very month it was \ndeclared operational it was also mothballed. Apparently, in today's \ndollars, somewhere around $20 billion was spent. We still have the \nmassive quantities of concrete poured into a building that looks very \nmuch like a modern-day pyramid up in the vast reaches of northeastern \nNorth Dakota. That is a legacy, I suppose, to the taxpayers who say \nsometimes you can have a very expensive program that doesn't turn out \nquite the way you expected. Some will say, well, that program was just \nfine; it was a bargaining chip in arms control, and it was mothballed \nthe very month it was declared operational because that was part of the \nstrategic calculation of our country. Of course, that is not the case.\n  I want to talk for a moment about the range of threats against our \ncountry. One of those threats is the threat of a terrorist nation, or \nan adversary, acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and \naffixing to the top of this missile a nuclear warhead and then firing \nthat missile at the United States of America. If that should happen, do \nwe want to have in place a national missile defense system to intercept \nit? Of course. The answer is yes, of course.\n  What are the likely threats? I mentioned an intercontinental \nballistic missile being acquired by a terrorist nation. But, it is far \nmore likely that it would not be an intercontinental ballistic missile \nbut a cruise missile; they are much more widely dispersed, and it would \nbe much more easily acquired. That cruise missile would travel 500 feet \nabove the ground, at 500 or 600 miles an hour, and would be launched \nfrom a barge, or a submarine, or a plane just off our shores. That is \nnot going to be intercepted by a national missile defense system.\n  Some say we are working on theater defense that will intercept cruise \nmissiles. Yes, but that theater defense isn't part of what is going to \nprotect the perimeter of our country. It is far more likely that a \nterrorist nation would acquire a cruise missile. Is there a defense \nsystem against a cruise missile?\n  It is far more likely a terrorist nation would, in fact, terrorize \nour country with a deadly vial of biological or chemical weapons that \ncould cause the kind of chaos that nearly occurred in Japan a couple of \nyears ago, where the right kind of deadly biological agents can kill \nthousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million people. It is far \nmore likely that a major U.S. city would be threatened by a suitcase \nbomb placed in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car on a New York City dock by \na terrorist nation. That is far more likely than them acquiring a \nsophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  The potential, for example, of an adversary such as Russia, which has \nsubstantial nuclear might, accidentally launching tubes full of \nmissiles from a Russian submarine would not be defeated by the national \nmissile defense system we are talking about because the system being \ndiscussed could only potentially defeat a handful of missiles, not an \naccidental launch of all the tubes of a Russian submarine. Only a \nhandful of missiles could be intercepted by the missile defense system \nthat is currently under discussion. That doesn't suggest that we ought \nnot consider it. But the question I ask is this: Consideration at what \nprice and with what other consequences?\n\n  First, as we begin to make decisions about a national missile defense \nsystem, I don't think we ought to just throw money at the system. I \nthink some who have an appetite for it say\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nwe should just keep pouring money in there and somehow a system will \nemerge that will protect our country. I think that would lead to a \ngreat deal of waste.\n  Second, the debate we have about deploying a national missile defense \nsystem, as soon as technologically possible or feasible, is a debate \nthat worries me, because it seems to suggest all of the consequences \nare less important and all of the consequences should be set aside.\n  What are those other consequences? One is a program we now have under \nway with Russia in which we actually saw the wings off Russian bombers. \nWe actually remove Russian missiles from their silos and remove the \nwarheads from the missile. We are reducing in a dramatic way the number \nof missiles and bombers and the capabilities of delivering warheads \naimed at this country.\n  I have in this desk drawer a little vial which, with the consent of \nthe Presiding Officer, I will show. This little vial of material is \nwiring that was ground up. It is from a Russian submarine that carried \nmissiles aimed at the United States. That submarine is reduced to small \npieces of metal. It is cut up. It doesn't exist anymore. I have some of \nthe wiring right here.\n  How do we acquire the wiring of a Russian ballistic missile \nsubmarine? You could shoot it and destroy it. That is one way. Or, the \nother way is with an agreement between ourselves and the Russians to \nreduce weapons of mass destruction and the delivery capabilities of \neach side. We have seen submarines and bombers and nuclear warheads \nbeing systematically reduced in a very aggressive way.\n  That is exactly what is happening here. That happens through the \nNunn-Lugar funds that are offered in this kind of legislation. It is a \nvery important program. It has been remarkably successful. I do not \nwant to, by what we are doing in other areas, jeopardize that kind of \narms reduction and arms control.\n  One other point, Mr. President: It is true that this is an \nincreasingly difficult and dangerous world. North Korea is testing \nmedium-range missiles. Iran is testing medium-range missiles. Pakistan \nand India do not like each other, and they exploded nuclear weapons \nright under each other's nose. It is a difficult and dangerous world.\n  I support research on missile defense. But I do not support efforts \nthat would say let us demand deployment of any system as soon as \ntechnologically feasible, even if it is at the expense of injuring \nother efforts to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or to \neliminate delivery systems of nuclear weapons under current arms \ncontrol regimes.\n  Some say the ABM Treaty is for a country that no longer exists, the \nold Soviet Union; don't worry about it; ignore it.\n  The fact is that we have made significant progress under our arms \ncontrol agreements. I think we need to be very careful as we proceed \ndown this road not to do one thing at the expense of others that we \nknow will work.\n  I only wanted to say again that the national missile defense program \nis one that I have provided support for by substantial amounts of \nresearch. I do worry sometimes that the amount of money offered is \nexceeding the amount of money the system is capable of using \neffectively. It is a difficult technology to hit a bullet with a bullet \nat intercontinental missile speeds. Some of my colleagues make the \npoint that it is not one program, it is many programs in a seamless \ntransition of dealing with suppression of missile threats in the \ntheater, and also dealing with intercontinental ballistic missile \nthreats.\n\n  It is true that these programs represent a number of different kinds \nof programs. But the largest of them is the national missile defense \nprogram, commonly referred to as that, which would be deployed to \ndefend against an intercontinental ballistic missile. Representing a \nState that has housed the only ABM or national missile defense program \nthat was ever built in the Free World, I have some acquaintance with \nit.\n  It is my hope that when and if this country deploys a system in the \nfuture, it not be done at the expense of arms control reductions that \nexist in other arms control agreements. That we not decide to focus so \nmuch on this issue that we do so at the expense of the nonproliferation \nefforts this country ought to have as job one. We ought to worry very \nmuch every day and in every way about efforts to prevent the \nproliferation and spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I think there is a lot of evidence out there about which we need to \nbe very concerned. Frankly, I think it has taken a back seat in recent \nyears. I think it has taken a back seat in Congress and a back seat in \nthe administration. I don't think we have had nearly as much effort as \nI would feel comfortable with to try to combat the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  There are not too many countries that have nuclear weapons at this \npoint, but many countries want to acquire them. There is a black market \nin the weapons material and production of nuclear weapons. As all of \nthose countries are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding nuclear weapons, I hope, as we discuss all of these issues, \nour country will understand that to prevent proliferation of these \nweapons, we should not just discuss national missile defense in a way \nthat says it is more important than any other area. If we are to build \na safer future for ourselves and our children, it must be a priority \nfor us to say that the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the \nworld is a very serious problem that this country ought to pay serious \nattention to, and it ought to command a substantial amount of our time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was very surprised and disappointed to \nfind that during our recess when we were not here, the President made a \nvery controversial appointment of James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to \nLuxembourg. I believe it is something that should not be done. In fact, \nwhen I think of procedures, I look to a man I admire so much, Senator \nBob Byrd from West Virginia.\n  During a recess in 1985, President Reagan made several appointments.\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n Senator Byrd said: The recess appointment power should not be used \nsimply to avoid controversy or to circumvent the constitutional power \nand responsibility of the Senate. In several cases, Reagan's recess \nappointments avoided serious and probing debate by the Senate on \ncontroversial issues. There is no evidence that the needs of government \nrequired any of these appointments to be made as recess appointments.\n  Then Senator Byrd went on to give the history, as he always does in \nhis very eloquent style, as to how the Constitution does provide for \nemergencies, for such things as appointments back in the 1800s when \npeople were traveling and unable to get here or when something \nstrategic is pending. In the case of James Hormel, certainly there is \nnot anything strategic pending.\n  For that reason, I am serving official notice today that I am going \nto do the same thing Senator Byrd did back in 1985: I am putting holds \non every single Presidential nomination.\n  In the case of James Hormel, it is a little confusing to a lot of \npeople as to why he became controversial. Yes, he is gay. That is not \nthe reason for people opposing him. It is the fact that he is a gay \nactivist who puts his agenda ahead of the agenda of America.\n  I can recall when he made the statement when first nominated by the \nPresident: I wish the President had nominated me to be Ambassador to \nNorway, because if they have something on the ballot--same-sex \nmarriages or something like that--I might be able to influence it.\n  That, to me, demonstrated very clearly that he wanted to use this \nposition to advance his own agenda and not the agenda of America.\n  I hasten to say, I would have the same feelings about any other \nappointment on any other issue. If David Duke were appointed and came \nto the conclusion he was going to use his militia interests as his \nmotivation and his agenda more than America's agenda, I certainly would \noppose that nomination in the same way. Notice is hereby served.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 592 through 601) were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider that action.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time has \nnow arrived when no more first degree amendments will be cleared to be \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I inquire from the Senator from Arizona if he wishes to \naddress the Senate at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 584\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment restores $3.1 billion in \noperations and maintenance and procurement funding that is cut by \nsection 108 of the bill. It reduces various accounts to eliminate \nfunding for low-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending by an equal \namount. The amendment doesn't change the total amount for defense in \nthis bill. It simply redirects the cuts to eliminate pork barrel \nspending rather than high-priority readiness and modernization funds.\n  I find it staggering that the committee would cut funding for \nreadiness and modernization by $3.1 billion when this bill contains \nnearly $5 billion in spending for unrequested, low-priority, \nunnecessary and wasteful spending programs that have not been \nscrutinized in the normal merit-based review process.\n  Congress recently passed an emergency spending bill that contained \nnearly $11 billion in defense spending to pay for the costs of ongoing \noperations in Kosovo. I believe the administration request was around \n$5 billion. As the chairman of the committee stated on the floor \nyesterday, we will very likely need to act later this year on another \nsupplemental bill to pay for continued offensive operations against \nSerbia or to enforce a peace agreement and protect the Kosovars who \nreturn home.\n  Why, then, would we want to cut funding from this bill that would be \nneeded to carry out these operations into the next fiscal year?\n  Why wouldn't we instead cut some of the $5 billion in pork barrel \nspending that has been put in this bill principally for the benefit of \nMembers and their constituents?\n  Here is the list of unrequested programs included in the bill that I \nhave accumulated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list of unrequested and unwanted \nprojects be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n    Department of Defense appropriation bill for fiscal year 2000, \n                        objectionable provisions\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\nArmy\nFort Wainwright utilidors........................................... $7\nAir Battle Captain Helo.

Mr. President, it totals $5 billion. Self-restraint in \nfiduciary matters is a virtue, especially for a party that rose to \nmajority status with the promise of reducing this type of practice.\n  But every year it is the same old story: More money for NULKA \nantiship decoy systems; more money for the plethora of laser projects \nthat have proliferated at every lab in the country; more money for \nunrequested and unneeded aircraft; more money for automatic grenade \nlaunchers--we have got to have a stockpile of these things that will \nlast forever--more money for research into double-hull technology, \nwhich shipbuilders are supposed to provide themselves per the \nrequirements of the Oil Pollution Prevention Act.\n  There are millions every year for hyperspectral research that is not \nrequested by the military. Earmarks like the one that requires the Army \nand Marine Corps to make the Rock Island arsenal the center of all \nfuture design, development and production activities related to \nartillery do not represent good public policy. What is it that forces \nus to designate Rock Island arsenal as a center for this? That's not \npublic policy.\n  Medical research and environmental matters unrelated to combat ought \nto be carefully scrutinized when funded in the defense budget. We do \njust the opposite: we use the defense budget to fund pet projects that \nshould be funded through nondefense agencies in nondefense spending \nbills. Osteoporosis is a serious problem, but in the defense budget? $3 \nmillion to fund phyto-remediation research and arid lands? In the \ndefense budget? How can we take ourselves seriously--how can the public \ntake us seriously, when we demonstrate absolutely no willingness to \ncurtail the very spending practices that put this country so heavily in \ndebt?\n  At the very time a consensus has formed around the proposition that \nthe armed forces are being stretched perilously thin, a situation that \nwill get worse when we send more than a brigade's worth of ground \nforces into Kosovo, it is incumbent upon those of us elected to \nrepresent the interests of the nation that we act with a modicum of \nself-restraint where the public treasure is concerned. Failing to do so \nwill not only damage the treasure, it will most assuredly cost lives. \nThis is, after all, national defense.\n  Let's review some recent examples of readiness shortcomings, \nshortcomings that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have repeatedly emphasized \npose a serious threat to both near and long-term readiness:\n  The nuclear carrier U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN-65) recently deployed to \nthe Persian Gulf and Kosovo, undermanned by some 800 sailors.\n  We are losing pilots to the commercial airlines faster than we can \ntrain them.\n  The Navy has one-half the F/A-18 pilots, one-third of the S-3 pilots, \nand only one-quarter of the EA-6B pilots it needs.\n  Only 26 percent of the Air Force pilots have committed to stay beyond \ntheir current service agreement.\n  The Army says that five of its ten divisions lack enough majors, \ncaptains, senior enlisted personnel, tankers and gunners.\n  Again, the world watches as the Air Force's main bomber, the B-52, \nonce again is called to duty to delivery air launched cruise missiles \nin combat. How many times has the Air Force called upon this 40-year \nold workhorse to deliver devastating firepower? The B-52 bomber was \nalready old when I saw it fly in Vietnam, and yet the Air Force plan \nwill carry the current bomber fleet through the next 40 years, with a \nreplacement to the B-52 tentatively planned in 2037.\n  The Navy is struggling to maintain a fleet of 300 ships, down from \nover 500 in the early 1990s. The fiscal year 2000 budget will not \nsupport a Navy of even 200 ships.\n  The Marine Corps saves money in spare parts by retreading light \ntrucks and Humvees, so as to afford small arms ammunition for forward \ndeployed Marines.\n  Mr. President, the cumulative effect of these types of readiness \nproblems will most assuredly translate into higher risks for the young \nmen and women we send into harm's way to defend us and our country.\n  Mr. President, I understand what is going on here. We have a problem, \nand that is the existence of stringent budget caps designed to keep \ngovernment spending in check. I support those who are resisting the \nurge to bust the budget by exceeding the spending allowed by the 1997 \nbudget agreement.\n  I also understand that the Appropriations Committee has to balance \nthe interests of those who favor domestic spending over defense \nspending, and I realize that compromises have to be made.\n  But we shouldn't be stuffing appropriations bills, defense or \notherwise, full of pork-barrel spending. And we shouldn't be cutting \ndefense, like this bill does, to set aside money to cover the excess \npork-barrel spending that will inevitably show up in other domestic \nappropriations bills later in the process.\n  And I would just like to make the point that the money that was taken \nfrom this bill for later pork-barrel spending could just as easily be \nreallocated back into this bill, when this amendment is adopted.\n  We shouldn't be jeopardizing the readiness of our Armed Forces by \ncutting high-priority funding just to stay within the budget caps. We \nshould do the right thing, and cut the pork instead of potentially \nputting our men and women in harm's way without the training and tools \nthey need to defend themselves and our nation.\n  I was going through this list here. Some of them are interesting and \nsome are amusing:\n  Under Defense Health Program is $1.4 billion for the Alaska Federal \nHealth Care Partnership; Tri-Service Nursing Research Program, $6 \nmillion--remember, this is out of Defense. I don't even know where the \nTri-Service Nursing Research Program is. Then there is Pacific Island \nHealth Care, $5 million; brown tree snakes--the perennial tree snakes--\nis only a million dollars this year. I would have thought that with all \nthe millions and millions we have spent on brown tree snakes over the \npast years, we would have at least been able to defend a nation from \nthem. Unfortunately, the spending for brown tree snakes continues, and \nprobably will for a long time--at least in my lifetime.\n  Outcome Driven Health Care and Info Systems, $6 million; Breast \nCancer Research Program, $175 million; Prostate Cancer Research \nProgram, $75 million; Acute lung injury, advanced soft tissue modeling, \net cetera, et cetera, $50 million. Then, of course, we have the usual \nprotections in this legislation that requires us to ``buy American'' \nanchor chains, carbon, alloy, or armor steel plate, and ball and roller \nbearings. We have to buy American for computers this time. That is \ninteresting. We have to buy American coal for municipal\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\ndistrict heat in Germany. Talk about the old line about bringing coal \nto New Castle. Then, of course, we have to buy American food, specialty \nmetals, hand tools, measuring tools, clothing and fabrics.\n  Then we have Ship Depot Operation Support at the Philadelphia Naval \nShipyard, $23 million. I am very curious about that expenditure up in \nPhiladelphia, which was supposed to be opened and going to be in \nprivate hands. Barrow landfill, $3 million; Professional Development/\nEducation Asia Pacific Center, $1.7 million. I wonder whose profession \nis being developed there. Let's see. The list goes on.\n  I think I have made my point, as usual. Here is Counternarcotics \nCenter at Hammer. Since I don't know where Hammer is, I probably should \nnot comment on it. The list goes on. Here is one the military didn't \nrequest: A smart truck initiative. Perhaps we will have trucks that gas \nthemselves, because $3.5 million is a pretty hefty sum to spend on \nsmart trucks.\n  Here is Plasma Energy Pyrolysis system and Phyto-remediation in Arid \nLands. Not to mention one of our important defense items, Texas \nRegional Institute for Environmental Studies. Then there is the \nUniversity Partnering for Operations Support and Cold Regions R\n  The list goes on. The point is that we now have 11,000 enlisted \nfamilies that are on food stamps. We now have a shortage of air launch \ncruise missiles, which everybody knows about. We now have an incredible \nincrease in the wear and tear of our equipment because of the \ndramatically increased operations regarding Kosovo. What do we do? We \nthink that we spend the money the military needs for modernization and \noperations and maintenance? No, Mr. President. We spend $5 billion in \nunnecessary and unwanted things, which is up, by the way, from the \nsupplemental. I think I only identified a little over $2 billion that \nwas in the ``emergency'' supplemental, such as Dungeness crab \nfishermen, reindeer, and other ``vital emergencies'' that required our \nimmediate attention.\n  So, I have very little confidence that this amendment will carry. I \nthink it is important, however, that the American people know where \ntheir tax dollars are going, and sooner or later--perhaps later--they \nwill demand that we stop doing this with their hard-earned tax dollars. \nIt may be later, as I say. But I also have to say to my dear friends on \nthe Appropriations Committee, I see increases in this kind of wasteful \nand unnecessary spending, not decreases. There is going to have to come \na point where we are going to have to start having recorded votes on \nall this stuff. I am worried about brown tree snakes like everybody \nelse, but I am much more worried about the men and women in the \nmilitary who happen to be subsisting on food stamps today. I think a \nlot of Americans are growing rather weary of this procedure.\n\n  Mr. President, I will be glad to have a tabling motion vote or an up-\nor-down vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regretfully must oppose Senator \nMcCain's amendment. I understand the amendment, but it takes a \ndifferent approach to funding critical Department of Defense priorities \nfor fiscal year 2000 than the committee has approved in this bill \nbefore the Senate.\n  Based upon the amounts that we provided in the fiscal year 1999 \nemergency supplemental appropriations for Kosovo and funds that were \nremaining from the 1999 supplemental for Bosnia, the committee \ndetermined--and I add that it was at my request--that at least $3.1 \nbillion now available to the Department of Defense can and should be \ncarried over to the year 2000. As a matter of fact, on the floor of the \nSenate I stated that our intent was to try and take care of some of the \nyear 2000 obligations in that supplemental to best reflect the needs of \nthe Department and the pressures across the discretionary accounts \nunder the 1997 budget agreement.\n  Our committee adjusted the totals in this bill to reflect those \nspecific amounts that carry over from the 1999 appropriation into the \nyear 2000. Having done so, having brought $3.1 billion more into this \naccount, we then removed some of the moneys that we previously \nallocated to the account into the nondefense area. The discretion to do \nthat gave us the ability to meet critical needs in the nondefense area.\n  We believe that we did address critical readiness problems in the \nsupplemental, and we specifically anticipated some of those needs which \ncould possibly have been incurred--the costs incurred--before September \n30th of this year. Those now appear to be funds that will be required \nin the year 2000, and we have met those demands by moving forward with \nthe money.\n  I know this has caused some anxiety to people within the Department \nof Defense who believe that we have cut the bill. We have not cut the \nbill. The bill is exactly the same amount of money originally under \nconsideration by the committee, but we have found the moneys to pay \nthose bills by carrying forward into the year 2000 some of the 1999 \nappropriations.\n\n  We believe we have met the needs of the military under this bill. The \namendment of the Senator from Arizona strikes from the bill $3.1 \nbillion, rather than carry forward with the money from 1999. I think \nthat will have a detrimental impact on the priorities established by \nthe committee and the priorities that some Members have presented not \nonly in committee but on the floor.\n  For instance, the Senator's amendment would reduce nearly $270 \nmillion from the service operation and maintenance accounts, including \n$53.5 million from the Army National Guard alone. In procurement, the \namendment pending would reduce or eliminate funding provided to replace \nthe aging UH-1, the Huey helicopters, built in the 1960s, with the \nArmy's modern standard, the UH-60 Blackhawk.\n  The amendment reduces funding for advance procurement of one of the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps' top priorities, the LHD-8 amphibious \nassault ship.\n  For the Air Force, funding for additional F-16, EC-130J and JStars \naircraft would be deleted.\n  In research and development, funds added for the SBIRS satellite, \nnational missile defense and the third arrow battery for Israel would \nbe reduced.\n  For the Defense Health Program, the additional amounts provided for \nbreast cancer research and prostate cancer research would be cut also \nby the Senator's amendment.\n  In response to Members' requests that the committee provide \nadditional funds to fight the war on drugs, the committee did add \nfunding for the gulf states counterdrug initiative, the National Guard \ncounterdrug missions, and $50 million in response to the proposed Drug \nFree Century Act. Senator McCain's amendment would delete $61.6 million \nof the funds added to the bill for those efforts.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I have discussed on many occasions that \nwe do have different approaches to addressing the funding needs for the \nArmed Forces. I know Senator McCain is a stalwart proponent of the men \nand women of the armed services and their families, and I believe I am \nalso. We are just approaching the job from a different direction.\n  I believe that I must, on behalf of the committee, oppose the \namendment. I truly believe the flexibility provided by the committee to \nthe Department of Defense best accommodates the needs of the military, \nand ensures that funds are available in the accounts where necessary to \naccommodate readiness, quality of life, modernization and technology \npriorities. I can state categorically the accounts that are here to \naccommodate readiness, quality of life, modernization and technology \npriorities of the Department of Defense have been met by our bill.\n\n  The Senator mentioned some of the items in this bill that affect my \nState. The Point Barrow landfill was created by the Department of the \nNavy. It operated in Point Barrow for many, many years. As that \ninstallation was closed down, the Department of Navy did not remediate \nthe landfill. It is a terrible problem in the Arctic, particularly in \nthe summertime when that landfill becomes just a morass. The local \npeople have asked, using Defense Department funds, that the job be \ncompleted. This bill does, in fact, provide moneys for that purpose.\n  The Senator mentioned the joint Federal telemedicine project that is \ngoing on in my State. Again, this is an initiative by the Department of \nDefense that has a substantial amount of\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\ncommunications capability in our State to deal with Federal agencies' \nneeds and the needs of the services they provide throughout the State \nof Alaska to coordinate a delivery system for medicine using \ntelemedicine techniques. We believe that is going to result in reducing \nthe cost of health care delivery to Alaska Native people and the Indian \nHealth Service to the military people throughout our State who serve on \nmilitary bases and those who receive the benefits of Federal programs. \nIt is not a general program for the population as a whole.\n  I say to the Senate, I understand the Senator's approach and I \nrespect it, but I believe and our committee believes that there are \ninstances where activities, which originated on military bases or \ncaused by military occupation of specific portions of land within the \nindividual States, do affect the local population and that those \nobligations of the Federal Government should be met with defense funds.\n  The basic problem, though--I go back to the beginning--we did not cut \nfrom other accounts in order to get the moneys to shift to other \nappropriations bills. For instance, we have shifted a substantial \namount of money now through what we call the deficiency subcommittee--\nwhich was a subcommittee created specifically for that purpose--moneys \nfrom these accounts from the Department of Defense into the agriculture \nappropriations bill, but the way it was done does not reduce the amount \nof money that will be spent by the Department of Defense in the year \n2000. A portion of the moneys really are carried over to be spent in \nthe year 2000 rather than being spent in 1999, and that is what we \nintended when we asked the Congress to approve that supplemental \nappropriations bill. I hope the Senate will agree with us and will \noppose this amendment and defeat it. It is a significant vote for us to \ndetermine.\n  Members will note the reports in the papers and in the media \nconcerning the meetings that are taking place in the House of \nRepresentatives. They are deciding on an approach quite similar to ours \nto reduce the amount of money that will be spent through the fiscal \nyear 2000 process and carry over some of the funds from 1999 to meet \nthe obligations in the year 2000.\n  I think that is a legitimate way to use the money that is available \nto us and will enable us hopefully to stay under the caps in treating \nall of the bills that have to be passed by our committee. Thirteen \nseparate bills have to be brought to this floor, and ours is the only \ncommittee which faces a point of order under the Budget Act if we \nexceed the caps. We are trying our best to live with that Budget Act. I \nthink we will.\n\n  There is still a serious gap in money, but we will find that money \nsomewhere within the agencies, either by reducing carryover funds or by \neliminating funds that are now no longer high priority so we can meet \nthe obligations of the year 2000 with the funds that will be available \nunder the budget agreement. If we cannot do that, we will come to the \nSenate in September, and we will have to work out a way to solve our \nproblem.\n  Right now, our goal--and I think it is a bipartisan goal--is to live \nwith the Budget Act, stay within the caps, yet meet our obligations. \nWhat we have done in this bill is the initial key to opening up the \ndoor down that long corridor to comply with the Budget Act. I urge the \nSenate to disapprove the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield to my friend if he has any comments to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join my chairman, Mr. Stevens, in \nopposition to the McCain amendment. In the statement made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, he mentioned a brown tree snake, $1 \nmillion to either control or to rid the State of Hawaii of this menace.\n  The history of the brown tree snake is a rather simple one, and it \nhas been documented. It was found in Solomon Islands and during the \nwar, army transport vessels accidentally or otherwise carried several \nbrown tree snakes from the Solomon Islands to Guam.\n  Within 2 years, seven species of birds have been wiped out on Guam, \nbabies have been threatened, and there is a brownout almost once an \nevening because of brown tree snakes.\n  The State of Hawaii has no snakes unless they are brought in. It has \nbeen documented that the brown tree snake was brought in from Guam via \nthe Air Force aircraft. Therefore, the Department of Defense, assuming \nsome responsibility for this, has not disapproved this amount of $1 \nmillion to help the State of Hawaii rid itself of the brown tree \nsnakes.\n  Hawaii's environment is such that it is rather fragile. We have no \nnatural predators to control the snakes, and if it ever gets loose in \nmy State, then all the beautiful birds of paradise will disappear.\n  I think the amount we have put in this bill represents the position \non the part of the Department of Defense in assuming responsibility is \na rather small one.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my hope the Senate will agree that \nwe can proceed on other amendments.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside and hopefully we will vote on it sometime \nbetween 3:30 and 4. I request there be 2 minutes equally divided so the \nSenator from Arizona can state to the Senate again the purpose of the \namendment before the final vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 549 And 550 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have authority to withdraw Byrd \namendments Nos. 549 and 550. They were modified and accepted in the \nmanagers' package to which we previously agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are withdrawn.\n  The amendments (Nos. 549 and 550) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 581\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n581 be taken up at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 581.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Department of Defense is authorized to \n     enter into agreements with the Veterans Administration and \n     Federally-funded health agencies providing services to Native \n     Hawaiians for the purpose of establishing a partnership \n     similar to the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership, in \n     order to maximize Federal resources in the provision of \n     health care services by Federally-funded health agencies, \n     applying telemedicine technologies. For the purpose of this \n     partnership, Native Hawaiians shall have the same status as \n     other Native Americans who are eligible for the health care \n     services provided by the Indian Health Service.\n       (b) The Department of Defense is authorized to develop a \n     consultation policy, consistent with Executive Order 13084 \n     (issued May 14, 1998), with Native Hawaiians for the purpose \n     of assuring maximum Native Hawaiian participation in the \n     direction and administration of government services so as to \n     render those services more responsive to the needs of the \n     Native Hawaiian community.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n       (c) For purposes of these sections, the term ``Native \n     Hawaiian'' means any individual who is a descendant of the \n     aboriginal people, who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised \n     sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of \n     Hawaii.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by both \nsides and the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. I ask that it \nbe considered and passed.\n  With Chairman Stevens' agreement, included in the managers' package \nof amendments is bill language that would provide authority to \nreplicate the Federal Health Care Partnership that is now operating in \nthe State of Alaska.\n  Pursuant to the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership, the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), the Veterans' Administration (VA) and the \nIndian Health Service (IHS) have entered into memoranda of \nunderstanding in order to make the most efficient use of resources that \nare made available to each of these Federally-funded health care \nsystems in the provision of health care services to their respective \neligible beneficiaries. Initiated in April of 1995, under this \npartnership, health care services are being provided to eligible DoD, \nVA and IHS beneficiaries without regard to the designation of the \nhealth care service facility, and telemedicine technologies are being \nemployed to provide access to health care services in remote rural \nareas.\n  The proposed bill language would provide authority for the Department \nof Defense to establish a similar arrangement with the Veterans' \nAdministration and Federally-funded health care agencies providing \nhealth care services to Native Hawaiians in the State of Hawaii. For \nthe purpose of this partnership, Native Hawaiians shall have the same \nstatus as other Native Americans who are eligible for the health care \nservices provided by the Indian Health Service.\n  The proposed bill language also provides authority for the Department \nof Defense to develop a consultation policy with regard to programs and \nactivities which affect the Native Hawaiian community in Hawaii.\n  On May 14, 1998, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13084, \ndirecting every Federal agency to establish an effective process to \nprovide for meaningful and timely consultation and coordination with \nNative Americans and Native American governments in the development of \npolicies and practices that significantly or uniquely affect their \ncommunities. On October 20, 1998, the Secretary of the Department of \nDefense announced the issuance of the Department's consultation policy \naffecting two of the three constituent Native American groups--American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. The proposed bill language authorizes the \nDepartment of Defense to develop a similar consultation policy for the \nthird constituent group of Native Americans--Native Hawaiians--for the \npurpose of assuring maximum Native Hawaiian participation in the \ndirection and administration of governmental services so as to render \nthose services more responsive to the needs of the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity, consistent with the following findings of the Congress----\n  The United States recognizes and affirms that American Indian, Alaska \nNative, and Native Hawaiian people, as the aboriginal, indigenous, \nnative people of the United States have a continuing right to autonomy \nin their own affairs and an ongoing right of self-determination and \nself-governance.\n  The Constitutional authority of the Congress to legislate in matters \naffecting the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United \nStates includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the \nNative Hawaiian people, as aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \nhave a special relationship with the United States.\n  The Federal policy of self-determination and self-governance of the \naboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States is intended \nto maximize the participation of native people in the direction and \nadministration of governmental services to their communities in order \nto make those services more responsive to the needs of the native \npeople and their communities. In accordance with that policy, the \nCongress encourages Federal agency consultation with the aboriginal, \nindigenous, native people of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians, with regard to \nagency actions that uniquely or significantly affect them or their \ncommunities.\n  For purposes of these sections in the proposed bill language, the \nterm ``Native Hawaiian'' means any individual who is a descendant of \nthe aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, ``occupied and exercised \nsovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of Hawaii.''\n  I thank the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, for his willingness to assure that the Department of \nDefense has a consistent policy as it relates to all Native Americans.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are in agreement, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 581) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, though I see on the floor Mr. Inouye \nand Mr. Stevens, two Senators for whom I have a tremendous amount of \nrespect, I rise to speak in opposition to the proposed increases in \nmilitary spending contained in this defense appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  I have, I believe, been a strong supporter of our women and men in \nuniform, especially our veterans. I think we should provide the best \npossible training, equipment and preparations for our military forces. \nI understand and know full well that our forces have been asked in \nrecent years to carry out a number of peacekeeping, humantarian and \nother missions.\n  I voted to support the airstrikes in Kosovo. I have raised questions \nthroughout this conflict. I hope there will be a diplomatic solution, \nand I hope the Kosovars will be able to go back home. I think we are at \nthe beginning of a huge challenge. In particular, I want us to remember \nthe Kosovars and continue especially with humanitarian assistance.\n  So I think we need to adequately support these activities, and I also \nsupported the supplemental budget for the cost of the campaign in \nKosovo. But I am troubled--and I think I am probably one of only a few \nin the Senate, but I have the opportunity and the honor of being able \nto speak as a Senator from Minnesota, and so I will--by what I see as a \nstampede in this Congress toward even greater increases in Pentagon \nspending. I think the increase in spending in this legislation goes way \nbeyond what we need to spend in the conflict in Kosovo and way beyond \nwhat I think a post-cold war defense budget should reflect.\n  This appropriations bill totals $264 billion, and we also \nappropriated a considerable amount more in the supplemental bill, the \nemergency bill. If you look at the cost of Kosovo, it will be a \nrelatively small percentage of this overall budget. In terms of \nmanpower or womanpower, even if we participate--and I believe we will--\nin the KFOR peace enforcement process, we will be contributing about \n7,000 troops. The total armed force of the United States is roughly 1.5 \nmillion. So this is not a question of whether or not we go on and live \nup to our commitment in Kosovo. I think we can support that mission \nwithout this Pentagon budget at the level called for.\n  I fear that using Kosovo and also some vaguely defined set of \n``threats'' will end up--and I want to talk about some of the doctrines \nthat undergird this budget--giving a blank check to the Pentagon this \nyear and in the years ahead. This budget accounts for a little over \nhalf of the discretionary spending in the annual budget. That is what \ntroubles me. If you look at the peak of the cold war, currently we are \nspending, roughly speaking, just thinking about real dollar terms, \nclose to 90 percent--about 86--of the cold war budget, and that is \nduring the height of the cold war.\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n  Now, most of the funds in this budget go to maintaining a force \nstructure that is shaped by the requirement to fight two simultaneous, \nmajor conflicts and to counter what defense analysts refer to as \n``uncertainty scenarios.''\n  I recognize that the United States faces a number of threats around \nthe world and that those threats have changed during the cold war \nperiod--in particular, the threat of terrorism and the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. If we look carefully at those threats, we \ncan see that in this budget too much of the spending is not directly \nrelated to meeting those threats but, rather, continues with what I \ndefine as cold war priorities.\n  We continue to pour billions of dollars into unnecessary cold war era \nweapons programs. We continue to maintain a nuclear arsenal that is \ncompletely disproportionate to the arsenals maintained by our potential \nadversaries--an arsenal that could be substantially cut, resulting in \ndramatic savings, still providing for as strong a defense as we could \never need.\n  Congress has also skewed spending priorities by refusing to close \nmilitary bases that the Pentagon acknowledges are unneeded and obsolete \nand which the Pentagon itself has pressed to close.\n  What is especially troubling about the spending in this budget is the \nStrategic Concepts--the two major regional conflicts concept and other \nuncertain scenarios--that are, I think, implausible and unlikely. I \nwant to draw here on some excellent work done by analyst Carl Conetta \nand Charles Knight of the Project on Defense Alternatives in Cambridge, \nMA.\n  Beginning in the 1980s, the focus of defense planners moved away from \n``clear and present danger'' of the Soviet power to the intractable \nproblem of ``uncertainty.'' Along with the shift has come a new kind of \nPentagon partisan--the ``uncertainty hawk.'' The uncertainty hawks are \nengaged in worst-case thinking. Among the sort of nonstandard \nscenarios, worst-case scenarios that are, for example, talked about \nwith this kind of doctrine are defending the Ukraine or the Baltics \nagainst Russia, civil wars in Russia and Algeria, a variety of wars in \nChina, contention with Germany, and wars aligning Iraq and Syria \nagainst Turkey, and Iraq and Iran against Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon's \nQuadrennial Defense Review, QDR, uses unnamed ``wild card'' scenarios \nto help define these requirements.\n  Now, although both the 1993 and 1997 Defense Reviews link the two-war \nrequirements to the Korean and Persian Gulf scenarios, these were also \ndescribed merely as examples of possible wars. Officially, the two-war \nrequirement--that we have to be able to fight two wars simultaneously--\nis generic. It is not tied directly to Korea or the gulf. As the \nQuadrennial Defense Review puts it, ``We can never know with certainty \nwhen or where the next major theater war will occur'' or ``who our next \nadversary will be.''\n  It is important to recognize, as opposed to appropriating moneys \nbased upon this kind of strategic doctrine, that since 1945 the United \nStates has fought only three major regional conflicts--one every 15 or \n20 years. The regional great powers and peer competitors that currently \nenthrall planners are only hypothetical constructs, and the world \nchanges all of the time.\n  I will give an example of a little bit more of this doctrine. The \nprime candidates, in addition to these uncertainty scenarios, worst-\ncase scenarios, for future peer rival status, given current doctrine, \nare Russia and China. A dozen years of dedicated investment might \nresuscitate a significant portion of the Russian Armed Forces, but that \ncertainly is not what we are looking at right now--a major military \ncompetitor, Russia. The Chinese ``threat,'' even given all of the \ndevelopments we have been talking about over the last several weeks, is \neven more iffy. If China's economy holds out, in 30 years it might be \nable to mount a ``Soviet-style'' challenge.\n  Surveying the prospects worldwide, a Defense Intelligence Agency \nanalyst concludes that ``no military or technical peer competitor to \nthe United States is on the horizon for at least a couple of decades.''\n  As I have said, I believe we should maintain a strong defense. We \nface a number of credible threats in the world, including terrorism and \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But let's make sure \nwe carefully identify the threats we face and tailor our defense \nspending to meet them. Let's not continue to maintain military spending \nbased on hypothetical threats that may not arise for decades--if at \nall.\n  I will argue as we look at this budget, which again makes up about \none-half of our discretionary spending, that we ought to consider this \nvote in the context of where we are heading with these budget caps. I \nsay yes to a strong defense but no to some of the unnecessary spending \nthat is in this budget; no to some of the scenarios that are laid out \nin this budget and some of the doctrines that undergird the spending in \nthis budget, especially when we are talking about over 50 percent of \ndiscretionary spending going into this area.\n  Whatever happened to the discussions we once had about national \nsecurity at home? If we are going to spend 50 percent of our \ndiscretionary budget on the Pentagon--and we are not going to do \nanything about these budget caps, and we will have to, in my view, take \nthese caps off; there is no question about it. But on current course \nwithin this context of the budget we now have before us, we are going \nto spend over 50 percent of discretionary spending on the Pentagon. \nAnd, as a result, what are we not doing? We are not looking at the \nother part of our national defense. I argue that part of our real \nnational security is the security of our local communities.\n  Whatever happened to the idea that we were going to focus on early \nchildhood development? Whatever happened to the priority that we were \ntalking about as being so important to our country that we had to \ninvest in the health, skills, intellect, and character of our children? \nWhatever happened to the importance of affordable child care? Whatever \nhappened to the importance of decent health care coverage for people?\n  In my State of Minnesota, 35 percent of senior citizens--that is it, \n35 percent of senior citizens--have some prescription drug coverage. \nThe other 65 percent have no coverage at all. Many of them are spending \nup to 40 percent of their budget just on these costs. Where is the \nfunding going to be for that? Where is the funding going to be for the \n44 million people who have no health insurance at all?\n  Yesterday, we had a White House conference dealing with mental \nhealth. I would add substance abuse. I have been doing work with \nSenator Domenici--and proud to do so--on trying to deal with some \ndiscrimination and making sure that people get decent mental health \ncoverage.\n  How are we going to move forward to make sure there is decent health \ncare coverage for people? How are we going to make sure there is \naffordable child care? What about affordable housing? How are we going \nto take the steps in our communities to reduce the violence and to be \nable to get to the kids--I think of the juvenile justice bill that we \npassed not more than a couple of weeks ago--before they get into \ntrouble in the first place? How are we going to make sure that higher \neducation is affordable? How are we going to make sure we have the best \neducation for every child?\n  I just simply want to say I am going to vote against this bill, and I \nam going to vote against this bill for two reasons, neither of which \nhas anything to do with the two very distinguished Senators who are \nmanaging this bill.\n  First of all, as I said, I think much of it goes beyond Kosovo. Much \nof it goes beyond our real national defense. I think too much of it is \nstill based upon a cold war doctrine. I believe we can make cuts in the \nPentagon budget and still have a strong defense. I have tried to lay \nout that case.\n  Second of all, I am going to vote against this bill--I don't think \ntoo many Senators are--because I view the vote on this appropriations \nbill in the context of the overall budget and where these \nappropriations bills are going. I view some of the dollars spent on the \nPentagon as being dollars that we are not going to spend for affordable \nchild care, that we are not going to spend to make sure there is decent \neducation for our children, that we are not going to spend to make sure \nthere is affordable housing.\n\n  I argue that somewhere in the debate in the Senate we have to also \nlook at\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nreal national security as not just being a strong defense as defined in \nthis budget, which I am for, although I think a strong defense doesn't \nnecessitate all of the money we are spending, but, in addition, we have \nto think about real national security as the security of our local \ncommunities where --one more time, and I will finish on this--there is \naffordable child care--when are we going to get to that?--there is \naffordable housing, there is decent education, there is decent health \ncare, where we don't have one out of every four children under the age \nof 3 growing up poor in our country, where we don't have one out of \nevery two children of color under the age of 3 growing up poor in our \ncountry, and make sure that every child, no matter color of skin, or \nincome, or rural, or urban, or boy or girl, can grow up dreaming to be \nPresident of the United States of America.\n  I think that has to be part of the definition of our real national \nsecurity. I think we have to make more decisive investments in these \nareas of public life in our Nation.\n  I believe this appropriations bill, in the context of the budget, \nwhere these appropriations bills are going to, subtracts from that very \nimportant agenda as well.\n  Let me finish one more time by being one of the Members of the \nSenate--I don't know whether others will say--I think others will say \nthis eventually--who says that right now we are in a fiscal \nstraitjacket. We will not be able to live with these caps. We will be \nmaking a huge mistake if we don't make some of the decisive investments \nI am talking about on the floor today. This will be a very shortsighted \nvision. We need to do much better as a nation going into the next \ncentury. And it can't be just Pentagon spending; it always has to be to \nmake sure that there is a peaceful opportunity for every child in our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is about time to vote on the McCain \namendment. We thought we would have another amendment offered by this \ntime. But it has not been offered. I believe it is time we start voting \non these amendments.\n  I will state for the Chair that it is my intention to find some way \nto call up these amendments in the order they were presented and \ndispose of them now as quickly as we can. There is a vote on cloture \ntomorrow on the Y2K proposition. I assume that will carry. We certainly \ndo not want to have this defense bill waiting around for the completion \nof a long process that is related to cloture.\n  I urge Members to cooperate with us. I will inquire of Members as \nthey come to the floor now on this vote as to when they will be able to \npresent their amendments to see if we can find some way to get some \ntime limitations. It is possible, I believe, to finish this bill \ntonight with the cooperation of Members of the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 589, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up amendment No. 589.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send to the desk a second-degree amendment. It will \nmodify this amendment in a way that is acceptable to both sides. I ask \nthat this amendment, as modified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 589), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Of the funds made available in Title IV of this \n     Act under the heading ``Research, Development, Test And \n     Evaluation, Navy'', up to $3,000,000 may be made available to \n     continue research and development on polymer cased \n     ammunition.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 588 and 591, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate amendments Nos. 588 and 591, and I ask they be considered en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 588 and 591) were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 584\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member spoke \neloquently about the merits of several projects in this bill that \naffect their States. As I have said before, I don't pretend to judge \nthe merit of each and every project on the list of objectionable \nmaterials. I do, however, object to the process by which these projects \nwere added to this bill, the process that circumvented the normal and \nappropriate merit-based review for determining the highest priority not \nonly in defense but across all appropriations bills.\n  I want to clarify something the chairman said: In this list, it does \nnot--repeat, does not--include funding for the SBIRS program on the \nIsraeli arrow missile defense program. There is no reduction in funding \nfor those programs.\n  Finally, my colleagues know the military service chiefs testified to \nCongress earlier this year that they need more than $17 billion every \nyear in order to redress several readiness shortfalls. This bill falls \nabout $6 billion short of that goal. This amendment would restore $13 \nbillion in high-priority readiness and modernization funds to help meet \nthe services' needs, offsetting every time with low-priority spending \ncuts.\n  I emphasize they came over and said they needed $17 billion. We are \nnot meeting that minimal request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I must oppose the Senator's amendment. I \nthink it will change the direction we are going in terms of how to meet \nthe pressing needs of the Department of Defense and, at the same time, \nbalance those needs against the rest of the needs of the country.\n  I urge that this amendment be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bill Adkins, \na legislative fellow on Senator Abraham's staff, be granted privileges \nof the floor during the Senate's consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are so many fellows being admitted \nthat I am going to ask on the next one that comes up that all fellows \nthat are working with Senators be limited to not more than 1 hour each \non the floor during the consideration of this bill. Those chairs in the \nback of the Senate are for people who are working with us on this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 541\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take a little time to explain this \namendment and to say that the primary coauthor of it is Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa. A cosponsor is Senator Wyden.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold also be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment and that his statement be placed in the \nRecord at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am happy to listen to the comments of \nthe Senator. On the second page, it says, ``. . .and the relevancy of \nthe missions of aircraft to warfighting requirements.''\n  It is the position of the committee that the aircraft we are talking \nabout are for basically multimission functions and are really not \ndesigned for warfighting requirements. They are designed for \ntransportation, basically to meet normal needs. If the Senator would \ndelete that last clause, we will be happy to accept the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want a moment, if I may confer with my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been told there is an objection to \nmy suggestion, so I withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will look at this because I \nhave not asked for the yeas and nays at this time. We may well delete \nthat particular part of the amendment. As a matter of fact, we will \nprobably take care of that problem.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a very important amendment. We \nbasically say that the provision in the bill for leasing six luxury \nexecutive jets for military generals will be essentially deleted. These \nare the same kinds of executive jets that are used by, frankly, \nbillionaires, CEOs of the biggest multinational corporations. I think \nproviding additional executive jets to the military's fleet of over 100 \nGulfstream, Lear, and Cessna jets sends the wrong signal to our young \nmen and women in the military and reflects misguided spending \npriorities by this Congress.\n  I want to tell you--and I know the Senator from Iowa would agree--it \nwasn't easy to find this gold-plated pork. To say it was buried in this \nbill is an understatement. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. \nIt is so disguised, there is no direct mention of the Gulfstream \naircraft anywhere in the bill. They are being leased for the first \ntime, I think, because it disguises the cost, which is enormous--when I \nget into it, I will tell you. It is about $39 million for one of these \nexecutive jets, compared to the executive jet that is in the fleet now \nthat costs $5.4 million, which is very fancy, and that one is the \nCessna Citation Ultra. This one is the Gulfstream; this is the gold-\nplated version.\n  The New York Times points out that leasing these jets costs taxpayers \nabout $145 million more than buying these jets. But I have to tell you, \nif you lease them, it is hard to find them in the bill.\n  In order to find out what is going to be leased, we had to call the \nAir Force and get a fact sheet that clearly says the jets will be \nleased, and they will be top-of-the-line Gulfstream V jets. Again, \nnowhere in this bill do you see Gulfstream V or a description of these \njets. If you read page 142--that is where the authority comes from--\nthis is what it says. This is literally the last page of this bill, \npage 142:\n\n       Aircraft leasing. Inserts a provision to provide the Air \n     Force the necessary authority to negotiate leases for support \n     aircraft.\n\n  That is it. Support aircraft. No one would know that these were the \nGulfstream jets that were stripped out of the emergency supplemental \nbill. You could not tell. But the Air Force told us right upfront and \nvery honestly. They sent us over a fact sheet and we found out that is \nwhat these were about.\n  Many of us here in the Senate--myself included--have said we are \nwilling to provide additional funds for the Defense Department to \nimprove recruitment and retention to fix shortfalls in training and \nspare parts and address quality of life issues, including family \nhousing and health care for our military personnel. I think the Senate \nhas done a commendable job in addressing many of these shortfalls: A \n4.8-percent pay increase, improving the retirement system, increasing \nretention benefits.\n  I strongly supported each and every one of those initiatives. \nHowever, we have more to do. It is shocking to some people to know that \nwe have military people on food stamps. The Senator from Iowa led the \nfight in the authorization bill to point out that our personnel \noverseas needed to be part of the WIC Program--the Women, Infants and \nChildren Program--to give their children cheese and milk to survive. So \nhow do we now come up with almost, I might say, $\\1/2\\ million over the \n10-year period to lease the fanciest executive jets that you can find? \nUntil we are totally convinced--and from my point of view not even \nthen--should we even consider this kind of an expenditure?\n  What is it for? So four-star generals can travel throughout the world \nin the greatest of comfort. I love to fly in comfort. I fly across the \ncountry almost every week. It is hard. I fly commercial and sometimes I \nsit in coach and sometimes I use my upgrades and sit in business class. \nIt is wearing and hard, but it is fine. You don't need to spend $39 \nmillion on a plane, or lease it at even a higher cost to do the \nbusiness the military requires you to do. It is really a question of \npriorities. We have done a lot for our enlisted personnel, but still we \nneed to do more. Yet, we are doing this in this bill. I am very hopeful \nthat the chairman--if we remove that one part from our amendment--will \nbe able to join us in support of this amendment.\n  There may be some objection. But I hope we can agree to drop this.\n  Our military personnel often live in family housing that needs \nreplacement or repair. This is a priority.\n  I was looking at the amendment offered by the Senate from Arizona. I \nalmost supported it until the chairman explained to me exactly what was \nhappening. Sometimes Members understand these things. We look in our \nown areas. We see the deficiencies. I think that if Members want to put \nsomething in to improve the quality of life of the people they \nrepresent in the military, it is appropriate. But I don't think this is \nappropriate.\n  Let me quote from the May 24 issue of Defense Week. This is talking \nabout the emergency supplemental.\n\n       The New York Times has exposed the bills' buried aircraft \n     language . . . this raised lawmakers' concerns that \n     appropriators would appear even softer on pork than they \n     already seemed.\n\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n\n  If the committee thought this was pork and did not belong in this \nemergency appropriations bill, then I say it is still pork now. It is \njust in another vehicle. But pork is pork.\n  What is especially troubling is that this leasing authority could \ncost more than buying the six aircraft outright. Again, the New York \ntimes says that leasing the jets costs $476 million --that is almost \n$.5 billion over 10 years--while buying them would cost $333 million. I \ndo my subtraction. That is a $143 million difference.\n  Here is how the Gulfstream company described these particular jets. \nThis is the company that would get the sale of these jets:\n\n       The Gulfstream V includes an evolution in cabin design that \n     minimizes the inherent strain of long-range travel. From the \n     100-percent fresh air control system, to the comfortably \n     maintained 6,000-foot cabin altitude at 51,000 feet, to cabin \n     size--the longest in the industry--the Gulfstream V provides \n     an interior environment unmatched in transoceanic business \n     travel.\n\n  Make no mistake, this is the top of the line in executive jets--$37 \nmillion per plane. For $30 million less per plane--for example, a \nCessna Citation Ultra at $5.4 million--we could save a tremendous \namount of money.\n  My amendment replaces this authority to lease executive jets with the \nrequest that the DOD provide some basic information about these \naircraft. I will be happy to work with the chairman if he wants me to \nchange some of that language. But we basically called for, in essence, \na study to tell us why we would need these planes and what other planes \ncould do the job that these planes do.\n  By the way, in Defense Week, they called this the ``Go to Meetings \nPlane.'' These planes are used to go to meetings. It is described that \nway in Defense Week.\n  We want to ask these questions:\n  How many of the missions require a top-of-the-line executive jet?\n  What wartime requirements make the number of jets needed so high?\n  We will be glad to drop that, if the chairman doesn't like that \nlanguage, but a GAO study looked at the gulf war and found very few \nwere used in that theater.\n  What is the cost comparison if we lease less expensive jets?\n\n  Are there existing aircraft in the fleet that can meet these mission \nrequirements or that can be modified to meet these requirements?\n  On another level, and without having to bring it to the Senate, I am \ngoing to personally send GAO a letter to look at this as well.\n  I think we need to step back and reexamine our priorities. The 106th \nCongress is increasing defense at a fast rate. There are many people \nwho make the case as to why that should be so. But I think since we are \nincreasing the defense budget while we are decreasing the domestic \nbudget, it really falls on us to make sure that what we spend is \nnecessary.\n  I don't have to tell Chairman Stevens, because he has to deal with \nthe aggravation of these nondefense discretionary program cuts overall \nof $21 billion. I serve on the Budget Committee. I know how hard it is \ngoing to be when you get to the civilian side of the budget. Right now, \na 9-percent decrease in domestic spending is going to be facing the \nappropriators. What does that 9-percent cut mean? It means devastating \ncuts in many programs. The Labor-HHS bill is cut 13 percent. This could \nhurt programs. We don't know where they are going to cut. But it could \nhurt programs like Head Start; the Centers for Disease Control; Job \nCorps; summer jobs, which helps keeps kids out of trouble in the summer \nmonths; and dislocated worker assistance.\n  The point is that we are cutting in other areas. We shouldn't be \nexpending this kind of money--$.5 billion--over 10 years, on these \njets.\n  The transportation bill already reported cripples the Federal \nAviation Administration's program to increase safety and capacity. The \nbill cuts the modernization program by $273 million from the \nPresident's request, meaning that automation in radar systems will be \ndelayed, at best, and perhaps will never happen at our civilian \nairports.\n  In addition, the Transportation Subcommittee rescinded $300 million \nfrom prior year funding for FAA modernization.\n  What am I saying?\n  On the civilian side, we are seeing America fail. We are not going to \nbe providing the highest level of safety for our airports. But what do \nwe do? We spend this kind of money.\n  I see my friend from Iowa is on his feet. I am going to finish in 60 \nseconds.\n  What do our veterans tell us? Our veterans tell us that they need \nmore national cemeteries. The VA-HUD bill is cut by 15 percent.\n  I will tell you right now, I think it would be a wise thing if we cut \nthese leased aircraft out and looked at these needs on the civilian \nside of Federal aviation and if we looked at the need to build new \nveterans cemeteries. It is actually reaching a crisis point. We note \nthe D-Day invasion. We commemorate that anniversary. Yet, we don't do \nall we should in that area.\n  I think we should get real with this budget. I commend my colleagues \non the committee. I am very fond of them. They do a good job. But I \nthink this is one area where we could really save some large dollars, \nand I think we can do better things with those dollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am joining with Senator Boxer in \noffering this amendment to strike the provision that allows the \nPentagon to lease six of these executive aircraft. The military \ndesignation is C-37A. We know them as Gulfstreams in the civilian \nworld. They are very lavish and very nice aircraft. In fact, I will \nshow you what we are talking about.\n  This is a Gulfstream V. It is a very nice airplane. I am sure that \nmillionaires who have made a lot of money in the stock market probably \nhave those. Billionaires have them. I am sure they fly them around. It \nis a very nice, luxurious aircraft. All of the statistics are very good \non that aircraft. It is quiet. It flies high. It goes long distances \nnonstop. It is quite luxurious on the inside.\n  As you can see, this is a very nice business executive jet. I \nwouldn't deny that it is a good tool for a lot of businesses to use in \nfact. I am not here to say that Gulfstream V is a bad aircraft, or that \nit shouldn't be built, or that there is no reason to have this in \nanybody's inventory--not in the least. This aircraft serves a very \nvaluable purpose for a lot of businesses here and around the world. In \nfact, the Gulfstream corporation has to be a good corporation, for all \nI know, and builds a pretty darned good airplane. That is not our \npoint.\n  Our point is--the more I have looked into this the more it has become \napparent to me--that all branches of the military have become top-\nheavy, not only top-heavy in terms of the command structure itself but \ntop-heavy in the number of executive jets they have to ferry them \naround from place to place. I am beginning to wonder if these are \nreally all that necessary. Are they really for wartime use, or are they \nreally more for just convenience?\n  For example--I will get more into this in detail later--we are told \nthat a lot of these executive jets such as this can go 4,000 or 5,000 \nmiles without refueling, as necessary to get to theaters of operation \naround the world. But the fact is, during the gulf war operations very \nfew of these were used. We have to ask the question: Is it really for \nthe benefit of generals to use for rapid movement during war, or is it \nmore for convenience in peacetime?\n  As the Senator from California said, we have a lot of budget problems \nhere at the military. I, for one, have been trying to do something \nabout getting WIC programs, as the Senator said, for our military \npersonnel overseas. It is a blot on our national character and on our \nmilitary that we have military personnel on food stamps. That is not \nright. It is not right that we have enlisted personnel who need the \nWomen, Infants and Children Supplemental Feeding Program.\n  Last year, the Senator from California and I tried to offer an \namendment here that would say at least when they go overseas they get \nthe same WIC Program as they got here. If I am not mistaken, I think it \ncame to the grand total of right around $5 to $20 million. The military \nsaid they couldn't afford to do it, but they can afford $40 million for \nsix of these aircraft. Something is wrong when the military says they \ncan't afford it, that the Department of Agriculture has to\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\npay for it; the Defense Department can't, but they can afford a \nbusiness jet such as this. That got me when I saw that. Something has \nto be done about this.\n  I understand they want to lease several of these Gulfstream V \naircraft. I would like to have one to go back and forth to Iowa. I \nwouldn't have to go through Chicago anymore--probably nonstop right to \nIowa. The Senator from California could use one, get on the jet right \nhere and go to any airport in California nonstop.\n\n  Let me show you the interior of the aircraft: A nice, luxurious \ninterior. Lean back, have your own personal TV set, a glass of wine. \nThat is pretty nice travel.\n  Again, I am not saying that we have to strip down everything, that a \ngeneral has to ride in a harness on a side bucket strapped onto a C-\n130. That is not what I am saying. There probably is a need for some of \nthese aircraft to transport these people rapidly. My question has to do \nwith the number of aircraft.\n  For example, I note that there are now over 300 aircraft in \ninventory, over 150 jets. I can't quite get an accurate count. Last \ntime I counted, there were 154 jets, 70 Learjets. Regarding the C-9, \nthe same as a Douglas DC-9, the Navy has 27, the Marines have 2, and \nthe Air Force has 5. Gulfstreams, we have 16 already. We have some \nGulfstream IIIs and IVs, the predecessor to the Gulfstream V. They are \nabout as nice, but they can't go as far. They are a good airplane. We \nhave 70 Learjets total; 727s, we have 3. I am reading just the jets. \nAnd I didn't realize we already have two Gulfstream Vs in our \ninventory. Cessna Citation 560, which is pictured here, is a pretty \nnice jet, not quite as big as the Gulfstream V and doesn't go as far, \nbut we have 14 of those. The old Saberliners, we have three still in \nexistence. We have seven 707s in our inventory.\n  There are quite a lot of jets to be flying around. Again, I am \nwondering, with the inventory that we have, why do we have to lease \nseven more? Or are we cutting back on some of the aircraft? Again, they \nmay serve a legitimate purpose, but I am wondering, and I go back to a \nGAO report that the Senator referred to from 1995, ``Travel by Senior \nOfficials,'' dated June 1995. One of the their recommendations in that \nreport was to develop the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the \navailability of each service's aircraft to help fulfill the OSA, \noperation support needs, of other services. The third recommendation, \nreassign or otherwise dispose of excess OSA aircraft.\n  Now, the chairman and ranking member may know better than I, but it \nseems to me that a lot of the services have the aircraft and they just \ndon't go from one service to the other. It seems to me what we really \nneed is an effective structure in DOD that puts these business jets and \nother aircraft under one operational command that really works. If a \nsenior officer in the Navy needed one for something, they should go to \nthis command to get it; Marines the same, Air Force--all this would be \nthe same. The Navy/Marine should go to one central structure to get the \naircraft and have them assigned from that structure. That is how it \nshould work.\n  It looks as though we are in the same old military gamesmanship: Air \nForce, ``I got mine''; Navy, ``I got mine.'' The Navy has Navy markings \nand the Air Force has Air Force markings and the Army has Army markings \nand never the twain shall meet.\n  I am curious as to how much money we waste and how much operational \nsupport aircraft we waste because we don't have that one effective \nintegrated command structure working as it should. That was the \nsuggestion made by GAO in 1995. If nothing else comes out of this, I \nhope we might move ahead in some way to provide an effective overall \noperational structure.\n  I said earlier that there is a DOD Directive 4500.43 that requires \nthat OSA aircraft inventories must be based on wartime needs. However, \nfew OSA aircraft were used in theater during the Persian Gulf war.\n\n  From the GAO report:\n\n       Actual use of OSA aircraft during the Persian gulf war \n     suggests that the primary role of OSA is not wartime support \n     but peacetime support.\n\n  Again, I quoted that from the GAO report of June of 1995.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator was a pilot in the military and I know \nhe understands aircraft.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think I do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I know he understands that these jets we are talking \nabout are not fighting machines; they are go-to-meetings machines.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might interrupt, these are what in common \nnomenclature would be called executive business jets, converted. For \nexample, in military terms, they call it a C-37 but it is really a \nGulfstream V.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend showed a couple of photos of the Gulfstream and \nthen a photo of the Cessna Citation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Cessna Citation Ultra. By the way, it is a very good \nplane.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that the Cessna Citation Ultra \ncosts $5.4 million a copy, according to the Appropriations Committee, \nand that the cost on the Gulfstream V is about $39 million.\n  This is transportation for the highest level of military officers. My \nfriend pointed out that we have a gap growing here between those at the \nbottom of the economic ladder in the military and those at the top. We \nknow that will always be the case, but it seems to me it is exacerbated \nwith this kind of situation.\n  I want to ask my friend if he believes that a top general could fly \ncomfortably in a $5.4 million plane as opposed to a $39 million plane?\n  What we are doing is simply asking for a study to see if we can \naccommodate the needs of the generals in a cheaper way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The basic answer to that is, yes--depending on the \nmission, of course.\n  Now, if a general or a four-star wanted to fly from here nonstop to \nEurope, they couldn't take this airplane which only has about a 2,000-\nmile leg. However, I might add, it could fly to Reykjavik and \nrefuel. It can fly to Shannon and refuel. It will take an hour and a \nhalf or more; you have to land, refuel, and get out of there. But it is \nperfectly capable of doing that. A lot of businesses fly these overseas \nall the time. You just have to stop and refuel in one place, that is \nall. It even has a bathroom on board.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may ask my friend, isn't it possible to base some of \nthese planes in Europe, base them in different places, which is what \nthey do anyway, so it is more convenient to make the switch?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator asking that question because I \nthink it points up--first of all, I am not saying we do not need any of \nthis; I am saying we do need some of these planes. I was talking with \nthe chairman about this. Let's say a four-star officer has to go from \nWashington to Florida to Texas to Chicago for a series of meetings. He \npossibly cannot do it with a civilian plane. I understand that, if one \nhas to go overseas for a certain meeting and get back. There are times \nwhen you cannot use civilian airplanes. But this type of a jet could be \nused for any kind of domestic travel in the continental United States. \nYou might have to land and refuel. That does not bother me a whole heck \nof a lot.\n  I am saying with the Gulfstream Vs that we have now--which I said we \nhave two or so right now in inventory, plus we have a number of \nGulfstream IVs and Gulfstream IIIs--let's say a general needed to get \nfrom the Pentagon to someplace overseas in a big hurry for something. \nOK, requisition one of them and use it for that. But if they have to go \nto Florida and then to Texas and then to California and make all these \nmeetings, use one of these smaller aircraft because they are going to \nland anyway, while they are at the meeting, they can refuel, take off \nand go. It is a much cheaper way of operating.\n  I seriously question whether we need six Gulfstream Vs for whatever \npurpose they are asking--I really question that--and I question whether \nor not other versions of aircraft like this or others can be used more \nfor domestic travel.\n  I have a letter to Chairman Stevens dated March 8, 1999, from the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Hamre, and General Ralston, U.S. Air \nForce. I was reading it over and was struck by a paragraph. It is an \nassessment of CINC support aircraft. This was required by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nreport last year. I was struck by this paragraph which says:\n\n       This study evaluated all military and representative \n     commercial aircraft to determine which aircraft would both be \n     configurable and available for CINC support airlift.\n\n  It goes on. This is the paragraph:\n\n       The study revealed that when CINC--\n\n  Commanders in Chief--\n\n     requirements, combined long, unrefueled range--4,200 to 6,000 \n     nautical miles--more than 18 passengers and short runway \n     capabilities--5,000 to 7,000 feet--a modern commercial \n     aircraft was needed.\n\n  I find it interesting. If you go to the CINCs and ask, ``What are \nyour requirements?'' and they define their requirements, guess what. \nThey meet the requirements of the Gulfstream V. If you ask me what my \nrequirements are to fly around the United States, I bet I can come up \nwith a set of determinants that I need a Gulfstream V: I travel a lot; \nI go to the coast once in a while; I am always in Iowa; sometimes I \nhave to be in one place for a meeting and then another place for a \nmeeting. I would love to have a Gulfstream V. And I have short runways, \ntoo, sometimes.\n\n  It is not surprising that we ask the CINCs, ``What do you need?'' and \nthey then define their needs and come up with Gulfstream Vs. It seems \nto me we ought to have someone else defining the needs rather than the \ncommanders in chief, because they are the ones who use the aircraft.\n  They said:\n\n       Based on historical CINC support aircraft usage and future \n     requirements, and discounting the probable need of backup \n     aircraft inventory, seven C-37A aircraft--\n\nthat is the Gulfstream V--\n\n     should minimally satisfy the existing CINC requirements.\n\n  What I cannot figure out--does the Senator from California know?--is, \nhow many CINCs are there? Do we know how many CINCs there are?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Nine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are nine CINCs, so we are getting seven Gulfstream \nVs for nine CINCs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Plus all the other aircraft that are in the inventory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order, Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I asked the Senator to answer a question. I asked the \nSenator to respond to a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor, and he \ncan only yield to the Senator from California for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can ask a question of the Senator from California, I \nbelieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That requires the Senator from Iowa to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask a question of my friend, since that is the rule and \nthat is being strictly enforced today, and I appreciate that. Does the \nSenator not agree that adding six more of these luxury planes, which \nwould give us a total of nine Gulfstream Vs--we would have nine \nGulfstream Vs; that is, one for each of the commanders, plus an \ninventory of other planes that include Learjets and Cessnas--does he \nnot believe that this is going overboard in terms of the priorities we \nshould have?\n  I agree with my friend, and I ask him this question as well: We are \nsaying that we are very willing to give the generals what they need, \nbut it is a matter of whether you get the gold-plated version or a very \nsolid version, and isn't that what we are really talking about?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator has put her finger on it: We are \nwilling to give the generals what they need but not what they want.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Interesting.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They may want to travel in this kind of luxury, but I am \nnot certain we ought to just give it to them. There are nine CINCs. \nEach one now would have their own Gulfstream V. Do we know what the \nper-hour operating cost is of a Gulfstream V? As best I can determine, \nthe per-hour operating cost is over $2,000. I think it is actually \nhigher than that, because I do not think that takes into account \ndepreciation; I think that is just fuel and other requirements.\n  Let's just say it is $2,000 an hour. A four-star officer gets on one \nof those Gulfstream Vs and flies 2 hours someplace for a meeting and 2 \nhours back; that is 4 hours, $8,000 just to go to a meeting someplace \nand come back. That is a good use of taxpayers' dollars?\n\n  I will lay you odds that 7 times out of 10 that four-star officer \ncould go right out here to National Airport or Dulles, get on an \nairplane, and get a first-class ticket--How much is a first-class \nticket?--fly to that meeting, and fly back for less than $1,000.\n  I ask you: When is the last time you ever got on a commercial \naircraft in the United States flying anywhere and saw a general or \nadmiral on that plane? I cannot remember when. I see a lot of \nlieutenants and commanders and captains, but I never see an admiral or \ngeneral. Then again, why would you? They are on their Gulfstream Vs, \njetting around.\n  I am not saying there is never a purpose--there may be--but I think \nthis is just a little bit too much. There are about 36 four-star \nofficers in the U.S. military, I am told--about 36 four-star officers--\nand for that, we have over 154 jets in inventory to fly people around. \nWhat is going on here?\n  In fact, I know our proposal only deals with the Gulfstreams, but if \nI am not mistaken, the bill also provides for the purchase of five \nadditional C-35s.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Those are the Cessnas. We are already going to buy five \nof these, and we are going to lease six more of the Gulfstream Vs. So \nit is not just the Gulfstream Vs. The Navy already has six Gulfstreams, \nthe Air Force already has Gulfstreams, and, as I said, 70 Learjets, C-\n21s.\n  I remember one time when I went on a congressional trip--was I still \nin the House or the Senate? I can't remember. I may have been in the \nSenate. We went to Central America. It was during that war in Central \nAmerica.\n  We flew from here to Florida, to MacDill, refueled, and we were in a \nlittle Lear. There were about six or seven of us crammed into that \nthing with no bathroom. But obviously, because of my Senate duties, I \nhad to get down there to go on a trip that could not be done \ncommercially. So we went from here to MacDill, refueled, then went to \nGuatemala and Honduras; and then I think we went to El Salvador; then \nwe went to Panama City, had to refuel again, fly to MacDill, refuel \nagain, and then fly home.\n  I tell you, it was not that comfortable a flight if you are one of \nthose in a little Lear, six or seven people crammed in there. For a \nSenator, that is fine. I bet you a general or admiral would never do \nthat. But we had staff. We had committee staff along with us.\n  I am just saying, sometimes if you are going to do these things, \nsometimes you have to put up with that. There is no way I could have \ndone it commercially, so I had to take a military aircraft. You do not \nhave to go in elaborate luxury every single time.\n  That is my point. I do not think there is a critical shortage of \nthese executive jets that should take precedence over the immediate \nneeds of our military.\n  Besides the sheer numbers of aircraft in each of the armed services \nindicating there is no shortfall, again, I repeat from the 1995 GAO \nreport that said the armed services should ``develop the appropriate \nmechanisms to ensure the availability of each service's aircraft to \nhelp fulfill the OSA needs of the other services.'' In other words, the \nGAO concluded the armed services needed to learn to share. This is a \nsimple concept that should be used to relieve any conceivable strain on \nthe number of executive aircraft.\n  The Pentagon counters this sensible solution by claiming that \nexisting aircraft are being fully used. However, the GAO also found \nthat DOD's operational support aircraft fleet ``far exceeds any \npossible wartime requirement.''\n  The Defense Week article that the Senator from California referred to \nof May 24, 1999, had some interesting things in it. They said:\n\n       In particular, the article said, ``There are about 600 to \n     800 users in the DC area authorized to request SAM [VIP \n     Special Air Mission] support for missions'' which meet \n     prescribed criteria.\n\n  As I understand, that does not include Senators and Congressmen. At \nleast that is what I am told. When I first read there are 600 to 800 \nauthorized users for VIP special air missions, I thought that must \ninclude the 435 Members of the House and the 100 Senators. I am told \nthat is not so.\n  I am wondering, who are these 600 to 800 people? I am wondering if \nsome of\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\nthese jets are being used for less than really vital needs and perhaps \ncould be used to meet the needs of the military CINCs.\n  Again, quoting from the Defense Week article of May 24:\n\n       Brig. Gen. Arthur Lichte, the Air Force's director of \n     global-reach programs, says these support aircraft are all \n     meeting other requirements [all these other aircraft that we \n     have in inventory] so [they] could not be used by the \n     commanders.\n\n  Again, I am wondering, why not? What are these other requirements? If \nthe commanders cannot use them, who is using them?\n\n       Hamre says most of these support aircraft are too small for \n     commanders' staffs. Plus, the four-stars need to be able to \n     fly non-stop intercontinental trips while staying in contact \n     with the president.\n\n  I am not so certain about that. I am not certain that a refueling \nstop in Shannon is all that burdensome.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Some on Capitol Hill respond that the CINCs could get by \n     with smaller staffs on board and could live with refueling \n     stops, but Hamre and Lichte don't agree.\n\n  I do not know why not. I know a lot of times we go on congressional \nfactfinding trips. We stop and refuel different places. I don't know \nwhy generals can't. They can still be in contact. That does not stop \nyour contact with the White House, simply because you land and refuel--\nnot at all.\n\n       What about the existing support fleet?\n       ``No,'' Hamre said, ``we don't have aircraft that can fly \n     from here to the Persian Gulf. I suppose you could go on a C-\n     12. You could island-hop like you did in World War II, but I \n     mean that doesn't make any sense. This big inventory of 500 \n     [operational support aircraft]--most of them are tiny \n     airplanes, four-passenger, six-passenger kind of airplanes.''\n\n  That is just not so. These are not four-passenger airplanes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Isn't it eight?\n  Mr. HARKIN. These are eight right here. How much staff does a general \nhave to take with him when he goes to a meeting? I would like to find \nthat out.\n  He said, ``The CINCs aren't [even] happy they have to live with a 12 \npassenger aircraft.''\n  Again I ask, how much staff do they need to take to these meetings \nthey go to?\n\n  So, again, the Senator from California and I have this amendment that \nsays basically: We ought to put this lease aside. Let's take a look at \nthis. Let's get a good report in. Do these really meet the warmaking \nneeds of the Pentagon?\n  Plus, I do not know where the facts lie on this one, but I will just \nsay that, according to the New York Times, the lease will cost the \ntaxpayers more than $475 million over 10 years. Purchasing the planes \nmay prove cheaper. Some say purchasing is going to cost more; some say \nit will cost less. But we do know that for these aircraft, for the cost \nof the aircraft, plus the operation of them over the next 10 years, it \nis going to come in at somewhere----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Over $400 million.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the lease is going to cost over $475 million. And \nthen there are operational costs. Now you are up to $600 or $700 \nmillion over the next 10 years just for these aircraft. That may be \nsmall change to the Pentagon, which is used to operating with $270 \nbillion budgets, but that is a lot of money for our taxpayers. I just \ndo not know where the facts lie in whether or not leasing is better \nthan purchasing.\n  We have seen very little information as to the cost tradeoffs of \nleasing versus purchasing. We have not seen a full report from the \nPentagon covering all possible options to cover these CINCs' needs, nor \ndo we have much information as to the needs of the military for all of \nthese such aircraft. That is why our amendment requires a report \ndetailing the requirements and options for such aircraft as an \nimportant first step. We do not have that.\n  Quite frankly, regardless of how our amendment fares, I say to the \nchairman, and others, I plan to come back to this issue, along with my \ncolleague from California, year after year, until we get a clearer \npicture. How many flights do senior officers take with senior executive \naircraft? We do not even know that. What are the costs? What are the \nper-hour costs? What are the costs for that trip? Could that trip have \nbeen utilized with an alternative such as commercial aircraft? At what \ncost savings? Could some of these aircraft be sold off as excess \naircraft if we better managed the total number of executive aircraft \nthat we have?\n  For example, we know that senior officials and officers fly from base \nto base and facility to facility. They fly from Andrews Air Force Base \nto NAS Jacksonville or to MacDill or to other air bases around the \ncountry. Could you utilize commercial aircraft for that? Sometimes yes; \nsometimes no. But we need to ensure that the DOD is looking for cheaper \nalternatives, including commercial airline alternatives. It may be \nslightly less convenient, but it sure would be a lot less costly, and \nit would free up existing DOD aircraft we have now for the unique \nmissions for which they say they are needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am somewhat surprised by the length and \nspecificity of the argument against this amendment. This amendment, on \npage 104 of the bill, would authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to \nobtain transportation for the commanders in chief, the regional \ncommanders, to lease aircraft. It does not mandate any leasing. It \nauthorizes leasing.\n  Currently these commanders in chief, regional commanders, are already \nflying 707 aircraft built 30, 35 years ago. Commercially, those \nairlines had 250 seats. They have 45 seats on those aircraft now. They \nare big. They are old. They are costly to maintain. It is possible to \nhave modern replacements now.\n  The Senators would have us replace one a year. We will keep operating \nthese old dumbos at enormous cost for repair and replacement of \nengines, instead of moving out and accepting the fact that there are \nplanes there now, American-built planes, and the Department estimates \nit will cost $750 million to operate and maintain the current support \nfleet over the next 10 years. We would reduce that cost and put our \npeople immediately in more cost-effective, quiet, efficient planes.\n  Yes, they are small compared to what they have now. Today a commander \nin chief takes along with him up to 45 people. This will reduce that \nsize; there is no question about that. Further, we reduce the number of \naircraft from nine to seven. They didn't mention that. This has nothing \nto say about all those other aircraft.\n  I would like to have a study of the flights of these airplanes that \nare owned by the Federal Government, particularly those owned and flown \nby the White House. We tried to get that and couldn't get it. We would \nlike to find out who flies in the State Department airplane. We \ncouldn't get that.\n  Now, be my guest and go get those, but these are commanders of our \nmilitary who are serving as regional commanders of forces. I wonder if \nthe Senate knows there are forces of the American people in 91 \ndifferent countries today. We are operating at about one-third the \nstaff we had just 5 years ago. We are trying to carry out missions that \nare almost impossible. Our reenlistment rate of pilots is down to less \nthan one-third of what it was just a year ago. The deployment of our \nforces is overwhelming. The degree of fatigue on our managers is \noverwhelming.\n  I really never expected this kind of argument about replacing the \n707s. I do not think anyone wants to continue to fly on the 707s. If \nnothing else, they are just old.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. I am going to table this, follow this bill through, \nand get it done. I can't understand that an amendment like this would \ndelay this bill, because it is only an authorization to lease. All we \nhave heard today, talking about the number of aircraft, is immaterial. \nThose aircraft are out there. They are not going to be affected by this \namendment at all.\n  What we are trying to do is say that these commanders who stand in \nfor the President as regional commanders in chief should have the state \nof the art of American industry in terms of their transportation. That \nis what this is. What we are doing is trying to get them to lease them, \nbecause if we started replacing them, I have to tell you, there is not \nmoney in this bill to allow us to buy seven new aircraft for these \ncommanders. We can give them\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nthe authority to lease them and replace them, and those leases can be \noptions to buy later. We can fill that if we want to buy the planes \nlater. We can't do it now, but these planes they are flying now are \nexpensive, and they are too large. They are not what these commanders \nneed.\n  A DOD report promised us a savings of $250 million over this 10-year \nperiod if they had this authority. It doesn't mandate them leasing it. \nIt authorizes them to lease some, buy some, lease with an option to \nbuy, whatever it might be, to get the best deal possible to replace \nthese aircraft.\n  Now, in terms of maintenance alone, this option would save us a lot \nof money. I think the problem of having dedicated aircraft is something \nwe ought to look at.\n  The Senator says he hasn't seen many four-star admirals or four-star \ngenerals on airplanes. I see them. They do not wear their uniforms on \nairplanes. Why should they? They would automatically be a target. It is \nnot what we want anyway. These people are known throughout the world. I \nthink if anyone in the world needs protection, it is the commanders in \nchief of the regions. We do not provide that, but we can provide them \nthe capability for security and safety as they move around the areas \nover which they have command.\n  Talk to the people in industry. Why do you think the big industries \nare leasing fleets of cars now? Because after the end of a year or so, \nthey turn them back, get a new model--no maintenance, no replacement of \nparts. The vehicles are out on the civilian market with a good value, \nbecause they have only been used for a short while.\n  We could do the same thing with these aircraft if people would wake \nup and use the leasing operation. We are not talking about leasing \ncombat aircraft; we are talking about leasing transportation that is \nvital to the regional commanders.\n\n  Again, our section only deals with transportation for the regional \ncommanders, not for all the 684 people. If you want to know who they \nare, they are people in the State Department. We will be glad to give \nyou a list. State Department, commanders of bases overseas, they are \neligible for flight on these aircraft.\n  But above all, I am sort of taken aback by the fact that we are \ngiving the Department of Defense the right to think about taxpayers' \nmoney as they provide this vital transportation link for these regional \ncommanders.\n  This saves money. The study shows they save money. Before they can \ncomplete the lease, they have to come back and get the money to lease. \nThere is no money in this bill to lease. As a practical matter, I \nreally don't understand. Here we are trying to save money. We are \ntrying to replace these antiquated airplanes. These places these people \ngo, most of them have no commercial connections. They just do not.\n  I took a trip this last week to California and down to the desert in \nArizona and back here on business, down at the border to look at some \nproblems there. I will tell the Senate about that later. There were no \nconnections to Douglas, AZ, commercially. I thought I would get down \nthere and see that problem to determine whether we ought to spend \ntaxpayers' money. They have the same problem. How can they tell us what \nthey need in these remote places of the world under their command?\n  And how can they come to meetings and listen to the Commander in \nChief or to the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs? These planes are \nneeded by these people. I think one of the great things brought about \nby the Goldwater-Nichols Act was, in fact, regional commanders. It gave \nus the kind of command and control we needed to maintain a very \nefficient military, with fewer people, and utilizing the talent of some \nvery distinguished people. I have to tell you, the longer I am here, \nthe greater respect I have for people who get four stars on their \nshoulders. That is what we are talking about--the people who have come \nthrough the services and have reached the point of ultimate command--\nand I mean ultimate. They can make decisions in lieu of the Commander \nin Chief in a time of crisis; I am talking about in lieu of the \nPresident. They have the power under that act to act in a crisis.\n  Now, what do you want to do--let them ride commercial planes? I \nchallenge anybody who has been out in the Pacific and has gone from \nplace to place, from island to island, where we have our military, to \nfigure out how to do it commercially. Even in my State, if you want to \ngo out to Adak, you can go out and come back 2 days later.\n  As a practical matter, this is transportation for the 21st century. \nIf nothing else, this Senator doesn't want to see representatives of \nthe Nation that leads the world in building aircraft to be traveling in \n1960 airplanes in the years 2001, 2002, and 2003. That is what we are \ntalking about. There is a lot here in terms of advertising America to \nthe world. I want these people to be flying in the best we have, \nbecause they are demonstrating this country's ability to maintain its \nposition in the world.\n  I cannot believe there would be this kind of dialog about giving the \nauthority to use a system that American business has now used very \nefficiently for 40 years--the leasing of equipment as opposed to buying \nit. I hope to God they use this authority and save us some money and \nput our people in safe, modern, efficient transportation.\n  Does the Senator want to speak before I make a motion to table?\n  Mr. INOUYE. For just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Hawaii for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, most respectfully, I have been trying to--\n--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object--and I will not--I wonder \nif the Senator from Iowa and I may have a chance to ask a question of \nthe Senator from Alaska so that we can make our point again, because I \nthink he misconstrued what we were saying. I think it is important to \nset the record straight. May we have 4 minutes between us to simply ask \na question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be pleased to enter into that kind of agreement, \nfollowing the remarks of the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have been trying to follow this debate \nas closely as possible. The explanation the Senator from California has \ngiven is that this amendment would strike provisions in the bill which \nallow the Secretary of the Air Force to lease six Gulfstream V jets to \ntransport the highest ranking military officials.\n  There is nothing in Section 8106 that speaks of six Gulfstream V \njets, nor does it speak of the highest ranking military officials. I \nhave no idea where that came from.\n  What this section says is:\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force may obtain transportation \n     for operational support purposes, including transportation \n     for combatant Commanders in Chief, by lease of aircraft, on \n     such terms and conditions as the Secretary may deem \n     appropriate, consistent with this section, through an \n     operating lease consistent with OMB Circular A-11.\n\n  There is nothing about Gulfstreams. There is nothing about the \nhighest ranking military officials. But even if we did say six \nGulfstream V jets for the highest military officials, I join my \nchairman in objecting to this amendment. We should keep in mind that \nfewer than 1 percent of the population of these United States have \nstood up and said to the rest of the world they are willing to stand in \nharm's way in our defense and, if necessary, give their lives. Fewer \nthan 1 percent of us have taken that oath. The least we can do is to \ngive them the cutting edge, and this is the cutting edge that is \nnecessary to differentiate between defeat and victory.\n  So, Mr. President, I will support a motion to table this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me again say what we are trying to \ndo. We believe under this amendment, by giving the authority to lease \naircraft, we will be able to get at least six aircraft in less than 2 \nyears to replace these aircraft that are now well over 30, 40 years \nold. We believe the savings in retiring these aging, expensive-to-\nmaintain 707 aircraft will be cost effective. But what is more, this \nmove will be very good for the Department, because by pooling these \naircraft they will be able to use them efficiently. Nobody will have a \ndedicated aircraft that is underutilized. They will be able to be used \nby others when not being utilized under this plan.\n  We adopted a similar plan last year at my suggestion, and that is \nwhen we were going to have aircraft for FEMA,\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nCIA, and the FBI. We formed a special unit, and they have pooled the \naircraft and they are available to them. They will have them available \nfor one or all of them, depending on the needs of the people involved. \nThis is a cost-effective utilization of air transportation to meet the \nneeds of our National Government. I hope we can defeat this amendment.\n  I am going to make a motion to table. I will be happy to consider \ntime for the Senators to speak. They have spoken almost an hour and a \nhalf. I will honor their suggestion if they want some time before I \nmake that motion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be glad to do 10 minutes and wrap it up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to complete it with 3 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa have not more than 10 minutes and the Senator from California \nnot more than 5 minutes and I be recognized again to make a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska has made a good \npoint that the military should consider leasing and not consider \npurchasing. That is what our amendment does. Read our amendment. It \nsays:\n\n       Not later than March 1, 2000, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the inventory and status \n     of operational support aircraft, Commander-in-Chief support \n     aircraft, and command support aircraft of the Department of \n     Defense. The report shall include a detailed discussion of \n     the requirements for such aircraft, the foreseeable future \n     requirements for such aircraft, the cost of leasing such \n     aircraft, commercial alternatives to use of such aircraft, \n     the cost of maintaining the aircraft, the capability and \n     appropriateness of the aircraft to fulfill mission \n     requirements, and the relevancy of the missions of the \n     aircraft to warfighting requirements.\n\n  That is exactly what our amendment does. But we want to know, should \nwe even lease them?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have one question. The first sentence says to strike \nthe provision on page 104.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Strike the provision----\n  Mr. STEVENS. To lease for another year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It strikes the provision which allows the Department of \nDepartment to go ahead and lease. It says: Let's do a study before next \nMarch 1. What are our requirements? What are our alternatives? And \nlet's examine the leasing versus the purchasing. We don't even have \nthat documentation yet.\n  So I don't think there is such a need that we have to rush ahead and \nallow them to go ahead and enter these long-term leasing agreements \nbefore March 1 of next year. There is not that requirement there. They \ntried to put this into the supplemental appropriations bill, and that \nwas knocked out because it wasn't an emergency. Now they have come back \non the regular appropriations bill.\n  So all our amendment is saying, fine, leasing may be the best way to \nproceed, but we haven't gotten to that point yet. Do we even need these \naircraft? We haven't gotten to that point yet. I make the point that I \nam not certain we need this. Let's take it one step at a time and see \nif these are really operational requirements.\n  The Senator also said that it would be costly; we have these old \naircraft in inventory we have to repair and keep them up and put new \nengines in them and all that stuff. It is sort of like my old car. I \nhave an old car, and it needs a new engine. I can put a new engine in \nthat car, and it is going to cost me about $1,300. The car runs fine. \nIn fact, it is a pretty darned nice car. It is just a little old and \nhas a lot of miles on it. If I go out and buy a new car, it will cost \nme about $20,000. I ask you, which is the better alternative, if I am \nlooking at it costwise? It is a lot cheaper for me to put a new engine \nin that old car.\n\n  These are 30-year-old, well-maintained aircraft. They are the best \nmaintained aircraft in the world. They go through their periodic \ninspections, their 100-hour inspections, their annual inspections, and \nthey have all kinds of new engines on them and everything. It is much \ncheaper to keep those flying, to repair them, and to keep them up than \nit is to go out and pay $40 million for one of these, I can assure you.\n  Second, my last point: The chairman says that this will not affect \nthe number of aircraft that we have out there now. I beg to differ. It \nwill affect the number of aircraft we have out there now, because if in \nfact the amendment of the Senator from California and myself is \nadopted, it is going to require them to take a really hard look at what \nthey have in their inventory, at what their needs are, and at how they \ncan better utilize them. That may affect the other aircraft out there. \nWe may be able to meet the mission requirements of the CINCs with all \nof the Gulfstreams, the Learjets, the Citation jets, the 707s, the \n757s, the 727s, and the DC-9s that we have out there if they are better \nutilized. That is the missing ingredient. We don't have that kind of an \naccounting. That is what our amendment calls for.\n  If it turns out that they really need these aircraft to meet the \nwarmaking capabilities, and it proves that it is cheaper to do it this \nway than to repair and fix up the older aircraft--if that can be \nshown--I will be first in line to vote to make sure they get the \naircraft.\n  But I am telling you, this Senator does not have adequate information \nright now to vote to spend probably upwards of $600 million to $700 \nmillion over the next 10 years to lease these Gulfstream Vs and operate \nthem for that period of time.\n  That is why we need to just step back, take a deep breath, and have \nthem to report back. One year is not going to be a big loss to them, if \nthey have to wait one year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for the time \nthat he has spent on working on this amendment with me and for his \nexperience. His being in the military, I think, brings tremendous \ncredibility to this discussion.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their \npatience. I know that this is an amendment that they do not agree with. \nI know they are not thrilled that we have offered it, but they have \nshown great respect and have given us the time that we need to explain \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nmore than 300 planes in the inventory. These are aircraft available for \nmilitary administrative travel. I ask unanimous consent to have that \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Military Planes--Civilian Equivalent Names and Specs\n\n     C-9--military equivalent of McDonnell Douglas DC-9--twin-\n         engine, T-tailed, medium-range, swept-wing jet aircraft. \n         Used primarily for aeromedical evacuation missions.\n       Capacity: 40 litter patients, 40 ambulatory and four litter \n     patients, or various combinations.\n       Number in the military: Total=34--Navy, 27; Marines, 2; Air \n     Force, 5.\n\n     C-12 Huron--Beech Aircraft King Air, a twin turboprop \n         passenger and cargo aircraft.\n       Built: Wichita, KS--Beech Aircraft Corp.

Mr. President, if we go through this list, you will see \nall of them: The C-20 series, the C-12 series, the C-21 series, the C-\n22B series, and it goes on and on with over 300 planes.\n  I thank Senator Harkin's staff for their work in putting that \ntogether.\n  I want to make a point. We have an argument on the floor of the \nSenate. It is a very fair argument. One side says it is cheaper to \nlease these Gulfstreams, and others say that it may well be cheaper to \nbuy them--forgetting about the fact that some of us think we don't need \nthem at all. This is almost $\\1/2\\ billion over 10 years at a time when \nwe are cutting virtually everything else but the military right now.\n  Let's face it. The FAA is almost being crippled with $300 million in \nrescinded funds to make our civilian skies safer. This is serious. This \nisn't a small piece of change.\n  If, as my friend says, the study comes back and shows we save money \nby buying these things, we will take a look at that.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alaska. I think there are times when of \ncourse--I know the Senator from Iowa agrees--we want to have certain \nplanes set aside for the convenience and use of our top brass. That is \nnot the question here. There are 300 planes in the military that they \ncan use now. In this very bill, we are purchasing more of the Cessna \nCitation Ultras, which are beautiful planes that the Senator from Iowa \nhas spoken about, to carry them around in luxury. Yes. They may have to \nstop to refuel, but they can keep in contact with the President of the \nUnited States. I have traveled with very impressive delegations where \nwe have had to stop in the middle of very tenuous circumstances.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, as an old military pilot \nmyself, I must say that if the generals want to get someplace in a real \nhurry--it may be necessary--and if it is part of our warmaking \ncapabilities, they can get in the back seat of an F-16, get inflight \nfueling, and they can be there a lot faster than any commercial \naircraft or a Gulfstream or anything else. That is the fastest way to \nget there.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reclaim my time. I have a brief amount of time left.\n  This isn't about hurting anyone in the military. My goodness. No one \ncould respect the military more than the Senator from Iowa. I have to \nsay that is not what this amendment is about. This amendment is about a \nvery hard-nosed money question. Can we move these generals around in \nstyle but not in the Gulfstream version? Can we look to see what the \nbest way to go is--leasing or purchasing? Then maybe we can save some \nmoney that we need desperately.\n  Our veterans need veterans cemeteries. They are being told that they \nhave to have a 15-percent cut in the VA allocation. This includes VA \nhospitals. We could go on. We have military people. You want to talk \nabout the military who have to go on food stamps or the WIC Program. \nThe Senator from Iowa has led that charge. Maybe that is why we feel so \nstrongly about this, that it is a matter of priorities. Respect for the \ngenerals? Absolutely. Respect for the enlisted people? Absolutely. \nLet's do the right thing.\n  All we are saying is a year's pause, have a good study done, come \nback together, see what the study shows, and then make the decision \nthat is based more on fact than fiction.\n  Yes. The New York Times did a study. They said it is costing about \n$140 million more to go the leasing route. Let's see if they are right.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to stand in strong support \nfor this amendment. This straightforward amendment to strike tens of \nmillion of dollars for luxury aircraft for military commanders, brought \nto the floor by Senators Boxer and Harkin is about our men and women in \nuniform.\n  It is about the men and women that we have heard so much about over \nthe past years, the central players in the services' readiness crisis. \nIt is about the men and women whose lives are on the line in operations \naround the world. There is no question, Mr. President, that we must \nprovide them with the necessary resources to defend themselves and the \nUnited States.\n  Just last year, there was a virtual consensus that the armed services \nwere facing a readiness crisis. Last September, the Joint Chiefs \ntestified that there was a dangerous readiness shortfall. General Henry \nShelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, claimed that ``without relief, \nwe will see a continuation of the downward trends in readiness . . . \nand shortfalls in critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis \nReimer stated that the military faces a ``hollow force'' without \nincreased readiness spending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay \nJohnson asserted that the Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit. So \nit went for all the services.\n  To address the readiness shortfall, the Congress passed on emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The bill was well-intentioned in its \nsupport for the efforts of our men and women in uniform. Unfortunately, \nsomething happened on the way to the front lines. The bill spent close \nto $9 billion, but just $1 billion of it went to address the readiness \nshortfall.\n  We added $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization still has not spent all that money, yet we \nhave added another $3.5 billion for the BMDO in this bill. Last year's \nsupplemental also added billions to what has become an expected \nemergency, that being our operations in Bosnia. That other unexpected \nemergency, the year 2000, received a billion dollars. And so it went. \nWhat happened to readiness?\n  It is with wonderment that the appropriations bill before us today \nwould spend upwards of $40 million in the next fiscal year, and perhaps \nas much as half a billion dollars over the next ten years on luxury \njets for four-star generals. Am I missing something or is this absurd? \nWe actually have troops that qualify for food stamps and DOD can \njustify spending tens of millions of dollars next year for luxury jets.\n\n  This bill will allow the Air Force to lease executive business \nGulfstream V jets for the military's unified and regional commanders in \nchief. This bill also spends $27 million for five UC-35 corporate \naircraft that the Pentagon did not even ask for this year. How can this \nbe?\n  According to John Hamre, the assistant secretary of defense, DOD has \nan inventory of almost 500 operational support airlift, or OSA, \naircraft, including 70 Learjets. The Army owns 160 OSA aircraft, the \nAir Force 111 OSA aircraft, the Navy 89 OSA aircraft; and the Marines \n24. The General Accounting Office found that DOD's operational support \nfleet ``far exceeded any possible wartime requirement.'' Yet, the Air \nForce and certain members of\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nCongress believe this to be a high military priority.\n  Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to close their eyes for a \nfew minutes while I describe the jet that has become such a military \npriority. I take this directly from Gulfstream's website:\n\n       From the 100 percent fresh air control system, to the \n     comfortably maintained 6,000 foot cabin altitude at 51,000 \n     feet, to cabin size--a generous 1,669-cubic-feet and the \n     longest in the industry--the Gulfstream V provides an \n     interior environment unmatched in transoceanic business \n     travel. The jet also offers a substantial outfitting \n     allowance of 6,700 pounds--more than 12 percent greater than \n     any other business aircraft current or planned--which affords \n     owners and operators the freedom to select furnishings and \n     equipment with minimum tradeoffs. Space-age titanium mufflers \n     and vibration isolators eliminate hydraulic system noise. \n     Plentiful insulation in the side panels reduces sound \n     further, and we've even reengineered Gulfstream's trademark \n     expansive, oval windows to lessen noise levels. The total \n     effect is library-like science conducive to a productive \n     trip.\n\n  Now I ask my colleagues to open their eyes and face reality. \nSupporting the Defense Department's misguided spending priorities is \nnot synonymous with supporting the military. I urge my colleagues to \nlook themselves in the mirror and credibly ask themselves if they can \nsupport corporate jets for generals while front-line troops muddle by \non food stamps. Which is the higher priority?\n  I cannot vote to increase the defense budget by tens of billions of \ndollars, including tens of millions for corporate jets, which the \nbudgets for veterans' health care, education, agriculture and other \nprograms are facing deep cuts.\n  Throwing good money after bad is not tolerated at other Departments \nand agencies. Why is it tolerated with DOD? Defense Week reported just \nyesterday that the Navy has lost track of almost 1 billion dollars' \nworth of ammunition, arms and explosives. Additionally, DOD has yet to \npass an audit. A 1998 GAO audit couldn't match more than $22 billion in \nDOD expenditures with obligations; it could not find over $9 billion in \ninventory; and it documented millions in overpayments to contractors. \nGAO concluded that ``no major part of DOD has been able to pass the \ntest of an independent audit.''\n  Mr. President, we need some accountability in the Defense Department. \nVoting for the Boxer-Harkin amendment shows that the Senate supports \nour men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think it would be interesting for the \nSenator to know that the plane of our commander in Europe, General \nClark, who we all see on the news--and we have met with him \nrespectively, and our committee has twice--the C-9A, cannot land at \nhalf of the airfields in Europe because of environmental restrictions.\n  I don't understand why we can't move to make available the process \nthat has been pioneered and developed by American industry and even \nStates and cities. They lease their aircraft. They lease their fleets \nof cars. It is cost effective. We are giving them the authority to do \nthis. We are not mandating them to do it by the provision of the bill.\n  But if people want this substitute amendment--the Senator from \nCalifornia would require a study for more than a year--we would be back \nhere again.\n  But we faced this. People forget. In the current year appropriations \nbill, we required an assessment of consolidated CINC support aircraft. \nIt was required to be submitted, and it was submitted by March 1. Here \nit is. It led to this provision. We have had a year. We had the study. \nThey have told us what they need.\n  I hope the Senate will support the need as outlined, but the needs \ncan be met by exercising the authority. We are not mandating anything \nin this bill.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 541. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I now send to the desk the amendment we \nhad listed as No. 587, which is the remainder of the managers' package.\n  There is the amendment of Senator Coverdell, a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution; an amendment by myself for Senator Bond concerning \nprocurement; an amendment pertaining to the McGregor Range Withdrawal \nAct in New Mexico for Senator Domenici; an amendment regarding military \nland withdrawals for myself. I ask that they be considered en bloc as \nthe remainder of the managers' package. They should be separately \nnumbered at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and on \n     behalf of other Senators, proposes amendments en bloc \n     numbered 587 and 605 through 607.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 587\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for the purchase of four (4) F-15E aircraft)\n\n       In the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       ``Sec.   . In addition to funds appropriated elsewhere in \n     this Act, the amount appropriated in Title III of this Act \n     under the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'' is \n     hereby increased by $220,000,000 only to procure four (4) F-\n     15E aircraft; Provided, that the amount provided in Title IV \n     of this Act under the heading ``Research, Development, Test \n     and Evaluation, Defense-Wide'' is hereby reduced by \n     $50,000,000 to reduce the total amount available for National \n     Missile Defense; Provided further, that the amount provided \n     in Title III of this Act under the heading ``National Guard \n     and Reserve Equipment'' is hereby reduced by $50,000,000 on a \n     pro-rata basis; Provided further, that the amount provided in \n     Title III of this Act under the heading ``Aircraft \n     procurement, Air Force'' is hereby reduced by $70,000,000 to \n     reduce the total amount available for Spares and Repair \n     Parts; Provided further, that the amount provided in Title \n     III of this Act under the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, \n     Navy'' is hereby reduced by $50,000,000 to reduce the total \n     amount available for Spares and Repair Parts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 605\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the \n     investigation into the June 25, 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 25, 1996, a bomb detonated not more than 80 \n     feet from the Air Force housing complex known as Khobar \n     Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 members of the \n     Air Force, and injuring hundreds more;\n       (2) An FBI investigation of the bombing, soon to enter its \n     fourth year, has not yet determined who was responsible for \n     the attack; and\n       (3) The Senate in S. Res. 273 in the 104th Congress \n     condemned this terrorist attack in the strongest terms and \n     urged the United States Government to use all reasonable \n     means available to the Government of the United States to \n     punish the parties responsible for the bombings.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) The United States Government must continue its \n     investigation into the Khobar Towers bombing until every \n     terrorist involved is identified, held accountable, and \n     punished;\n       (2) The FBI, together with the Department of State, should \n     report to Congress no later than December 31, 1999, on the \n     status of its investigation into the Khobar Towers bombing; \n     and\n       (3) Once responsibility for the attack has been established \n     the United States Government must take steps to punish the \n     parties involved.\n\n  (The text of the amendments (Nos. 606 and 607) is printed in today's \nRecord under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 587 and 605 through 607) were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, are there any further amendments that need to be \ndisposed of that would qualify?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n\n\n                           strategic airlift\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the question of \nstrategic airlift. In this bill, the Managers have attempted to \naccelerate and increase funding for new modern programs, specifically \nthe C-17, in lieu of investing scarce resources in older aircraft.\n  Mr. President, currently C-17s are only assigned to a few bases. We \nrecognize some members are concerned that by focusing on the C-17, \nthose strategic airlift bases without C-17s will suffer. I recognize \nthis legitimate concern and want to ask the Chairman his views on the \nbasing of C-17 aircraft. Would the Senator agree with me that C-17s \nshould be assigned to additional bases to replace aging C-141 and C-5 \naircraft?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I fully agree with the Senator's statement. I believe \nthat C-17s should be used to replace many other strategic aircraft and \nthat the basing strategy of the Air Force needs to take this into \naccount.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Would the Chairman agree that one of the bases that \nshould have top priority for C-17s is Dover Air Force Base in Delaware?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I strongly agree. Dover is one of the key supply bases \nfor all of our operations in Europe and the Middle East. I think it \nrequires the C-17 as soon as possible. The bill before the Senate adds \nmulti-year authority to purchase more C-17s and I think both our \nPacific based forces and forces designated to supply Europe need C-17s \nto stay modern and ready.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator for his comments. He and I have both \nexpressed support in the past for getting C-17s assigned to the \nPacific. I am glad to hear him say that Dover Air Force Base is also a \nvery high priority for C-17s.\n  I stand ready to work with the Senator on ensuring that our Pacific \nbases and Dover Air Force Base receive the C-17s as expeditiously as \npossible.\n\n\n                  Marshall Foundation and Junior ROTC\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend the Chairman for recognizing the \nimportance of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, JROTC, for \nour nation's high schools through his support of the program in this \nbill.\n  I ask if the Chairman is familiar with the George C. Marshall \nFoundation, which assists in the training of ROTC cadets nationwide.\n  This foundation has worked for over 20 years to develop the Marshall \nROTC award and seminar. The Marshall Foundation now wishes to adapt \nthis leadership program for the JROTC.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my good friend from Hawaii asks an \nimportant question. I am familiar with the Marshall Foundation and am \ninterested in the prospect of adapting this program to the Junior ROTC.\n  The committee would be interested in any support the Department of \nDefense could provide to this important mission. The Marshall \nFoundation has helped to promote ethical leadership for ROTC cadets and \nmidshipmen, and we all know that any effort to improve citizenship in \nthe nation's youth should be supported. The Department of Defense \nshould support the Marshall Foundation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n     joint computer-aided acquisition and logistics support program\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will my friend, the distinguished Chairman of the Committee \non Appropriations, who also ably serves as the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Defense, the Senator from Alaska, yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the Joint Computer-Aided \nAcquisition and Logistics Support, JCALS, program is one of the most \nsuccessful joint defense programs in the information technology area. \nIt was begun in 1991 to automate the acquisition and logistics \nprocesses that support the Defense Department's weapon systems--\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\nto provide a paperless acquisition and procurement process across all \nmajor defense agencies and commands. For example, at the Defense \nLogistics Agency, the Electronic Folderization Contract used to require \n126 tons of paper and 100 days for an acquisition cycle. As a direct \nresult of JCALS, the process is now paperless and the acquisition cycle \ntakes just 15 days. The DOD estimates that JCALS will save $2.3 billion \nthrough 2014 just by digitizing documents that now are prepared in \npaper form.\n  Is my understanding correct that the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations \nbill now before the Senate contains the President's budget request of \n$154.1 million for JCALS, with $121.8 million in the Army Operations \nand Maintenance account and $32.3 million in the Army Other Procurement \naccount?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. If I may inquire \nfurther, is it also my understanding that it is the committee's intent \nthat all of these JCALS funds, including those in the Operations and \nMaintenance account allocated for defense information infrastructure \n(DII) purposes, are to be spent exclusively on activities directly \nrelated to JCALS?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct that it is our strong intention \nthat all JCALS funds, including those allocated for so-called defense \ninformation infrastructure, be used exclusively for direct JCALS work, \nas provided in the budget request.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman. If he would yield for a final \nquestion, am I correct in my understanding that it is the Committee's \nfurther intent that all JCALS defense information infrastructure funds \nprovided in the Army Operations & Maintenance account, approximately \n$20 million, are to be allocated to the JCALS southeast regional \ntechnical center currently located in Fairmont, West Virginia? I am \nadvised that to the maximum extent practicable, the contractor plans to \nuse these funds in Hinton, West Virginia, to further develop JCALS \ncapabilities to support weapons systems.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from West Virginia is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his clarification and assistance \nwith this most important issue.\n\n\n  improved materials powertrain architectures for 21st century trucks\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my request for $8 million for \n``Improved HMMWV Research'' under Army RDT, ``Combat Vehicle and \nAutomotive Advanced Technology'' was incorporated in this year's \ndefense appropriations bill. These funds are intended to initiate a \nthird phase of the design, demonstration and validation of ultra-light, \nsteel-based structures and advanced powertrain architectures on high \nvolume truck platforms.\n  This research effort, competitively selected by the Army in fiscal \nyear 1999 subsequent to the submittal of the President's Budget is \ntitled ``Improved Materials Powertrain Architectures for 21st Century \nTrucks,'' IMPACT. The full program will cover light/medium military \npayloads up to five tons, including applications with an open or closed \nbed configuration currently serviced by several of the Army's HMMWV \nvariants.\n  Kentucky is a large commercial producer and Army base user of such \nvehicles, and now, through the University of Louisville's involvement \nin this effort, it will also play an important research role in their \ndesign and testing. The military should realize significant procurement \nand O cost savings as a result.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \ncorrectly clarifying the intent of these funds.\n\n\n    south carolina-new york cancer prevention and telehealth program\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President I would like the attention of my \ncolleagues to point out a fine program worthy of funding in the Defense \nAppropriations bill. the South Carolina-New York Cancer Prevention and \nTelehealth Program design will build on the successful prostate cancer \nprevention, research, and telemedicine protocol which has already been \nestablished at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) through \nthe support of the Department of Defense. The current protocol will be \nexpanded to employ real-time, state-of-the-art telemedicine training \nand technology to prevent, detect, and diagnose prostate cancer in our \nmen in uniform. The program will utilize expertise of leading medical \ninstitutions such as MUSC and Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center to \nprovide our military servicemen with treatment at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center, Keller Army Community Hospital at the US Military \nAcademy at West Point, and the Beaufort Naval Hospital.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate the distinguished Senator bringing this \nprogram to the Senate's attention. Last Year, I supported including the \nMUSC telehealth program in the Department of Defense Appropriations \nbill. I agree with the Senator from South Carolina that the continued \nexpansion of this program should be included in this FY 2000 bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I, too, supported this program, and as you know I am \ncommitted to promoting the best health care possible for the men and \nwomen who serve our country. Briefly Senator, would you explain who the \nprimary beneficiaries of this program would be?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the Chairman's support and would point out \nthat past and present cancer research demonstrate that these \ntelemedicine techniques would be beneficial to military populations. \nthis telehealth program will replicate the success of the South \nCarolina model in New York. Once validation of this has been \naccomplished, a much broader application can be made to other types of \ncancers at military sites throughout the nation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure my colleague that we will continue to work \ntogether as this bill moves forward.\n\n\n                      Sensor network demonstration\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL . Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, the threat of \nchemical and biological warfare agent incidents due to accidents or \nacts of terrorism is real. I applaud the attention and support provided \nby the Committee in S. 1122 to research activities on detection and \nresponse technologies to these threats. It has come to my attention \nthat interferometric sensors are one of the most promising technologies \nfor creating relatively inexpensive, small, adaptable, highly sensitive \nchemical detectors. Such sensors are ideally suited for deployment in \ndomestic emergency warning networks when integrated with technologies \nsuch as geographic information systems. Is it the committee's intention \nthat all promising detection technologies, including interferometric \nsensors, be part of the Department's chemical and biological defense \nresearch program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, the committee directs the Department of Defense to \nexplore all promising detector technologies including interferometric \nsensors.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As the committee noted in its report on S. 1122, the \nMarine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, also known \nas CBIRF, has an important responsibility in responding to chemical/\nbiological threats and that their activities should be fully integrated \nwith the Department's chemical-biological defense program. It is my \nunderstanding that the Marine Corps is prepared to conduct a \ncoordinated civilian and military chemical incident demonstration that \nwould integrate sophisticated sensor technology like that \ninterferometric sensors I just mentioned, into a detection network. My \narea of the country would make an ideal place for such a demonstration \nbecause of the presence of chemical agents and demilitarization \nfacilities in the region and because the region has been the target of \nterrorist activities in the past. Does the committee agree that such a \njoint civilian and military exercise is an appropriate part of \ndeveloping chemical and biological detection technologies and can be \nfunded out of the additional funds made available by the committee \nunder Marine Corps Program Wide Support?\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee agrees that such a demonstration by the \nMarine Corps CBIRF unit is an appropriate activity and should be \nconsidered through funding currently available in the bill.\n\n\n                        fuel cell power systems\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as you know, fuel and power logistics \nsupport are mission critical elements for the success of the Air Force \n``Air Expeditionary Force Deployment'' concept. The Defense Department \nhas long recognized that fuel cell power systems can reduce the \nlogistics requirements for batteries and liquid fuels, and improve \noperational effectiveness of various military systems. The Air Force \nResearch Laboratory is the original developer of a polymer membrane \nmaterial that can improve performance and significantly lower the cost \nof fuel cells. Unfortunately, reductions in the FY 2000 Air Force \nScience and Technology budget threaten to terminate Air Force \ninvestments in fuel cell development.\n  I commend my good friend Chairman Stevens and my good friend and \ncolleague in the Senate, Senator Inouye, the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, for the Committee's efforts to \nadequately fund the Air Force's Science and Technology programs.\n  I believe that the Air Force should continue to pursue improvements \nto polymer processing technique and to transition the membrane material \nfor fuel cell production. There are several specific missions and \napplications that will benefit from fuel cell technology including Air \nExpeditionary Force Deployment (AEFD), Aerospace Ground Equipment \n(AGE), Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) and battlefield computers that need \nto operate 16 to 32 times longer than heavy battery powered systems. In \naddition, future Air Force mission plans are based on space missions at \nor above the edge of the earth's stratosphere. In these missions fuel \ncells can play a major role in meeting the energy requirements and \nimproving mission efficiency and effectiveness.\n  The commercial and military fuel cell market projections are \nsignificant--greater than $100 billion per year by the year 2006. \nSeldom is the opportunity for across the board dual use benefit for the \ngovernment and commercial sector as vivid as it is for fuel cells. \nChairman Stevens, I'm sure that you will agree that the Air Force \nshould pursue the prototype scale-up, optimization and full-scale \ndemonstration of an advanced solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell that \nuses PBO based membranes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, \nfor his kind remarks regarding this Committee's work on the FY 2000 \nDefense Appropriations Bill. I recognize the importance of investing in \nlogistics technologies that can extend our military capabilities and \ncan lower the logistics burden for the Air Expeditionary Force \nDeployment concept.\n  I agree with my colleague that development of the PBO fuel cell \nmembrane material is important. The membrane is a critical component of \nthe fuel cell, in terms of its performance and cost. Improvements to \nthe fuel cell membrane will result in direct benefits to our military \nreadiness.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I also wish to thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his kind remarks about this important Defense \nspending bill. I share the Senator's concern about levels of investment \nby the Air Force in Science and Technology. In the past, wise \ninvestments in Science and Technology resulted in many of the military \nsystems on which our men and women in the military depend today.\n  The Air Force Air Expeditionary Force Deployment concept is of great \ninterest to the Committee. Fuel Cells can reduce the logistics burden \nfor many military systems used in peace keeping and humanitarian relief \noperations, as well as for combat operations. I agree that the Air \nForce should consider the development of fuel cell membrane materials.\n\n\n                       high security lock program\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nis both important and timely--the security of our nation's secrets and \nclassified material.\n  Two days ago a bipartisan committee released a report detailing a \nlevel of espionage that few Americans expected. American's most vital \nnuclear information was stolen from the very places that were supposed \nto be the most secure. I am not here to cast blame but, rather, wish to \ndiscuss a program designed to help reduce the risk of this type of \ntravesty.\n  The Department of Defense has in place a Federal Specification, FF-L-\n2740, which sets the minimum requirements for locks to be used on any \ncontainer storing classified materials. The Department, to its credit, \nis near completion of a program to retro-fit all containers which do \nnot currently meet that specification.\n  However, there remains an area where our classified materials are \nvulnerable. As Senator Stevens knows, contractors also store classified \ndocuments throughout the country. Unfortunately, they often do so in \ncontainers bearing locks which do not meet Federal Specification FF-L-\n2740. So, I would ask my colleague, Senator Stevens, does he believe \nthat our nation's classified documents should be properly stored, \nwhether housed at a governmental agency or contractor's office?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I respond to the Senator from Kentucky that I absolutely \nsupport the safe storage of all classified documents. For this reason, \nI was happy to accommodate your request to include an additional $10 \nmillion dollars for the specific purpose of retrofitting security \ncontainers managed by contractors with locks which meet or exceed \nfederal specification FF-L-2740.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator and applaud his leadership on this \nnational security issue.\n  I also want to make the entire Senate aware of a letter written by \nthe Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nSenators Shelby and Kerrey wrote to the Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence and pointed out \nthat ``It appears the outdated, non-compliant locks still employed by \nDefense contractors cannot adequately prevent surreptitious entry.'' \nThey go on to state that ``FF-L-2740 compliant locks are more cost-\neffective than the devices currently in use.'' Finally, they close by \nstating that they ``believe DOD should consider directing the retrofit \nof Defense contractors' equipment.''\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his support of the $10 million \nappropriation for this retrofit program. His leadership will help \nprevent the type of espionage that has dominated the news in recent \ndays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his comments.\n\n\n                       Troops to teachers program\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have been concerned that the extension \nand improvement of the Troops-to-Teachers program recently authorized \nin the FY 2000 National Defense Authorization bill, S. 1059, Section \n579, might not be funded this year. As my colleagues are well aware, \nthis program will provide excellent assistance to retired military \npersonnel in obtaining teaching credentials to enable them to make the \ntransition from the military to the classroom in an expedited way. \nRetired military personnel are highly trained professionals, \nparticularly in scientific and technical fields--an area in which the \nnation's school systems are in dire need of trained professionals. \nTroops-to-teachers offer stipends to personnel retiring from the \nmilitary to obtain teaching credentials or vocational instruction \ncertificates needed for primary through secondary schools. It's program \nby which everyone wins.\n  I am advised that the President's budget requests $18 million in \nfunding for FY 2000 under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Since the Defense Authorization bill would extend Department \nof Defense management over the program until it transfers \nresponsibility to the Department of Education at a date not later than \nOctober 1, 2001, it is essential that the funding be maintained during \nthis period of transition.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his support for \nthis initiative which I sponsored in this year's Defense Authorization \nbill. I agree that it is a critical program benefiting our nation's \nchildren and\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\nschools. While I recognize the Senator from New Mexico's concerns, I \nbelieve it is important to remember that the intent of this initiative \nis to transfer the Troops to Teachers program to the Department of \nEducation. Funding to increase and strengthen this important program is \nmeant to come from the Department of Education, not the Department of \nDefense. Furthermore, we agreed to delay transfer of this program from \nDOD to DOE until 2001 in order to ensure a smooth transition which \naffords minimal disruption to the current program and infrastructure. \nOur legislation clearly stipulates that expansion of this program \nthrough an infusion of funds is meant to be done at the Department of \nEducation with Department of Education funds and not while the program \nis being transferred from the DOD. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues, including the Senator from New Mexico who is an original \ncosponsor of this measure, to ensure that the appropriate funds are \nallocated for the Department of Education allowing this agency to \nreform and strengthen the program as authorized by the Senate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I fully support that view and appreciate his leadership \non this important initiative. The Nation's schools and the Nation's \nstudents will be the better for it. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   ddg-51 advance procurement funding\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I draw the attention of the distinguished \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee to a funding provision of the \nFY 2000 Defense Authorization Bill that passed after the Appropriations \nCommittee had completed its military budget mark-up last month. Title X \nof the Authorization Bill allows the Secretary of the Navy to expend no \nmore than $190 million for the advance procurement of components to \nsupport the planned construction of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class \ndestroyers in Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003. The Navy, as the Chairman \nknows, has already written to Congress that it will need $371 million \nfor this purpose by FY 2001, but the obligation of some of this amount \nnext fiscal year may reduce programmatic risks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Seapower \nSubcommittee for highlighting the DDG-51 advance procurement provision \nof the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Bill. I am aware of this \ninitiative and strongly support it as a means of providing the \nSecretary of the Navy with the flexibility to release up to 50% of the \nDDG-51 advance procurement budget in FY 2000 should he determine that \nvendor and supplier base stability warrants such expenditures.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for \nhis understanding and support of this critical shipbuilding amendment.\n\n\n   procurement of a 20th large, medium speed roll on/roll off vessel\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Marine Corps has an unfunded requirement for one \nadditional sealift ship to complete their Maritime Prepositioning Force \nEnhancement [MPF (E)] program. In recent testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Lieutenant General Martin Steele concluded \nthat ``obtaining a 20th Large, Medium Speed Roll-on/Roll-off vessel \n(LMSR) and converting an LMSR to meet all MPF (E) requirements is the \nbest solution to our third ship requirement.'' General Steele also \nnotes that the situation in Kosovo has highlighted the need for the \nadditional ship. In light of these comments, I believe that it is \nessential that Congress fund the procurement of the 20th LMSR.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Army has agreed to release an LMSR to the Marine \nCorps as long as Congress provides funding in the Fiscal Year 2000 \ndefense budget for the construction of a new ship to replace the one \ngiven to the Marines. This presents us with an excellent opportunity to \nfulfill both requirements.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree. Funding the vessel will be a win, win, win \nproposition for the military. The Marine Corps will get their third MPF \n(E) in a timely manner and at minimal cost, the Army could reach an end \nstate with all eight ships for prepositioning being identical, and the \nnew ship would fill a current sealift shortage of 70,000 square feet of \nRO/RO in surge sealift. The previous LMSRs have been delivered ahead of \nschedule and under budget. Funding the 20th ship at this time will save \ntaxpayer dollars in the long run, by keeping the production lien open.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is a clear military requirement for the \nprocurement of this ship. Unfortunately, we are working under tight \nbudget restrictions. Should funds become available, I believe that \nCongress should give careful consideration to procuring a 20th LMSR to \nmeet the Marine Corps' prepositioning needs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \nwillingness to work with me on this issue.\n\n\n                     Innovative readiness training\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense \nAppropriations bill contains $20 million for innovative readiness \ntraining. Under this program, the Department of Defense trains Active \nDuty, Guard and Reserve personnel by providing ``real world'' \nexperience here in the US which is similar to what might be encountered \nin Overseas Humanitarian and Civic Assistance Programs. Under the \nInnovative Readiness Program, the Walking Shield American Indian \nSociety has provided such training opportunities on American Indian \nreservations especially those located in the states of North and South \nDakota and Montana. Without the support and cooperation of the Walking \nShield American Indian Society, many of the engineering and medical \nprojects conducted by the Department of Defense would not have been \npossible. This type of civilian-military program has a very positive \nimpact on recruiting and retention and should be continued in FY 2000.\n  I understand that the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2000 \nAppropriations bill for the Department of Defense notes that the \nCommittee believes that the Department should expand the scope of \nreadiness initiatives to include Native American groups, when \nappropriate and compatible with mission requirements. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are you familiar with the work of Project Walking Shield \nand the Walking Shield American Indian Society which conduct health, \nhousing, road construction and other projects suitable for military \ntraining on Indian Reservations?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I am familiar with the work of this excellent group \nand the benefits it provides not only to the military but to the tribes \nserved by its activities.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would you agree that this group provides the kinds of \ntraining opportunities envisioned for the Innovative Readiness Program \nand it should continue its partnership with the Department and its \nsupport and cooperation in Fiscal Year 2000?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This type of partnership is one we are trying to \nencourage.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I share my colleague's enthusiasm for this excellent \nprogram.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I agree that the Society's work is what we want to \nencourage in this account.\n\n\n                                 jrotc\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense \nSubcommittee, Senator Stevens, in a brief colloquy regarding the Junior \nReserve Officer Training Corps program (JROTC).\n  As Chairman Stevens may know, the Chicago Public Schools have \ndeveloped and implemented a very successful JROTC program. Since the \nprogram began, it has served over 7,500 cadets from all four branches \nof the armed services and helped these students achieve better grades, \nattendance, conduct, and higher graduation rates. The Chicago Public \nSchools are now in need of expanding the successful JROTC program to an \nadditional 10 high schools, including the Chicago Military Academy at \nBronzeville. And, they are attempting to enter partnerships with all of \nthe branches of the armed services in order to better serve interested \nstudents.\n  The Senate bill includes an increase for JROTC of $3.5 million. Is it \nthe understanding of Chairman Stevens that successful programs like the \none in Chicago should be able to work with the Department of Defense \nand the various branches to receive funding?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the fine work being done by the Chicago \nPublic Schools in the area of JROTC. It is an example of a program that \nworks. It is\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nmy understanding that a number of Chicago high schools would like to \ninclude JROTC as part of their curriculum. I believe that the level of \nfunding for JROTC in the Senate bill would give programs like the one \nin the Chicago Public Schools an opportunity to work with the branches \nof the armed services in order to expand.\n\n\n                   banking services on domestic bases\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Department of Defense is currently \ndrafting proposed regulations to establish a procedure on how military \nbases are to solicit and select bids from financial institutions to \nprovide banking services on domestic military bases. The regulations \nare likely to be issued in June of this year. I understand that the \nregulations may establish a presumption in favor of bids received from \nlocal banks over the bids received from any other bank.\n  It is important that these new regulations not prevent base \ncommanders from approving a bid from a financial institution that \nspecializes in providing banking services to military personnel, if its \nbid would provide lower cost and more convenient banking services than \na bid submitted by a local bank. There are several financial \ninstitutions in this country that have made it their business to \nprovide banking services to our armed forces. Their ability to provide \naffordable and convenient banking services to our military personnel is \nevident from the bids they have won to establish branches at bases \nacross the country. The Department of Defense should hold an open and \ncompetitive bidding process for the establishment of bank branches on \nmilitary installations and should not shut out these specialized banks \nfrom the process.\n  I do not suggest that the location of a bank not be a consideration \nin the selection process. However, it should not be the primary \ncriterion. The cost and convenience of banking services for our \nmilitary personnel should be the overriding factor in determining the \nbid that is selected, regardless of whether it is a bid from a local \nbank or a specialized military bank. I intend to follow this regulation \nclosely as it is developed. If it is not written in a manager that best \nserves the interests of our military personnel, I may seek a \nlegislative change of this policy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague from Missouri for bringing this \nissue to the attention of this body. I agree that it is an issue of \nconcern, and I intend to work with my colleague should a legislative \nsolution be necessary.\n\n\n                   bioenvironmental hazards research\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Defense Department needs the \ncapability to assess and prevent both the adverse impacts of its \noperations and training activities on the environment, as well as the \nadverse health effects of contaminated environments on its troops and \nemployees. One particular area of interest is in bioenvironmental \nhazards research, which focuses on the development of biosensors and \nbiomarkers of exposure for human and ecological system.\n  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Naval Oceanographic Office \n(NAVOCEANO) are currently expanding existing research capabilities in \nbasic and applied environmental sciences of aquatic systems. The \npurpose of this research is both to understand the processes of \nriverine and gulf systems and to understand the impacts of human \ndevelopment on estuaries and harbor systems throughout the world. This \nwork complements other ``brown water'' research initiatives in ONR, \nparticularly the STRATAFORM program which is looking at issues of sea \nlevel change, climate variability, and riverine runoff.\n  The joint technology development of the biosensors can be used in \nautonomous underwater vehicles, which have direct application in \nsupport of NAVOCEANO military surveys in the Littoral Zones and the \npre-invasion mission to detect mines and obstacles for clearance/\navoidance in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) and Surf Zone (SZ) approaches \nto the amphibious landing areas.\n  Specifically, the biosensor's role during military surveys conducted \nby NAVOCEANO will be to collect the natural ``background'' \nenvironmental harmful agents to personnel that work in the waters of \nthe littoral zones. Development of this definitive database will \nsupport the intelligence requirements of the SEAL, EOD, and amphibious \nassault teams. Moreover, biosensors will improve the probability of \nmission success, endurance and survivability of SEAL swimmers through \ndetection of harmful agents during the initial environmental surveys. \nThis health-risk assessment will involve the prediction and monitoring \nof waters polluted (either naturally or by intention or both by the \nopposing forces) with heavy metals, microbial hazards, chemical \nhazards, environmental chemicals, toxic organisms, and areas of outflow \nfrom waste treatment plants prior to the hunt for mines and obstacles.\n  Congress should encourage the Defense Department and the Navy to \npursue research and development of technologies and methods for better \nmeasuring and understanding the full range of impacts of biological \nhazards, including biological warfare, to humans (both military and \ncivilian) and other living organisms. This will improve our ability to \ndevelop suitable preparations or responses to such hazards.\n  I would like to ask my colleague from Alaska, would he be willing to \nlook at this need and, if appropriate, provide additional support for \nthis research effort before we are asked to give final approval to the \nDefense Appropriations bill later this year?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the senator from Louisiana for raising this \nissue. I understand why the Navy has a need to better understand the \naquatic environment into which it will send its personnel and \nequipment. I am willing to look at the need to support additional \nresearch in this area and to recommend an appropriate response if one \nis indicated.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague and I look forward to working with \nhim to provide for a strong integrated bioenvironmental hazards \nresearch capability for the Navy.\n\n\n                           distance learning\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense \nSubcommittee, Senator Stevens, in a brief colloquy regarding distance \nlearning.\n  As Chairman Stevens may know, the City Colleges of Chicago Europe has \nbeen providing college degree and certificate programs to the U.S. \nmilitary service members and their families in Europe since 1969. In \nfact, the City Colleges of Chicago was one of the early pioneers in \ndistance learning. Today, the program offers over 70 courses on the \nInternet and provides interactive television courses via satellite to \nU.S. peacekeeping forces stationed in the Sinai Desert, Bosnia, and \nHungary.\n  The Senate bill includes an increase for distance learning of $45 \nmillion. Is it the understanding of Chairman Stevens that successful \nprograms like the City Colleges of Chicago Europe should be able to \nwork with the Department of Defense to receive funding?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the Center for Opening Learning at the \nCity Colleges of Chicago--Harold Washington College. I believe that the \nlevel of funding for distance learning in the Senate bill would give \nprograms like the Center for Opening Learning an opportunity to work \nwith the Department of Defense in order to develop additional courses \nand enhance new learning technologies that will ultimately help \nmilitary students stationed overseas.\n\n\n                             electric drive\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of recent \nengineering breakthroughs in the area of naval propulsion. In the past \nfew years, industry has been working hard to develop electric drive \ntechnology that could be used in a naval vessel. Electric drive would \nreplace the traditional mechanical drive system, that turns the ship's \npropellers through a system of reduction gears, with a system that uses \nelectricity directly to turn the engines and power the rest of the \nship's systems.\n  Electric drive offers major benefits over mechanical drive. It is \nmore efficient in terms of reduced fuel consumption and requires fewer \ncrew to maintain. It can also generate more power than mechanical \nsystems. Electric drive is also quieter, making it an attractive option \nfor submarines, or any vessel concerned with stealth. Industry analysts \nbelieve electric drive could save the Navy $4.3 billion over the life \nof the new destroyer program, the DD-21, alone.\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n  Last year the appropriations committee included a provision in the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill asking the Navy to produce a \nreport on the potential for electric drive. The Secretary of the Navy \nreleased the study in March, a study that was a powerful endorsement of \nthe electric drive technology. This report points to electric drive as \na technology that will no doubt have major implications for the future \nof naval ship design and engineering. I hope the Navy will continue its \nresearch efforts, and make every effort to include this technology in \nthe next generation of destroyers, the DD-21. I also hope the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee will maintain its interest in the program \nand continue its support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank Senator Kohl. I agree that the Navy should \ncontinue its research efforts into electric drive, and it should \nstrongly consider the benefits it could bring to the DD-21 Class of \ndestroyers. In addition, I am aware that this technology will also \nprovide important benefits to other future Navy ships such as improved \nstealth for future submarines. By developing a modular, common \nintegrated system, where major system elements can be used on all new \nNavy ship designs without any design changes, the Navy can also realize \nthe multiple benefits of reduced training and logistics costs, as well \nas significant production cost savings.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with the opinions of the chairman and of Senator \nKohl. I consider it essential that our Navy be equipped with the most \nadvanced technology in their future ships. Since electric drive not \nonly offers significant operational benefits, but also significant \nsavings, I most strongly urge the Navy to continue its research work \nand make every effort to ensure that this technology is deployed on DD-\n21.\n  Mr. KOHL. As I am sure the chairman and ranking member are aware, \nmuch of the research into this technology has been privately funded. \nGeneral Dynamics and Eaton Corporation, among others, have been leaders \nin the field of electric drive and their efforts have been crucial to \nmoving the development along. Their investment has presented the Navy \nand Congress with an excellent opportunity to take advantage of \ndevelopments financed in the private sector. As the Navy continues to \nevaluate electric drive and the DD-21 program I hope the committee will \nbe ready to capitalize on that investment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree that this presents us with an excellent \nopportunity. The committee will certainly give the Navy consideration \nshould it make an additional request for funding for electric drive \nresearch.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The potential of electric drive is certainly worth \nexploring, and the committee would be willing to consider a request \nfrom the Navy if they believe it is critical to the DD-21 design \neffort.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank both Senators for their support of continuing \nresearch and evaluation of electric drive. Senators Stevens and Inouye \nhave long been known for their clear vision when it comes to supporting \ncutting edge military technology, and that reputation is well deserved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill \nbefore us today. I would like to sincerely thank Senators Stevens and \nInouye for their strong leadership on the Defense Subcommittee. I also \nwould like to recognize the hard work and diligence of the staff on \nthis Committee.\n  Every year this Committee goes through the exercise of trying to \nallocate sufficient funds for the foremost priorities of providing for \nour nation's defense. Every year under the current funding constraints \nthe difficulty of this task increases. This year is no exception.\n  I would like to briefly mention some of the most important aspects of \nour defense addressed in this spending package.\n  The bill provides $264.7 billion in new spending authority for the \nDepartment of Defense for FY 2000. This is $1.4 billion above the \nPresident's request. This recommendation meets the budget authority and \noutlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation.\n  In parallel with the Defense Authorization bill, the bill funds \nalmost 1.4 million active duty military personnel. This bill fully \nfunds a 4.8-percent pay raise for FY2000 and includes more than $1.838 \nbillion in supplemental spending for military pay.\n  This legislation provides approximately $2.1 billion for overseas \ncontingency operations in Southwest Asia and Bosnia. I and many others \nsuspect we'll be forced to pass an additional emergency supplemental \nfor peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. As Chairman Stevens has already \nindicated, it would be premature to speculate about those possible \nappropriations at this time.\n  The bill includes appropriations totaling $92 billion for operation \nand maintenance (O). This is $626.1 million above the \nAdministration's request.\n  The bill supports the establishment of 17 Rapid Assessment and \nInitial Detection (RAID) teams. And it provides $1.3 billion for \ncombating terrorism. Within the funds for combating terrorism, the bill \nmakes $79.6 million available to provide Army and Air National Guard \nfull-time personnel to facilitate successful achievement of this \nmission.\n  I fully support the decision to appropriate $475.5 million for Former \nSoviet Union Threat Reduction programs. These are important programs \nthat address one of the most significant proliferation threats we face \ntoday. I also would like to voice my strong support for the decision \nthat $25 million be used only to support Russian nuclear submarine \ndismantlement and disposal activities.\n  I also sincerely appreciate the Committee's effort to restore some of \nthe funding required for research, development, test, and evaluation. \nThe increase of $2.1 billion to the budget request will help prevent \nthe loss of scientific and technical expertise within our defense \ninfrastructure. Moreover, this will help ensure that the U.S. maintains \nits technological lead in its defense capabilities.\n  The Committee also funded several items that will ensure that New \nMexico based defense installations and programs remain robust. I would \nlike to briefly highlight some of the items that received funding in \nthe appropriations bill.\n  Directed energy weapons provide the potential of low cost per kill \nratios sought for our missile defense capabilities. In the area of \ndirected energy, $14 million will go for the High Energy Laser Test \nFacility at White Sands, the Army's premier facility for directed \nenergy programs. There is an additional $15 million for the Tactical \nHigh Energy Laser program. This joint program with Israel is very \nimportant to proving the concept of using lasers to achieve defenses \nagainst short and medium range missiles. After significant cuts and \nchanges to its development plan last year, the Airborne Laser program \nis fully funded at $309 million.\n  The Committee added $40 million to the Warfighter Information Network \nprogram. Based at Laguna Industries, this program manufactures mobile \ncommand and control headquarters for a digital Army.\n  An additional $7.5 million was appropriated for modernization of \ntesting equipment at White Sands Missile Range. Also, $6 million will \nbe made available for much needed perimeter fencing to prevent further \naccidents from unexploded ordnances at the range.\n  $10 million is included for the Scorpius Low Cost Launch program. A \nsignificant portion of the research and development for this program is \nbased at Phillips, and testing of the engines and the rocket itself is \nconducted at New Mexico Tech and White Sands. This is an important \nprogram both because of the implications to our national security that \narise from exorbitant launch costs and due to potential cost savings to \ntaxpayers by lower costs for getting payloads into orbit for U.S. \ndefense programs.\n  Several other Phillips based programs also received additional \nsupport, including: $5 million for further research and development on \nradio frequency weapons, $25 million for military spaceplane efforts, \n$5 million for advanced countermeasures using solid state laser \ntechnologies.\n  At my and other member's request, an additional $10 million of \nfunding will be made available for research and development of new \ntechnologies to counter chemical and biological\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\nthreats. $4 million in support was included for the blast mitigation \nresearch of both military and nonmilitary explosives at New Mexico \nTech.\n  Lastly, $10 million in additional funding was added for the Theater \nAir Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF) at Kirtland Air \nForce Base. This will help a great deal in making this facility the \nworld class training facility necessary to maintain combat readiness of \nour Air Force in the coming years.\n  I believe this bill demonstrates the balance required to best fund \nour armed forces under current fiscal constraints. Again, I am pleased \nby the hard work of my colleagues on this Committee and express, once \nagain, my admiration for the hard work of Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye in achieving an appropriate spending package for our military \nmen and women.\n\n\n                 ASSEMBLED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ASSESSMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of \nChemical Weapons Demilitarization. I do so in order to point out that \nthe Department of Defense has consistently ignored Congressional \ndirective and intent.\n  In 1996, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment which \ndirected the Army to identify and demonstrate technologies other than \nbaseline incineration which could be utilized in the destruction of \nAmerica's chemical weapons stockpile. This program, which came to be \nknown as the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment, or ACWA, enjoyed \ntremendous inititial success. Through the involvement of the DoD, the \nArmy, technology providers and citizens advocacy groups--disparate \ninterests, indeed--agreement was reached on how the process should \nproceed as well as the criteria for success. It is also critical to \npoint out that one area of consensus was that the timely destruction of \nthe stockpiles remained a top priority. Nobody involved in this process \nadvocates unnecessary delay in efforts to comply with the Chemical \nWeapons Convention 2007 deadline. Certainly, I never viewed my efforts \nas anything other than a safeguard to ensure that once the destruction \nof the stockpile located in Kentucky began, only the safest method \navailable was utilized.\n  Unfortunately, this is where the good news ends.\n  After rigorous evaluation and discussions, the decision was announced \nthat six separate methods met the technological criteria necessary in \norder to be tested as alternatives to baseline incineration. These six \nwere the only proposals of the almost 20 originally submitted for \nconsideration which were deemed capable of producing safer methods. \nUnfortunately the Army and the Department of Defense made the decision \nto move forward and evaluate only three of the qualified technologies, \nleaving three untested. Further, this decision was made not on the \nbasis of what was technologically feasible, but solely on the basis on \nwhat was cost-efficient. Not in the interests of finding the safest \nmanner available to destroy the weapons, but on satisfying the minimum \nrequirements so that the incineration could continue regardless of the \nresults of the testing.\n  To help ease this budget difficulty, I offered and the Senate \naccepted, an amendment to the FY99 Department of Defense Appropriations \nBill which gave the Secretary of Defense the Authority to reprogram up \nto $25 million in order to fully test each of the technologies which \nmet the criteria for selection as potential alternatives to \nincineration. This provision was included in the final version of the \nDefense bill, and was eventually signed into law.\n  Mr. President, despite this clear expression of Congressional intent, \nthe Army, the Department and the Administration have consistently \nrefused to allocate sufficient funds to complete the testing. As a \nresult, the ACWA program is in danger of losing its credibility--the \nvery quality that led to its initial successes. If the testing of the \nthree technologies does not produce a viable alternative to \nincineration, then the legitimate question will be posed, ``What about \nthe additional proposals which were viewed to have merit as \nalternatives to incineration?''\n  Not wishing to answer that question, I worked to encourage the \nadministration to agree that further testing was cost effective and in \nthe best interests of the country. Their responses, which I will submit \nfor the Record, professed their strong support for the goals of the \nACWA program, but claimed that the budget was simply too tight for the \nDepartment to reprogram funds for additional testing.\n  With all due respect, that contention is simply false. The truth is \nthat the Department of Defense and the Army made a decision years ago \nthat they would eliminate chemical weapons using incineration and have \nresisted considering other options since that time.\n  This year's report, Senate Report 105-53, states that ``the Committee \nis concerned with the lack of oversight afforded the Chemical \nDemilitarization Program within the executive branch.''\n  Further the Report states:\n\n       In a review of the program's funding, the Committee \n     discovered that funds had systematically been obligated \n     without being expended and in some instances funds were \n     unobligated. Rather than facing a shortfall in funding, the \n     program had over $200,000,000 of Operation and Maintenance \n     funds unexpended at the end of fiscal year 1998. In light of \n     the unobligated and unexpended balances available to the \n     Department, the program growth in the budget request is not \n     justified.\n\n  Mr. President, this language is a stinging indictment of the \nDepartment's mismanagement of the Chemical Demilitarization program. \nFurther it demonstrates clearly that there is no truth to the assertion \nthat there were not sufficient funds available to allow for the \ndemonstration of all viable alternatives to baseline incineration.\n  I intend to continue to press the Army to test all six technologies \nso that the citizens who live near our stockpiles may be assured that \nonly the safest methods available are employed to destroy chemical \nweapons.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: This responds to your interest in \n     the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) Program. I \n     regret any misunderstanding we may have had about responding \n     to your concerns on this matter.\n       As you know, Congress has directed the Department to \n     demonstrate and evaluate at least two alternatives to \n     baseline incineration for the disposal of assembled chemical \n     munitions. The ACWA Program actually identified six \n     technologies, exceeding the original requirement, but was \n     able to fund only three--the three that were ranked as the \n     best value to the U.S. Government. We would like to go \n     further, but the entire amount appropriated for support of \n     ACWA in the Fiscal year 1999 Defense Appropriations Act will \n     be required to complete demonstration testing and conduct a \n     non-government independent evaluation of cost and schedule \n     with regard to implementing an alternative technology.\n       The Act also provided authority to use up to an additional \n     $25 million of the funds appropriated for the Chemical \n     Demilitarization program in order to complete ACWA \n     demonstrations. This language, however, addressed authority \n     only; no additional funds were appropriated. While we will \n     vigorously press for savings in the Chemical Demilitarization \n     program, at this point, we are unable to exercise \n     reprogramming authority without jeopardizing our ability to \n     meet the Chemical Weapons Convention mandate of April 2007 \n     for destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile. If, \n     however, additional funding becomes available in the coming \n     fiscal year to support the ACWA Program, we plan to expand \n     the scope of demonstration testing beyond the three \n     technologies already programmed.\n       Successful disposal of the chemical munitions stockpile and \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention are among our \n     highest national security priorities. The ACWA Program is a \n     critical component of this effort. I want to thank you for \n     your support of this important program. Again, I regret any \n     misunderstanding concerning my response to your interest in \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Hamre.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: This is in reply to your letter to \n     Secretary Cohen regarding the Assembled Chemical Weapons \n     Assessment (ACWA) program. In that letter you asked about the \n     Department's plans for testing of alternative technologies.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n       As you may be aware, the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997 mandated that we \n     identify and demonstrate not less than two alternatives to \n     the baseline incineration process for the demilitarization of \n     assembled chemical munitions. In selecting three technologies \n     to proceed to final demonstration testing we have exceeded \n     that requirement. We recognize the intent of the Senate as \n     evidenced in Sec. 8143 of the Senate passed FY 1999 DoD \n     Appropriation Bill. If additional funding becomes available \n     in the coming fiscal year to support the ACWA program, we \n     plan to reexamine the scope of demonstration testing.\n       A similar letter has been sent to your colleagues who \n     joined you in writing to Secretary Cohen regarding this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Lynn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Executive Office of the President\n\n                                    Washington DC, March 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your letter about the \n     Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) program. The \n     President requested that I respond directly to your letter. \n     The Administration shares your goals of safely disposing of \n     our chemical weapons stockpile and has been supportive of \n     your efforts to find environmentally sound alternatives to \n     the baseline incineration system for destroying these \n     chemical weapons.\n       As you know, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997 created \n     the ACWA program and provided $40 million ``to identify and \n     demonstrate not less than two alternatives to the baseline \n     incineration process for the demilitarization of assembled \n     chemical munitions.'' In time, the ACWA program identified \n     six alternatives. Due to limitations of funds, only three \n     alternative technologies were selected for further \n     development and testing, one more than required by the 1977 \n     Act. To fund the third alternative, funds had to be \n     reprogrammed from the baseline Chemical Demilitarization \n     program, which supports a safe and effective disposal process \n     in order to fund research into an additional system that may \n     or may not be selected at a future date for implementation.\n       As you pointed out in your letter, the FY 1999 Defense \n     Appropriations Act provides authority to reprogram up to $25 \n     million from the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction, \n     Defense account to fund the demonstration of alternatives to \n     baseline incineration. Unfortunately, the Act also reduced \n     the President's request for the account by $78 million. This \n     reduction will severely challenge the Army's ability to \n     successfully destroy this Nation's chemical stockpile by \n     April 29, 2007, as required by the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. As a result of the $78 million reduction, to date \n     we have been unable to identify available funds in the \n     Chemical Demilitarization program to reprogram to ACWA for \n     additional demonstration projects.\n       The Administration's policy is to proceed as quickly as \n     possible with the safe destruction of the Nation's chemical \n     stockpile, while at the same time seeking even safer and more \n     effective methods. The National Academy of Sciences concluded \n     in its 1994 study that the baseline incineration system is a \n     safe and effective disposal process for the stockpile. The \n     Administration will continue to seek even safer methods. We \n     look forward to working with you to that end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                         Director.\n\n\n    The Gallo Research Center at the University of California, San \n                               Francisco\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to see language in the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations report which recommends $300 \nmillion for medical research and development efforts to be used for \nlife-saving medical projects, including breast cancer and prostate \ncancer research.\n  Of the $300 million, the Committee recommends that $50 million is to \nbe made available for peer reviewed medical research grants and \nactivities. Further, the Committee directs that the Secretary of \nDefense, in conjunction with the service of the Surgeons General, \nestablish a process to select medical research projects of clear \nscientific merit and direct relevance to military health. One of the \nprojects listed as having scientific merit and direct relevance to \nmilitary health is that of alcohol abuse and prevention research.\n  I believe that alcohol abuse and prevention efforts must be supported \nby Congress. We have all been witness to broken families, broken lives \nand lost opportunities attributed to alcoholism. To that end, I would \nlike to share with my colleagues the promising research being conducted \nto combat alcoholism at the Gallo Center in San Francisco, California.\n  The mission of the Gallo Center is to identify genes that control \nbrain responses to alcohol and other addicting agents and then develop \nnew drugs to treat addiction. It is the only alcoholism research \nprogram in the country that is based with a department of neurology. \nThe Gallo Center is fully equipped for research in cellular, molecular, \nand behavioral neuroscience and also invertebrate and human genetics.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Feinstein, in her request for $11 \nmillion from the Medical Research activities budget in the Department \nof Defense Appropriations bill to support alcoholism research at the \nGallo Center located at the University of California, San Francisco \nMedical School. I believe that the important work conducted at the \nGallo Center qualifies under the medical research project directive as \nrecommended by the Committee, and that it should be funded from the $50 \nmillion already made available for peer reviewed medical research \ngrants and activities.\n  The Department of Defense Health Program has appropriately identified \nalcoholism research as a priority area. I believe that providing $11 \nmillion from the Medical Research activities budget in the Department \nof Defense Appropriations bill for the Gallo Research Center at the \nUniversity of California, San Francisco would prove to be a worthwhile \ninvestment in our efforts to learn more about alcoholism, it causes, \nand what we can do to fight it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, page 95 of the report accompanying S. \n1122 contains language that encourages the Army to include Rock Island \nArsenal in all aspects of the development, design and production of the \nLightweight 155mm Towed Howitzer Program. This directive is problematic \nfor many reasons. If followed, it would undermine industrial \ncompetition and conflict with the fair and competitive process that has \noccurred to date. It would preclude further competition for the 155mm \nTowed Howitzer and all future towed artillery programs. And the report \nlanguage would potentially contradict several statutes, including the \nArmy Industrial Facilities Act, the Working Capital Funds Act, and the \nArsenal Act.\n  The contract for this program has already been awarded on a \ncompetitive basis. Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering LTD developed \nthe original design and owns background intellectual property in the \ncurrent Lightweight 155mm system. Attempting now to direct the work to \nRock Island would potentially detract from work done at Picatinny \nArsenal in my home state of New Jersey, as well as potentially create \nall sorts of legal fights. While Rock Island should be encouraged to \ncompete for a subcontract, all future awards should be made on a \n``best-value'' basis. Any legislative micromanagement that compromises \nthe competitive bidding process is inconsistent with legal and economic \nprudence. I urge such ill-advised acquisition guidance to be dropped \nwhen the Senate convenes with the House to conference this bill.\n\n\n                       Mc Gregor Range Withdrawal\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations bill would renew the withdrawal of the McGregor Range \nfor use by the U.S. Army.\n  McGregor Range is one of six military parcels withdrawn from public \ndomain in 1986. These parcels comprise nearly 30 percent of the \nDepartment of Defense's 25 million acres. The lands will revert to the \npublic domain in 2001 unless Congress passes new legislation.\n  This amendment is specific to the 608,000 acres utilized by Fort \nBliss and does not address any of the other renewals for other military \ninstallations.\n  McGregor Range comprises nearly 700,000 of Fort Bliss's 1.12 million \nacres. The Fort Bliss garrison is adjacent to El Paso, Texas, but the \nMcGregor Range is located entirely in New Mexico.\n  Sections of McGregor are used for cattle grazing and other \nnonmilitary purposes such as hunting and recreation. The Bureau of Land \nManagement manages the cattle-grazing program through close \ncoordination with the Army. These cooperative efforts provide for \nefficient use of the lands as well as effective stewardship of the \nnatural resources located there.\n  Recent studies of this issue provides a succinct summary of the most \nrelevant policy issues surrounding the renewal of withdrawal for \nmilitary purposes. Mr. President, allow me to briefly list the major \nfindings of this study:\n  Fort Bliss has a critical role as a national center for air defense \nand\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nMcGregor Range is essential for fulfilling that role;\n  McGregor Range is the only range in the United States capable of \ntraining America's air and missile defense forces. Because all CONUS \nPatriot forces are stationed at Ft. Bliss they depend on McGregor for \nthe training needed to ensure their full readiness prior to deployment.\n  Successive BRAC rounds have reduced the capability of the DOD to \nsupport both current and future training and testing requirements with \nthe available infrastructure. Range complexes such as McGregor and \nWhite Sands Missile Range are critical now and will become more \ncritical in the future as weapons systems and doctrine evolve which \nallow greater stand-off distances and mobility in the future. These \ncapabilities are wasted if we fail to train our forces to the maximum \nextent of their capabilities.\n  McGregor Range supports the U.S. Air Force in the training activities \nat Holloman Air Force Base.\n  The combined space of McGregor Range and White Sands can be leveraged \nto accommodate the needs of a more modern Army. Currently, the range \nsupports specialized test operations by White Sands Missile Range which \nrequire additional safety buffer zones to ensure public safety.\n  Military training and testing requirements for McGregor Range are \nforeseen for at least the next 50 years based on weapons systems that \nare either currently fielded, such as Patriot, or are planned for \nfielding in the near future. Additionally, emerging doctrine and weapon \nsystems part of the Army-After-Next will require large areas to fully \ntrain soldiers in the employment of these weapons systems. If the \nrequirement is known for the next fifty years, then it is unclear why a \nshorter withdrawal period is reasonable.\n  The BLM's 1986 Wilderness Study made a ``No Wilderness'' \nrecommendation regarding the Culp Canyon WSA. This recommendation was \n``based on the low-quality wilderness value of the WSA and the \npotential conflicts with associated military use of the area.'' Without \nthis portion of the range, the Army's ability to conduct Patriot and \nrelated air and missile defense training will be reduced by \napproximately one-third.\n  There is strong regional support for this renewal. 176 public \ncomments expressed support for the Army's preferred alternative. An \nadditional 26 expressed support for one of the other alternatives.\n  The Army's proposal will continue historic non-military uses of the \nrange which include livestock grazing and hunting for 50 years.\n  The Army has already met its obligations with respect to performing \nan Environmental Impact Statement, holding public hearings, and \nsubmission of request for renewal to the Administration.\n  In sum, all of the legal requirements set forth by Congress have been \nmet. Congressional action is now required to ensure that the Army \nretains its ability to test, simulate, and train for missions at Fort \nBliss. Allowing the Army's continued access to these lands is critical \nto adequate training and readiness now and in the future.\n  One of the fundamental duties of Congress is the maintenance of the \nnational defense. Nothing is more fundamental than the provision of \ntraining ranges, such as McGregor, in maintaining a trained and \nprepared military.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not object to my colleague's \namendment to renew the public land withdrawal for the McGregor Range in \nNew Mexico, however, I believe the preferable course of action is to \nfollow the process the Senate agreed to just last month, and allow the \nDefense and Interior Departments the opportunity to jointly develop a \nlegislative proposal.\n  The McGregor Range in southern New Mexico was one of several military \nranges that was last withdrawn for military purposes in 1986 under \nPublic Law 99-606. The withdrawal period for McGregor and the other \nranges is for 15 years, and does not expire until November, 2001.\n  Last month, language was included in the Committee-reported version \nof S. 1059, the DOD Authorization bill, that would have extended public \nland withdrawals at four of the six military installations covered by \nPublic Law 99-606: the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, \nthe McGregor Range in New Mexico, and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely \nin Alaska. During the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor, I \noffered an amendment which replaced the withdrawal language with a \n``sense of the Senate'' statement urging the Administration to submit \nlegislative proposals for these four military withdrawals by July 1. I \nunderstand that both the Defense and Interior Departments are currently \nworking on such a legislative proposal and that we still anticipate \nbeing able to incorporate legislative language in the conference report \nfor the DOD Authorization bill.\n  With respect to the proposed amendment for the McGregor Range, I want \nto be clear that I recognize the critical role the range serves for our \nnational defense training needs and I support their continued use for \nthese purposes. In my opinion, however, I think it makes much more \nsense, and will result in less controversy in the long run, if we allow \nthe normal process for the renewal of the public land withdrawals to be \ncompleted. In short, this means allowing the Interior Department the \nopportunity to review the Army's environmental impact statement, which \nI understand has only just been completed, and that following that \nreview, the Administration has the opportunity to submit its \nlegislative proposal for our consideration.\n  The McGregor withdrawal encompasses approximately 608,000 acres of \nland in New Mexico. The renewal of the withdrawal and future uses of \nthe range are of interest not only to the Army, but also to area \nresidents and other public land users. Although the amendment is not \nclear, I am concerned that it materially changes some of the withdrawal \nterms from the 1986 Act.\n  For example, the 1986 Act authorized a withdrawal period of 15 years. \nThis amendment provides for a 50-year withdrawal. I understand that the \nmilitary desires a longer withdrawal period than the current 15 years, \nand I am not opposed to considering a longer term. But meaningful \nperiodic reviews and environmental analyses serve an important purpose. \nThey provide local communities with an opportunity to raise issues \nabout the way these lands are managed, and they allow us to consider \nnew land management issues which may not have been present when the \noriginal withdrawals were made. I think it is a mistake to \nsignificantly change this policy without at least the opportunity for \npublic hearings.\n  Another aspect of the amendment that seems to be a significant \ndeparture from past management practices is a requirement that the \nSecretary of the Army manage the withdrawn lands. Under current law, \nthe lands are managed by the Bureau of Land Management for a variety of \nmultiple use purposes, subject to the limitations of the military uses. \nFor example, the 1986 Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \nmanage the lands in a manner permitting the continuation of grazing, \nthe protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat, the control of \npredators, recreation, and the suppression of brush fires.\n  This amendment now provides for management by the Army, under the \nterms of a new agreement to be developed between the Army and the \nInterior Department, which is to provide for the proper management and \nprotection of natural and cultural resources. It may very well be that \nsuch an agreement will adequately provide for other non-military uses \nand protect sensitive natural and cultural resources. However, there is \nno requirement that the lands be managed under existing law, including \nthe Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The amendment also appears \nto leave very important land management questions unanswered. For \nexample, the BLM currently manages the Culp Canyon Wilderness Study \nArea within the McGregor Range, as well as an ``Area of Critical \nEnvironmental Concern.'' Under this amendment, is the Army required to \nmanage those areas to the same degree of protection as required of the \nSecretary of the Interior? Again, at the very least, I think it is \nimportant that all interested parties should be heard on these issues \nbefore we decide how to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by again urging the \nAdministration to expeditiously complete its legislative proposal by \nthe end of this month. Although I would prefer to hear\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nthe Administration's proposal, I am committed to seeing that the \nMcGregor range renewal is enacted this year. If, however, a timely \nproposal is submitted by the Administration, I hope that we will be \nable to include appropriate legislative language to renew the \nwithdrawal for McGregor and the other affected ranges as part of the \nconference report for the DOD Authorization bill.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFY 2000 appropriations bill. This legislation demonstrates a strong \ncommitment to America's defense and to our ability to meet future \nmilitary challenges. I especially thank and acknowledge the efforts of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nDefense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, the distinguished ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and the ranking member \nof the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, for their work and support \nof this legislation.\n  I am particularly pleased that the committee included $1 million for \nexciting new technology designed to make landmine detection safer and \nmore effective. This technology, known as nonlinear technique for \nlandmine detection, has been developed by engineers at the Davidson \nLaboratory of the Stevens Institute in my home State of New Jersey. \nThis new method for detection of mines and other buried man-made \nobjects has been devised in such a way as to differentiate between \nrocks, other solids and actual landmines through acoustics. This \ntechnology will increase our ability to meet our international \nobligations and dramatically improve the safety and security of our \narmed forces.\n  I also express my support for the committee's inclusion of an \nadditional $121 million for the production of 11 new Black Hawk \nhelicopters. A coalition of eight companies in my state manufacture \ncritical components for the Black Hawk, which is the Army's premier \ntactical transport helicopter. First produced in 1977, it is used for \ncombat assault, combat re-supply, battlefield command and control, \nelectronic warfare and medical evacuation. Currently, the Black Hawk is \nproviding critical support functions for our armed services in Kosovo. \nThis funding will ensure that our military has the ability to continue \nits current operations and sustain readiness for future dangers.\n  I am also extremely pleased that this legislation represents a \nsignificant increase in our commitment to the Defense Health Program. \nThe inclusion of $175 million for the breast cancer program, and the \n$75 million for the prostate cancer research programs, has special \nsignificance for the constituents I represent. New Jersey's breast \ncancer incidence rate is among the highest in the Nation; and, more \nthan 1,400 of the 6,900 New Jersey men diagnosed with prostate cancer \ndie each year. I am confident that these funding initiatives will bring \nus much closer to finding answers for the men and women of New Jersey \nand nationwide, who suffer from these devastating diseases.\n  Additionally, the pay raise of almost 5 percent for all members of \nthe military included in this bill deals with serious concerns I have \nhad regarding quality of life and morale of our soldiers. By addressing \nthe inequities between military pay and civilian wages, this pay raise \nwill go a long way toward reaching our goals of retaining highly \ntrained personnel and assist in our ability to achieve recruiting \ngoals.\n  Finally, while I am supportive of these important components of this \nlegislation, I am extremely concerned with the committee's \nrecommendation that the Army and the Marine Corps develop a plan to \ninclude the Rock Island Arsenal in all aspects of howitzer development, \ndesign, and production for the Lightweight 155mm.\n  Currently, critical research and development functions for the \nhowitzer take place under the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments \nCommand, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center at \nPicatinny Arsenal, NJ. The howitzer, as well as other important \nmilitary systems, require sophisticated software which may only be \nfielded by Picatinny Arsenal. If the committee's proposal is \nimplemented, I fear that Rock Island Arsenal will ultimately assume \nimportant research and development responsibilities for the howitzer \nfor which they have never before played a role and may be unqualified \nto preform. I encourage the committee to strongly consider these \nconcerns which have similarly been expressed by the Army and Marine \nCorps.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Chairman Stevens, Ranking Member Byrd, \nand Ranking Member Inouye for their commitment and attention to these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct.\n  Mr. President, it is almost painful to witness the way in which this \nSenate is abdicating its responsibility to scrutinize the Department of \nDefense. During debate on the fiscal year 2000 DoD authorization bill, \nwe had exactly two amendments that called a multi-billion dollars \nweapons system into question. On this appropriations bill, we had \nexactly two amendments worthy of extensive debate. Two amendments, Mr. \nPresident. Here we have a defense policy that perpetuates a Cold War \nmentality into the 21st century, and the Senate has no questions.\n  Mr. President, on the heels of an authorization bill that exemplifies \nthe Pentagon's utter failure to adapt its priorities to the post-Cold \nWar era, the American taxpayer is left holding the bag paying for the \nmess. There are a number of theories that attempt to explain the \ndifficulties faced by the armed services. There is a dearth of \nthoughtful solutions. The general consensus is that if we pour enough \nmoney into the Defense Department, the problems will go away. \nUnfortunately, effective problem-solving doesn't work that way.\n  The DoD has a weapons modernization strategy that makes it impossible \nto buy enough new weapons to replace all the old weapons on a timely \nbasis, even though forces are much smaller than they were during the \nCold War and modernization budgets are projected to return to Cold War \nlevels. Consequently, the ratio of old weapons to new weapons in our \nactive inventories will grow to unprecedented levels over the next \ndecade.\n  Subsequently, that modernization strategy is driving up the operating \nbudgets needed to maintain adequate readiness, even though the size of \nour forces is now smaller than it was during the Cold War. Each new \ngeneration of high complexity weapons costs much more to operate than \nits predecessor, and the low rate of replacement forces the longer \nretention and use of older weapons. Thus, as weapons get older, they \nbecome more expensive to operate, maintain, and supply.\n  Couple this with an accounting system that has failed each and every \nGAO audit since enactment of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, \nand you have a poorly managed, misguided strategy inviting disaster.\n  Instead of thoughtfully addressing these shortcomings, Mr. President, \nwe proceed to spend the American taxpayers' money as we have in the \npast. No change. We continue to promote bigger and more expensive \nweapons systems at the expense of our men and women in uniform. No \nmatter how much money we throw at this problem, we won't find a \nsolution if we stay on this track.\n  For the past year, Mr. President, we've heard the call to address our \nmilitary's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told \nthat foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and \nmaintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts.\n  Just last year, there was a virtual consensus that the armed services \nwere facing a readiness crisis. Last September, the Joint Chiefs \ntestified that there was a dangerous readiness shortfall. General Henry \nShelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, claimed that ``without relief, \nwe will see a continuation of the downward trends in readiness . . . \nand shortfalls in critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis \nReimer stated that the military faces a ``hollow force'' without \nincreased readiness spending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay \nJohnson asserted that the Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit. So \nit went for all the services.\n  To address the readiness shortfall, Mr. President, the Congress \npassed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill was \nwell-intentioned in its support for the efforts of our men\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nand women in uniform. Unfortunately, something happened on the way to \nthe front lines. The bill spent close to $9 billion, but just $1 \nbillion of it went to address the readiness shortfall.\n  We added $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization still hasn't spent all that money, yet \nwe've added another $3.5 billion for the BMDO in this bill. Last year's \nsupplemental also added billions to what has become an expected \nemergency, that being our operations in Bosnia. That other unexpected \nemergency, the year 2000, received a billion dollars. And so it went. \nWhat happened to readiness?\n  One provision in this bill casts a pall over the readiness needs of \nour service members and highlights, in microcosm, the Defense \nDepartment's misguided priorities. This appropriations bill will spend \nupwards of $40 million in the next fiscal year, and perhaps as much as \nhalf a billion dollars over the next ten years on luxury jets for four-\nstar generals. Am I missing something or is this absurd? We actually \nhave more than 11,000 troops that qualify for food stamps and DoD can \njustify spending tens of millions of dollars next year for luxury jets. \nHow can this be?\n  Mr. President, one concern goes to the heart of the entire debate on \nour national defense. The underlying question is this: Why should the \nPentagon receive billions dollars more in funding when it has failed \nutterly to manage its budget? Throwing good money after bad isn't \ntolerated at other departments and agencies. Why is it tolerated with \nDoD?\n  Defense Week reported just yesterday that the Navy has lost track of \nalmost $1 billion worth of ammunition, arms and explosives. \nAdditionally, DoD has yet to pass an audit. A 1998 GAO audit couldn't \nmatch more than $22 billion in DoD expenditures with obligations; it \ncould not find over $9 billion in inventory; and it documented millions \nin overpayments to contractors. GAO concluded that ``no major part of \nDoD has been able to pass the test of an independent audit.''\n  Mr. President, this bill also has some painful implications for other \nfederal programs. Essentially, we are spending tax dollars on a \nwasteful and misguided defense strategy while domestic programs face \nsteep spending cuts in the upcoming fiscal year.\n  The bill exceeds the Pentagon's request by $1.4 billion. It spends \n$1.4 billion more than the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe is sufficient \nto meet our national defense needs. And that additional money is coming \nout of vital domestic programs that were already facing spending cuts.\n  Mr. President, I cannot vote to increase the defense budget by tens \nof billions of dollars, including tens of millions for corporate jets, \nwhile the budgets for veterans health care, education, agriculture and \nother programs are facing deep cuts. Supporting the Defense \nDepartment's misguided spending priorities is not synonymous with \nsupporting the military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 1122, the Defense \nappropriations bill for FY 2000. As scored with adjustments, the \npending bill provides $264.9 billion in total budget authority and \n$176.9 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related \nactivities. When adjusted for outlays from prior years and other \nactions, the bill totals $263.9 billion in BA and $254.6 billion in \noutlays.\n  There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the \nSenate for review.\n  The bill is consistent with the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement \nand the discretionary spending cap. In fact, in both budget authority \nand outlays the bill is below the amount that the Congressional Budget \nResolution for fiscal year 2000 would contemplate for the Defense \nSubcommittee's allocation. This is in recognition of the fact that \nreadiness items originally planned for fiscal year 2000 were \naccelerated into fiscal year 1999 in the 1999 Emergency Kosovo \nSupplemental, which the President has signed into law.\n  As a result, for budget authority, this bill is $3.1 billion below \nthe allocation originally contemplated for it; for outlays it is $2.2 \nbillion below. Because of this situation, the allocation approved by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee for defense has been reduced and \nheld for subsequent reallocation.\n  In addition, this year the defense budget is once again confronted \nwith a serious mismatch between the DOD/OMB and the CBO estimates of \nthe outlays needed to execute the programs in the budget request. CBO's \nestimate of outlays was $10.5 billion higher than OMB and DOD's \nestimate.\n  Because the President's proposed budget was over the discretionary \ncap by such a larch amount, compensating for the OMB and DOD undercount \nof outlays would require very large reductions in manpower, \nprocurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that are simply not \nacceptable, especially in view of the conflict in the Balkans. To \nenable this bill to be considered on a basis commensurate with the \nPresident's request, an outlay adjustment of that size is included in \nthe scoring of this bill.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has assured me that this \naction reduces the 2000 outlays shortage to manageable dimensions and \navoids the negative effect on readiness or modernization that would \notherwise be necessary.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to \ncompliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very \nskillful handling of this important legislation and for his \nstatesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this \nyear's defense budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee \ntable displaying the budget impact of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   S. 1122, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  General\n                                  purpose    Crime  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.............   263,722   ......       209    263,931\n  Outlays......................   254,409   ......       209    254,618\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............   263,722   ......       209    263,931\n  Outlays......................   254,409   ......       209    254,618\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority.............   250,330   ......       197    250,527\n  Outlays......................   248,310   ......       197    248,507\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............   264,896   ......       209    265,105\n  Outlays......................   258,610   ......       209    258,819\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............  .........  ......  .........  .........\n  Outlays......................  .........  ......  .........  .........\n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n              TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............  .........  ......  .........  .........\n  Outlays......................  .........  ......  .........  .........\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority.............    13,392   ......        12     13,404\n  Outlays......................     6,099   ......        12      6,111\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............

Mr. President, I commend the able managers of this bill, \nSenator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for producing a balanced and \ncomprehensive bill that addresses some of the most pressing needs of \nthe U.S. military.\n  Together with the emergency supplemental spending bill that Congress \nsent to the President last month, and the Defense authorization bill \nthat the Senate passed prior to Memorial Day, this Defense \nappropriations bill marks a major commitment to our men and women in \nuniform by funding a wide array of vital defense programs. In acting \nquickly and decisively on these three bills, the Senate has sent a \nstrong message of support to the military, particularly to those forces \ncurrently engaged in the air war over Yugoslavia. That support is \nrichly deserved. Once again, America's military forces have \ndemonstrated their superior skills and leadership in the Balkan \nconflict. We are indebted to them for their service and dedication to \ntheir country.\n  This appropriations bill represents a strong effort on the part of \nthe managers to balance the very real needs of the Defense Department \nagainst the pressing needs of other domestic programs in the budget. \nThis is a tough year for the appropriators. We are working under very \ntight budget caps to meet a whole host of escalating infrastructure \nneeds--both physical and human--in this nation. Senator Stevens was \nable to trim slightly more than $3 billion from defense spending to \nallocate to other programs without damaging the integrity of this bill. \nEven so, it will be difficult to pass all 13 appropriations bills for \nFiscal Year\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n2000 within the constraints of the current budget caps. I do not know \nwhat the resolution to this problem will be, but I commend Senator \nStevens for the steps he has taken so far, and I look forward to \nworking with him on the remaining appropriations bills.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, inadvertently, at my request, the Senate \nadopted the Domenici amendment twice. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe in order to vitiate the adoption of amendment No. 604. It is a \nduplicate of amendment No. 577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The bill is ready to be advanced to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be read for the third time.\n  The bill (S. 1122) was read the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I once again thank all Members of the \nSenate for their cooperation with us in handling this very \ncontroversial bill. I thank my constant companion and good friend, the \ncochairman of our Defense Subcommittee. I yield to him for any comment \nhe might might make before I ask for the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional \ndedication, vision, and public service of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff \nSevers who is leaving the Air Force Legislative Liaison Office for \nassignment as the program manager for the Wind Corrected Munitions \nDispenser Program at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. It is a privilege \nfor me to recognize the many outstanding achievements he has provided \nfor the Senate, the Air Force, and our great Nation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Severs has served our country with distinction for \nnearly 14 years. After graduating from the University of Georgia in \n1985, he embarked on his Air Force Career with a training assignment at \nKeesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. He subsequently completed tours of \nduty at McClellan Air Force Base, California; Wright-Patterson Air \nForce Base, Ohio; Los Angeles Air Force Base, California; and back \nagain to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In each of his Air Force \nassignments, Lieutenant Colonel Severs' performance has been \noutstanding.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Severs began his tour on Capitol Hill as a \nlegislative fellow assigned to the office of my esteemed colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Jim Inhofe. During this assignment, he worked on the \nfiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. After his assignment with \nSenator Inhofe, Lieutenant Colonel Severs was reassigned to the Air \nForce Office of Legislative Liaison in the Pentagon.\n  Initially, he was responsible for acquisition and logistics issues \nand was responsible for preparing the Secretary of the Air Force and \nChief of Staff of the Air Force for posture testimony. He was then \nselected to be the Executive Officer to the Director of Air Force \nLegislative Liaison followed shortly thereafter by his reassignment as \nDeputy Chief of the Air Force Senate Liaison Office.\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\n  Lieutenant Colonel Severs has earned the respect and trust of many of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle. His professional abilities \nand expertise enabled him to foster excellent working relationships \nthat have served the Air Force and the Senate exceptionally well. As a \nliaison officer in the Senate, Lieutenant Colonel Severs has provided \nmembers and staff with informative and timely support regarding Air \nForce plans, programs, and constituent casework. His efforts have \ncontributed greatly to maintaining the best trained, best equipped, and \nbest prepared Air Force in the world.\n  Mr. President, Jeff Severs, his wife, Gay, and children, Hugh and \nBrooke, have made many sacrifices during his 14-year Air Force career. \nHe continues to serve with a dedication and enthusiasm seen only in our \nNation's best and brightest. He is a great credit to the Air Force and \nthe country, and his efforts on behalf of members and staff of the \nSenate will be greatly missed. As he now departs for new challenges at \nEglin Air Force Base, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to recognize his service to the Senate and wish him well in his \nnew assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6693-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

S. 744 would also transfer to the federal \ngovernment 29 inholdings currently owned by the University within \nconservation system units in Alaska.\n  When this bill was passed out of Committee it was done so with an \namendment that clarified the lands the University was to relinquish \nunder Section 3 of the bill.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to call my \ncolleagues' attention to the importance of women's health care issues. \nI came to know the importance of women's health early in life. Some of \nyou may know that my mother suffered from tuberculosis. Back in those \ndays, patients with TB had to be isolated, so my mother was living in a \nsanatorium. I could not see her in person, only through the windows.\n  In the past, women's health did not receive the attention it \ndeserves. I believe it is time to change that. If we are to eliminate \nthe diseases that especially afflict women today, we will need real \ndedication to the task of developing new treatments and prevention \ntechniques.\n  And because women make many of the health care decisions for \nfamilies, their decisions touch the health of many people--children, \nspouses, elderly parents and relatives. In this great country of ours, \nwhere we emphasize personal responsibility, good health care decisions \nare fundamental to quality health.\n  As medical science advances into new territory, expanded choices will \ngive women unprecedented opportunities to live better and longer lives, \nand to affect the quality of health care in our country. Women will be \ncalled upon to take charge of their own health as well\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nas to demand medical excellence for their families. Only with the help \nof such informed decision makers will we be able to develop policies \nwhich assure all Americans access to affordable, quality health care.\n  In an effort to highlight women's health care and to make women aware \nof the health care choices that are available to them, I recently co-\nhosted a forum, Health Care: What Every Woman Should Know, with our \nformer colleague in the Senate, Hank Brown, now President of the \nUniversity of Northern Colorado. The conference featured a number of \npanelists who discussed the latest research and treatment of various \nkinds of cancer as well as depression and eating disorders. Legislative \ninitiatives and solutions were also part of the forum agenda.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the forum \nagenda and an article from the Greeley Tribune newspaper highlighting \nremarks of the keynote speaker Assistant Surgeon General Susan \nBlumenthal be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Health Care: What Every Woman Should Know\n\n  Sponsored by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and the University of \n                           Northern Colorado)\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 1999.\n       Dear Friends: Thank you for attending today's forum, Health \n     Care: What Every Woman Should Know. I am honored to co-host \n     this event with the University of Northern Colorado, and I \n     hope today's forum provides you with knowledge to ensure a \n     healthier life for you and your families.\n       I have always worked to ensure access to affordable, high \n     quality health care. Women's health has historically received \n     little attention and it is time that we correct that. Because \n     women are the primary care givers and make most of the health \n     care decisions for families, it is important to make women \n     aware of the advances that are taking place in the areas of \n     research, detection, treatment and prevention.\n       Personal health choices are fundamental to quality health \n     care. Today's forum will highlight approaches that can lead \n     to early intervention, less invasive and less expensive \n     treatment and cost-saving strategies.\n       I sincerely hope you will use what you learn today to make \n     positive health care choices.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n\n                                 agenda\n\n       8:30 a.m.--Registration Confirmation: Coffee, fruit, \n     bagels.\n       9:00 a.m.--Welcome: UNC President Hank Brown and Senator \n     Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n       9:15 a.m.--Panel I: Confronting the ``C'' Word--Moderator: \n     Kim Christiansen, Channel 9 News Anchor.\n       Saving Your Skin: Skin Cancer--Jim Martin, PhD, GNP;\n       The Capricious Cancer: Breast Cancer--Alison Merrill, RN, \n     MS;\n       The Silent Cancer: Ovarian Cancer--Susan Carter, MD;\n       Survival and Beyond: Cancer Rehabilitation--Susan Carter, \n     MD.\n       10:20 a.m.--Break.\n       10:35 a.m.--Panel II: Mind and Body Connections--Moderator: \n     Adele Arakawa, Channel 9 News Anchor--\n       Your Mind and Moods: Dealing with Depression--Maria \n     deMontigny Korb, RN, PhD;\n       The Fear of Being Fat: Eating Disorders--Judy Stauter Huse, \n     RD, MS;\n       How to Change with the Change of Life--Meredith Mayer, RN, \n     MS, FNP.\n       11:35 a.m.--Getting the Best Care: How You Can Be An \n     Advocate (Legislative Initiatives and Solutions)--Raissa \n     Geary, MA, Professional Staff, U.S. Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor and Pensions Committee.\n       Noon--Lunch: Guest Speaker: Susan Blumenthal, MD, MPA, \n     Assistant Surgeon General--``Critical Public Health Issues \n     for Women in the 21st Century''.\n       1:00 p.m.--Closing Remarks: Senator Ben Nighthorse \n     Campbell.\n\n\n                              University of Northern Colorado,\n\n                                           Greeley, CO, June 1999.\n       Greetings: It is my pleasure to extend warm greetings and \n     welcome you to this forum on Health Care: What Every Woman \n     Should Know.

Rather than waiting for \n     new technology to be developed, she called the CIA. Together \n     with NASA and the CIA, Blumenthal used spy-satellite \n     technology to improve the success of mammograms.\n       ``Some of the same imaging technology used to find tanks \n     camouflaged behind trees can now be used to find cancer \n     cells,'' she\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\n     said. Blumenthal was in Greeley on Thursday to deliver the \n     keynote address at a conference about women's health.\n       The conference, held at the University of Northern \n     Colorado, featured a variety of panelists who discussed \n     everything from anorexia to breast cancer to political \n     action.\n       Blumenthal delivered a ``report card'' on women's health in \n     the country today: The biggest problem facing women isn't any \n     one disease, but instead is a lack of focus on women's \n     health.\n       ``We must address these issues if we want to safeguard \n     women's health,'' she said.\n       The problem stems from the fact that women's health issues \n     also are political issues, said Raissa Geary, a member of the \n     U.S. Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n     Committee.\n       ``This is more politically charged than almost anything we \n     do,'' she said. ``We're treated as a political issue when it \n     comes to health care. We have wonderful, pure approaches to \n     women's health care policy, but it's not in a vacuum.''\n       Although women's health is not being discussed as often as \n     most women would like, awareness of health problems facing \n     women has increased in the past century, Blumenthal said.\n       For many years, serious health problems such as heart \n     disease and lung cancer were thought only to occur in men. \n     But through increasing research in women's health issues, \n     Blumenthal said, concerns such as these are being discussed.\n       Also, it's important to include women and minorities in all \n     research projects relating to health issues that affect women \n     as well as men, Blumenthal said. Programs that don't include \n     women will lose their federal funding.\n       Marianne Dinges attended the conference Thursday and said \n     the experience was valuable. She said she was impressed with \n     the quality of the speakers and the topics they were \n     scheduled to discuss.\n       ``It appeared we were going to see a full gamut of issues \n     and their political relevance,'' she said. ``A lot of us are \n     involved in women's issues and hear a lot about this, but we \n     all got new information.''\n       The conference was sponsored by UNC and U.S. Sen. Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. Campbell said his staff pitched \n     the idea to UNC after receiving many calls from women about \n     health issues.\n       ``It came from the community activists who wanted me to do \n     it,'' he said.\n       The issues addressed at the conference need to be at the \n     forefront of public debate, Campbell said.\n       He said he will take the information back to Washington, \n     D.C., and enter it into the Congressional Record. He also \n     wants to start a series of forums like the one Thursday to \n     further address the issues.\n       ``We just touched the surface of women's health,'' he said. \n     ``The time to endure is passed. It's time to fight back.''\n\n\n                             healthy living\n\n       Susan Blumenthal, assistant U.S. surgeon general, gave \n     these tips for healthy lives:\n       Find a doctor who respects you.\n       Know your family health history; many diseases are genetic \n     and run in families.\n       If you smoke, stop. If you don't, never do. It's the No. 1 \n     preventable cause of health problems among women.\n       Exercise or do some other sort of physical activity at \n     least 30 minutes every day. This could be as simple as riding \n     a bike or walking up stairs rather than using the elevator.\n       Eat smart.\n       Get annual physical exams, and make sure to include routine \n     women's health tests such as pap smears.\n       Know your health care plan and make sure to read the fine \n     print.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, information we received at the forum \nwill be helpful in my work on the Appropriations Committee as we \nconsider funding priorities in the women's health area.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6695-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6695-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1259.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the temporary \n     visa waiver program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress passed the Immigration \n     Control and Reform Act of 1986 that established a temporary \n     visa waiver program to pave the way toward better \n     international relations and increased visitor travel between \n     the United States and certain participating foreign \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, the temporary visa waiver program expired in \n     September, 1996, and has since been extended on a year-to-\n     year basis, with the current extension expiring in September, \n     1999; and\n       Whereas, the visa waiver program allows persons with \n     waivers to enter the United States for a period of up to \n     ninety days without a visa; and\n       Whereas, twenty-one countries were participating in the \n     visa waiver program with the United States as of 1996, with \n     more being added since then; and\n       Whereas, the visa waiver program is critical to boosting \n     the number of international arrivals in Hawaii, with an \n     estimated eighty percent of all international visitors \n     arriving at Honolulu International Airport being under the \n     visa waiver program; and\n       Whereas, the addition of Taiwan, South Korea, and China to \n     the visa waiver program by the United States would further \n     boost Hawaii's economy because of the huge numbers of \n     travelers to Hawaii from these countries; and\n       Whereas, despite the success of the visa waiver program, \n     the United States Congress has not made the program \n     permanent, instead preferring to extend it on a year-to-year \n     basis; now, therefore,\n       BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the \n     Twentieth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 1999, the Senate concurring, that the United States \n     Congress is urged to:\n       (1) Make the visa waiver program permanent; and\n       (2) Add Taiwan, South Korea, and China to the visa waiver \n     program;\n       and\n       Be it Further Resolved that members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation are urged to exert efforts to make \n     the visa waiver program permanent and add Taiwan, South \n     Korea, and China to the program; and\n       Be it Further Resolved that certified copies of this \n     Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Majority Leader \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-139.

One hundred percent federally funded state \n     and local assistance, previously granted to the states for \n     civil defense, should be provided to the states for \n     preparedness activities for crisis and consequence management \n     as the result of the increasing potential for acts of \n     terrorism and use of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (2) The federal government recognizes that the short and \n     long-term consequences of domestic terrorism is among the \n     responsibilities of state and local government supplemented \n     by the resources of the federal government. Federal agencies \n     that are tasked with providing assistance to state and local \n     government must be required to recognize and use the state's \n     emergency management systems that have effectively responded \n     to state and local emergencies and disasters for over fifty \n     years.\n       (3) The National Guard of each state and territory is a \n     critical state resource during emergencies and disasters. As \n     such, the role of the National Guard and the Department of \n     Defense must be better defined in preparing for acts of \n     terrorism.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Iowa relative to Health Care \n     Financing Administration rules; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, rules recently promulgated by the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA) of the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services requiring Outcome and \n     Assessment Information Set (OASIS) assessment and follow-up \n     reports for all patients of Medicare-certified home health \n     agencies and health departments, whether or not the patient \n     is a recipient of Medicare; and\n       Whereas, the OASIS system requires an 18-page initial \n     assessment which must be completed by a registered nurse, and \n     a 13-page follow-up assessment which is required to be \n     completed every sixty days; and\n       Whereas, the requirement for computer software necessary \n     for preparation and transmission of the OASIS system \n     assessments and reports is essentially an unfunded federal \n     mandate; and\n       Whereas, the HCFA requirement necessitates costly reporting \n     for patients who receive services not paid through Medicare \n     and the reporting is duplicative of existing assessment and \n     reporting requirements; and\n       Whereas, in the small-scale home health care organization \n     environment in Iowa, it is not feasible to provide services \n     through separate organizations based upon whether the patient \n     is a recipient of Medicare; and\n       Whereas, the HCFA rules would result in Medicare-certified \n     organizations only providing services to recipients of \n     Medicare, thereby reducing the availability of preventive \n     home services to older Iowans who are not recipients of \n     Medicare, increasing in-hospital admissions and Medicare \n     costs, and increasing nursing home admissions and Medicaid \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, OASIS appears to be solely a research project of \n     HCFA, totally unfunded by federal sources, and accomplished \n     with loss of funds by reporting agencies and loss of services \n     to older Iowans; now; therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring, that the Congress of the United States is \n     encouraged to amend the OASIS system requirements to apply \n     them only to patients who are recipients of Medicare and not \n     to all patients of Medicare-certified home health agencies; \n     and\n       Be It Further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House \n     is directed to provide a copy of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, to the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, to the Minority \n     Leaders of the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of Iowa's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-141. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to Health Care Financing \n     Administration rules; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5041\n\n       Whereas, New rules made by HCFA require OASIS assessment \n     and follow-up reports for all patients of Medicare-certified \n     home health agencies and health departments whether or not \n     the personal or attendant care for such patients is paid from \n     Medicare, and\n       Whereas, The new HCFA report requires an 18-page initial \n     assessment, which must be completed by a registered nurse, \n     with a 13 page follow-up assessment being required every 60 \n     days; and\n       Whereas, The requirement for computer software for the \n     preparation and transmission of such assessments and follow-\n     up reports is another unfunded mandate of the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, The HCFA requirement requires costly unfunded \n     reporting of those who receive services which are not paid by \n     Medicare--which reporting duplicates existing assessment and \n     reporting requirements of the Kansas Department on Aging; and\n       Whereas, In the environment of the small, home health care \n     services existing in Kansas, it is not feasible to create \n     separate organizations to provide services for non-Medicare \n     customers. The end result of the HCFA rules is that Medicare-\n     certified agencies will no longer be able to provide in-home \n     services to non-Medicare customers. Consequently, with lower \n     levels of preventive home services being available to older \n     Kansans there will be an increase in hospital admissions, \n     thus increasing Medicare costs, and an increase in nursing \n     home admissions, thus increasing Medicaid costs; and\n       Whereas, OASIS appears to be solely a research project of \n     HCFA, totally unfunded by federal sources, and accomplished \n     with loss of funds by reporting agencies and loss of services \n     for Kansas seniors: now; therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State \n     of Kansas, the Senate concurring therein: That we memorialize \n     the Congress of the United States to require the Health Care \n     Financing Administration OASIS reporting and data reporting \n     requirements to apply only to Medicare patients and not to \n     all patients of Medicare-certified home health agencies; and\n       Be it further resolved: That the Secretary of State be \n     directed to provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, President of the United States Senate, \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     minority leaders of the United States Senate and the United \n     States House of Representatives, and to each member of the \n     Kansas Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-142. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to the estate and gift taxes; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n       We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular \n     Session of the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, do hereby \n     respectfully represent that:\n       Whereas, the estate and gift tax is the federal \n     government's least significant revenue source contributing \n     approximately 1.1% of total federal revenue and in 1998 just \n     1.66% of adult deaths in the United States are expected to \n     result in taxable estates; and\n       Whereas, a rationale for the estate and gift tax is that \n     only the very wealthy pay it, but in 1995, 54% of all estate \n     tax revenue came from estates under five million dollars and \n     estate taxes that year fell for those with estates over \n     twenty million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the reason for the preceding is that careful \n     estate planning can virtually eliminate the tax, however many \n     estate planning techniques are costly and require long lead-\n     times to implement, making the burden of the estate tax often \n     falling on those with recently acquired modest wealth such as \n     farmers and small businesses; and\n       Whereas, the tax can be devastating on small businesses and \n     agricultural operations and protecting these ventures from \n     estate taxes can be costly and drain resources that could be \n     better used by the owners to upgrade and expand their \n     operations; and\n       Whereas, the estate and gift tax may be having unintended \n     environmental consequences as America's nonindustrial private \n     forest owners (who own 58% of America's forest land) face the \n     untimely timber harvest and disruption of established forest \n     management programs because of the federal estate tax and \n     this is counterproductive to society's goals of sustainable \n     forestry and environmental quality and the tax may also have \n     the unintended consequence of forcing a decedent's estate to \n     subdivide or sell all or portions of the family land, that \n     otherwise might be managed in a sustainable manner, in order \n     to meet the estate tax obligation; and\n       Whereas, Canada, Australia and Israel have repealed their \n     estate taxes with three policy reasons given that more people \n     were becoming subject to the tax, the relative tiny portion \n     of revenue raised and arguments by economists that the tax is \n     counterproductive; and\n       Whereas, the inheritance tax is applied to property and \n     goods that have already been taxed and some economists have \n     indicated that the gross domestic product over the next seven \n     years would be $80 billion higher if the estate and gift tax \n     were repealed; now; therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the members of the First Regular Session \n     of the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     respectfully request that members of Congress take a serious \n     look at repealing the estate and gift tax or, at the very \n     least, to increasing the exemption substantially.\n       Be it further resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House \n     of Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and \n     directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of Congress, and the congress delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-143.

Block, where the state unsuccessfully challenged \n     the unilateral action by Congress of extending federal \n     jurisdiction from federally owned land to state-owned water, \n     the state's free exercise of authority over its state-owned \n     lands and waters was severely diminished; and\n       Whereas, in the 18 years since the federal courts upheld \n     this congressional extension of\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n     federal authority over state water, the only revenue earned \n     on school and other state grant lands from wilderness users \n     has been derived from a token campground reservation fee that \n     is reappropriated for necessary campground maintenance and \n     therefore adds nothing to the permanent school fund, the fund \n     constitutionally established to support public schools of the \n     state out of income derived from school and other grant land \n     sale and natural resource management revenues; and\n       Whereas, continuance of state land ownership within the \n     Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness not only defeats the \n     purpose for which the state school grant lands were granted \n     and dedicated, it also unnecessarily handicaps federal \n     management duties relating to the wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, the Minnesota Constitution, article XI, sections 8 \n     and 10, provide that school and other grant lands may be sold \n     only at public auction or exchanged; and\n       Whereas, consolidation of federal land ownership within the \n     Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness through an exchange of \n     Superior National Forest land that is located outside the \n     wilderness area for state land that is located within the \n     wilderness area will mutually benefit both the federal and \n     state governments by simplifying federal wilderness area \n     management activities through efficiencies arising from \n     single land ownership and by enabling the state to properly \n     manage its school trust lands for the purposes for which \n     these lands were granted and dedicated, as was first \n     contemplated for these lands by the Minnesota legislature in \n     the enactment of Laws 1917, chapter 448, which created the \n     Minnesota state forests in the counties of Cook, Lake, and \n     St. Louis, the first state forests established in Minnesota; \n     and\n       Whereas, there appears, preliminarily, to be sufficient \n     acreage of federal land that is located within the exterior \n     boundaries of the Superior National Forest, exclusive of \n     lands in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, to \n     exchange for the high value state-owned school grant and \n     other land inholdings located within the wilderness area; \n     now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota that Congress is requested to speedily \n     enact laws that would expedite the exchange of federally \n     owned land located within the Superior National Forest that \n     lies outside of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for \n     land owned by the state of Minnesota located within the \n     Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and Be it Further \n     Resolved, That in its deliberations concerning this request, \n     Congress is requested to be especially cognizant that the \n     legal title of the state of Minnesota to its school and other \n     grant lands located within this wilderness area has been \n     preserved, relatively unaltered, since being separated by \n     grant from the federal public domain at statehood, and that \n     the state of Minnesota's checkerboard land ownership pattern \n     gives these lands a unique value because the lands are an \n     integral part of what the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     recognized in State of Minnesota by Alexander v. Block as ``. \n     . . our Nation's only lakeland canoe wilderness--a network of \n     more than 1,000 lakes linked by hundreds of miles of streams \n     and short portages which served as the highway of fur traders \n     . . .'' and which ``. . . still contains 540,000 acres of \n     virgin [old growth] forests, by far the largest such area in \n     the eastern United States.'' And be it further Resolved, That \n     Congress also be cognizant that the Minnesota Constitution, \n     article XI, section 10, relating to the exchange of school \n     grant and other state lands, requires the state to reserve \n     mineral and water power rights in lands transferred by the \n     state and, in addition, that Minnesota has never leased \n     any state-owned minerals located on lands within the area \n     that is federally designated as the Boundary Waters Canoe \n     Area Wilderness, and further, that since 1976, under \n     Minnesota Statutes, section 84.523, state law prohibits, \n     except when needed in a national emergency declared by \n     Congress, the exploration and mining of state-owned \n     minerals and the harvesting of state-owned peat, and Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That while the state of Minnesota is cognizant of \n     the fact that Congress may authorize the federal government \n     to acquire state-owned school grant and other lands by \n     eminent domain proceedings brought in federal courts, a \n     procedure which entails congressional appropriation of the \n     substantial amount of money necessary to pay Minnesota the \n     market value of these lands as approved by the federal \n     courts, the state hereby affirms that the mutual best \n     interests of both the federal and state governments are best \n     served by land exchange as a solution to the long-standing \n     problem of intermingled land ownership within the Superior \n     National Forest, and Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President of the United States, the \n     President and the Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the chair of the Senate Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources, the chair of the House Committee on \n     Resources, and to each of Minnesota's Senators and \n     Representatives in Congress for the purpose of assisting \n     those members in the discharge of duties imposed by Minnesota \n     Statutes, section 1.0451, especially those duties set forth \n     in subdivision 3 relating to land exchange.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-148.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, The economy of the State of Nevada is dependent \n     upon tourism; and\n       Whereas, Canada and Mexico rank No. 1 and No. 7, \n     respectively, among Nevada's sources of international \n     tourism, sending more than 1.5 million Canadian visitors and \n     more than 104,000 Mexican visitors to this state per year; \n     and\n       Whereas, Visitors from Canada and Mexico comprise a major \n     economic contribution to the State of Nevada; and\n       Whereas, the United States has entered into international \n     trade agreements with its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, to \n     foster, encourage and stimulate the exchange of goods and \n     products for mutual economic gain; and\n       Whereas, The United States does not currently require \n     departing tourists returning to Canada and Mexico to be \n     stopped and identified at border crossings; and\n       Whereas, Section 100 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 requires that a new \n     entry-exit control system be implemented to track all foreign \n     visitors entering and leaving the United States but does not \n     provide any law enforcement benefits; and\n       Whereas, The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996 would impose new border inspection \n     requirements for the gathering of data at entry and departure \n     points for vehicular traffic from Canada and Mexico where \n     none currently exist; and\n       Whereas, The new border entry-exit system does not provide \n     for any enhancement of provisions for apprehending or \n     removing illegal immigrants, drug traffickers, terrorists or \n     other criminals and would not curtail illegal immigration at \n     the borders; and\n       Whereas, No inspection stations or other facilities for \n     departing foreign travelers have been constructed; and\n       Whereas, This system would be implemented at enormous \n     expense to the taxpayers of the United States with no \n     tangible benefits; and\n       Whereas, Congress has held hearings at various sites along \n     the Canadian border to consider exempting that country from \n     the provisions of the Act, but no such hearings have been \n     held or are scheduled in the Mexican border states; and\n       Whereas, Mexican and Canadian tourists who enter the United \n     States for business and recreational travel are not \n     immigrants; and\n       Whereas, These nonimmigrant Mexican and Canadian business \n     and leisure travelers who will already be required to present \n     travel documents to enter the United States, would be \n     subjected to inspections and queries upon departure that \n     would cause travel delays and inconveniences to those \n     tourists; and\n       Whereas, Such delays and inconveniences would discourage \n     tourism in the United States by Mexican and Canadian \n     citizens, delay commerce and create an economic downturn; and\n       Whereas, The borders with Canada and Mexico should be kept \n     reasonably free of governmental over-involvement in order to \n     encourage tourism, trade and legitimate economic activity \n     that benefit all three countries; and\n       Whereas, The National Governors' Association at its meeting \n     in Washington in February 1998 determined that the entry-exit \n     control system may have ``unintended negative consequences on \n     international trade, tourism and the economy''; and\n       Whereas, The National Governors' Association urged \n     suspension of implementing the entry-exit control system \n     until Congress and the President can ensure that any such \n     system will not disrupt tourism, trade or other legitimate \n     traffic entering the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress passed legislation in October 1998 \n     delaying imposition of the implementation of the provisions \n     of Section 110 until March 31, 2001, but allowing the exit \n     system to take effect at the airports of international entry \n     in the United States; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That Congress is hereby urged permanently to \n     mitigate the consequences of the provisions of Section 110 of \n     the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n     Act of 1996; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is encouraged to keep the borders \n     between the United States and Canada and Mexico reasonably \n     free of governmental over-involvement and to impose no new \n     restrictions until infrastructure is available that can \n     collect data and detect illegal and unwanted immigration \n     without disrupting legitimate tourist travel; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-159. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to prayer in public schools; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 55\n\n       Whereas, The 48th Annual National Day of Prayer was \n     observed on May 6, 1999, and the United States of America was \n     founded by men and women with varied religious beliefs and \n     ideals; and\n       Whereas, The First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states that ``Congress shall make no law \n     respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the \n     free exercise thereof . . .,'' which means that the \n     government is prohibited from establishing a state religion. \n     However, no barriers shall be erected against the practice of \n     any religion; and\n       Whereas, The establishment clause of the First Amendment \n     was not drafted to protect Americans from religion, rather, \n     its purpose was clearly to protect Americans from \n     governmental mandates with respect to religion; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan Legislature strongly believes that \n     reaffirming a right to voluntary, individual, unorganized, \n     and non-mandated prayer in public schools is an important \n     element of religious choice guaranteed by the Constitution, \n     and will reaffirm those religious rights and beliefs upon \n     which the nation was founded; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this \n     legislative body memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to strongly support voluntary, individual, \n     unorganized, and non-mandatory prayer in the public schools \n     of this nation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-160.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4012\n\n       To the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the \n     United States, and to the President of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the Senate \n     and House of Representatives of the United States, in \n     Congress assembled:\n       We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative \n     session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as \n     follows:\n       Whereas, Washington state contains a rich diversity of \n     forests, rivers, seacoasts, grasslands, deserts, and other \n     habitats, and an\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\n     equally diverse population of fish and wildlife, all of which \n     require by law some level of protection and responsible \n     management by federal, state, and local agencies; and\n       Whereas, Washington state also contains a large number and \n     variety of outstanding recreational facilities and \n     opportunities, including three national parks, a national \n     volcanic monument, one hundred twenty-five state parks, and \n     many local parks, trails, water access areas, swimming pools, \n     and sports fields; and\n       Whereas, Outdoor recreation and wildlife enjoyment are \n     important elements of the Northwest way of life. A large \n     majority of Washington's residents and visitors actively \n     pursue and enjoy a range of outdoor recreation activities, \n     from active sports such as soccer, softball, swimming, and \n     bicycling, to outdoor and wildlife-related pursuits such as \n     hiking, camping, canoeing, and wildlife observation; and\n       Whereas, Outdoor recreation and wildlife enjoyment are also \n     important elements of Washington's economy. For example, a \n     1996 survey conducted by the United States fish and wildlife \n     service showed that annual wildlife-related recreation \n     expenditures exceeded one hundred billion dollars, almost \n     three billion dollars spent in Washington state. Wildlife \n     viewing alone accounts for more than twenty-one thousand jobs \n     in Washington state; and\n       Whereas, Washington's population is one of the fastest-\n     growing in the United States, with an even faster-growing \n     public demand for wildlife conservation, wildlife-related \n     recreation, and outdoor recreation facilities; and\n       Whereas, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     (LWCF) was created in 1965 to preserve, develop, and assure \n     that all Americans have access to quality outdoor recreation. \n     In the thirty years since its creation, LWCF has funded the \n     acquisition of almost seven million acres of parkland, water \n     resources, wildlife habitat open space, and the development \n     of more than thirty-seven thousand state, municipal, and \n     local parks and recreation projects. In recent years, LWCF \n     funding for federal projects has been reduced by more than \n     half and funding for state projects has been entirely \n     eliminated; and\n       Whereas, Washington and other states lack adequate, \n     dedicated funding for fish and wildlife protection and \n     management, especially for those species which are not hunted \n     and fished and which are not listed as threatened or \n     endangered. In 1980, Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife \n     Conservation Act (P.L. 96-366) which was intended to address \n     the protection and management of nonhunted wildlife species, \n     but the act was never funded, leaving the entire \n     responsibility to the states;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress pass legislation to restore and revitalize federal \n     funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Lands shall \n     be open for public use and enjoyment. We pray that Congress \n     create a new dedicated fund for state-level fish and wildlife \n     management, which would be administered by the United States \n     fish and wildlife service; be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of \n     the United States, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member \n     of Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-163.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to the Social Security Act; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 219\n\n       Whereas, the State of Alaska received an increase in its \n     Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) from 50 percent \n     to 59.8 percent in consideration of the high cost of living \n     in Alaska by an amendment to the Social Security Act; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator Daniel K. Akaka, United \n     States Senator Daniel K. Inouye, United States Representative \n     Neil Abercrombie, and United States Representative Patsy T. \n     Mink have recently introduced federal legislation to amend \n     the Social Security Act to increase Hawaii's FMAP in \n     consideration of Hawaii's high cost of living; and\n       Whereas, federal financial participation for the medicaid \n     program is based on the FMAP which is calculated according to \n     a formula based on per capita income in the individual state \n     in relation to the per capita income of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, the FMAP is calculated as the quotient of the per \n     capita income of the United States, times a multiplier, the \n     state income is determined as a designated portion of the \n     national income as determined at the United States Department \n     of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the per \n     capita income of Hawaii is an amount that is derived at the \n     BEA as a portion of national income statistics; and\n       Whereas, because of its island location and other factors, \n     the cost of living in Hawaii greatly exceeds the cost of \n     living in the mainland states, so that per capita income is a \n     poor measure of its relative ability to bear the cost of \n     medical services; and\n       Whereas, a study conducted by the Taubman Center for State \n     and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy \n     School of Government and the Office of United States Senator \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan, established that if per capita \n     income is measured in real terms, considering cost of living \n     factors, Hawaii ranked 47th at $19,755 compared to the \n     national average $24,231 and Alaska is ranked 34th with a \n     real per capita income level of $21,592; and\n       Whereas, the Harvard/Moynihan study cites Hawaii with one \n     of the highest poverty rates in the nation--Hawaii ranks \n     eighth in the country with a poverty rate of 16.9 percent as \n     compared to the national average of 14.7 percent--and on a \n     per capita basis state revenues and expenditures are far \n     higher in Hawaii, as well as Alaska, than in the other 48 \n     mainland states, but Alaska's 10.6 percent poverty rate is \n     lower than the national average, placing it 39th in the \n     country; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii has not participated in the economic \n     rebound that has benefited most of the rest of the nation in \n     the past several years, in part because of its heavy \n     dependence on international tourism and trade, and Hawaii \n     continues to suffer from the drop in value in the Japanese \n     yen, its unemployment rate is above the national average, and \n     its tax revenues have fallen short of estimates; and\n       Whereas, based on Hawaii's current medicaid spending level \n     of approximately $700 million, each percentage point increase \n     in its FMAP rate would provide approximately $7 million \n     annually in additional federal funds; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii is seeking to have its \n     medicaid program funded in dollars equal to its tax \n     contributions based on its higher per capita income and one \n     that recognizes its true costs, as was done for Alaska; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twentieth \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999 \n     (the Senate concurring), That this body hereby urges the \n     United States Congress, the President of the United States, \n     and the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to support United States Senator Daniel K. Akaka, United \n     States Senator Daniel K. Inouye, United States Representative \n     Neil Abercrombie, and United States Representative Patsy T. \n     Mink's federal legislation to amend the Social Security Act \n     to increase Hawaii's FMAP in consideration of our high cost \n     of living; and be it further\n       Resolved That certified copies of the Concurrent Resolution \n     be transmitted to the members of the United States Congress, \n     the President of the United States, and the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-165. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Vermont relative to Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Joint House Resolution 113\n\n       Whereas, the purpose of Social Security is to provide a \n     strong, simple and efficient form of basic insurance against \n     the adversities of old age, disability and dependency, and\n       Whereas, for 60 years Social Security has provided a stable \n     platform of retirement, disability and survivor annuity \n     benefits to protect working Americans and their dependents, \n     and\n       Whereas, the costs to administer Social Security are less \n     than one percent of the benefits delivered, and\n       Whereas, the American and world economies continue to \n     encounter periods of high uncertainty and volatility that \n     make it as important as ever to preserve a basic and \n     continuing safety net of protections guaranteed by our \n     society's largest guarantor of risk, the federal government, \n     and\n       Whereas, Social Security affords protections to rich and \n     poor alike and no citizen, no matter how well-off today, can \n     foretell tomorrow's adversities, and\n       Whereas, average life expectancies are increasing and \n     people are commonly living into their 80's and 90's, making \n     it more important than ever that each of us be fully \n     protected by defined retirement benefits, and\n       Whereas, medical scientists are continually developing new \n     ways to maintain and enhance the lives of people with severe \n     disabilities, thus making it more important that each of us \n     to be protected against the risk of dependency, \n     institutionalization and impoverishment, and\n       Whereas, the lives of wage earners and their spouses are \n     seldom coterminous; one often outlives the other by decades, \n     making it crucial to preserve a secure base of protection for \n     children and other family members dependent on a wage earner \n     who may die or become disabled, and\n       Whereas, Social Security, in current form, reinforces \n     family cohesiveness and enhances the value of work in our \n     society, and\n       Whereas, Congress currently has proposals to shift a \n     portion of Social Security contributions from insurance to \n     personal investment accounts for each wage earner, and\n       Whereas, Social Security, our largest and most fundamental \n     insurance system, cannot fulfill its protective function if \n     it is splintered into individualized stock accounts and must \n     create and manage millions of small risk-bearing investments \n     out of a stream of contributions intended as insurance, and\n       Whereas, private accounts cannot be substituted for Social \n     Security without eroding basic protections for working \n     families, since such protections, to be strong, must be \n     insulated from economic uncertainty and be\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n     backed by the entity best capable of spreading risk, the \n     federal government, and\n       Whereas, the diversion of contributions to private \n     investment accounts would dramatically increase financial \n     shortfalls to the Social Security trust fund and require \n     major reductions in the defined benefits upon which millions \n     of Americans depend, and\n       Whereas, to administer 150 million separate investment \n     accounts would require a larger bureaucracy, and the \n     resulting expense and the cost of converting each account to \n     an annuity upon retirement would consume much of the profit \n     or exacerbate the loss realized by each participant, and\n       Whereas, the question of whether part of the Social \n     Security Trust Fund should be diversified into investments \n     other than government bonds so that, while still invested \n     collectively at low expense, returns may be increased, thus \n     enhancing the capacity of the fund to meet its obligations to \n     pay benefits while spreading the risk across the entire \n     spectrum of Social Security participants, is entirely \n     different from that of splintering its millions of accounts, \n     and\n       Whereas, creating an array of winners and losers would be \n     contrary to the basic principles of insurance and risk \n     distribution, thus defeating the purpose of this part of our \n     retirement system, and\n       Whereas, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to \n     provide a full menu of provisions that enables working \n     Americans and their employers to voluntarily contribute to \n     tax-sheltered accounts that are open to the opportunities and \n     exposed to the risks of investment markets, diverting Social \n     Security contributions to private accounts duplicates \n     existing programs, and\n       Whereas, such recently created systems now cover half of \n     American families, now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives, That \n     the General Assembly respectfully and strongly urges Congress \n     not to enact laws that might tend to diminish or undermine a \n     unified and stable Social Security system, and be it further\n       Resolved, That laws to encourage workers and their \n     employers to save or invest for retirement should supplement \n     and not substitute for the basic benefits of Social Security \n     insurance that are vital to American working families, and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be directed to send a \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States and each member of the Vermont Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-166.

Part 3809, the 3809 \n     Regulations, before September 30, 1999; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature strongly supports \n     Alternative 1, the ``No Action'' alternative, as described in \n     the draft Environmental Impact Statement on Surface \n     Management Regulations and Locatable Mineral Operations, to \n     maintain the existing 3809 Regulations without revision or \n     modification; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-169.

A bill to provide grants to State educational agencies and \nlocal educational agencies for the provision of classroom-related \ntechnology training for elementary and secondary school teachers; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    teacher technology training act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp teachers use technology in their teaching, the Teacher Technology \nTraining Act of 1999.\n  This bill has three major provisions:\n  It authorizes $500 million for state education departments to award \ngrants to local public school districts on the basis of need to train \nteachers in how to use technology in the classroom.\n  It specifies that grants may be used to strengthen instruction and \nlearning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of \nteacher training in using technology in the classroom.\n  It requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate the technology \ntraining programs for teachers developed by school districts within \nthree years.\n  I am introducing this bill because teachers say they need to learn \nhow to use computers and other technology in their teaching. In a 1998 \nsurvey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, only 20 percent \nof teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' to integrate educational \ntechnology into instruction.\n  Furthermore, the training that does exist for these teachers is \ninadequate. In the same Department of Education survey, among full-\ntime, public school teachers, 78 percent said they had participated in \nprofessional development programs on using educational technology in \ntheir instruction, but only 23 percent of those teachers said they felt \n``well prepared'' in this area. Of the teachers who report having \nreceived some training, 40 percent felt that it had improved their \nclassroom teaching only ``somewhat'' or ``not at all.'' This is \nunacceptable. What we see now is that in many schools the students know \nmore about how to use computers than the teachers do. In one Kentucky \nschool profiled by Inside Technology Training magazine, the students \nrun the school's computer systems. The article quoted the school \ndistrict's technology coordinator as saying that the students had \n``long surpassed'' what the teachers could do and\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nreported that one student had recently trained twenty teachers on \nsoftware for Web page construction (``Fast Times at Kentucky High,'' \nInside Technology Training, June 1998).\n\n  I see this problem in my own state. A report by the Los Angeles \nCounty Office of Education in 1996 found that in Los Angeles County, \nnearly half of the teachers had no experience with computers or had \nonly limited familiarity with word processing software. According to a \n1998 report by the California Teachers Association, teachers in \nCalifornia rank training in the use of new technology fourth among \neighteen changes they believe could most improve public education. \nForty-five percent of the teachers surveyed said more technology \ntraining would greatly improve conditions for teaching and learning \n(CTA for the Next Century, 1998).\n  It is crucial that we given students the opportunity to become \nfamiliar with technology in their classrooms because post-high school \neducation and most good jobs require experience using computers. U.S. \nCommerce Secretary William M. Daley has said, ``Opportunities are now \ndependent upon a person's ability to use computers and engage in using \nthe Internet'' (CQ Weekly, ``Digital Haves and Have Nots,'' April 17, \n1999). In my state, a 1997 Rand report found that there is currently a \nshift in the state's economy away from manufacturing and toward higher-\nskill service and technology industries, and employers are placing a \nhigher premium on the computer skills necessary for these positions \n(Immigration in a Changing Economy, Rand, 1997). Students are better \neducated when their teachers are well trained. We cannot prepare \nstudents for the increasingly technological workplace without trained \nteachers.\n  We have made great efforts to make technology available to students \nin their classrooms, and now we have a national student to computer \nratio of 10 to 1. Seventy-eight percent of our nation's schools have \nInternet access. These are good first steps.\n  But also essential is having teachers and students use all this \ntechnology in their day-to-day classroom activities when it can enhance \nlearning. This will not happen until teachers are trained in how to \ninclude technology in their instruciton.\n  One teacher expressed her frustration in an article in the National \nSchool Boards Association's Electronic School magazine:\n\n       Most teachers have no model to show them the advantages of \n     hooking up to the projects available on the Internet. And \n     shrinking school budgets don't provide nearly enough money to \n     train teachers in new or visionary techniques. Meanwhile, we \n     can't escape the magazine and newspaper articles touting the \n     Information Superhighway and heralding new ways of responding \n     to, using, and learning information in our society. Well, who \n     most needs to learn to traverse this road successfully? \n     Society future leaders--and their teachers (Electronic \n     School, ``Going Global,'' February 1995).\n\nI agree.\n  Our teachers are not prepared to use technology in their classrooms. \nStudents need to learn to use modern technology and it can help them \nlearn. If we are expecting teachers to use up-to-date methods and \ntools, we must train them to do so. This bill will provide some of the \nfunds needed to do that.\n  By introducing this bill I am not suggesting that technology is a \ncure-all for the problems in our schools. Technology is one of many \nteaching and learning tools. It can bring some efficiencies to \nlearning, for example, providing a new way to do math and spelling \ndrills or keeping students engaged in learning while a teacher works \nwith other students who need extra help. It can also be an important \nresearch tool by providing easy access to information that, without a \ncomputer, is not easily available.\n  We expect a great deal from our teachers and students. We must give \nthem the resources they need. This bill is one step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6711-1",

Colonel William Alexander--Alex to \nhis friends--is retiring this month after an Air Force career spanning \nalmost 30 years. Alex has spent much of his career leading and \nmentoring Defense Acquisition Professionals, leaving as his legacy a \nnew generation of experienced procurement managers.\n  Born in the baby boom era between WWII and the Korean War, Alex grew \nup in Indiana, where he attended DePauw and Indiana Universities. After \ncompleting his Masters Degree in 1970, he entered the Air Force at \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Some of his early \nprojects started the development for today's generation of precision \nguided weapons. It was a whole lot trickier then, without the advantage \nof the Global Positioning System, but his team worked to develop a way \nto triangulate a target designation to improve bomb targeting \nreliability.\n  The Air Force recognized the contributions of this young officer and \nmoved him into a career in procurement and satellite operations. Alex \nspent the next 20 years of his career moving between different aspects \nof the complex world of keeping satellites operating successfully on \norbit. He was a procurement official in a number of software source \nselections, using his abilities to aid the Air Force in getting \nrevolutionary operating software for its expanding fleet of satellites. \nAfter his work in operations, the Air Force wisely transferred him into \nthe National Reconnaissance Office as the Director of the Acquisition \nand Engineering Group within the Communications System Acquisition and \nOperations Directorate. When the Deputy Director of the Communications \nDirectorate was reassigned, Alex was selected for this position in \nlight of his vast experience in successful acquisitions.\n  However, I don't want to spend too much time discussing the technical \ndetails of Colonel Alexander's career. There are many successful \nprocurement officials within the Air Force and the Department of \nDefense, but few are as widely recognized for their crafting of \npersonnel in addition to their acquisition expertise. Although the \nproject was always treated with importance, Alex always made sure that \nhis people came first. He was always looking to find ways to challenge \nhis staff to grow both in technical ability and in interpersonal \nrelationships. His success gives credence to the philosophy of \nempowering and caring for your people, which ultimately leads to the \nprogram success. One night during his time in satellite operations, a \nsatellite was having difficulties getting initialized. Scores of people \nwere working around the clock trying to work through the complex issues \ninvolved. Recognizing that people do not perform at their best when \nthey are exhausted, Colonel Alexander banished a number of people from \nthe operations floor until they had a rest period. The engineers \nreturned to the floor with clearer heads and ultimately were able to \nget the satellite up and running successfully on orbit.\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\n  When there was a tragic death of an employee on official travel, Alex \ntemporarily set aside his own grief to assist others in the office in \naddition to the employee's family. In the confusion that surrounded the \nfuneral, Alex took time to meet with all of the family members to try \nto help them understand the events that had taken place. It was a \ndifficult time for all involved, but Alex clearly demonstrated his \ncaring for his co-workers and should be commended for his actions.\n  One area where Colonel Alexander should be especially proud is in his \ninitiatives for acquisition reform. Alex was always driving to improve \nall aspects of buying satellites and software, looking for new and \ninnovative ways to execute the program. At his encouragement, one \ndivision has studied purchasing satellites on-orbit, which would be a \nfirst for the NRO. He has been an advocate for openness and \nrevolutionary thinking, balancing trusted methods with new ideas. Under \nhis leadership, a security rebaselining was started which resulted in \nhis program appearing on CBS' Eye on America. His drive in this area \nhas literally saved the federal government millions of dollars.\n  Finally, I want to thank Colonel Alexander for one final initiative. \nAfter being nominated for a Congressional Fellowship by Colonel \nAlexander, a member of his staff has joined my staff for the \nlegislative year. This staff member has been of great assistance \nalready in the Defense bills that have gone to the floor, and I look \nforward to his continuing contribution through the rest of the Senate's \nsession.\n  I'm sure that there are still many details for Colonel Alexander to \nwork out as he transitions to a ``former'' military life. I wish him \nthe best in his endeavors and pass along a sincere thank you on behalf \nof Congress for passing along his life's philosophy to the generation \nthat will follow in his procurement footsteps. The legacy left behind \nis greater than mere relics of satellites and software, which will age \nand be disregarded. Colonel Alexander's heritage is in a corps of \npeople who now have a greater understanding of the balances and \npressures in life and a toolkit with how to deal with them. This is a \ntrue success, and one that I hope will be a sustained source of pride \nthroughout his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6727-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE FENWAY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Fenway Community \nDevelopment Corporation in Boston is celebrating its twenty-fifth \nanniversary, and I congratulate the corporation on its impressive \naccomplishments.\n  The Nation's economy is currently enjoying the longest period of \npeacetime expansion in the nation's history. Today, more Americans than \never have access to quality education and productive jobs and careers. \nBut that success is no cause for complacency. Too many of our fellow \ncitizens and too many of our communities are not full participants in \nthe nation's overall prosperity. For them, economic growth often means \nhigher housing costs and pressures to move out of neighborhoods which \nhave been their homes all their lives.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Fenway Community Development Corporation \nwas formed to do more to see that neighborhood development benefits the \nresidents of the neighborhood. The Corporation stands proudly for the \nfundamental principle that local residents should enjoy the benefits of \neconomic growth too, regardless of their incomes, and that neighborhood \nplanning should always put people first.\n  Since 1973, the Fenway CDC has worked skillfully to improve the \nquality of life in the community, actively encouraging residents to \nparticipate in decisions that affect it. Under its leadership, \nresidents from different cultures, age groups, and income levels have \nall come together for a better Fenway. I commend them for what they \nhave done to empower people and strengthen the fabric of their \nneighborhoods.\n  A large part of this success comes from many activities to improve \nlife in the Fenway. Protecting existing housing, actively seeking \nopportunities to develop affordable new housing, pursuing commercial \ndevelopment that meets the needs of the neighborhood--all of these are \nessential parts of the mission.\n  Other activities include homebuyer counseling--the afterschool \nprograms and playground renovation for neighborhood youth through the \nFenway Family Coalition--the computer training and job opportunities \nwith local employers through the Walk to Work Program--and the Senior \nTask Force, which maintains affordable housing for low income elderly \nresidents, as well as blood pressure screenings and recreation \nfacilities available at the Peterborough Senior Center. All of these \nprograms have contributed immensely to the quality of life in the \nFenway neighborhood, and the Corporation deserve great credit for these \nachievements.\n  Fenway CDC is a respected leader of CDCs nationwide. I congratulate \nthem for 25 years of skillful work and real results, and I know that \nthe next 25 years will be just as successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6727-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE LOON MOUNTAIN RECREATION CORPORATION\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation of Lincoln, New \nHampshire for their outstanding achievements in the environmental \narena. This month. Loon Mountain will receive the Times Mirror \nCompany's Silver Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence in Visual \nImpact.\n  Loon Mountain will be receiving this award due to the recent \ninstallation of a new snowmaking pump station. The resort's two \nobjectives in the design of this station were to reduce the visual \nimpact of the pump station to the surrounding community and minimize \nthe impact of the new water withdrawal system on the adjacent river.\n  Through careful site planning and creative architectural design, the \npump station blends in naturally with its surroundings. The techniques \nemployed during construction were environmentally sound and the \nwithdrawal system does not disturb the river environment.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I realize the impact that industrial design can have on the \nenvironment, and I am excited to see businesses such as Loon Mountain \nworking hard to minimize these impacts. I commend the Loon Mountain \nRecreation Corporation for their environmental awareness, and I am \nproud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6727-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6727-S6728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ANDRE AGASSI\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nhistoric event that took place this past weekend in Paris when Las \nVegas's own Andre Agassi captured the 1999 French Open Championship. \nAndre's completion of the career Grand Slam secures him a place in \ntennis history that only five other men can claim, and as a testament \nto his versality, he is the only person to accomplish this feat on \nthree different surfaces--hardcourt, grass, and clay. He is the first \nAmerican in 61 years to win all four majors--Wimbledom in 1992, the \nU.S. Open in 1994, the Australian Open in 1995, and now the French--and \nhis victory will soon catapult him to No. 4 in the world rankings.\n  As great as Andre's accomplishments have been on the court throughout \nhis career, they are, in my opinion, overshadowed by the generosity and \ncompassion he has shown off the court. Andre's commitment to at-risk \nand underprivileged youth has been a passion of his throughout his \ntennis career. His establishment of the Andre Agassi Foundation in 1994 \nto support and fund programs that serve underprivileged kids has \nprovided much needed assistance to a variety of service organizations \nthat work with children in the Las Vegas area, including the Boys & \nGirls Clubs in Las Vegas, the Assistance League of Las Vegas, and Child \nHaven. Since its inception, the Agassi Foundation has donated over $5 \nmillion to local youth charities.\n  In today's world of professional sports, it is always refreshing to \nsee an athlete who recognizes the blessings and opportunities he has \nreceived, and has chosen to give something back to his community. In \nspite of a tennis career that has had its ups and downs, Andre has \nalways had a steady hand\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nwhen it comes to helping underprivileged children. Andre Agassi is the \nepitome of what a professional athlete should be, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in commending him for making tennis history and \nfor all of his charitable endeavors that mean so much to the Las Vegas \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6728-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MEYER ``MIKE'' BERMAN\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Meyer \n``Mike'' Berman, a World War II veteran who demonstrated unusual \nheroism during his two years of service in the United States Army.\n  Mike Berman, Private First Class, served as part of the 12th Infantry \nRegiment during World War II. An outstanding soldier, he was decorated \nwith the Good Conduct Medal, the Bronze Star Medal with one Oak Leaf \nCluster, the World War II Victory Medal and Ribbon, the European \nAfrican Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and a Ribbon with one Silver \nService Star.\n  However, the accomplishment Mike Berman is proudest of is the time he \nsaved the life of his friend, Private John Buyers. While artillery \nshells were coming from all directions, Mike Berman rushed to the aid \nof Private Buyers, who had been grievously injured. Mike Berman \nsinglehandedly carried Private Buyers by foot to the service jeep that \ntransported him to medical aid. I ask that Private Buyers' letter \nexpressing the gratitude he felt towards Private Berman for saving his \nlife be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                           England: Oct: 29th 1944\n\n       Dear Mike: Just a few lines to say hello and let you know \n     I'm coming along pretty good. I just wanted to thank you for \n     what you done for me the day I got hit. I'll never forget it. \n     If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be living today. Thanks \n     a million, ``Mike.'' I've had three operations so far and I'm \n     pretty weak, but I'll live through it. I won't be with you \n     boys' any more but tell them all hello for me. Please write \n     to me if you get a chance.\n       Well, Mike, be good and take care of yourself. I sure \n     didn't last long, did I? Oh well! It was all in the cards I \n     guess. Please excuse my writing. I can do better but I'm \n     pretty nervous these days. Once again thanks for what you \n     done for me and maybe some day, I'll be able to sort of \n     square things up.\n       So long.\n           Cordially,\n                                                           Buyers.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is particularly appropriate with the recent \ncelebration of Memorial Day that we pay homage to truly courageous \nindividuals like Mike Berman, whose faith in democracy and freedom for \nmankind have helped make our nation as great as it is today.\n  The worst of times often best reveals the character of an individual. \nIn the worst of times, Mike Berman proved his charity and love for his \nfellow man. He went beyond the call of duty when no one else dared to.\n  Having come from an immigrant family, Mr. Berman's achievements \nillustrate the enormous passion and desire America's immigrants have to \ncreate a better future in their newly adopted country. Our recognition \nof Mr. Berman reminds us of the tremendous contribution that immigrants \nhave made in the shaping of our Nation. This diverse group of \nextraordinary, enterprising, and self-sufficient individuals have \ncontinuously served to strengthen the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/08/senate-section/article/S6728-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 1554\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
