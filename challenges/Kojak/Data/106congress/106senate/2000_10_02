Mr. President, on a cold winter afternoon in 1941, a young \nboy of fourteen went about his daily business, engaged in his humble \nprofession. I can imagine that to many of the pedestrians who made \ntheir way down Central Park West that day, this youngster perhaps was \nnothing extraordinary, just another shoeshine boy. However, this was \nnot just another winter day; it was December 7, 1941. It marked the \nbeginning of America's active participation in the greatest struggle of \nthe twentieth century, a war that would take this boy and make him a \nman. And it was, perhaps, the last time Daniel Patrick Moynihan was \nleft standing on the sidelines as the controversies and events that \nwould affect our Nation unfolded. So this was not just another boy. \nToday, I honor this man and commemorate his transformation from a \nhumble shoe-shine boy to the senior Senator from the State of New York. \nIt is with a heavy heart, a heart that is filled with admiration, that \nI bid Senator Moynihan farewell and thank him for his ceaseless efforts \non behalf of the people of New York and this Nation.\n  He will not be leaving this afternoon or tomorrow or the next day, \nbut this is his final year, by his own choice, in which he will serve \nthe Nation and his State of New York from his position in this Chamber.\n  Raised by a journalist and a bar-keep in Manhattan's melting pot, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\nMoynihan climbed the ladder of academia with the callused hands of a \nblue-collar day laborer to become a man of accomplishment and great \nlearning, the embodiment of the American Dream. He once arrived for an \nexamination at City College of New York with a dockworker's loading \nhook tucked into his back pocket next to his pencils, as if it were a \nstudy in contrasting worlds.\n  It was this unrelenting desire, this hunger, this thirst for \nknowledge that led this former shoeshine boy from the sidewalks of New \nYork, that led this longshoreman who had worked out in the cold with \nthe swirling snow and the wintry winds about him, to his improbable \ndestiny in the life of our Nation.\n  Having served honorably in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a \ngunnery officer aboard the U.S.S. Quirinus, he earned a doctorate from \nthe Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1961. He taught briefly at \nboth Harvard University and Tufts University and then worked in a \nseries of high positions in the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford \nadministrations. Now get that, high positions in four administrations--\nthe Kennedy, the Johnson, the Nixon, and the Ford administrations. He \nbecame the first and only man ever to serve in the Cabinets or \nsubcabinets of four successive Presidents.\n  What an outstanding career. What an outstanding man for that career. \nHowever, this was only the beginning, for this great thinker among \npoliticians. He was also to become one of the finest politicians among \nthinkers.\n  A true visionary, Senator Moynihan is the kind of philosopher-\npolitician who the Founding Fathers had fervently hoped would populate \nthe Senate. Men, who, like Socrates' philosopher-kings described in \nPlato's Republic, ``are awake rather than dreaming''--men who have \nbroken the bonds of ignorance and have sought the truth of fine and \njust and good things, not simply the shapes and the half-defined \nshadows of the unthinking world; men who have shared the light of their \nlearning, illuminating the path for others--some of whom always seem to \nbe left in the dark.\n  If there is, in fact, one man among those of us in the Senate who \ntruly epitomizes Socrates' philosopher-king, it is surely, indubitably, \nand without question, the senior Senator from the State of New York, \nMr. Moynihan.\n  With a pragmatic eye and a unique talent for seeing the issues that \nface our Nation on a larger scale--on a grand scale--Senator Moynihan \nhas spent most of his life breaking through the partisan politics \ninside this beltway. He possesses both a startling ability to foresee \nfuture problems, far beyond the ken of most men, and the courage to \naddress these problems before they become apparent to common men. \nIssues that few others tackle with insight, such as Social Security, \nhealth care, and welfare reform, he has passionately addressed for many \nyears--crossing party lines, challenging every administration--and all \nwithout personal concern for political backlash. Simply put, Senator \nMoynihan states facts, the cold, hard truths that many others in high \nplaces refuse to face and that some are unable to see. His conscience \nis his compass, and his heart is steadied by his unfaltering belief in \nthe power of knowledge and the possibilities of government.\n\n  As Senator Moynihan steps away from his desk on the Senate floor for \nthe final time--he will never step away from it in my memory. I will \nalways see him at that desk. I will always see his face--that unkempt \nhair, the bow tie, the spectacles which he frequently readjusts. I can \nhear him say: ``sir; sir.''\n  As he steps away from his desk on the Senate floor for the final \ntime, he will walk away with his head held high, with his legacy \nintact, and with a distinguished and singular place in our Nation's \nhistory well secured. He will always be looked to as a leader of men, \nas an author of many books--more books than most Senators have read--\nand as a compassionate intellectual who has no peer in this Senate, who \nhas used his considerable talents to become one of the principal \narchitects of our Nation's foreign policy and our Nation's social \nsecurity safety net. He will be remembered thusly, for these and more.\n  U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, author of the \nWelfare Reform Act of 1988 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, chairman of the Senate Committee on the \nEnvironment and Public Works from 1992 to 1993, chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Finance from 1993 to 1994, Daniel Patrick Moynihan has \nleft his indelible mark on this country.\n  He served as the chairman of that Finance Committee, one of the \noldest of the few committees that sprang into being early, I believe it \nwas in 1816. It was from that Committee on Finance that the \nAppropriations Committee was carved in 1867, a half century later. In \nthe beginning, the Finance Committee handled both the finance and the \nappropriations business of the Senate. The Finance Committee was well \nled when Daniel Patrick Moynihan sat in the chair.\n  I certainly will never forget the role that Senator Moynihan played \nin our battle against the line-item veto. Like Socrates' quoting the \nshade of the dead Achilles in Homer's epic, the ``Odyssey,'' Senator \nMoynihan would rather, `` `work the Earth as a serf to another, one \nwithout possessions,' and go through any sufferings, than share their \nopinions and live as they do.''\n  Incapable of indifference and unable to sit by as others were \nparalyzed by ignorance, Senator Moynihan rose up and fought the good \nfight--the just fight--and he won, sir. He won.\n  In the 24 years that Senator Moynihan has walked the marble halls of \nthe Capitol, he has graced us all with intellectual vigor and a stellar \nlevel of scholarship. He has helped us all to ascend the path of true \nknowledge and reach for wisdom. Each of us, Democrat and Republican \nalike, recognizes that when Senator Moynihan speaks, we should listen \nfor we may learn something that could fundamentally shift our thinking \non a given matter. Senator Moynihan has been a guiding light, a sage of \nsages, the best of colleagues, and always, always a gentleman--always a \ngentleman.\n  On this day, when I state this encomium in my feeble way--feeble \nbecause I cannot meet the challenge, strive though I must, I cannot \nmeet the challenge to gropingly find the appropriate words to express \nmy true and deep abiding admiration and love. I cannot find it for this \nman.\n  I have served with many men and women in this Senate. Everyone here \nknows of my great admiration for some of those men--I say ``men'' \nbecause, for the most part, of these more than two centuries, only men \nserved in this body. Every colleague of mine knows of my deep \nadmiration for certain former Senators--Senator Richard Russell, \nSenator Russell Long, Senator Lister Hill, Senator Everett Dirksen, and \nothers--and yet Senator Moynihan is uniquely unique. He is not the \nkeeper of the rules as was Senator Russell. He is not the great orator \nthat was Senator Dirksen, but this man is unique in his knowledge, in \nhis grasp of great issues, in his ability to foresee the future and to \npoint the way, always unassuming, always courteous, always a gentleman. \nAh, that we could all be like this man!\n  I wish I could have been so fortunate as to sit in Senator Moynihan's \nclasses at Harvard or, to paraphrase Garfield, on a log in the West \nVirginia hills with Pat Moynihan on one end and me on the other. That \nis the picture I have of one to whom I look up, one whom I admire and \nat whose feet I would gladly sit to learn the lessons, the philosophy, \nthe chemistry of the times.\n  Erma and I offer our best wishes to his lovely and gracious wife \nElizabeth as our esteemed colleague, Senator Moynihan, embarks on yet \nanother adventure--retirement. I thank him for being this special man, \nalways a philosopher-Senator. He will be sorely missed here. Whence \ncometh another like him?\n  Herman Melville, in his classic work, Moby Dick, said this:\n\n       There is a Catskill Eagle in some souls that can alike dive \n     down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and \n     become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever \n     flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so \n     that even in his lowest swoop, the Mountain Eagle is still \n     higher than the other birds upon the plain, even though they \n     soar.\n\n  Many who have passed through these halls have soared, but very, very \nfew could ever truly be likened to a Catskill Eagle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. When I arrived at the Senate near 25 years ago, it was \nvery clear to me that I would look to Robert C. Byrd as my mentor; and \nhe has been. I have sat at the foot of this Gamaliel for a quarter \ncentury. As I leave, sir, he is my mentor still. I am profoundly \ngrateful.\n  If I have met with your approval, sir, it is all I have hoped for. I \nthank you beyond words. And I thank you for your kind remarks about \nElizabeth.

Mr. President, recently, a great voice was silenced when \nCarl Thomas Rowan passed away. As a newspaper columnist, he articulated \nthe problems and predicaments of working Americans. As a Presidential \nadvisor, Mr. Rowan spoke for the rights not only of minorities but also \nfor all Americans who were getting the short end of the stick, as we \nsay back in the West Virginia hills.\n  Carl Rowan and I came from similar backgrounds. We both grew up in \npoor coal-mining communities and we never forgot our roots. Carl often \ntalked about growing up without running water, without electricity, \nwithout those basic amenities that so many people take for granted \ntoday. As they did for me, those humble beginnings provided Carl Rowan \nwith the burning desire to make a difference in his community and in \nhis country. And make a difference he did.\n  The only thing stronger than Carl Rowan's voice was his conviction. \nHe stood for basic principles--equality and freedom--and those \nprinciples guided him at every step in his life. Earlier this year, \nCarl Rowan wrote:\n\n       Men and women do not live only by what is attainable; they \n     are driven more by what they dream of and aspire to that \n     which might be forever beyond their grasp.\n\n  That ideal resonated not only in his columns but also in his life. \nInstead of simply bemoaning the fact that a college education was too \nexpensive for many underprivileged children, Mr. Rowan in 1987 created \nthe Project Excellence Foundation, which has made nearly $80 million \navailable to students for academic scholarships. Instead of allowing \nthe amputation of part of his right leg to slow him down, Mr. Rowan \nwalked--and even danced; even danced--faster than doctors expected, and \nhe then pushed for greater opportunities for the disabled. When others \nsaw obstacles, Carl Rowan saw challenges. When others saw \nimpossibilities, Carl Rowan saw opportunities. Instead of cursing the \ndarkness, Carl Rowan lighted the candles.\n  Mr. Rowan wrote:\n\n       Wise people will remember that the Declaration of \n     Independence and the Preamble to our Constitution are mostly \n     unattainable wishful thinking or make-believe assertions that \n     were horizons beyond the reality of life at the time they \n     were written.\n\n  Carl Rowan always reached beyond the horizon--he always went beyond \nthe horizon--and he helped others to aspire to do the same. With the \npassing of Carl Rowan, journalism has lost one of its best, the \nunderprivileged have lost a friend, and the Nation has lost a part of \nits social conscience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BALL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment upon \nthe death of one of America's great lawyers, Joseph A. Ball. On \nSaturday, the New York Times carried an extensive account of his \nbackground and history and accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent \nthat at the conclusion of my remarks the copy of the New York Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Times article details the specifics on the positions \nheld by Mr. Ball in the lawyers associations, his professorial \nassociations as a teacher, his experience as a criminal lawyer, and his \nexperience, most pointedly, as one of the senior counsel to the Warren \nCommission, the President's commission which investigated the \nassassination of President Kennedy. It was on the Warren Commission \nstaff that I came to know Joe Ball.\n  The original complexion of the Warren Commission on staffing was that \nthere were six senior counsel who were appointed and six junior \ncounsel. That distinction was replaced by putting all of the lawyers \nunder the category of assistant counsel. But if there was a senior \ncounsel, it was Joe Ball.\n  Then, in his early sixties, he was a tower of strength for the \nyounger lawyers. When the commission began its work, I was 33. Most of \nthe junior lawyers were about the same age. We looked to Joe Ball for \nhis experience and for his guidance. He had a special relationship with \nChief Justice Earl Warren, which was also helpful because Joe Ball \ncould find out what Chief Justice Warren had in mind in his capacity as \nchairman and provide some valuable insights that some of the younger \nlawyers were unable to attain.\n  Joe Ball worked on what was called area two, along with the very \ndistinguished younger lawyer, David Belin from Des Moines, IA. Area two \nwas the area which was structured to identify the assassin. Although \nthe initial reports had identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin, \nand on television, on November 24, America saw Jack Ruby walk into the \nDallas police station, put a gun in Oswald's stomach and kill him, the \nWarren Commission started off its investigation without any \npresumptions but looking at the evidence to make that determination as \nto who the assassin was.\n  My area was area one, which involved the activities of the President \non November 22, 1963. There was substantial interaction between the \nwork that Joe Ball and Dave Belin did and the work which was assigned \nto me and Francis W.H. Adams, who was senior counsel on area one.\n  Frank Adams had been New York City police commissioner and had been \nasked to join the Warren Commission staff when Mayor Wagner sat next to \nChief Justice Warren at the funeral of former Governor and former \nSenator, Herbert Lehman. Mayor Wagner told Chief Justice Warren that \nFrank Adams, the police commissioner, knew a lot about Presidential \nprotection and had designed protection for motorcades in New York City, \nwith dangers from tall buildings, which was an analogy to what happened \nto President Kennedy.\n  There was question as to how we would coordinate our work, and it was \nsort of decided that Joe Ball and Dave Belin would investigate matters \nwhen the bullet left the rifle of the assassin in flight, which was no \nman's land, and when it struck the President. That came into area one, \nwhich was my area: the bullet wounds on President Kennedy, the bullet \nwounds on Governor Connally, what happened with the doctors at Parkland \nHospital, what happened with the autopsy, all matters related to what \nhad happened with President Kennedy.\n  We had scheduled the autopsy surgeons for a Monday in early March. \nThey were Lieutenant Commander Boswell, Lieutenant Commander Humes and \nLieutenant Colonel Pierre Finck. The autopsy was done at Bethesda, \nwhere President Kennedy was taken, because of the family's preference \nthat he go to a naval installation because he was a Navy man, so to \nspeak, who had served in the Navy.\n  The testimony was to be taken on this Monday in March. There was \nquite a debate going on with the Warren Commission staff as to whether \nwe should talk to witnesses in advance. It seemed to many of us that we \nshould talk to witnesses in advance so we would have an idea as to what \nthey would testify to so we could have an orderly presentation, which \nis the way any lawyer talks to a witness whom he is about to call. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer has been a trial lawyer and knows very \nwell to what I am referring. There was a segment on the Warren \nCommission staff which thought we should not talk to any witnesses in \nadvance, lest there be some overtone of influencing their testimony. \nFinally, this debate had to come\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nto a head, and it came to a head the week before the autopsy searchers \nwere to testify.\n  And on Friday afternoon, Joe Ball and I went out to Bethesda to talk \nto the autopsy surgeons. It was a Friday afternoon, much like a Friday \nafternoon in the Senate. Nobody else was around. It was my area, but I \nwas looking for some company, so I asked Joe Ball to accompany me--the \nautopsy surgeons falling in my area. We took the ride out to Bethesda \nand met the commanding admiral and introduced ourselves. We didn't have \nany credentials. The only thing we had to identify ourselves as working \non the Warren Commission was a building pass for the VFW. My building \npass had my name typed crooked on the line, obviously having been typed \nin after it was signed. They sign them all and then type them in. It \ndidn't look very official at all.\n  So when Commander Humes and Commander Bozwell came down to be \ninterviewed, Commander Humes was very leery about talking to anybody. \nHe had gone through some travail with having burned his notes and \nhaving been subjected to a lot of comment and criticism about what \nhappened at the autopsy, and there were FBI agents present when the \nautopsy was conducted. A report had come out that the bullet that had \nentered the base of the President's neck had been dislodged during the \nautopsy by massage. It had fallen out backward as opposed to having \ngone through the President's body, which was what the medical evidence \nhad shown.\n  That FBI report that the bullet had entered partially into the \nPresident's body and then been forced out had caused a lot of \ncontroversy before the whole facts were known. Later, it was determined \nthat the first shot which hit the President--he was hit by two \nbullets--well, the second shot, which hit him in the base of the skull, \nwas fatal, entering the base of the skull and exiting at the top at 13 \ncentimeters, 5 inches--the fatal wound. The first bullet which hit the \nPresident passed between two large strap muscles, sliced the pleural \ncavity, hit nothing solid and came out, and Governor Connally was \nseated right in front of the President and the bullet would have to \nhave hit either Governor Connally or someone in the limousine.\n  After extensive tests were conducted, it was concluded that the \nbullet hit Governor Connally. There has been a lot of controversy about \nthe single bullet theory, but time has shown that it is correct. A lot \nof tests were conducted on the muzzle velocity of the Oswald rifle. It \nwas identified as having been Oswald's, purchased from a Chicago mail \norder store. He came into the building with a large package which could \nhave contained the rifle. He said they were curtain rods for an \napartment which already had curtains. The muzzle velocity was about \n2,200 feet per second, and the velocity after traveling about 275 feet \nwas about 1,900 feet per second.\n  At any rate, as Joe Ball and I went through it with the autopsy \nsurgeons, we found for the first time--because we had only seen the FBI \nreports--that the bullet did go through President Kennedy and decreased \nvery little in velocity. It was at that moment when we talked to Dr. \nHumes and Dr. Finck that we came to hypothesize that that bullet might \nhave gone through Governor Connally. We didn't come to a conclusion on \nthat until we had reviewed very extensive additional notes, but it was \non that occasion that Joe Ball and I had interviewed the autopsy \nsurgeons. It was a marvel to watch Joe Ball work with his extensive \nexperience as a lawyer and as a fact finder.\n  He lived to the ripe old age of 97. The New York Times obituary had \nvery extensive compliments about a great deal of his work and focused \non his contribution to the Warren Commission, where he had written an \nextensive portion of the Warren Report, as he was assigned to area two \nwhich compiled a fair amount of the report.\n  America has lost a great patriot in Joe Ball, a great citizen, a \ngreat lawyer, and a great contributor. I had the pleasure of knowing \nhim and working with him on the Warren Commission staff and have had \noccasion to reminisce with him about his work. I noted that on his \noffice wall in California is his elegantly framed building pass.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ball, 97, Counsel to Warren Commission\n\n                             (By Eric Pace)\n\n       Joseph A. Ball, a California trial attorney who was a \n     senior counsel to the Warren Commission, which investigated \n     the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, died on Sept. \n     21 in Long Beach, Calif. He was 97 and a longtime resident of \n     Long Beach.\n       At his death, Mr. Ball was a partner in the Los Angeles \n     office of the Hawaii-based law firm Carlsmith Ball. He had \n     been a partner in that firm and its predecessor in Los \n     Angeles for five decades.\n       Mr. Ball, who wrote crucial portions of the commission's \n     report, was selected for the commission by United States \n     Chief Justice Earl Warren, who had come to know him in \n     California's political world.\n       At that time, Mr. Ball was 61, a leading criminal lawyer, a \n     member of the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on the \n     Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and a professor at the \n     University of Southern California Law School.\n       In January 1964, he was appointed as one of six senior \n     lawyers who, each assisted by a younger colleague, were to \n     handle one of six broad areas of inquiry.\n       Mr. Ball and David W. Belin, a lawyer from Des Moines who \n     was chosen to assist him, concentrated on the area they \n     called ``the determination of who was the assassin of \n     President Kennedy.''\n       ``About 10,000 pieces of paper were then rolled into my \n     office; the written reports of various investigative \n     agencies, including the F.B.I., the Dallas Police and the \n     Central Intelligence Agency,'' Mr. Ball wrote in 1993. \n     ``During the first month of the investigation, we classified \n     the information found in the reports by means of a card index \n     system. This permitted the immediate retrieval of this \n     information.'' Witnesses were also questioned during the \n     inquiry.\n       Mr. Belin wrote in 1971, after the Commission's report had \n     been criticized, that ``despite the success of the \n     assassination sensationalists in deceiving a large body of \n     world opinion, the Warren Commission Report will stand the \n     test of history for one simple reason: The ultimate truth \n     beyond a reasonable doubt is that Lee Harvey Oswald killed \n     both John F. Kennedy and J.D. Tippit on that tragic afternoon \n     of Nov. 22, 1963.''\n       Office Tippit was a Dallas police officer whom Oswald shot \n     shortly before shooting Kennedy.\n       The commission's final report was sent to President Lyndon \n     B. Johnson in September 1964.\n       Mr. Ball was a president of the American College of Trial \n     Lawyers and of the State Bar of California.\n       The Joseph A. Ball Fund to benefit American Bar Association \n     programs of public service and education and to honor \n     excellent attorneys was named in his honor.\n       He was born in Stuart, Iowa, and received a bachelor's \n     decree in 1925 from Creighton University in Nebraska and his \n     law degree in 1927 from the University of Southern \n     California.\n       He married Elinor Thon in 1931. After her death, he \n     remarried. He also outlived his second wife, Sybil.\n       He is survived by a daughter JoEllen; two grandchildren; \n     and two great-grandchildren.\n       Mr. Ball recalled in 1993: ``In 1965, I called Chief \n     Justice Warren on the telephone. I said, `Chief, these \n     critics of the report are guilty of misrepresentation and \n     dishonest reporting.' He replied, `Be patient; history will \n     prove that we are right.'

Mr. President, I am often critical of this \nAdministration's happy-go-lucky ways when it comes to drug policy. The \nadministration is like the grasshopper in the old fable. It's out there \nfiddling around when it ought to be working. That said, I do not mean \nthis criticism to detract from the fine work done by the many men and \nwomen in our law enforcement agencies. These fine people risk their \nlives every day to do important and difficult work on behalf of the \npublic.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight some of the achievements and \ninvaluable service provided to this nation by the men and women of the \nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Customs Service, and \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. As chairman of the Senate Caucus on International \nNarcotics Control, I would like to express my\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nthanks and make known the tremendous pride that I think we should all \nhave in the good people in these agencies.\n  The men and women of the DEA, Customs, and the Coast Guard are \ndedicated to the protection of the United States and to ensuring the \nsafety of our children and our lives from the devastating effects of \nthe drug trade. They are called on daily to place their lives in harm's \nway in an effort to keep our nation secure. When they are boarding \nsmugglers' vessels on the seas. When they stop terrorists at the \nborder. When they investigate narcotics trafficking organizations \naround the globe. When they dismantle clandestine methamphetamine labs, \nengage in undercover operations, safeguard our ports of entry, or shut \ndown ecstasy peddling night clubs, these fine people risk their lives \nand well being for all of us.\n  DEA efforts this year include Operation Mountain Express, which \narrested 140 individuals in 8 cities, seized $8 million and 10 metric \ntons of pseudoephedrine tablets, which could have produced \napproximately 18,000 pounds of methamphetamine. In addition, DEA's \nOperation Tar Pit, in cooperation with the FBI, resulted in nearly 200 \narrests in 12 cities and the seizure of 41 pounds of heroin. The heroin \nring they busted was peddling dope to kids, many of whom died. DEA, in \nconjunction with State and local law enforcement, has also aggressively \ndismantled hundreds of clandestine methamphetamine labs that poison our \nurban streets and rural communities.\n  The United States Customs Service has seized over 9,000,000 Ecstasy \ntablets in the last 10 months. Ecstasy is an emerging problem that \naffects not only our large cities but many rural areas, including my \nhome State of Iowa. In addition, their Miami River operations have \nresulted in the seizure of 18 vessels, mostly arriving from Haiti, and \nover 7,000 pounds of cocaine--a small portion of the over 122,000 \npounds of cocaine seized this fiscal year. Finally, the Customs Service \nhas seized over 1 million pounds of marijuana and over 2,000 pounds of \nheroin as well, often in very risky situations.\n  Coast Guard successes this year include a record-breaking seizure \ntotal of over 123,000 pounds of cocaine, including many major cases in \nthe Eastern Pacific. This effort went forward even while still \ninterdicting over 4,000 illegal alien migrants bound for U.S. shores. \nIn addition, the deployment of two specially equipped interdiction \nhelicopters in Operation New Frontier had an unprecedented success rate \nof six seized go-fast vessels in six attempts.\n  Finally, as announced last month, a joint DEA and Customs \ninvestigation--supported by the Coast Guard and Department of Defense--\nconcluded a 2 year multinational case against a Colombian drug \ntransportation organization. The result was the arrest of 43 suspects \nand the seizure of nearly 25 tons of cocaine, with a retail street \nvalue of $1 billion. Operation Journey targeted an organization that \nused large commercial vessels to haul multi-ton loads of cocaine. This \norganization may have shipped a total of 68 tons of cocaine to 12 \ncountries in Europe and North America.\n  I believe we should all be proud of the jobs these folks do on our \nbehalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9563-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9563-S9564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAST PITCH IS FOUL BALL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the administration is at it again. Late \nlast month, it issued its findings from the latest Household Survey on \ndrug use in America. You would have to look fast to find anything about \nit. As usual, the administration chose to release the information when \nno one was looking. And as usual, they did this hoping no one would \nnotice. Given that the majority of the press did not bother to do more \nthan rephrase the press release from the Department of Health and Human \nServices, it would be hard to figure out just what the 300-odd page \nreport actually said anyway. But neither the press release nor the news \naccounts do justice to what is not happening. What is not happening is \nthe fact that the drug use picture is not getting any better.\n  When it comes to drugs, the administration just can't say it \nstraight.\n  It continues the trend of its incumbency of labeling bad news or good \nnews and counting on the press to not look beyond the hype. In \nreleasing the latest data, Secretary Shalala says that the report shows \nthe continuing downward trend in drug use. She remarked at the press \nconference that, ``We've not only turned the corner--we're heading for \nhome plate,''--suggesting that the report shows that the administration \nhas hit a home run.\n  I'm not sure at which game Secretary Shalala is playing, but the most \ngenerous interpretation is that she clearly is not reading her own \nreports or her staff is not telling her what's in them. She needs new \nglasses or new staff. Despite this happy talk, even HHS's own press \nrelease notes that, ``Illicit drug use among the overall population 12 \nand older remained flat.'' That may be a home run down at HHS but in \nplain English that means ``no change.'' In my book, ``flat'' does not \nmean continuing a downward trend.\n  I suppose in an election year ``no change'' in how many people are \nusing drugs is a sign of success. Least ways, that's how this \nadministration sees it. Or, wants you and me to see it. But when you \nactually get down into the numbers, this ``success'' is not all it \nappears to be. It shares something with the Cheshire cat--it disappears \nwhen you look at it. In true Alice in Wonderland logic, down is not \nalways not up. To follow Shalala's analogy with baseball, what we have \nhere is not a home run but the runner rounding the bases on a foul \nball.\n  Before I get to actual numbers, let me say something on background \nabout this year's report. The thing to note is that the administration \nhas changed the methodology for how it collects data for the report. \nWhy is that important? Here's what the report says: ``Because of the \ndifferences in methodology and impact of the new survey design on data \ncollection, only limited comparisons can be made between data from the \n1999 survey and data from surveys prior to 1999.''\n  Now, in those years since 1993, that data show dramatic increases in \ndrug use on this administration's watch. During each of those years, \nhowever, the administration tried to put a ``spin'' on the information, \ncalling bad news good news. Instead of doing that any more, they have \ndecided to play hide and seek with the information. Don't like the \nresults? Well . . . Change the way you figure them and declare success. \nAs with the Cheshire cat, pretty soon all you're left with is the \nsmile. Even this little bit of sleight of hand, however, does not \nwholly work.\n  It's really very simple. There has been no significant change for the \nbetter in the rate of past month drug use on this administration's \nwatch. More seniors graduating from high school today report using \ndrugs than in any year since 1975. Almost 55 percent of high school \nseniors now report using an illegal drug before graduation.\n  Use of heroin among young people is on the rise. We are in the midst \nof a methamphetamine epidemic. If reports are accurate, we are awash in \nEcstasy and its use among the young is accelerating. The rate of \nillicit drug use has increased in six out of the last seven years.\n  The administration tries to hide this fact by reporting on a decline \nof use among 12-17-year-olds in hopes no one will notice an increase \namong 18-25-year-olds. But this is a statistical game. Although there \nis an unfortunate trend in the onset of drug use at earlier ages, onset \nbegins most typically among 15-18-year-olds. By including the earlier \nyears in the count, you disguise the true rate of increase.\n  Even allowing for the moment that the administration spin is true, \nhowever, does not change the fact that youthful use of drugs continues \nspiraling upwards.\n  Today's use levels are 70 percent higher than when this \nadministration took office. The numbers are not getting better. Yet, we \nhave another report and another press release touting victory. This is \nshameful and to call it anything else is a sham.\n  And just as bad, fewer kids are reporting that using illicit drugs is \ndangerous--a sure sign of future problems. Especially at a time when we \nhave a well-monied, aggressive legalization campaign that this \nadministration has done little to counter. And this despite a $200 \nmillion-a-year ad campaign aimed at exactly these age groups that\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\nthis administration touts as a success. The most optimistic thing a \nrecent GAO report had to say about this much-troubled effort is the \nhope that it might do better.\n  The administration also continues the game of trying to hide its \nrecord by lumping the increasing use figures on its watch with the \ndecreasing use figures in earlier administrations. I have complained \nrepeatedly about this gimmick. This is just plain deception.\n  Mr. President, I am often critical of this administration's happy-go-\nlucky ways when it comes to drug policy. The administration is like the \ngrasshopper in the old fable. It's out there fiddling around when it \nought to be working.

He personally \ntravels his State and has led efforts against methamphetamines, \nEcstacy, and other drugs. He understands those issues clearly.\n  He is correct; there is too much spin. These drugs do not justify the \npositive spin being put on them. During the administrations of \nPresidents Bush and Reagan, I served as a Federal prosecutor. According \nto the University of Michigan Authoritative Study of Drug Use Among \nHigh School Students, drug use fell every single year for 12 \nconsecutive years; it jumped after this administration took office. \nThey have, in fact, made a number of mistakes that have undermined the \nprogress made.\n  I appreciate serving with Senator Grassley on the drug caucus and in \nthe Judiciary Committee where we have discussed these issues.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Alabama for the support he has \ngiven to the drug caucus. Most importantly, he is a regular attender of \nour meetings and hearings. His support and interest in this issue, \nparticularly coming from his background as a U.S. attorney, have been \nvery helpful to the work of the drug caucus as well. I thank him for \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9564-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9564-S9565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I indicate to my colleagues I will take \na few minutes to speak about the administration's energy policy; \nhowever, as I think about it, it is better to entitle it the \nadministration's ``no energy'' policy.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration and anger with \nthe Clinton/Gore administration's lack of an energy policy.\n  Each weekend I travel back to my home state of Iowa. In recent weeks \nI have spent many hours explaining to my constituents why fuel prices \nare so high, and unfortunately, explaining why prices will likely rise \npast current levels. I've continually had the displeasure of looking \ntruckers and farmers in the eye and telling them there is no relief in \nsight.\n  In my home state we are experiencing price levels not seen in a \ndecade, but all I can tell my farmers and truckers is that it is likely \ngoing to get worse.\n  In recent weeks, the price of crude oil reached more than $37 a \nbarrel, the highest price in 10 years. Natural gas is $5.10 per million \nBtu's, double over a year ago. Heating oil in Iowa is around $1.25 a \ngallon, up 40 cents from this time last year. And propane, a critical \nfuel which farmers use to dry grain, is up 55 percent since last year.\n  These increases are simply unacceptable. Iowans and the rest of the \nnation should not have been subjected to these price spikes.\n  Unfortunately, it is the Clinton/Gore administration's lack of an \nenergy policy over the past 7\\1/2\\ years that have directly led to the \nsituation we are facing today. Mr. President, two weeks ago, Vice \nPresident Gore stated, and I quote: ``I will work toward the day when \nwe are free forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.''\n  Yet, since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 18 percent--the lowest \nlevel since 1954. At the same time, U.S. oil consumption has risen 14 \npercent.\n  The result: U.S. dependence on foreign oil under the Clinton/Gore \nadministration has increased 34 percent. We now depend on foreign oil \ncartels for 58 percent of our crude oil, compared to just 36 percent \nduring the Arab oil embargo of 1973.\n  Some may be wondering how we got here. The answer is clear. This \nadministration is opposed to the use of coal. Opposed to nuclear energy \nproduction. Opposed to hydroelectric dams. Opposed to new oil \nrefineries; 36 have been closed, but none has been built in the past \neight years. And, this administration is opposed to domestic oil and \ngas exploration and production.\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\n  This administration opposes nearly every form of domestic energy \nproduction.\n  They do, however, support the use of clean, efficient, and \ndomestically produced natural gas. Currently, 50 percent of American \nhomes are heated with natural gas. In addition, 15 percent of our \nnation's electric power is generated by natural gas. And while demand \nfor natural gas is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next \ndecade, the administration has not provided the land access necessary \nto increase supply.\n  As this map demonstrates, federal lands in the Rocky Mountains and \nthe Gulf of Mexico, along with offshore areas in the Atlantic and the \nPacific, contain over 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Access to \nthis land could provide the resources necessary to meet current demand \nfor nearly ten years.\n  Unfortunately, this land and millions of acres of forest are either \nclosed to exploration or effectively off limits. Simply put, our \nnation's producers can't meet demand without greater access to the \nresources God gave us.\n  I am a strong supporter of alternative and renewable energy. I have \nbeen a leader in the Senate in promoting alternative energy sources as \na way of protecting our environment and increasing our energy \nindependence.\n  My support for expanding the production of ethanol, wind and biomass \nenergy has directly led to the increased use of these abundant \nrenewable energy resources. But right now, these are only part of the \nsolution, and President Clinton and Vice President Gore know that.\n  The administration does not have a plan to deal with our current \nenergy needs. I believe the solution is clear.\n  It is time to support and encourage responsible resource \ndevelopment--using our best technology to protect our environment--to \nincrease domestic energy production. It is time to make use of the vast \nresources this great country has to offer. Only then will we be free \nfrom so much dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nGrassley for his wise remarks about our energy policy. Certainly \nnatural gas is the cleanest burning of our fossil fuels. We will need \nit more and more because every electric powerplant that is being built \nis a natural gas plant. The Senator makes an outstanding and valuable \npoint that we have to do a better job of producing more.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sessions and Mr. Hutchinson pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3143 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives back in 1992, I spent 2 years serving in the minority--\n2 years; in 1993 and 1994--before the Republican victories in the 1994 \nelections brought about the first Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives in 40 years.\n  Having now been on the majority side for 5\\1/2\\ years, I am very \nappreciative of the 2 years I served in the minority. Having had the \nexperience of knowing what it is to be in the minority, to have the \nagenda set by the majority side, to have the frustration of having vote \nafter vote in which you come up on the short end, is important. I think \nit helps me in understanding the frustrations the other side has \nexperienced. It also helps me understand now, being in the majority, \nhow hard it is to lead and to govern.\n  I remember in those first 2 years, we were pretty organized in \nlobbing criticisms and lobbing objections and in presenting our agenda \nto the American people. We didn't have to worry about legislating. We \ndidn't have to worry about passing anything. We didn't have the votes \nto do that. But we could do a lot in framing the debate.\n  As we approach the end of this session, it is much easier to \ncriticize in the minority than to govern in the majority. It is easy to \nsay no; it is easy to find even the slightest flaw with a legislative \nproposal as a rationale for opposing it and blocking it. When you are \nin the majority, the job of calling up tough bills, debating the very \ntough issues, taking the very tough votes, that is what governing is \nabout.\n  That is why I have come to the floor this afternoon. I believe an \nattack unanswered is an attack assumed.\n  Last week, Senator Byrd, for whom I have the greatest admiration, \ncame to the floor and noted that few Members in this body have ever \nwitnessed how the Senate is really supposed to function. I concur with \nthat; I agree entirely. I believe it takes a commitment, a commitment \nfrom both sides of the aisle to complete our appropriations obligations \nin a timely fashion and to ensure the Senate is governing and \nfunctioning the way it is supposed to.\n  The fact is, there are a number of Senators who don't seem to want \nbills signed into law but who want issues. Why? Because it is easier to \ndemagogue an issue than it is to legislate an issue. So who gets left \nholding the buck? Who gets the blame if legislation, for any reason, \ndoes not pass? It is clearly the majority in the Congress who will get \nblamed if the Government shuts down, as we have already found out. It \nis those who are in the majority in Congress, clearly, who get the \nblame.\n  In terms of another Government shutdown, I assure the American people \nand my colleagues that despite any dispute over issues pending, the \nGovernment will not shut down if we have anything to say about it or \nanything to do about it, if it can be prevented in any way. Social \nSecurity checks will be delivered, health care services under Medicare \nwill be funded, and our Nation's veterans will not be left out in the \ncold.\n  That being said, we still have 11 appropriations bills unsigned and \nmultiple unrelated issues on the table. The education of our kids, \nprescription drugs, and a Patients' Bill of Rights are all there, still \non the table. Since these unrelated issues seem to get tossed around a \ngreat deal, let me talk about them plainly for a few minutes and why \nthe minority continues to insist on their passage by holding up our \nNation's spending bills.\n  First of all, in the area of education, the other side maintains that \nwe are not having a debate on education in the 106th Congress. I \nsuggest that the other side of the aisle doesn't really want a bill; \nthey want an issue. They say that unless we vote for their few \neducation proposals, which, by the way, would concentrate even more \npower in the Department of Education, we are not having a debate on \neducation. I think that is not fair, and it is not accurate.\n\n  During the 106th Congress, we have already voted six times on the \nclass size reduction initiative. Six times we have all been called upon \nto cast our vote, to go on the record, even though that has been \nmisconstrued and misrepresented to the American people. We have been \nwilling to debate it. We have been willing to cast votes a half dozen \ntimes during this Congress alone.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Alabama pointed out, the \nDepartment of Education has failed to pass an audit for 3 years in a \nrow. They can't even account for how the money is being spent \ncurrently. So it is not unreasonable that many of us have reservations \nin giving them more power and more authority in the area of school \nconstruction and the hiring of 100,000 new teachers.\n  According to the Congressional Daily Monitor, a press conference was \nheld recently with Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Education \nSecretary Dick Riley, ``demanding that Republicans accept their \npositions.'' So after voting six times against the class size reduction \ninitiative in the Senate, you would think the attitude would not be \ntheir way is the only way. Our side of the aisle has been more than \naccommodating in providing funding that was reserved for class size \nreduction. In the fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, \nRepublicans have appropriated the $1.3 billion for class size reduction \nin the title VI State grant so that schools who want to use the funding \nfor this initiative are able to do so. But schools that have already \nachieved the goal of class size reduction or have more pressing \nproblems can use the funding for other priority items such as \nprofessional development or new textbooks.\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\n  One would think that is a reasonable, acceptable compromise, a middle \nground. But instead, we hear the other side saying: It is our way or no \nway. We are going to block the appropriations bills unless you do it \nexactly the way we want it. They contend, again, unless we are voting \nfor class size reduction, we are avoiding the issue of education, even \nthough we have already voted on class size reduction six times in this \nCongress.\n  The Democrats considered bringing this issue up again in the HELP \nCommittee just last week as an amendment to a bipartisan bill to fully \nfund the IDEA program. If a debate on education is what the other side \nreally wants, then why did they object to multiple unanimous consent \nrequests on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act to keep the debate on education?\n  The ESEA debate was moving along very well on the Senate floor. There \nwas a consensus that only a few amendments should be offered and they \nshould be germane. They should relate to education. But then on the \nother side of the aisle there were those who objected to those \nagreements to keep the debate limited to education. I know that I and \nmy colleagues on this side of aisle would be more than willing to \nreturn to S. 2, the reauthorization of this critical elementary and \nsecondary education bill, to debate education, if we would simply have \nthat agreement to limit the amendments not to everything under the sun, \nnot to prescription drugs and a Patients' Bill of Rights and minimum \nwage and everything else, but to limit that debate to education.\n\n  I am not going to allow Members on the other side of the aisle to \nhave it both ways. You claim that we are not dealing with education and \nthen object to agreements to keep education debates on education bills. \nI suggest you are looking for an issue, not the passage of legislation.\n  Then on the issue of prescription drugs, my distinguished colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, last week--I had the opportunity to \npreside as he made this speech, but I want to quote him--said:\n\n       On the other side, they make a proposal which sounds good \n     but just will not work. Under Governor Bush's proposal on \n     prescription drugs, he asserts for 4 years we will let the \n     States handle it. There are fewer than 20 States that have \n     any drug benefits. Illinois is one of them, I might say. His \n     home State of Texas has none. But he says let the States \n     handle it for 4 years. Let them work it out. In my home State \n     of Illinois, I am glad we have it, but it certainly is not a \n     system that one would recommend for the country. Our system \n     of helping to pay for prescription drugs for seniors applies \n     to certain illnesses and certain drugs. If you happen to be \n     an unfortunate person without that kind of coverage and \n     protection, you are on your own.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I know Senator McCain is waiting. I appreciate very \nmuch his graciousness.\n  The fact is, while Senator Durbin made that comment, every State does \nhave a Medicaid program that offers prescription drugs today. In \naddition, they have State employee drug programs already in existence. \nThese programs are separate from the State pharmaceutical assistance \nprograms, of which 25 currently exist. So Senator Durbin's argument is \nunfair and unjustified because the money given to the States is not \nrequired to be used to only start a new pharmaceutical assistance \nprogram.\n  They can be used to expand the existing Medicaid drug programs. So \nGovernor Bush's helping hand drug plan provides greater assistance to \nlow-income seniors, and provides it now, while Vice President Gore's \nplan requires an 8-year phase-in for those drug benefits. So I suggest \nthat we are getting a lot of demagogy.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is the final issue I wanted to talk \nabout, but I will reserve that for another time. I will say this, and \nsay it clearly: We have an active conference that has been working, and \nworking hard. We had numerous votes on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nhad endless amendments in the committee on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. To suggest this isn't a deliberative body, as the Democratic \nleader suggested last week, is unfair. This issue has been debated, and \ndebated thoroughly. It is the Democrats who stifled the debate by \nwalking out on the conference in the spring. We can still have a \nPatients' Bill of Rights enacted if we have cooperation. There are two \nsides to every story, and both should be told. Let's not allow two \ncompeting agendas to prevent us from getting our work done on the \nspending bills. They are too important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9566-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9566-S9567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MOTOR VEHICLE AND MOTOR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT DEFECT NOTIFICATION \n                            IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I want to discuss an issue that is \nof sometimes importance, the Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Equipment \nDefect Notification Improvement Act.\n  Last week, the Commerce Committee reported S. 3059, the Motor Vehicle \nand Motor Vehicle Equipment Defect Notification Improvement Act. The \nbill is in response to the systemic failure of the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and the motor vehicle industry to share \ninformation that could have prevented the fatalities that resulted in \nthe recent recall of millions of Bridgestone/Firestone tires.\n  The key provisions of the bill would insure that NHTSA has the \ninformation that it needs from manufacturers to make sound decisions, \nincluding information about recalls in foreign countries. This \nlegislation would increase penalties to deter manufacturers from \nwithholding valuable information about recalls and establish \nappropriate penalties for the most egregious actions that place \nconsumers in danger. It would also require NHTSA to upgrade the Federal \nmotor vehicle safety standard for tires, which has not been updated \nsince its adoption more than 30 years ago.\n  It is my understanding that a few Members have placed holds on this \nbill for various reasons--I think there are two--including opposition \nto the inclusion of criminal penalties for violating motor vehicle \nsafety standards. Clearly, each member is entitled to place a hold on \nmeasures to which they object, but I hope that members can understand \nthe importance of acting on the key provisions of this bill before \nCongress adjourns.\n  The criminal penalties provision in this bill have been the subject \nof much discussion. The provision is intended to allow for the \nassessment of criminal penalties in instances where a manufacturer's \nconduct is so egregious as to render civil penalties meaningless. An \narticle in this week's Business Week, addresses the application of \ncriminal penalties to such conduct. It reports that ``prosecutors have \nbeen waking up to the fact that criminal sanctions may be a more \neffective deterrent and punishment than the worst civil penalties.'' \nFurthermore, a criminal penalties provision is not a novel inclusion. \nMultiple agencies are authorized to assess criminal penalties, \nincluding, among others, the Department of Labor, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Already, NHTSA has linked more than 100 deaths to these tire \nfailures. Last week, NHTSA announced that other models of Bridgestone/\nFirestone tires may be defective as well. We must act quickly to \ncorrect the problems that could lead to further loss of life. As I have \nrepeated throughout the process, I am willing to work with my \ncolleagues to address their concerns so that this vital legislation may \nbe passed prior to the adjournment of this Congress.\n  In summary, more than 100 people have died. It is clear that we need \nthis legislation. It is supported by the administration and by every \nconsumer group in America. It passed through the Commerce Committee \nunanimously. I intend to come to the floor and ask that we consider \nthis piece of legislation.\n  I expect those who are putting a hold on this bill to come forward \nand give their reasons for putting a hold on this\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\nvery important safety bill. We are talking about the lives of our \ncitizens. This is a serious issue. That is why I intend to come to the \nfloor again and ask that we move the bill. I hope those Senators who \nobject will come forward and state their objections or remove their so-\ncalled holds on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9567-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9567-S9569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFERENCE REPORT FOR ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  2001\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this year's energy and water \nappropriations bill is very critical, particularly at a time when our \nNation is facing rising gas and energy prices, national security \ndisasters at federal facilities, and massive backlogs to complete \nmultimillion projects for water infrastructure. That is why I am \nutterly disappointed that the final agreement for this bill blatantly \ndisregards these national priorities in favor of special interests \ngiveaways.\n  Mr. President, approving the annual budget is among our most serious \nresponsibilities. We are the trustees of billions of taxpayer dollars, \nand we should evaluate every spending decision with great deliberation \nand without prejudice.\n  Unfortunately, each year, I am constantly amazed how the \nappropriators find new ways to violate budget policy. Appropriators \nhave employed every sidestepping method in the book to circumvent \nSenate rules and common budget principles that are supposed to strictly \nguide the appropriations process. The excessive fodder and trickery \nhave never been greater, resulting in the shameless waste of millions \nof taxpayer dollars. This final report is no exception.\n  This year's final agreement for the energy and water appropriations \nbill is only a minor reflection of the previous Senate-passed bill.\n  A grand total of $1.2 billion is added in pork-barrel spending, a \nfigure that is three times the amount from the Senate-passed bill and \nabout $400 million more than the amount of last year's total. I have \ntwenty-one pages of pork-barrel spending found in this report.\n  An additional $214 million is provided for designated ``emergency'' \nspending.\n  The latest epidemic here as we approach the appropriations issue, in \norder to avoid any budget restraints that may be remaining--and there \nare few--is the designation of ``emergency spending.''\n  Explicit directives are included for favorable consideration of \nspecial interest projects; and more than 30 policy riders are added in \nto conveniently sidestep a fair and deliberative legislative review.\n  I rise today to tell my colleagues that I object.\n  I object to the $1.2 billion in directed earmarks for special \ninterest projects in this bill. I object to sidestepping the \nlegislative process by attaching erroneous riders to an appropriations \nbill. I object to speeding through appropriations bills without \nadequate review by all Members. I object to the callous fashion which \nwe disregard our national interests in favor of pet projects.\n  Some of my colleagues have said that the pork doesn't really matter \nmuch in these spending bills because it's not a lot of money. But, Mr. \nPresident, adding billions more in pork barrel spending is a lot of \nmoney to me and to the millions of American taxpayers who are footing \nthe bill for this spending free-for-all.\n  While America's attention has been focused on the Olympic games in \nSydney, Australia, our constituents back home may be interested to know \nthat a gold medal performance is taking place in their own government. \nIf gold medals were awarded for pork-barrel spending, then the budget \nnegotiators would all be gleaming in gold from their award-winning \nspending spree.\n  However, I doubt many Americans would be appreciative if they knew \nthat this spending spree will be at their expense with money that \nshould be set aside to provide tax relief to American families, shore \nup Social Security and Medicare, or pay down the federal debt.\n  The figures speak for themselves. Again, this year's grand pork total \nis close to $400 million more than the amount from last year's bill and \nmore than three times the amount included in the recent Senate passed \nbill.\n  Unless I am grievously mistaken, I was under the distinct and very \nclear understanding that the purpose of Senate-House appropriations \nconferences are to resolve differences only between the two versions \nand make tough decisions to determine what stays in the final \nagreement. As a rule, no new spending could be added.\n  The rules are flung out the window once again. The overall total \nbudget for this year's conference agreement has been fattened up by as \nmuch as $2 billion more than the House bill, and about a billion more \nthan both the amount included in the Senate-passed bill and the amount \nrequested by the administration.\n  Let me give this to you straight. You have a certain amount passed by \nthe Senate and a certain amount by the House. They are supposed to go \nto conference and reconcile their differences. Instead of that, we add \nbillions of dollars in conference, and neither Senate nor House \nMembers, nor members of the Appropriations Committee have a voice or a \nvote. That is disgraceful--disgraceful.\n  Each year, appropriators employ new spending tricks to avoid sticking \nto allocations in the budget resolution. It has become quite clear that \nthese closed-door conferences, which no other Member can participate in \nor have any voting privileges, is simply another opportunity for \nmembers to take another trip to the trough to add in millions \npreviously unconsidered for individual member projects.\n  What was described earlier in the Senate this year as a ``modest'' \nbill has now become a largesse take-home prize for many Members. \nNumerous earmarks are provided for such projects that, while on its own \nmerit may not be objectionable, were not included in the budget request \nor tacked on without any review by either the Senate or the House.\n  For example, within this final agreement, nearly 250 earmarks are \nadded for individual Army Corps projects which are clearly not included \nin the budget request, and, more than 150 Army Corps projects were \ngiven additional amounts about the budget request.\n  The inconsistency between the administration's request, which is \nresponsible for carrying out these projects, and the views of the \nappropriators on just how much funding should be dedicated to a \nproject, is troubling. As a result, various other projects that may be \nequally deserving or higher in priority do not receive an appropriate \namount of funding, or none at all.\n  This year's budget for Army Corps has been inflated to $4.5 billion \nin funding for local projects. Yet, we have no way of knowing whether, \nat best, all or part of this $4.5 billion should have been spent on \ndifferent projects with greater national need or, at worst, should not \nhave been spent at all. There's no doubt we should end the practice of \nearmarking projects for funding based on political clout and focus our \nresources in a more practical way, instead, on those areas with the \ngreatest need nation-wide.\n  Other earmarks are rampant in this bill that appear that are clearly \ndemonstrative of wasteful spending at the expense of taxpayers:\n  An earmark of $20 million was added in during conference, without \nprevious consideration by either the House or Senate, for an \nunauthorized project in California, the CALFED Bay-Delta restoration \nproject. Certainly, I have no objections to restoring the ecological \nhealth of the Bay Delta area, however, any amount of funding for \nunauthorized projects flies in the face of comments by the managers who \npledged not to fund unauthorized projects.\n  Also, $400,000 is earmarked for aquatic weed control in Lake \nChamplain, Vermont. This particular earmark has resurfaced in \nappropriations bills for at least the past three years and it appears a \nbit preposterous that we continually fund a project such as this on an \nannual basis which has nebulous impacts on our nation's energy and \nsecurity needs.\n  An earmark of $800,000 is provided to continue work on ``a detailed \nproject report'' for a project in Buchanan County, Virginia. Government \nspending is truly getting out of control if nearly a million dollars is \nnecessary simply to compile a report.\n  Another earmark of $250,000 is included for a `study' of drainage \nproblems in the Winchester, Kentucky area. Granted, I do not object to \ntrying to fix any water problems facing any local\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\ncommunity, but is a quarter of a million really necessary to only study \nthe problem and not fix it?\n  More padded spending includes $150,000 to determine what the \n``federal interest'' is for a project in southeastern Pennsylvania. Why \nis $150,000 necessary to determine if the federal government should \ncare about a specific project? Dozens of earmarks like this one, in the \nhundreds of thousands each, are riddled throughout this conference \nreport without any explanation as to why such high amounts of funding \nare justifiable.\n  Among the worst pork in this bill are earmarks that will benefit the \nethanol industry, a fiscal boondoggle industry that already reaps \nsubstantial benefits from existing federal subsidies at the expense of \ntaxpayers. It is a blatant insult to taxpayers to ask them to \nsupplement the ethanol industry even more by spending $600,000 for \nethanol production at the University of Louisville, and $2,000,000 for \nthe design and construction of a demonstration facility for regional \nbiomass ethanol manufacturing in southeast Alaska.\n  My colleagues will note that each of these earmarks have a specific \ngeographic location or institution associated with them. Is there \nanother organization besides the one proposed in southeast Alaska that \ncould design and construct a demonstration facility for regional \nbiomass ethanol manufacturing?\n  A similar earmark of $2 million is included for this specific Alaskan \nethanol manufacturing facility in the Interior appropriations bill this \nyear. So they have $4 million for one specific spot without any \nauthorization and without any discussion.\n  There is $4.5 million for the removal of aquatic growth in Florida, \nwhich is about $1.2 million higher than the budget request;\n  An additional $250,000 for the Texas Investigations Program, for \nwhich no explanation is provided as to what constitutes an \n``investigations'' program;\n  $2,000,000 for the multi-year demonstration of an underground mining \nlocomotive and an earth loader powered by hydrogen in Nevada;\n  And, $3,000,000 to establish a program the University of Nevada-Las \nVegas for Department-wide management of electronic records.\n  Get this, all of my colleageus who have a college or university in \ntheir State: $3 million at the University of Nevada Las Vegas for \ndepartment-wide management of electronic records;\n  $2,000,000 for the Discovery Science Center in Orange County, \nCalifornia;\n  $2,000,000 for the Livingston Digital Millennium Center at Tulane \nUniversity; and\n  $2,000,000 for modernization upgrades at the University of South \nCarolina.\n  How are any of these earmarks directly related to the national \nsecurity and energy interests of our nation?\n  Also, the tactic of using the ``emergency funding'' stigma returns \nstrongly in this bill. I am very disappointed to see that the \nAppalachian Regional Commission will not only be funded again this \nyear, but it is also the recipient of an ``emergency appropriation'' of \n$11 million.\n  My dear friends, the Appalachian Commission was established as a \ntemporary commission in 1965. Somehow this year it needs to be the \nrecipient of $11 million for ``emergency appropriations.'' My curiosity \nis aroused as to what the emergency is at the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. This commission was established as a temporary commission \nin 1965, but has managed to hook itself into the annual appropriations \nspending spree to extend its so-called temporary life to 35 years. This \nprogram singles out one region for special economic development grants \nwhen the rest of the nation has to rely on their share of community \ndevelopment block grant and loans.\n\n  Certainly, the Appalachian region does not have a monopoly on poor, \ndepressed communities in need of assistance. I know that in my own \nstate, despite the high standard of living enjoyed in many areas, some \ncommunities are extremely poor and have long been without running water \nor sanitation. It would be more cost-beneficial to provide direct \nassistance to impacted communities, again based on national priority, \nrather than spending millions each year for a commission which may have \noutlived its purpose.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that I do not object to these projects \nbased on their merit nor do I intend to belittle the importance of \nspecific projects to local communities. However, it is no surprise that \nmany of these earmarks are included for political glamour rather than \npractical purposes. Members can go back to their districts to rally in \npublic parades, trying to win favor by bringing home the bacon.\n  The House of Representatives passed this conference report last \nFriday by a majority margin, despite the fact that most of the voting \nMembers did not have adequate time, if any at all, to review the \ncontents of this report. This is another appalling demonstration to the \nAmerican public of the egregious violation of one of our most sacred \nduties--ensuring the proper use of taxpayer dollars. How can we make \nsound policy and budget decisions with this type of budget steam-\nrolling?\n  I know I speak for many hardworking Americans when I express my hope \nfor reform in the way the Congress conducts the business of the people \nso that we might reclaim the faith and confidence of those we are sworn \nto serve. Yet, we are mired in another yearly ritual of budget chaos. \nSadly, the only message that we send to the American public is that our \nbudgetary process is at an all-time low.\n  Unfortunately, this may be only a foreboding of what is to come at \nthis end of year final budget negotiations. The end-of-year rush to \ncomplete the fiscal year 2001 budget is outpaced only by the rush to \ndrain the taxpayers' pockets and deplete the budget surplus.\n  At the end of the day, special interests win and the taxpayers lose. \nIt's a broken record that the American people are tired of listening \nto.\n  I will vote against this bill and any other appropriations bill that \nso flagrantly disregards our fiscal responsibility and violates the \ntrust of the American people.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal article by David Rogers is a very \nenlightening one, in case some of my colleagues and friends have not \nread it.\n\n       In the scramble to wrap up budget negotiations, Congress \n     could overshoot the Republicans' spending target for this \n     fiscal year by $35 billion to $45 billion.\n       The willingness to spend reflects a new synergy between \n     President Clinton, eager to cement his legacy, and the GOP \n     leadership, increasingly worried about losing seats in \n     November and more disposed to use government dollars to shore \n     up candidates. While the largest increases are in areas \n     popular with voters--education, medical and science research, \n     land conservation, veterans' care and the military--the \n     bargaining invites pork-barrel politics on a grand scale, \n     with top Republicans leading the way.\n       Just this weekend, for example, a bidding war escalated \n     over highway and transit projects that are part of the \n     transportation budget to be negotiated this week. House \n     Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois opened the door by asking \n     to add legislative language to expedite the distribution of \n     about $850 million for Chicago-area transit projects. While \n     the Hastert amendment wouldn't add directly to next year's \n     costs, it became an excuse for others to pile on.\n       The Virginia delegation jumped in early, winning the \n     promise of $600 million to help pay for a bridge over the \n     Potomac River. By late Friday night, dozens of projects for \n     both political parties were being added. House Transportation \n     Committee Chairman Bud Shuster laid claim to millions for his \n     home state of Pennsylvania. Mississippi, home of Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott, is in the running for funds in \n     the range of $100 million. In all, the price tag for the \n     extras tops $1.6 billion.\n       The whole enterprise, which could yet collapse under its \n     own weight, dramatizes a breakdown in discipline in these \n     last weeks before the November elections. In the spring, the \n     GOP set a spending cap of $600 billion for the fiscal year \n     that began yesterday--a number that was never considered \n     realistic politically.\n       After devoting long summer nights to debating cuts from Mr. \n     Clinton's $626 billion budget, Republicans will end up \n     appropriating significantly more than that. If total \n     appropriations rise to between $635 billion and $645 billion \n     or even higher, as the numbers indicate, the ripple effect \n     will pare surplus estimates by hundreds of billions of \n     dollars over the next 10 years.\n\n  I cannot overemphasize the importance of this. We have the rosy \nscenario of a multitrillion dollar surplus in the years ahead, and if \nwe keep spending this kind of money, everybody knows that the surplus \nwill disappear. There is an open and honest debate as to whether we \nshould have tax cuts or whether we should save Social Security, \nMedicare, or pay down the debt. We are not going to be able to do any \nof it if we are spending this kind of money. I was told by a Member not\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\nlong ago that if we agree to what is presently the overspending in this \nbudget, it could mean as much as $430 billion out of the surplus in the \nnext few years.\n\n       Both an $18.9 billion natural-resources bill and a $23.6 \n     billion measure that funds energy and water programs are \n     expected to be sent to the White House, and the \n     transportation bill soon could follow. The Republican \n     leadership believes it has reached a compromise to free up \n     the measure funding the Treasury and the operations of the \n     White House and Capitol.\n       That still leaves the heart of the domestic budget--massive \n     bills funding education, health, housing and environmental \n     programs. Negotiations on those bills are hovering near or \n     even above the president's spending requests.\n       The natural-resources bill agreed to last week illustrates \n     the steady cost escalation: The $18.9 billion price tag is \n     about $4 billion over the bill passed by the House in June.\n       In a landmark commitment to conservation, the legislation \n     would devote as much as $12 billion during the next six \n     years, mainly to buy lands and wildlife habitat threatened by \n     development. As the annual commitment grows from $1.6 billion \n     to $2.4 billion in 2006, more and more dollars would go for \n     sorely needed maintenance work in the nation's parks.\n  Regarding the national parks, that is something with which I don't \ndisagree.\n  I have suggested from time to time when my colleagues say there is \nnothing we can do because the President has the leverage over us in \norder to shut down the Government for which we would get the blame, if \njust once, with one appropriations bill, just one, we could send to the \nPresident a bill that doesn't have a single earmark, have a single \nlegislative rider on it, then we would go into negotiations of the \nissue with the President with clean hands. When we add billions in pork \nbarrel spending on our appropriations bills and then go into \nnegotiations with the President, there is no difference except in \npriorities. It is wrong.\n  I have been spending a lot of time campaigning around the country for \ncandidates for the House and for the Senate, and for our candidate for \nPresident, my party's candidate for President and Vice President of the \nUnited States. I can tell my colleagues, clearly the American people \nhave it figured out. They don't like it. They want this practice to \nstop. They want us to fulfill a promise we made in 1994 when we asked \nthem and they gave us the majorities in both Houses of Congress.\n  Mr. President, this appropriations pork barreling has got to stop. I \nintend to come to the floor with every bill, and if it keeps on, I will \nthen take additional measures. We all know what is coming up: The train \nwreck. If it is as much as $45 billion more then our original $600 \nbillion spending cap, I am not sure how such action is justified.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9569-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the motion to proceed.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2557) to protect the energy security of the \n     United States and decrease America's dependence on the \n     foreign oil source to 50 percent by the year 2010 by \n     enhancing the use of renewable energy resources, conserving \n     energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, and \n     increasing domestic energy supplies, mitigating the effect of \n     increases in energy prices on the American consumer, \n     including the poor and the elderly, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Has there been a time agreement on the legislation just \nproposed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have until 5:30 when we have a scheduled \nvote on another matter.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will consume up to 15 minutes of time in \nrelation to the energy issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak on this \nimportant issue before the Senate and to talk once again to my \ncolleagues about what I believe to be the dark cloud of a national \nemergency. The American consumer has begun to detect a problem because \nthe price of gasoline at the pump has gone up 25 or 30 percent in the \nlast year. When they begin to pay their home heating bills this winter, \nI think they will recognize where the problem lies.\n  We have had the President and the Vice President trying to position \nthemselves politically over the last month and a half on energy because \nof the spike in prices, but frankly they have articulated little. Now \njust in the last week we have had the Vice President present an energy \npolicy for the country, and we have had Governor George Bush talking \nabout an energy policy that he would propose.\n  Here is why these things are happening. Finally, I hope, the American \npeople are beginning to focus on the very critical state of the \navailability of energy in this country, to run the economy, to make the \ncountry work, turn the lights on, move our cars, and do all that it \ntakes to run an economy based on a heavy use of energy.\n  We are now importing between 56 to 58 percent of our crude oil needs. \nSome will remember that during the era of the oil embargo of the mid-\n1970s we were only importing 35 percent of our needs. Even at that time \nthere were gas lines and fighting at the gas pumps because American \nconsumers were frustrated over the cost of gas. What I am saying, \nAmerica, is we no longer control our energy availability, our energy \nsupplies, our energy needs.\n  Is it any wonder why prices have more than tripled in the last 2 \nyears from a low of about $11 per barrel of crude oil to a high late \nlast month of $38? The reason is somebody else is setting the price by \ncreating either a scarcity of supply or by the appearance that there \nwould be a scarcity of supply. It is not American producers controlling \nprices and supply, it is foreign producer countries.\n  The items we do control in the marketplace are demand and supplies we \nmight be able to produce from our own resources. Natural was selling \nfor $2 per 1,000 cubic feet last year, just a year ago, and on Friday \nof last week natural gas was selling for $5.20 for every 1,000 cubic \nfeet. That is better than a doubling of that price.\n  As winter approaches, Americans likely will face the highest energy \nprices ever. Let me say that again. As the winter approaches, Americans \nare going to awaken to the highest energy prices they have ever paid. \nIf the winter is colder than usual, energy prices will be even higher.\n  Electricity prices will move right along with gas and oil because \nmany of the electrical-generating facilities of our country are fueled \nby natural gas. While petroleum and natural gas supplies appear to be \nadequate, no one can doubt that the supply and demand for crude oil, \nnatural gas, and other energy sources is very tight, resulting in \nincreased prices for these commodities. While many observers believe \nsupplies of oil and natural gas will be sufficient to meet our needs in \nthe coming months, I am concerned these important resources will likely \nremain in very short supply and, therefore, will be very costly to the \nAmerican consumer.\n  I believe, and I mean this most sincerely, as a member of the Senate \nEnergy Committee who for the last 10 years has tried to move policy and \nhas seen this administration either say ``no'' by the veto or ``no'' by \nthe budget, I sincerely believe the Clinton-Gore administration, by its \nfailure to produce a national energy policy, is risking a slowdown, \nperhaps even a downturn, in this economy.\n  Some expect energy prices to remain high throughout the first quarter \nof 2001, above $30 a barrel for oil and as high as $4 per thousand \ncubic feet for natural gas. If this is true and that cost ripples \nthrough the economy, then they--and by ``they'' I mean the Clinton \nadministration--are truly risking a slowdown in the economy. This means \nAmericans will be paying more than $1.50 per gallon of gas and perhaps \ntwice as much as they paid for residential natural gas use last year. \nDriving, heating homes, providing services and manufacturing goods will \nbe much, much more expensive under this new high-cost energy economy.\n  It is not only the price at the pump you worry about anymore; it is \nthe plastics; it is the supply of goods; it is everything within our \neconomy that is made of the hydrocarbons that will go up in price. \nSince energy costs are\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\nfactored into the cost of all goods and services, we can expect food, \nappliances, clothing--essentially everything--to become more expensive. \nAs these costs rise, the amount of capital available for investment \nautomatically begins to decline, pulling the economy down along with \nit. As we devote more of our money to the daily need for energy, we \nhave less to spend on the goods and services that we need, the goods \nand services that have fired our economy. As budgets shrink, consumers \nwill be forced to make hard choices. If we have to spend 10 or 15 \npercent more of our income to fill up the tank or to buy the services \nand goods that are energy intensive, then, of course, we will have less \nmoney to spend elsewhere.\n  We are in this undesirable position not because we are short on \nenergy resources such as oil, natural gas, or coal; we are here because \nthis administration, in my opinion, has deliberately tried to drive us \naway from these energy sources. Look at their budgets and look at their \npolicy over the last 8 years. Al Gore himself has spoken openly about \nhow much he hates fossil fuels, how he wants to force the U.S. off \nfossil fuels no matter the cost. He has proposed many times to do so. \nTwice in the last 8 years the Clinton-Gore administration has tried to \ndrive up the cost of conventional fuels. Isn't that interesting? Just \nin the last few weeks they have been trying to drive down the costs by \nreleasing crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into our \nmarket, but for the last 8 years it has been quite the opposite. \nAmerica, are you listening? Are you observing? Why this change of \nheart? Why this change of personality?\n  First, Clinton and Gore proposed a Btu tax, which the Republican \nCongress defeated. They had to settle for a 4.3-cent gas tax. The \nRepublicans in every way tried to resolve that and to eliminate it, but \nthat was how they spread it into the market. They took that and said: \nWe are not going to use it for highway transportation as we have \nhistorically done. We want it for deficit reduction.\n  During debate on the Btu tax, the administration admitted that its \nintent was to encourage conservation, or discourage use, and therefore \ncause us to move more toward renewable energy sources by dramatically \nincreasing the cost of conventional fuels. In other words, tax America \naway from gasoline and oil.\n\n  Next, the Clinton-Gore administration designed the Kyoto Protocol. We \nall know about that. That is the great international agreement that \nwill cool the country, cool the world down because the Administration \nasserts that the world is warming due to the use of fossil fuels. They \nsaid it is necessary that we do it, critically important that we do it. \nBut if implemented, it would substantially penalize the nations that \nuse fossil fuels by forcing reductions in fossil fuel usage. The Vice \nPresident has publicly taken credit for negotiating this document.\n  I don't think you hear him talking much about it today. He is a bit \nof a born-again gas and oil user of in last couple of weeks. But \nclearly for the last 8 years that is all he has talked about, his Kyoto \nProtocol, penalizing the user nations to try to get them to use less \nenergy, all in the name of the environment. The protocol could result \nin a cost of nearly $240 per ton of carbon emissions reduction.\n  What does that mean to the average consumer out there who might be \nlistening? This results in a higher cost of oil and gas and coal. What \nwould it mean? About a 4-percent reduction in the gross domestic \nproduct of this country. If we raise the cost of those three items--\noil, gas, and coal then we will drive down the economy 4-percent. \nSimply translated, that means thousands and thousands of U.S. jobs \nwould be lost and our strong economy weakened. Yet the Vice President \ntakes credit for flying to Tokyo and getting directly involved in the \nnegotiations of the Kyoto Protocol. This is Al Gore's document. Yet he \ntalks very little bit about it today.\n  Why is this administration so wholeheartedly committed to forcing us \nto stop using fossil fuels at almost any cost? Because they buy into \nthe notion that our economic success has been at the expense of the \nworld's environment. I do not buy into that argument. I think quite the \nopposite is true. I believe our success has benefited the world. Our \ntechnology is the technology that the rest of the world wants today to \nclean up their environment, to make their air cleaner, to make their \nwater more pure. It is not in spite of us; it is because of us that the \nworld has an opportunity today, through the use of our technology, to \nmake the world a cleaner place to live.\n  The challenge now is to ensure we go on in the production of these \ntechnologies through the growth and the strength of our economy so we \ncan pass these technologies through to developing nations so they can \nuse them, whether it be for their energy resources or whether it is \nsimply to create greater levels of efficiency, and a cleaner economy \nfor their people.\n  The message to Vice President Gore is don't shut us down. Let us \nwork. Let us develop. Let us use the technologies we have and expand \nupon them. You don't do that through the absence of energy. You don't \ndo that with 2,300 windmills spread across the Rocky Mountain front. \nYou do that by the use of what you have, to be used wisely and \nhopefully efficiently at the least cost to provide the greatest amount \nof energy that you can to the economy.\n  To ensure that we all succeed, we must pay attention to our \nstrengths. The United States has an abundant supply of oil, natural \ngas, and coal, and we must, if we wish to have an influence on the \nprice of these commodities, develop our own resources in an \nintelligent, responsible, and environmentally sound way.\n  Were we to produce oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we \ncould produce up to 1.5 million barrels of oil a day. Some say that \nwill destroy the refuge. Envision the refuge in your mind as a spot on \na map, and compare it to putting a pencil point down on the map of the \nUnited States. The impact of that pencil point on the map of the United \nStates is the same impact as drilling for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Shame on you, Mr. President, for vetoing that legislation a few years \nago. If you had not, we might have 1.5 million barrels of additional \ncrude oil a day flowing into our markets for 30-some years. We would \nnot have to beg at the throne of OPEC. We would not have to go to them \nwith our tin cup, saying: Would you please give us a little more oil? \nYour high prices are hurting our economy.\n  The President was not listening in 1995 when he vetoed that \nlegislation. Other oil and gas resources can come from production from \nthe Federal Outer Continental Shelf and from onshore Federal lands in \nthe Rocky Mountain front. The abundance of our crude oil and the \nabundance of our gas is phenomenal. Yet, a year ago, in the \nnortheastern part of the United States in New Hampshire, Al Gore, now a \ncandidate for President of the United States, said he would stop all \ndrilling. He does not want us to drill anywhere, and he would do it in \nthe name of the environment.\n  These resources can be obtained today, under the new technologies we \nhave, with little to no environmental impact. When we have finished, if \nany damage has occurred, we clean it up, we rehabilitate it, and the \nfootprint that was made at the time of development is hardly \nnoticeable. That is what we can do today.\n  There is no question that the road to less reliance on oil, natural \ngas, and coal is a responsible one, but it is a long one. You do not \nshut it off overnight without damaging an economy and frustrating a \npeople.\n  We have these resources, and they are in abundance. We ought to be \nproducing them at relatively inexpensive cost to the American consumer \nwhile we are investing in better photovoltaic and solar technologies \nand biomass, wind, and all of the other things that can help in the \ntotal package for energy.\n  The problem is simply this: This administration stopped us from \nproducing additional energy supplies at a time of unprecedented growth \nin our economy. Of course, that economy has been based on the abundance \nand relatively low costs of energy.\n  Creating punitive regulatory demands, such as the Btu tax and the \nKyoto Protocol, is not the way to go if you want an economy to prosper \nand you want the opportunities of that economy to be affordable and \nbenefit\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\nall of our citizens. Such policies create--the policies of which I have \nspoken, Btu tax and Kyoto Protocol--winners and losers. The great \ntragedy is that the American consumer ultimately becomes the loser.\n  The path to stable energy prices is through a free market that \nrewards efficiency and productivity and does not punish economies for \nfavoring one form of energy over another. The American consumer will \nmake that decision ultimately if he or she has an adequate number of \nchoices in the marketplace.\n  The Vice President, in his recent speech on energy, simply repeated \nthe tired, old rhetoric of the Carter administration and every Democrat \ncandidate in past presidential elections. Each placed reliance on \nsolar, wind, and other renewables and on energy conservation--all \nadmirable goals that Presidents Reagan and Bush also encouraged, but \nPresidents Reagan and Bush supported renewables with the clear \nunderstanding that renewables could not be relied upon to replace \nfossil-fuel-fired electrical generating capacity that currently \nsupplies our baseload of electricity. And that baseload demand will \ncontinue to rise as our economy grows.\n\n  Presidents Reagan and Bush also recognized that somehow the \nautomobile was not just going to disappear overnight and that it was \nnot going to be replaced by electric cars within the near future. They \nunderstood that. They rewarded production and encouraged production. \nFor 8 years now, domestic oil and gas production has been discouraged \nand restricted, and the American consumer is paying the price at the \npump. This winter the American consumer will also pay a dramatic price \nas their furnaces turn on.\n  Can it be turned around overnight? Absolutely not. We must begin to \ninvest in the business of producing, whether it be electricity or \nwhether it be oil from domestic reserves or gas. It is there. It awaits \nus. We simply have to reward the marketplace, and the marketplace will \nproduce. We cannot continue to squeeze it, penalize it, and refuse \naccess to the supplies the American consumer needs.\n  It is a simple message but a complicated one, especially complicated \nby an administration that says: No, no, no, let the wind and the Sun \nmake up the difference. Probably not in my lifetime or in the lifetime \nof any of the youngest people listening today can and will that be \npossible. But a combination of all of those elements of energy coming \ntogether--hydro, nuclear, or the production of crude oil and gas from \nour own reserves, supplies from abroad, and renewables and \nconservation--will be necessary to carry us through a crisis that \nclearly could spell a major hit to our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand the order of business is the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. We are on the motion \nto proceed.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  As I have said before, energy is terribly important to all of us. It \nis particularly important to those of us who come from producer States. \nBut perhaps if you come from a part of the country where there is no \nproduction and the cost continues to go up, you are even more \nconcerned. In New England, that is pretty much the case.\n  In any event, we do have a problem in energy and we have to find \nsolutions. We have two very different points of view in terms of what \nour needs are and how we meet them.\n  Many wonder, of course, why gas and diesel prices are so high. \nHeating oil will be very expensive. I come from a production State, and \nit wasn't long ago that oil in our oil fields was bringing less than \n$10 a barrel. Now, of course, in the world price, we are up in the \nthirties. Part of that, of course--I think the major part--is that we \nhave relatively little impact on the price. We have allowed ourselves, \nover a period of time, to become dependent upon importation of oil. We \nhave not had, in my view, an energy policy. We have had 8 years of an \nadministration that really has not wanted to deal with the idea of \nhaving a policy in terms of where we are going.\n  I have become more and more convinced--it is not a brand new idea, \nbut I think it doesn't often get applied--that we have to set policies \nand goals for where we need to be over a period of time. And then, as \nwe work toward that, we can measure the various things we do with \nrespect to attaining that goal. If our goal is--and I think it should \nbe--that we become less dependent upon imported oil, then we have to \nmake some arrangements to be there. That has not been the case.\n  This administration, on the other hand, has basically gone the other \nway and has indicated that we ought to reduce our domestic production. \nIn fact, our consumption requirements have gone up substantially over \nthe last couple of years--about 14 percent. During the same period of \ntime, domestic production has gone down approximately 17 percent.\n  In 1990, U.S. jobs in exploring and producing oil and gas were about \n400,000 or 500,000 people. In 1999, the number of people doing the same \nthing was about 293,000--a 27-percent decline.\n  Why is this? Part of it is because we haven't really had this goal of \nhow we were going to meet our energy demands and then measure some of \nthe things that have brought us to where we are. On the contrary, the \npolicy pursued from this administration has been one that has made \ndomestic production even more difficult than it was in the beginning--\nand more difficult than it needs to be, as a matter of fact.\n\n  So I guess you can talk about releasing oil from our strategic \nstorage. I don't make as big a thing out of it as some, but that is not \na long-term answer. It is a relatively small amount of oil compared to \nour usage--about a day and a half's usage--and it is not going to make \na big difference in terms and no difference to where we are in being \nable to have domestic production in the future. I set that aside. I \nonly warn that that can't be offered as a solution to the energy \nproblem. That seems to be about all this administration is prepared to \ndo.\n  On the contrary, going back over some time, in 1993 the first Btu tax \nincreased the cost of a gallon of gas about 8 cents. The compromise was \nabout 3 cents, with the Vice President casting the deciding vote. Now, \nof course, the effort is to manipulate the price of the storage oil, \nbut it won't do that. As I said, it is only about 1 and a half day's \nsupply.\n  We find our refineries now producing at about 95-percent capacity, \npartly because of some of the restrictions placed on these facilities. \nSome have gone out of business, and practically none has been built. We \nfind natural gas, of course, becoming increasingly important. Fifty \npercent of U.S. homes and 56 million people rely on natural gas for \nheating. It provides 15 percent of our power. It will provide more in \nthat this administration has also moved basically against the use of \ncoal, which is our largest producer of electric energy, instead of \nfinding ways to make coal more acceptable. The coal industry has been \nworking hard on that. We have low-sulfur coal in my State. This \nadministration has pushed against that, and we have therefore had less \nuse than we had before.\n  So what do we do? I think certainly there are a number of things we \ncan do. There does need to be a policy. A policy is being talked about \nby George Bush, which is supported generally here in the Senate--that \nwould be No. 1--to help low-income households with their energy bills \nand put some more money in as a short-term solution to help with the \nlow-income energy assistance program. We can do that. We can direct a \nportion of all the gas royalty payments to that program and offset some \nof the costs over time. We are always going to have the need, it seems \nto me, regardless of the price, for low-income assistance. We can do \nthat. And we can establish a Northeast management home heating reserve \nto make sure home heating is available for the Northeast. We should use \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve only in times of real crises--not \nprice, but crises such as the wars of several years ago.\n  We need to make energy security a priority of U.S. foreign policy. We \ncan\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\ndo a great deal with Canada and Mexico. It seems we ought to be able to \nexercise a little more influence with the Middle East. Certainly, we \nhave had a lot to do with those countries in the past--being helpful \nthere. I think we can make more of an impact in Venezuela than we have. \nI think we can support meetings of the G-8 energy ministers, or their \nequivalent, more often.\n  Maybe most importantly, we have lots of resources domestically, and \ninstead of making them more difficult to reach, we ought to make it \neasier. I come from a State that is 50-percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Of course, there are places such as Yellowstone Park and \nTeton Park where you are never going to do minerals and should not. \nMuch of that land is Bureau of Land Management land that is not set \naside for any particular purpose. It was there when the homestead \nstopped and was simply residual and became public land. It is more \nmultiple use. We can protect the environment and continue to use it--\nwhether it is for hiking, hunting, grazing, or whether indeed for \nmineral exploration and production, as we now do.\n\n  This administration has made it difficult to do that. We can improve \nthe regulatory process. I not only serve on the Energy Committee, but \non the Environment and Public Works Committee. Constantly we are faced \nwith new regulations that make it more difficult, particularly for \nsmall refineries, to live within the rules. Many times they just give \nit up and close those. We can change that. It depends on what we want \nto do with the policy. It depends on our goals and what we want to do \nwith domestic production and whether or not these kinds of things \ncontribute to the attainment of those goals. It is pretty clear that \nthey don't.\n  I think we can find ways to establish clear rules to have some \nnuclear plants that are safe, so they indeed can operate. They are very \nefficient. We talk about the environment. They are friendly to the \nenvironment. We need to do something. Of course, if we are going to do \nthat, as they do in France and the Scandinavian countries, we can \nrecycle the waste, or at least after a number of years we can have a \nwaste storage at Yucca Mountain, NV. This administration has resisted \nthat entirely, as have many Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  So these are all things that could be done and are being talked \nabout. We are talking about breaching dams. I think everybody wants to \nlook for alternative sources. We ought to use wind and solar. But the \nfact is that those really generate now about 2 percent of the total \nusage that we have. Maybe they will do more one of these days. I hope \nthey do. We have some of that in my State as well. As a matter of fact, \nmy business built a building about 20 years ago, and we fixed it up \nwith solar power. I have to admit it didn't work very well. It works \nbetter now, and we can continue to make it work better, but it is not \nthe short-term answer to our energy problems.\n  We can do something with ANWR. I have gone up to the North Slope of \nAlaska. You can see how they do the very careful extraction. You have \nto get the caribou out of the way. But you can see what is going on. \nThat can be done. I am confident it can be done.\n  Those are some of the things that are suggested and which I think \nought to have real consideration. It is difficult sometimes to try to \nreconcile environmental issues. I don't know of anyone who doesn't want \nto do that. Environmental protection has to be considered, but it \ndoesn't mean you have to do away with access.\n  Quite frankly, one of the real problems we have in some States is how \nto use open spaces. We are doing something in my State about protecting \nthe environment and protecting public land. Too many people say you \njust shouldn't use it for anything at all. When some States, such as \nNevada and others, are up as high as 85 percent in Federal ownership, I \ncan tell you it is impossible to have an economy in those States and \ntake that attitude. On the other hand, I am persuaded that we can have \nreasonable kinds of programs that allow multiple use and at the same \ntime protect the future use of those lands. It seems to me those are \nthe kinds of things we ought to be doing.\n  It is very difficult. It is certainly easy to set energy policy back, \nparticularly when the price has gone up as it has. I think all of us \nremember a year or so ago when the price at the gas pump was down as \nlow as 86 cents a gallon. Now in my State it is as high as $1.60. You \nthink about it a lot more when it is $1.60 than when it is 86 cents. We \ndidn't complain much about the producers then. But now we are pretty \ncritical. We need a policy.\n  That is the opportunity we have in this Congress--to really establish \nsome of the byways and roadways to help us achieve a reduction on our \ndependency on foreign oil. We need to move toward changes in \nconsumption and in the way we travel. I have no objection to that. The \nfact is, that is going to take time. The economy, the prosperity, and \nthe security of this country depends a great deal on an ample and \navailable energy source. It requires an energy policy. It requires the \nadministration to step up to the plate and work with this Congress to \ncontinue to work to establish an energy policy.\n  That is our task. That is our challenge. I think it is a necessary \nmovement in order to continue to have freedom and economic prosperity.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9572-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9572-S9577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are about to cast a vote at 5:30. I \nthink in many ways this is a very difficult situation. I come to the \nfloor this afternoon expressing my gratitude to the distinguished chair \nof the Energy and Water Subcommittee and certainly to the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Nevada, our extraordinary assistant Democratic \nleader, for the great work they have done in responding to many of the \nissues and concerns that our colleagues have raised. I think in large \nmeasure it is a very balanced bill.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve what is a very significant \nmatter relating to the Missouri River and the precedent that it sets \nfor all rivers. The Corps of Engineers must, from time to time, update \nthe master manual for the rivers that it manages. Unfortunately, some \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have indicated that \nthey were unwilling to compromise with regard to finding a way they \ncould address their concerns without calling a complete halt to a \nmultiyear process that has been underway to revise and update a master \nmanual that is now over 40 years old. That is the issue: a manual that \naffects thousands of miles of river, hundreds of thousands, if not \nbillions, of dollars of revenue generated from hydroelectric power, \nnavigation, irrigation, municipal water, and bank stabilization.\n  There is perhaps no more complicated management challenge than the \none affecting the Missouri and, for that matter, the Mississippi \nRivers.\n  So our challenge has been to address the concerns of the two Senators \nfrom Missouri in a way that recognizes their legitimate questions \nregarding the Corps' intent on management, and also to recognize that \nthere are stretches of the river both affecting the Mississippi in \ndownstream States as well as all of the upstream States that also must \nbe addressed, that also have to be worked out, that have to be \nrecognized and achieved in some way.\n  We have gone to our distinguished colleagues on the other side on a \nnumber of occasions indicating a willingness to compromise, indicating \na willingness to sit down to try to find a way to resolve this matter. \nI must say, we have been rebuffed at every one of those efforts. So we \nare left today with no choice.\n  What I hope will happen is that we can vote in opposition to the bill \nin numbers sufficient enough to indicate our ability to sustain a veto; \nthe President will then veto this legislation, as he has now noted \npublicly and privately on several occasions; and that we come down \ntogether to the White House, or anywhere else, work out a\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\ncompromise, work out some suitable solution that accommodates the \nSenators from Missouri as well as all other Senators on the river. That \nis all we are asking.\n  It is unfortunate that it has to come to this, to a veto. I warned \nthat it would if we were not able to resolve it. I am disappointed we \nare now at a point where that appears to be the only option available \nto us.\n  Before he came to the floor, I publicly commended the chair of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee for his work. And I will say so privately \nto my colleagues that what he has done and what the ranking member has \ndone is laudable and ought to be supported. But the overriding concern \nis a concern that has been addressed now on several occasions. It was \nmy hope that it was a concern that could have been addressed in a way \nthat would have avoided the need for a veto. Unfortunately, that is not \nthe case. So we are left with no choice, Madam President. I regret that \nfact.\n\n  I hope that my colleagues will understand that this legislation is \nimportant. I hope after the veto, after it is sustained--if that is \nrequired--we can go back, get to work, and find the compromise that I \nhave been seeking now for weeks, and find a way with which to move this \nlegislation along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Are we scheduled by unanimous consent to vote at 5:30 on the \nconference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, the senior Senator from Montana \nwould like a minute or two to talk on this subject. Perhaps it would be \nbetter for him to do it now, and then you could close the debate, if \nthat would be appropriate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was just going to ask. I saw him on the floor and he \nmentioned he might want to speak. I need about 6 minutes, so could you \ntake the intervening time before the 6 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my colleague, I need only 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I only need about 6 minutes. I will yield the rest to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I inquire of the minority leader and the Senator from New \nMexico if we could get perhaps an extra 5 minutes before the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it appears we have 10 minutes remaining \nbefore the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 5:32 and the time be \nequally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst adoption of the Conference Report for the Energy and Water \nAppropriations. Section 103 is an anti-environmental rider that \nprevents the sound management of the Missouri River.\n  As my colleagues will recall, during Senate consideration of this \nbill last month, Senator Daschle and I proposed to delete this \nprovision. Unfortunately we were not successful.\n  Now, rather than attempting to work out a compromise, the conferees \nhave included the very same language in the conference report before us \ntonight.\n  I will not repeat all of the arguments made in the earlier debate \nabout why this amendment is bad for the river and the people of my \nstate. The important point is, nothing has changed from that debate and \nthe need to remove this rider remains as true today as it did then.\n  First, the Army Corps of Engineers is managing the Missouri River on \nthe basis of a master manual that was written in 1960 and hasn't \nchanged much since then.\n  Today, conditions are much different. Priorities are different.\n  Under the current master manual--40 years old--water levels in Ft. \nPeck lake are often drawn down in the summer months, largely to support \nbarge traffic downstream, which is an industry that is dying and, \naccording to the Corps' own analysis, has much less economic value than \nthe recreation value upstream.\n  These drawdowns have occurred time and time again. Their effect is \ndevastating: Moving ramps to put boats in the lake a mile away, \nseverely curtail boating and fishing that are enjoyed by thousands of \nMontanans and tourists alike. They also reduce the numbers of walleye, \nsturgeon, and other fish.\n  The drawdowns are the big reason why eastern Montana has been getting \nan economic raw deal for years. More balanced management of the \nMissouri River, which takes better account of upstream economic \nbenefits, is absolutely critical to reviving the economy in that part \nof our State.\n  Now there has been some talk that the proposed split season will \naffect hydropower production. While detailed studies are not yet \ncomplete, in fact, the Corps estimates that the split season will have \n``essentially no impact to the total hydropower benefits.'' So there \nreally should be no doubt. The split season is a better deal for \nMontana. It is a better deal for the whole river.\n  Of course, this rider is about more than just Ft. Peck.\n  It also prevents the Corps of Engineers from obeying the law of the \nland. Specifically, the Endangered Species Act.\n  If we create a loophole here, there will be pressure to create \nanother loophole somewhere else. And then another. Before you know it, \nthe law will be shredded into tatters.\n  We all know the Endangered Species Act is not perfect. I believe we \nneed to reform it so it will work better for landowners and for \nspecies.\n  We are working hard to pass returns, but those reforms haven't \npassed. So the Endangered Species Act remains the law of the land, and \nwe have to respect it. And so should the Corps.\n  Forget about the species for a minute. Think about basic fairness. We \nrequire private landowners to comply with the Endangered Species Act.\n  Why should the Federal Government get a free pass?\n  The answer is, they should not. The Army Corps of Engineers should be \nheld to the same standard as everybody else, and the Corps agrees.\n  We have a public process in place, to carefully revise the master \nmanual. It's been underway for 10 years.\n  Now, at the last minute, when the end is in sight, a rider in an \nappropriations bill would derail the process by taking one of the \nalternatives right off the table.\n  That's not fair. It's not right. It's not the way we ought to make \nthis decision.\n  Instead, we should give the open process that we began ten years ago \na chance to work.\n  We should give people an opportunity to comment on the biological \nopinion and the environmental impact statement.\n  So the final decision will not be made in a vacuum.\n  But this rider makes a mockery of that process. The rider allows for \nan extensive period for public comment. But then it prohibits the \npublic agencies from acting on those comments.\n  A better way is to allow the agencies and the affected parties to \ncontinue to work together to strike a balance to manage this mighty and \nbeautiful river: for upstream states, for downstream states, and for \nthe protection of endangered species; that is, for all of us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, along with many of my colleagues, I \nvoted in support of an amendment to the energy and water appropriations \nbill when it moved through the Senate to strike an anti-environment \nrider from that bill. Unfortunately, that amendment failed and the \nrider remains in the conference report we consider today.\n  For that reason, I must vote against this legislation. I understand \nthat the President has indicated that he will veto this legislation \nbecause of this antienvironment provision.\n  The antienvironment rider included in this bill stops changes in the \nmanagement of the Missouri River called for by existing law. Those \nchanges would ensure that the river is managed not only for navigation, \nbut also for\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\nthe benefit of the fish and wildlife that depend on the river for \nsurvival.\n  It is critical that those changes go into effect promptly because \nwithout them several endangered species may become extinct.\n  The Missouri River management changes that this antienvironment rider \nblocks are called for by a 600-page Fish and Wildlife Service study. \nThe study is itself based upon hundreds of published peer-reviewed \nstudies, and would modify the 40-year-old Corps of Engineers policy of \nmanaging the flows of the Missouri River primarily to benefit a $7 \nmillion downstream barge industry.\n  That old Corps policy is largely responsible for the endangerment of \nthree species--the piping plover, the least interior tern, and the \npallid sturgeon--that depend upon the river for survival. Two other \nfish species are also headed toward extinction.\n  It is very unfortunate that this provision was included in a bill \nthat otherwise has much to commend it.\n  I appreciate the conferees' hard work in crafting a bill that funds \nseveral important California priorities. The Hamilton Wetlands Project \nfunded in this bill would restore approximately 1,000 acres to wetlands \nand wildlife habitat at Hamilton Army Airfield. The American River \nCommon Elements funded in this bill would result in 24 miles of levee \nimprovements along the American River and 12 miles of improvements \nalong the Sacramento River levees, flood gauges upstream of Folsom Dam, \nand improvements to the flood warning system along the lower American \nRiver. Finally, the Solana Beach-Encinitas Shoreline Feasibility Study \nfunded in this bill would assist both cities in their efforts to battle \nbeach erosion, and would provide needed data for the restoration of \nthese beaches. Projects such as these are extremely important to \nCalifornia.\n  Because of these and the other benefits of this bill for California, \nI find it unfortunate that I must vote against this legislation. I do \nso, however, because a vote for this bill is a vote to support an \nantienvironment rider that may well lead to the irreversible damage of \ncausing the extinction of several endangered species.\n  I expect that this legislation will be taken up by the Senate without \nthis rider in the next few weeks, and that we will move forward with \nimportant energy and water projects without doing irreversible damage \nto our environment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, during a statement I made on the Senate \nfloor today regarding various pork-barrel spending in the final \nconference report for the FY 2001 energy and water appropriations, I \nincorrectly referred to a $20 million earmark for the CALFED Bay-Delta \nrestoration project. I was informed by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that the conference agreement does not include any \nfunding for this specific California project. I wanted to state for the \nRecord that I will correct my statement that will be included on my \nSenate web page and remove this reference to the CALFED project.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I intend to vote against the energy and \nwater appropriations conference report this afternoon. I support the \nvast majority of the bill, in fact, there are a number of projects I \nhave worked for years to have included. But, once again, in addition to \nthose projects, an anti-environmental rider was also attached to this \nlegislation.\n  The President has announced his intention to veto this bill because \nof that anti-environmental rider. So we will be back here in the next \nfew days considering this legislation again. And I have been assured \nthat when we take up this legislation again, our Virginia projects will \nbe included, since they are not the subject of the dispute. I hope that \nin the intervening period, we can remove the rider which would prevent \nthe Corps of Engineers from reviewing its procedures to protect the \nMissouri river and its environment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today in continuing concern over \nthe National Ignition Facility, a massive stockpile stewardship \nfacility being built at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore \nLabs in California. This program has been beset by cost overruns, \ndelays, and poor management. The House in its Energy & Water bill \nincluded $74.1 million for construction of NIF. The Senate adopted an \namendment I offered that capped spending at the same level, and also \nrequested an independent review of the project from the National \nAcademy of Sciences.\n  I know the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee each have \ntheir own concerns about NIF, and I greatly appreciate their efforts to \nbring this program under control. But frankly I am disappointed in what \nhas come out of conference. The funding for NIF construction has risen \nfrom $74 million to $199 million. $74 million in the House, $74 million \nin the Senate, and $199 million out of conference.\n  That is a lot of money to spend on a program that is out of control. \nProjected costs of constructing this facility have almost doubled in \nthe last year. We don't know if the optics will work. We don't know how \nto design the target. Even if the technical problems are solved, we \ndon't know if the National Ignition Facility will achieve ignition. We \ndon't even know if this facility is needed. DOE's recent \n``rebaselining'' specified massive budget increases for NIF for several \nyears, but, despite Congressional requests, did not say where this \nmoney would come from or what impact it would have on the stockpile \nstewardship program.\n  This is the time to slow down, conduct some independent studies, \nreconsider how we can best maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile and \nwhether this risky program really is critical to that effort. Instead \nwe are saying full steam ahead.\n  It is true that part of the money, $69 million, is held back until \nDOE arranges for studies of some of these issues and certifies that the \nprogram is on schedule and on budget. These issues are critical to \nfuture Congressional action on NIF. Unfortunately, the bill does not \nclearly specify who will conduct those studies.\n  I wish we could entrust DOE with these reviews, but history suggests \nthey have not earned our trust. A recent article in the journal Nature \ndescribes ten years of failed peer review on this project: so-called \n``independent'' reports that were not independent, that were written by \nstacked panels with conflicts of interest, that even were edited by \nproject officials. A recent GAO report notes that reviews ``did not \ndiscover and report on NIF's fundamental project and engineering \nproblems, bringing into question their comprehensiveness and \nindependence.'' DOE is currently under threat of a second lawsuit \nregarding violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act in NIF \nstudies.\n  We need a truly independent review. I am pleased that the Chairman \nand Ranking Member agreed to join me in a colloquy on this concern, and \nhope the studies mandated in this bill will be fully independent and \ncredible. Otherwise, I fear that the $199 million we are appropriating \nwill be poured down a bottomless pit with the $800 million already \nspent. We've seen this happen too many times, with the Superconducting \nSupercollider, the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the Space Station, and \non and on. I will continue to strive to protect our taxpayers, keep our \nnuclear stockpile safe, and end wasteful spending on NIF before more \nbillions are spent.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report on the energy and water appropriations bill. This is \na very important bill, for it contains a provision that will protect \nthe citizens of Missouri from a risky Administration scheme to flood \nthe Missouri River Basin. Section 103 of this bill is a provision that \nis necessary for the millions of Americans who live and work along the \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers. This is the section of the bill that \nwas subject to an amendment to strike when the Senate considered this \nlegislation on September 7, 2000. The Senate defeated the attempt to \nstrike at that time, and I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Domenici, for maintaining Section 103 in the conference report \nnow before us.\n  Madam President, as you know, the use of the Missouri River is \ngoverned by what is known as the Missouri River Master Manual. Right \nnow, there is an effort underway to update that manual. The specific \nissue that is at the crux of the debate over Section 103 is what is \ncalled a spring rise. A spring rise, in this case, is a release of huge\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\namounts of water from above Gavins Point Dam on the Nebraska-South \nDakota border during the flood-prone spring months.\n  In an effort to protect the habitat of the pallid sturgeon, the least \ntern, and the piping plover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued \nan ultimatum to the Army Corps of Engineers insisting that the Corps \nimmediately agree to its demand for a spring rise. The Corps was given \none week to respond to the request of Fish and Wildlife for immediate \nimplementation of a spring rise. The Corps' response was a rejection of \nthe spring rise proposal, and they called for further study of the \neffect of the spring rise.\n  The language in section 103 will allow for the studies the Corps \nrecommends. Section 103, inserted in the bill during the subcommittee \nmarkup, is a commonsense provision that states in its entirety:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used to \n     revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if such \n     provisions provide for an increase in the springtime water \n     release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow \n     melt period in States that have rivers draining into the \n     Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.\n\n  This policy--this exact language--has been included in the last four \nenergy and water appropriations bills, all of which the President \nsigned without opposition. Let's look at the support that the Energy \nand Water appropriations bills, with the exact same language, have \nenjoyed in the past.\n  In October, 1995, the Senate agreed to the energy and water \nappropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 89-6.\n  In September, 1996, the Senate agreed to the energy and water \nappropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 92-8.\n  In September, 1998, the Senate agreed to the energy and water \nappropriations conference report by unanimous consent.\n  In September, 1999, the Senate agreed to the energy and water \nappropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 96-3.\n  In addition, this year, the Senate voted 93-1 in favor of final \npassage of the energy and water appropriations bill on September 7, \n2000, following the defeat of the amendment to strike Section 103.\n  This lengthy record of support is part of the reason I am shocked and \nastounded to report that last week, the President's Chief of Staff, \nJohn Podesta, sent a letter to the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee chairman stating that the President would veto this bill \nif section 103 is included. In other words, the Clinton-Gore \nadministration is threatening to veto the entire energy and water \nappropriations bill if it contains language to protect the lives and \nproperty of all citizens living and working along the lower Missouri \nand Mississippi Rivers.\n  If the President follows through with a veto of the bill, after \nhaving signed this provision four times previously, he will be sending \na very clear message to the citizens of the Midwest. It is very easy to \nunderstand. Unfortunately, it would be very hard to digest and \naccommodate. But the message would be this: The Clinton-Gore \nadministration is willing to flood downstream communities as part of an \nunscientific, risky scheme that will hurt, not help, the endangered \nspecies it seeks to protect. If that is the message, I wouldn't want to \nbe the messenger.\n  The President's Chief of Staff, Mr. Podesta, made a number of \ninteresting, yet untrue, claims in his veto threat letter. We have \ncorrected and clarified these points before, but allow me to do so \nagain, in the hope that the administration will reconsider its position \nwhen confronted with the real facts on this issue.\n  First, the administration claims in its veto letter that section 103 \nwould, ``prevent the Corps from carrying out a necessary element of any \nreasonable and prudent alternative to avoid jeopardizing the continued \nexistence of the endangered least tern, pallid sturgeon, and the piping \nplover.'' This statement is false.\n  Under section 103, alternatives can be studied and all alternatives \ncan be implemented--with the exception of a spring rise.\n  What is ironic is that spring flooding could hurt the wildlife more \nthan it will protect them. And it will do so in a way that will \nincrease the risks of downstream flooding and interferes with the \nshipment of cargo on our nation's highways.\n  Dr. Joe Engeln, assistant director of the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources, stated in a June 24 letter that there are several \nmajor problems with the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposed plan that \nmay have the perverse effect of harming the targeted species rather \nthan helping them.\n  In his letter, he writes that, ``the higher reservoir levels [that \nwould result from a spring rise] would also reduce the habitat for the \nterns and plovers that nest along the shorelines of the reservoirs.''\n\n  Dr. Engeln also points out that because the plan calls for a \nsignificant drop in flow during the summer, predators will be able to \nreach the islands upon which the terns and plovers nest, giving them \naccess to the young still in the nests.\n  Second, the administration claims that the Missouri Master Manual is \noutdated and, ``does not provide and appropriate balance among the \ncompeting interests, both commercial and recreational, of the many \npeople who seek to use this great American river.'' This, also, is \nuntrue.\n  This administration's plan for ``controlled flood'' or spring rise \nplaces every citizen who lives or works downstream from the point of \nrelease in jeopardy by disturbing the balance at a time when downstream \ncitizens are most vulnerable to flooding.\n  Section 103 protects citizens of Missouri and other states from \ndangerous flooding while allowing for cost efficient transportation of \ngrain and cargo.\n  Section 103 is supported by bipartisan group representing farmers, \nmanufacturers, labor unions, shippers, citizens and port authorities \nfrom 15 Midwest states.\n  Also supporting Section 103 are major national organizations \nincluding the American Farm Bureau, American Waterways associations, \nNational Grange, and the National Soybean Association.\n  The strong support for Section 103 and against the spring rise \nundermines the administration's claim that the Master Manual must be \nimmediately changed.\n  In addition to the illusory argument that the spring rise is \nnecessary to protect endangered species, some advocates of the spring \nrise claim that this plan is a return to more ``natural flow \nconditions'' and that the river should be returned to its condition at \nthe time of the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n  Not only is this unrealistic because the Midwest was barely habitable \nbecause of the erratic flooding conditions at that time, according to \nDr. Engeln of the Missouri DNR, the proposal would benefit artificial \nreservoirs at the expense of the river and create flow conditions that \nhave never existed along the river in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and \nMissouri.\n  Over 90 organizations representing farmers, shippers, cities, labor \nunions, and port authorities recently sent a letter to Congress saying: \n``The spring rise demanded by the Fish and Wildlife Service is based on \nthe premise that we should `replicate the natural hydrograph' that was \nresponsible for devastating and deadly floods as well as summertime \ndroughts and even dustbowls.''\n  I think it is pretty clear that there is not sound science to support \nsome protection of these species. There is a clear disagreement among \nscientists, and a strong argument that the implementation of this plan \nwould, in fact, damage the capacity of some of these species to \ncontinue.\n  I urge the Senate to support this conference report. I ask the \nPresident to rethink his threatened veto and side with the bipartisan \nconsensus to protect the citizens living and working in the lower \nMissouri River Basin from the Fish and Wildlife Service's plan to flood \nthe region.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise to tell the Senate this is a \ngood bill. I hope we will pass it.\n  The Senate passed this bill 97-1. It went to conference. Obviously, \nthere were some changes made in conference but clearly not significant \nenough to have somebody vote against this bill.\n  When the call of the roll occurs, we are going to hear that a number \nof Senators on the other side of the aisle are\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\ngoing to vote against the bill. I hope everybody understands that most \nof them have asked for things in this bill, and they have been granted \nthings in this bill their States desperately need. I don't know how all \nthat will work out, but they are being asked to vote against this \nbecause the President of the United States, after signing similar \nlanguage regarding the Missouri River four different times, has \nsuggested that this year, if it is in this bill, he will veto it.\n  This bill has taken much work on the defense side; that is, for the \nnuclear deterrent, nuclear weapons activities of America, and those \nactivities related to it that have to do with nonproliferation. We have \ndone an excellent job in increasing some of the very important work of \nthese National Laboratories and our nuclear defense deterrent, people, \nequipment, and facilities. Sooner or later many more Senators are going \nto have to recognize the significance of that part of this bill.\n  The second part of it has to do with nondefense discretionary \nappropriations; that is, mostly water and water projects across this \ngreat land. Many of them are in here for Senators on the Democrat side \nof the aisle. We were pleased to work with them on that.\n  I hope the bill will get sent to the President and we will be able to \nwork something out with reference to the Missouri River. The President \nindicates now that he doesn't want that paragraph, that provision, so-\ncalled section 103, in this bill. I am not going to argue as eloquently \nas Kit Bond, the Senator from Missouri, did with reference to why that \nprovision should be in the bill. But I can say that a compelling \nmajority of Senators agreed with him when we had a vote on it, and then \nagreed to vote on final passage which included that.\n  To make sure everybody understands a little bit about where we have \nbeen and where we are going, I will not talk much about this chart, \nexcept I will ask that we take a quick look at the orange part of this \nchart. You see how big that keeps growing while people worry about this \nbill, and legitimately so. Senator McCain argues that perhaps there are \nsome things in this bill that should not be in it. He may be right.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, when you have to put something together \nfor a whole House and a whole Senate, sometimes you have to do some \nthings that maybe one Senator wouldn't want done.\n  This orange shows what is happening to the American budget of late. \nThis is the 2000 estimate, the orange part of the entitlements and \ninterest we pay in our budget for the people. See how it continues to \ngrow. The yellow is the Defense Department. If you will focus for a \nmoment on this purple piece, that number, $319 billion out of a budget \nof $1.8 trillion, is the 11 appropriations bills that have not yet been \npassed.\n  May I point it out again. This is the entitlements plus the interest. \nThis is defense, which has been passed. And this, which you can see \nfrom this year to this year to this year, not very big changes compared \nto the other parts of the budget, this is what the 11 appropriations \nbills will amount to more or less, including this one.\n\n  It means that one-sixth of the Federal budget is at issue when we \ndiscuss the 11 appropriations bills that remain. Two of them were \ndefense, and they belong in this portion of the budget. But if you look \nout, as we try to project 2005 and beyond, to see what keeps growing \neven though we are paying down the national debt, the entitlement \nprograms keep growing. And the difference in this part, the purple \npart, is rather insignificant in terms of growth.\n  This bill is slightly over the President's budget in the nuclear \ndeterrent, nuclear laboratory, nuclear weapons activities, and is \nslightly over the President on all of the water projects. I failed to \nmention the science projects that are in this bill, which are \nnondefense projects. They go on at all of the laboratories, and they \nare the cutting edge of real science across America--in this bill we \nare talking about. All of these, this and 11 others, belong in this \nsmall amount. Even for those who think it is growing too much, our \nprojections beyond the year 2005 are that it still will be a very small \nportion of our Federal budget with a very large amount going to \nentitlements.\n  I wish I had one more I could predict, the surpluses along here, \nbecause I don't believe you need to worry about having adequate \nsurpluses to take care of priorities in the future, to take care of \nMedicare, prescription drugs, and Medicare reform. Nor do I think there \nwill be a shortage of money, some of which we should give back to the \nAmerican people before we spend it.\n  My closing remarks have to do with what should we do with the great \nsurplus the American people are giving us by way of taxes, which they \nhave never paid so much of in the past. I look to the person who had \nmost to do with our great thriving economy, Dr. Alan Greenspan. He \nmentions three things to us: First, you should put as much of it as you \ncan on the national debt. The second thing is, you should give the \npeople back some of it by way of taxes. That is the second best thing. \nHe comments, ``If you are going to look at the big picture, the worst \nthing you can do with the surplus for the future of our children and \ngrandchildren is to spend it on new programs.''\n  So I suggest we all ought to be worried about the future. But today \nwe ought to get an appropriation bill passed. I hope our people will \nunderstand that in spite of the plea from the minority leader that you \nvote against it because of the Missouri language, we can pass it today \nand see if in the next few days we can work something out with the \nPresident if he remains dedicated to vetoing this bill over the one \nissue of which the Senator from Montana spoke.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much admire the work and the \neffort the Senator from New Mexico has put into this bill, and I hope \nafter the President vetoes this bill, and it is sustained, we can work \nout this one problem so we can get the bill passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DESIGNATION OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN PLACE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) during the second half of the twentieth century, \n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan promoted the importance of \n     architecture and urban planning in the Nation's Capital, \n     particularly with respect to the portion of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue between the White House and the United States Capitol \n     (referred to in this subsection as the ``Avenue'');\n       (2) Senator Moynihan has stressed the unique significance \n     of the Avenue as conceived by Pierre Charles L'Enfant to be \n     the ``grand axis'' of the Nation's Capital as well as a \n     symbolic representation of the separate yet unified branches \n     of the United States Government;\n       (3) through his service to the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal \n     Office Space (1961-1962), as a member of the President's \n     Council on Pennsylvania Avenue (1962-1964), and as vice-\n     chairman of the President's Temporary Commission on \n     Pennsylvania Avenue (1965-1969), and in his various \n     capacities in the executive and legislative branches, Senator \n     Moynihan has consistently and creatively sought to fulfill \n     President Kennedy's recommendation of June 1, 1962, that the \n     Avenue not become a ``solid phalanx of public and private \n     office buildings which close down completely at night and on \n     weekends,'' but that it be ``lively, friendly, and inviting, \n     as well as dignified and impressive'';\n       (4)(A) Senator Moynihan helped draft a Federal \n     architectural policy, known as the ``Guiding Principles for \n     Federal Architecture,'' that recommends a choice of designs \n     that are ``efficient and economical'' and that provide \n     ``visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and \n     stability'' of the United States Government; and\n       (B) the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture further \n     state that the ``development of an official style must be \n     avoided. Design must flow from the architectural profession \n     to the Government, and not vice versa.'';\n       (5) Senator Moynihan has encouraged--\n       (A) the construction of new buildings along the Avenue, \n     such as the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade \n     Center; and\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\n       (B) the establishment of an academic institution along the \n     Avenue, namely the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \n     Scholars, a living memorial to President Wilson;

DESIGNATION OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN PLACE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) during the second half of the twentieth century, \n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan promoted the importance of \n     architecture and urban planning in the Nation's Capital, \n     particularly with respect to the portion of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue between the White House and the United States Capitol \n     (referred to in this subsection as the ``Avenue'');\n       (2) Senator Moynihan has stressed the unique significance \n     of the Avenue as conceived by Pierre Charles L'Enfant to be \n     the ``grand axis'' of the Nation's Capital as well as a \n     symbolic representation of the separate yet unified branches \n     of the United States Government;\n       (3) through his service to the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal \n     Office Space (1961-1962), as a member of the President's \n     Council on Pennsylvania Avenue (1962-1964), and as vice-\n     chairman of the President's Temporary Commission on \n     Pennsylvania Avenue (1965-1969), and in his various \n     capacities in the executive and legislative branches, Senator \n     Moynihan has consistently and creatively sought to fulfill \n     President Kennedy's recommendation of June 1, 1962, that the \n     Avenue not become a ``solid phalanx of public and private \n     office buildings which close down completely at night and on \n     weekends,'' but that it be ``lively, friendly, and inviting, \n     as well as dignified and impressive'';\n       (4)(A) Senator Moynihan helped draft a Federal \n     architectural policy, known as the ``Guiding Principles for \n     Federal Architecture,'' that recommends a choice of designs \n     that are ``efficient and economical'' and that provide \n     ``visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and \n     stability'' of the United States Government; and\n       (B) the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture further \n     state that the ``development of an official style must be \n     avoided. Design must flow from the architectural profession \n     to the Government, and not vice versa.'';\n       (5) Senator Moynihan has encouraged--\n       (A) the construction of new buildings along the Avenue, \n     such as the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade \n     Center; and\n       (B) the establishment of an academic institution along the \n     Avenue, namely the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \n     Scholars, a living memorial to President Wilson; and\n       (6) as Senator Moynihan's service in the Senate concludes, \n     it is appropriate to commemorate his legacy of public service \n     and his commitment to thoughtful urban design in the Nation's \n     Capital.\n       (b) Designation.--The parcel of land located in the \n     northwest quadrant of Washington, District of Columbia, and \n     described in subsection (c) shall be known and designated as \n     ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan Place''.\n       (c) Boundaries.--The parcel of land described in this \n     subsection is the portion of Woodrow Wilson Plaza (as \n     designated by Public Law 103-284 (108 Stat. 1448)) that is \n     bounded--\n       (1) on the west by the eastern facade of the Ronald Reagan \n     Building and International Trade Center;\n       (2) on the east by the western facade of the Ariel Rios \n     Building;\n       (3) on the north by the southern edge of the sidewalk \n     abutting Pennsylvania Avenue; and\n       (4) on the south by the line that, bisecting the atrium of \n     the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, \n     continues east to bisect the western hemicycle of the Ariel \n     Rios Building.\n       (d) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     parcel of land described in subsection (c) shall be deemed to \n     be a reference to Daniel Patrick Moynihan Place.\n\n                 TITLE IV--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n     SEC. 401.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\n       (1) It is in the national interest to establish an \n     effective, coordinated, and cost-effective means by which \n     records on specific subjects of extraordinary public interest \n     that do not undermine the national security interests of the \n     United States may be collected, retained, reviewed, and \n     disseminated to Congress, policymakers in the executive \n     branch, and the public.\n       (2) Ensuring, through such measures, public access to \n     information that does not require continued protection to \n     maintain the national security interests of the United States \n     is a key to striking the balance between secrecy essential to \n     national security and the openness that is central to the \n     proper functioning of the political institutions of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 803.

SUNSET.\n\n       The provisions of this title shall expire four years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, unless reauthorized by \n     statute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald) appointed Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nLugar, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nMack, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Levin conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the leader. I specifically thank \nthe chairman, Senator Shelby. We have worked to put this authorization \nbill together. It could not have happened but for his cooperation and \nthe cooperation of a number of others of our colleagues on the \nIntelligence Committee. I thank them for their cooperation, the \nchairman in particular. I thank the majority leader and Senator Daschle \nas well. Again, I acknowledge the leadership of my chairman. He has \nbeen most helpful in working through this bill. I thank him, the \nmajority leader, and our colleagues.\n  My remarks will echo many of the points made by the distinguished \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby. Those who are \nnot familiar with the workings of the Intelligence Committee may find \nit odd that members from different parties have such agreement on the \nsubstance of this legislation. Most of my colleagues, however, know \nthat the committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship and I am \nproud to say that under Senator Shelby's leadership we have upheld that \ntradition. We have confronted difficult policy issues and budget \nchoices, and the chairman has gone out of his way to ensure that the \ncommittee addressed these in a fair and nonpartisan way. I appreciate \nthe courtesies he has shown me as vice chairman. I think we have \nproduced a good bill that focuses on several critical areas of \nintelligence policy.\n  This important legislation authorizes the activities of the U.S. \nintelligence community and seeks to ensure that this critical function \nwill continue to serve our national security interests into the 21st \ncentury. The community faces momentous challenges from both the \nproliferation of threats facing America and from the rapid pace of \ntechnological change occurring throughout society. How we respond to \nthese challenges today will affect our ability to protect American \ninterests in the years ahead.\n  Some have argued that the end of the cold war should have \nsignificantly reduced our need for a robust intelligence collection \ncapability. In fact, the opposite is true. The bipolar world of the \nSoviet-United States confrontation provided a certain stability with a \nclear threat and a single principal adversary on which to focus. We now \nface a world with growing transnational threats of weapons \nproliferation, terrorism, and international crime and narcotics \ntrafficking, and multiple regional conflicts which create instability \nand threaten U.S. interests. While we, of course, must continue to \nclosely monitor Russia, which still possesses the singular capability \nto destroy our country, these emerging threats demand increasing \nattention and resources.\n  A decade after the collapse of Soviet communism, the intelligence \ncommunity continues its difficult transition, from an organization \nwhich confronted one threat to one which now must focus on a variety of \nthreats, each unique in its potential to harm the United States. At the \nsame time, the community has been buffeted by the information \nrevolution, which provides tremendous opportunity for intelligence \ncollection, but threatens to overwhelm our ability to process and \ndisseminate information. These twin challenges--new and qualitatively \ndifferent threats, coupled with an information and technological \nexplosion--threaten the community's ability to serve as an early \nwarning system for our country and a force multiplier for our armed \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, the intelligence community has often been too slow to \nconfront these challenge and to adapt to these new realities. To make \nthis transition will require the following:\n  First, the intelligence community must get its budget in order. \nAlthough I believe the community probably needs additional resources, \nthe Congress first must be convinced that existing resources are being \nused effectively.\n  Second, the various intelligence agencies must begin to function ore \ncorporately--as a community, rather than as separate entities, all with \ndifferent and often conflicting priorities. This has been a topic of \ndebate for some time. And yet, the passage of time does not seem to \nhave brought us much closer to this objective.\n  Third, the intelligence community must do a better job of setting \npriorities. That means making hard decisions about what it will not do. \nResources are stretched thin, often because community leadership has \nbeen unable to say no. The result is that agencies like the National \nSecurity Agency are starved for recapitalization funds necessary to \nkeep pace with technological changes.\n  Fourth, the community must streamline its bureaucracy, eliminating \nunnecessary layers of management, particularly those that separate the \ncollector of intelligence from the analyzer of that intelligence.\n  Finally, the community must revamp its information technology \nbackbone so that agencies can easily and effectively communicate with \none another.\n  These steps will not be easy but are essential if the intelligence \ncommunity is to stay relevant in today's world. Good intelligence is \nmore important than ever. As we deal with calls for military \nintervention in far flung locales, intelligence becomes a force \nmultiplier. We rely on the intelligence community to keep us informed \nof developing crises, to describe the situation prior to any U.S. \nintervention, to help with force protection when U.S. personnel are on \nthe ground, and to analyze foreign leadership intentions. Solid \nintelligence allows U.S. policymakers and military commanders to make \nand implement informed decisions.\n  Maintaining our intelligence capability is difficult and sometimes \nexpensive but absolutely essential to national security. The committee \nhas identified a few areas that we think are priorities that need \nadditional attention. One area of particular concern is the need to \nrecapitalize the National Security Agency to assure our ability to \ncollect signals intelligence. Collecting and deciphering the \ncommunications of America's adversaries provides senior policymakers \nwith a unique source of sensitive information. In 1998, and again this \nyear, the committee asked a group of highly qualified technical experts \nto review NSA operations. The Technical Advisory Group's conclusions \nwere unsettling. They identified significant shortcomings which have \nresulted from the sustained budget decline of the past decade. With \nlimited available resources the NSA has maintained its day-to-day \nreadiness but has not invested in needed modernization. Consequently, \nNSA's technological infrastructure and human resources are\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nstruggling to meet emerging challenges.\n  The NSA historically has led the way in development and use of \ncutting edge technology. This innovative spirit has helped keep the \nUnited States a step ahead of those whose interests are hostile to our \nown. Unfortunately, rather than leading the way, the NSA now struggles \nto keep pace with communications and computing advances.\n  There is, however, some reason for optimism. The current Director of \nNSA, General Hayden, has developed a strategy for recovery. He has \nundertaken an aggressive and ambitious modernization effort, including \ndramatic organizational changes and innovative business practices. \nThese changes and the rebuilding of NSA's infrastructure will, however, \nrequire significant additional resources. The committee decided that \nthis situation demands immediate attention, but the intelligence budget \nfaces the same constrained fiscal situation as other areas of the \nFederal budget. We have, therefore, realigned priorities within \nexisting resources in order to reverse this downward trend. This was \nnot an easy process and we were forced to make some painful tradeoffs, \nbut ensuring the future of the NSA is the committee's top priority. We \ncannot stand by and allow the United States to lose this capability. We \nhave taken prudent steps in this legislation to make sure NSA will \ncontinue to be the premier signals intelligence organization in the \nworld.\n  The bill also attempts to address an imbalance that has concerned the \ncommittee for some time. We have argued that our ability to collect \nintelligence far exceeds our ability to analyze and disseminate \nfinished intelligence to the end user. We spend a tremendous amount of \nthe budget developing and fielding satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles \nand all manner of other senors and collection platforms. These programs \nare important but too often new sensors are put into place without \nsufficient thought to how we will process and distribute the additional \ndata. No matter how good a satellite is at collecting raw intelligence, \nit is useless if that intelligence never makes it into the hands of a \ncompetent analyst and then on to an end user.\n  This imbalance has been particularly acute at the National Imagery \nand Mapping Agency. At the request of Congress, NIMA has identified \nprojected processing shortfalls associated with its future sensor \nacquisition plans. NIMA also outlined a three phase modernization to \naddress these shortfalls. Unfortunately, the future year funding \nprofile creates a situation that will force the intelligence community \nto either cut deeply into other programs or abandon the modernization. \nThe committee has rejected that approach and has realigned priorities \nin order to avoid this budgetary squeeze in the out years. It makes no \nsense to purchase expensive collection platforms when the rest of the \nsystem cannot handle the amount of intelligence produced.\n\n  Beyond the questions of resource allocation, this legislation also \naddress several policy issues, including the problem of serious \nsecurity breakdowns at the State Department. Over the course of the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years the Department has been beset by seemingly \ninexplicable security compromises, the latest being the disappearance \nof a laptop computer in January of this year. This incident, still \nunexplained, follows closely on the heels of the discovery of a Russian \nlistening device planted in a seventh floor conference room. \nSubsequently we learned that there was no escort requirement for \nforeign visitors, including Russians, to the State Department. Finally, \nI must mention the 1998 tweed jacket incident. In this case an \nunidentified man wearing a tweed jacket entered the Secretary of \nState's office suite unchallenged by State Department employees and \nremoved classified documents. No one knows who he was.\n  The only conclusion that I can draw is that the State Department \nculture does not place a priority on security. Despite Secretary \nAlbright's efforts to correct procedural deficiencies and to emphasize \nthe need for better security, we have not seen much progress. The \nauthorization bill contains a provision requiring all elements of the \nState Department to be certified as in compliance with regulations for \nthe handling of Sensitive Compartmented Information. This is the most \nhighly classified information and is controlled by the Director of \nCentral Intelligence. If a component of the State Department is not in \ncompliance with the applicable regulations, then that office will no \nlonger be allowed to retain or store this sensitive information. It is \nunfortunate that this provision is necessary, but we must make it clear \nto individuals who handle classified material that we are serious about \nenforcing security rules.\n  A broader but related area of concern is the ability of the U.S. \nIntelligence community to meet the counterintelligence threats of the \n21st Century with current structures and programs. We can no longer \nworry only about the intelligence services of adversaries such as the \nold Soviet Union, North Korea, or Cuba. We must deal with ever more \nsophisticated terrorist organizations and international crime \nsyndicates capable of launching their own intelligence and \ncounterintelligence efforts. We also face challenges from friendly \nstates seeking access to economic data and advanced U.S. technology.\n  All of these changes argue for a major retooling of a U.S. \ncounterintelligence apparatus designed for the cold war. The Director \nof Central Intelligence, the Director of the FBI, and the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense have undertaken an effort, referred to as CI-21, \nto design the structures and policies that we will need to cope with \ncutting edge technology and with the emergence of threats from \nnontraditional sources. I have been encouraged by the early progress \nmade on the CI-21 effort. We have chosen not to include legislative \nprovisions in the bill with the hope that the agencies involved will \nreach agreement and finalize the CI-21 plan. The report accompanying \nthe bill strongly encourages them to do so and I reiterate that \nencouragement.\n  One provision in the bill that has created a bit of controversy is \nthe section that closes a gap in existing law related to the \nunauthorized disclosure of classified material. This provision will \nmake it a felony for a U.S. government official to knowingly pass \nclassified material to someone who is not authorized to receive it. I \nsay that this provision closes a gap because many categories of \nclassified information are covered by existing statutes. This includes \nnuclear weapons data and defense information. Unfortunately much \nsensitive intelligence information does not fall into one of the \nexisting definitions. Disclosure of this information could compromise \nsensitive sources and in some cases endanger peoples lives. The \nprovision in the bill has been carefully crafted to avoid first \namendment concerns and the chairman and I will offer a technical \namendment incorporating suggestions made by the Attorney General. It is \nmy understanding that she supports the provision as amended.\n\n  Another provision which merits further explanation is the section \ndealing with treaty implementing legislation. This language provides \nthat future criminal laws enacted to implement treaties will not apply \nto intelligence activities unless those activities are specifically \nnamed in the legislation. On its face this could be interpreted as \nexempting our intelligence community from the law regardless of the \nnature of the activity. In fact, this only applies to activities which \nare otherwise lawful and authorized. Intelligence activities are \nsubject to an extensive set of statutes, regulations and presidential \ndirectives. These rules try to balance our need for intelligence to \nprotect our national security with the American sense of values and \nethical behavior.\n  Intelligence gathering--spying--is an inherently deceitful activity. \nTo protect our military forces, thwart terrorist acts, or dismantle \ndrug trafficking organizations, we gather information through \nsurreptitious means. We either convince people to betray their country \nor cause, or we use intrusive technical means to find out what people \nare doing or saying. This may make some people uncomfortable, but it is \nabsolutely essential to protecting American interests. Treaties that \nproscribe certain kinds of behavior should not inadvertently restrict \nthese intelligence activities. If the Congress intends to apply treaty \nimplementing legislation to intelligence activities,\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\nthen we should say so explicitly. We want to be precise and ensure that \nintelligence operatives in the field understand what we expect of them. \nAmbiguity and uncertainty are more likely to create problems. This \nprovision will put the burden on Congress to make the determination of \nwhich treaty restrictions we want to apply to intelligence activities.\n  I have served on the Intelligence Committee for almost 8 years now \nand I have had the privilege of serving as vice chairman since January. \nDuring that time I have made a few observations that I would like to \nshare. Since I am leaving the committee and the Senate at the end of \nthis year, I have no vested interest other than my continuing belief in \nthe importance of the committee's work conducting oversight of the \nintelligence community.\n  My experience leads me to the conclusion that excessive turnover is \nseriously hampering the effectiveness of the Intelligence Committee--a \ncommittee the Senate relies upon and points to in reassuring the \nAmerican people that the intelligence community is being appropriately \nmonitored by their elected representatives. Because of the 8-year \nlimitation, member turn-over can be, and often is dramatic. For \nexample, when the 107th Congress convenes next January, 5 of the 7 \ncurrently serving Democrats will have departed the committee. At the \nend of the 107th Congress, 5 of the 8 currently serving Republicans \nwill leave the committee.\n  Over time, this brain drain diminishes the committee's ability to \ndischarge its responsibilities. For example, in 1994 the committee \ndealt with the Aldrich Ames espionage case, arguably the most \ndevastating counterintelligence failure of the cold war. The committee \nproduced a report extremely critical of the CIA in this case and of the \nway the CIA and FBI dealt with counterintelligence in general. The Ames \ndebacle led to a major restructuring of our national \ncounterintelligence system with significant legislative input. Yet \ntoday, there is only one member on the majority side who served on the \ncommittee during that period, and at the end of this year there will be \nno members on the Democratic side. This lack of corporate memory \ngreatly reduces the committee's effectiveness.\n  This committee deals with sensitive and complex issues, and much of \nthe committee's business involves the technical agencies such as the \nNational Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. To \nunderstand these issues a Senator must invest significant time to \ncommittee briefings and hearings. There is no outside source to go to \nstay abreast of developments in the intelligence community. Just about \nthe time members are beginning to understand these issues they are \nforced to rotate off the committee. This makes no sense.\n  The rationale behind the term limits was two fold. First, it was \nfeared that the intelligence community could over time co-opt \npermanently serving members. In fact, new members who have little \nexperience with the workings of the intelligence community are more \ndependent on information provided by the intelligence agencies. SSCI \nmembers are no more likely to be co-opted by the intelligence community \nthan the members of other authorizing committees are likely to be co-\nopted by the Departments and agencies they oversee. The second reason \nterm limits were enacted stemmed from the understandable view that the \nSSCI would benefit from a flow of fresh ideas that new members would \nbring. But because of naturally occurring turnover, new members have \nregularly joined the committee, irrespective of term limits. Since the \nSSCI was created 24 years ago, approximately sixty Senators have served \non the committee. Members have served an average of just over 5 years--\nand approximately 60 percent of committee members have served on the \ncommittee less than 8 years. This historical record confirms that \nvacancies will continue to occur regularly on the SSCI, thus allowing \nthe new faces and fresh ideas. At the same time, however, members who \nhave a long-term interest in the area of intelligence should continue \nto serve and develop expertise.\n  My second observation relates to the committee's authority but also \nto a larger issue that is the question of declassifying the top line \nnumber for the intelligence budget. It is difficult to conduct a \nthorough and rationale debate concerning intelligence policy without \nmentioning how much money we spend on our intelligence system. \nDeclassifying the top line budget would allow for a healthy debate \nwithin the Congress about the priority we place on intelligence. I \nwould provide greater visibility and openness to average Americans, \nwhose tax dollars fund these programs. Disclosure of the overall budget \nwould provide these benefits without damaging U.S. national security. \nDCI Tenet declassified the budget numbers for top past budgets with no \nadverse effects, but has declined to continue this practice. I hope \nthat the Congress and the next administration will revisit this issue \nand left this unnecessary veil of secrecy.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank the staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee for the work they do and for the support they have given me \nas vice chairman. The committee is staffed by professionals dedicated \nto ensuring that the intelligence community enhances U.S. national \nsecurity and does so in strict compliance with the intent of Congress. \nThe staff is unique in the Senate in that the vast majority are \nnonpartisan and go about their business without regard to any political \nagenda. The four members of the staff with partisan affiliations, the \nstaff directors and their deputies, approach their work with same \nspirit of bipartisanship that always has been a hallmark of the \ncommittee. Let me single our Bill Duhnke and Joan Grimson, the majority \nstaff director and deputy for their excellent cooperation and the \ncourtesy they have extended this year. I should note that Joan is not \nhere today because she is off on maternity leave. I extend my \ncongratulations to her and her husband on the birth of their first \nchild, Jacqueline Anna. I also thank Melvin Dubee, my deputy minority \nstaff director. Melvin brings a wealth of experience to the job, and it \nhas been reflected in the sound advice I have come to depend on him to \nprovide. Vicki Divoll, who joined the committee staff as counsel in \nJanuary, also has been invaluable to me during the preparation of this \nlegislation and in dealing with other legal issues.\n  Finally, I would have been lost as vice chairman without the guidance \nand advice of Al Cumming, the minority staff director. Al kept me well \ninformed and helped me focus on issues that will have a lasting impact \non the functioning of the intelligence community. The staff has done \nsuperb work on this legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bryan for his comments. \nObviously, as I said, this is very important legislation. The \nIntelligence Committee does good work, important work for our \ncommittee. It has been partially delayed by misunderstandings which we \nhave worked out. I think everybody is satisfied with this. I thank the \nchairman for his persistence. I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to take a minute or two and talk \nabout my colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan. He is going to be \nleaving the Senate soon. As the vice chairman of the committee--a long-\nterm and long-time member of the Senate Intelligence Committee--he has \nbeen a delight to work with most of the time. Seriously. He puts a lot \nof effort into what we do on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  I would be remiss if I did not bring that up as we pass this bill \ntonight. We have a conference to go to. We will be spending a lot of \ntime together in the waning days of this Congress. Dick Bryan served \nthis country well, first as a State legislator, as the attorney general \nof his State, as the Governor of his State, and in two terms in the \nU.S. Senate. I have worked with him on a lot of issues, and I can say \nthis: He is a hard worker, he is smart, he is going to be prepared, he \nis going to be tough, and he is going to put the Nation first.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I may respond to the excessively \ngenerous comments of my chairman, my colleague, and my friend, the \nreality is that working with him has been a pleasure. Without his \ncooperation and, obviously, trying to work in a bipartisan way to \nprocess this piece of legislation and other things we have done since \nthe two of us have been privileged\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nto serve as chairman and vice chairman, we would not be here today with \nthis bill.\n  I acknowledge his leadership. The good citizens of Alabama have a \nfine Member here and a person with whom I have been privileged to work \nfor the last 12 years I have been in the Senate, and most especially \nthis last year when we have served in our respective roles on the \nIntelligence Committee. I thank him publicly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9595-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote relative to the H-1B bill and the visa waiver bill on Tuesday, the \nSenate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nominations on the Executive Calendar, en bloc: No. 652, \nMichael Reagan; No. 654, Susan Bolton; and No. 655, Mary Murguia.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the en bloc \nconsideration, the following Senators be recognized to speak for the \nallotted timeframes. They are: Senator Hatch for 20 minutes; Senator \nKyl for 20 minutes; Senator Lott or designee for 20 minutes; Senator \nLevin for 20 minutes; Senator Robb for 10 minutes; Senator Harkin for \n30 minutes; Senator Leahy for 20 minutes; and Senator Durbin for 10 \nminutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time, the nominations be temporarily set aside.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the Senate \nthen proceed to the nomination of Calendar No. 656, James Teilborg, and \nthere be up to 1 hour each for Senators Hatch, Kyl, and Leahy, and up \nto 3 hours for Senator Harkin or his designee, and following the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthat nominee, without any intervening action or debate, to be followed \nimmediately by a vote en bloc in relation to the three previously \ndebated nominations. I further ask consent that the vote count as three \nseparate votes on each of the nominations.\n  Finally, I ask consent that following the confirmation votes, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the distinguished \nmajority leader, in good faith, if he would modify his unanimous \nconsent request to discharge the Judiciary Committee on further \nconsideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, the nominee for the \nEighth Circuit Court, and that her nomination be considered by the \nSenate under the same terms and at the same time as the nominees \nincluded in the majority leader's request?\n  I ask the majority leader if he would modify his request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's interest in that \nadditional nomination. I do not think I have ever moved to discharge \nthe Judiciary Committee on a single nomination or a judge. There are \nother judges presumably that will also need to be considered. I do \nappreciate the agreement that has been reached here. I know that it has \nbeen difficult for the Senator from Iowa to even agree to this. But in \nview of the fact that the committee has not acted, I could not agree to \nthat at this time, so I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object for \njust one more, again, I just want to say to the majority leader that on \nsome of these nominees--I think maybe three of them were nominated, got \ntheir hearings and were reported out of committee all within one week \nin July. Yet Bonnie Campbell from Iowa was nominated early this year. \nShe has had her hearing, and has been sitting there now for four months \nwithout being reported out. I just find this rather odd. I haven't \nheard of any objections to bringing her nomination out on the floor.\n  I just ask the majority leader whether or not we can expect to have \nat least some disposition of Bonnie Campbell before we get out of here.\n  Mr. LOTT. I respond, Mr. President, that I do not get into the \nbackground of all the nominees when they are before the committee. I do \nnot know all of the background on these nominees. As majority leader, \nwhen nominations reach the calendar, I try to get them cleared. I do \nthink the fact that we had not been able to clear these four, even \nthough they were already on the calendar, has maybe had a negative \nimpact on other nominations being reported on the assumption that, \nwell, if we could not move these, which were, I think, unanimously \ncleared quickly without any reservations, that that had become an \nimpediment. I do not know that this will remove that impediment, but it \nlooks to me as if it is a positive step.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just say to the leader, it seems odd we have a nominee \nthat is supported by both of the Senators from her home State, on both \nsides of the aisle, on the Republican and Democratic side; and I think \nshe is not getting her due process here in this body. I just want to \nmake that point. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say for the Record--and you know that it is true because \nI believe you were with me when he spoke to me--Senator Grassley has \nindicated more than once his support for the nominee. So he has made it \nclear he does support her. I do not know all of the problems or if \nthere are any. But perhaps further consideration could occur. I am sure \nyou won't relent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I plan to be here every day. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \noriginal request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

SMITH, CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to \ntake this opportunity to recognize the exemplary service and career of \nan outstanding naval officer, Rear Admiral Louis M. Smith, upon his \nretirement from the Navy at the conclusion of more than 33 years of \nhonorable and distinguished service. Throughout his exemplary career, \nhe has truly epitomized the Navy core values of honor, courage, and \ncommitment and demonstrated an exceptional ability to advance the \nNavy's facilities requirements within the Department of Defense and the \nCongress. It is my privilege to commend him for a superb career of \nservice to the Navy, our great Nation, and my home State of \nMississippi.\n  Since September 1998, Rear Admiral Smith has served as the Commander, \nNaval Facilities Engineering Command, and Chief of Civil Engineers. As \nthe senior civil engineer in the Navy, he is responsible for the \nplanning, design, construction and maintenance of naval facilities \naround the globe. On Capital Hill, he is best known for his quick wit, \nentertaining and informative testimony, and ability to communicate the \nNavy's facilities requirements in addition to his role in developing \nand executing the Navy's Military Construction, Base Realignment and \nClosure and Environmental programs. He often testified before \ncongressional committees and ensured\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\nthat Members of Congress and their staffs fully understood the Navy's \nshore infrastructure requirements. In this capacity, Rear Admiral Smith \nwas second to none.\n  Previously, he served as the Director, Facilities and Engineering \nDivision for the Chief of Naval Operations where he had a hand in \nshaping the Navy's readiness ashore, as well as numerous quality-of-\nlife initiatives to improve the lives of Sailors and Marines. A true \nshore facilities expert, his previous public works assignments included \nAssistant Public Works Officer, Naval Air Station, Brunswick, Maine; \nPublic Works Officer, Naval Air Station, Keflavik, Iceland; and \nCommanding Officer, Public Works Center, San Diego, California.\n  As an acquisition professional, he has had numerous contracting \nassignments, including Officer-in-Charge of Construction, Mid Pacific, \nPearl Harbor, Hawaii and Head of Acquisition and Vice Commander of \nWestern Division, San Bruno, California. He embarked on his brilliant \nnaval career as the Officer in Charge of Seabee Team 5301, making three \ndeployments to Vietnam and earning the Bronze Star and Combat Action \nRibbon.\n  The Navy will best remember Rear Admiral Smith for his mastery of the \nNavy's financial system and his prowess in effectively navigating the \npolitical waters within the Beltway. His eight tours in the Nation's \nCapital began with duty in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations \nas Facilities Engineer, Security Assistance Division (OP-63). After an \nexchange tour on the Strategic Air Command staff, he then served as the \nDirector of the Chief of Naval Operations' Shore Activities Planning \nand Programming Division (OP-44), followed by a tour in the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Navy. Later, he served in the offices of the \nNAVFAC Comptroller and the Director of Programs and Comptroller, \nNAVFAC. After his Command tour in San Diego, he returned to NAVFAC \nHeadquarters as Vice Commander and Deputy Chief of Civil Engineers. \nRear Admiral Smith's knowledge of the Fleet, coupled with his \nunparalleled planning and financial acumen, was absolutely vital to \nsuccessfully charting the Navy's course through both the 1980s build-up \nand the post-Cold War draw-down.\n  Rear Admiral Smith is a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a \ngraduate of Marquette University where he received his Bachelor of \nScience in Civil Engineering. He later attended Purdue University where \nhe earned his Master of Science in Civil Engineering. Married to the \nformer Susan Clare Kaufmann of Milwaukee, he and Susan have two sons, \nBrian and Michael.\n  My home State of Mississippi has benefitted greatly from the \ncontributions of Rear Admiral Smith's visionary leadership, consummate \nprofessionalism, uncommon dedication, and enduring personality. For the \nState of Mississippi, he was there to assist in the disaster recovery \nfrom Hurricane George; he was there to provide outstanding facilities \nsupport for U.S. Navy bases in Mississippi; and he was there to assist \nmy staff in providing the highest levels of facilities support for our \nNavy. On January 1, 2001, he will enter retirement and the Navy will \nwish him fair winds and following seas. On behalf of the Congress, I \ncongratulate Rear Admiral Louis Martin Smith on the completion of an \noutstanding and successful career with very best wishes for even \ngreater successes in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9596-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ANGELS IN ADOPTION AWARD\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a member of the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, I would like to commend Senators Mary Landrieu \nand Larry Craig for their leadership in creating the Angels in Adoption \nprogram. I am happy to join in this initiative to honor the special \nfamilies that open their hearts and homes when they adopt a child. This \nyear I want to recognize a special family from Falling Waters, West \nVirginia as our very own angels in adoption. The Merryman family has \nbeen nominated for the Angels in Adoption Award by Steve Wiseman, \nExecutive Director of West Virginia Developmental Disability Council, \nfor being outstanding examples of adoptive parents.\n  Scott and Faith Merryman have been happily married for 32 years and \nlive in Berkeley County, West Virginia. They both work in the \ndisability field, Scott as a supervisory mentor at the Autism Center \nand Faith at the West Virginia Parent Training Information Center, a \nresource center for parents of children with special needs.\n  They have 6 children, 8 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. Two \nof their children, Richard and Hope, are adopted and they are in the \nprocess of adopting another foster child, Charity Megan.\n  Richard, who has cerebral palsy, is 26 years old, and now lives in \nhis own apartment. Richard is a member of the West Virginia Team of the \nPresident's Committee on Mental Retardation and attended the \nInternational Academy in 1999. He is also a member of the West Virginia \nDevelopmental Disabilities Council and a self-directed activist on \naccessibility and other disability issues.\n  Hope was adopted at 13 days old because her birth parents were unable \nto take care of her. She is now 19 years old and enjoys working as an \nAssistant Manager in a local restaurant as well as spending time with \nher family.\n  Charity Megan came to the Merryman family when she was 14 months old \nfrom an institution. She is now 17 years old, and has severe \ndisabilities including facial deformities, stunted growth, mental \nretardation, and a seizure disorder.\n  Despite the long hours of care and trips to the doctor, Scott and \nFaith say that they have learned a lot about the kind of things money \ncan't buy--like love and laughter.\n  I am proud to honor the Merrymans for the love that they show their \nfamily, and to the commitment they share in promoting adoption. In my \nown state of West Virginia, we have had a 51 percent increase in the \nnumber of adoptions since 1995 because of caring families like the \nMerrymans.\n  We as a Nation need to continue to offer our support to these special \nfamilies. As a member of Congress I will continue to introduce \nlegislation that will build on the foundation of the 1997 Adoption and \nSafe Families Act to ensure our children a safe and stable home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9596-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9596-S9597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, it is unfortunate that James Madison's \nlegacy is sometimes overshadowed by other prominent Virginians who were \nalso founding fathers of the United States. Most Americans can readily \nrecite the accomplishments of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. \nAnd while most people can identify James Madison as an important figure \nin American history, his exact accomplishments are sometimes less well \nknown than some of his contemporaries. As we approach the 250th \nanniversary of James Madison's birth, I wish to bring to your attention \nthe outstanding contributions he made to the fledgling United States.\n  During the course of his life, James Madison exhibited all the best \nqualities of a politician and a scholar. As a politician, he served as \na member of the Virginia House of Delegates, a member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives, U.S. Secretary of State, and two-term President of \nthe United States. As a scholar, he is associated with three of the \nmost important documents in American history: the U.S. Constitution, \nthe Federalist Papers, and the Bill of Rights. In Virginia, we have \npaid tribute to James Madison by naming one of our fine state \nuniversities after him--James Madison University in Harrisonburg, \nVirginia.\n  More than any other American, Madison can be credited with creating \nthe system of Federalism that has served the United States so well to \nthis day. Madison's indelible imprint can be seen in the delicate \nbalance struck in the Constitution between the executive and \nlegislative branches and between the states and the Federal government. \nIn addition to his contributions to the Constitution and the structure \nof American government, Madison kept the most accurate record of the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia of any of the participants. \nMadison's notes from the Convention are a gift for which historians and \nstudents of government will forever owe a debt of gratitude.\n  After the Constitutional Convention, Madison worked toward \nratification of the Constitution in two of the states most crucial for \nthe new government: Virginia and New York. He narrowly secured \nVirginia's ratification of the Constitution over the objections of such \nprominent Virginians as George Mason and Patrick Henry. He assisted in \nthe New York ratification effort through his contributions to the \nFederalist Papers.\n  The Federalist Papers, written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, \nand John Jay are used to this day to interpret the Constitution and \nexplain American political philosophy. Federalist Number 10, written by \nMadison, is the most quoted of all the Federalist Papers.\n  As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Madison became the \nprimary author of the first twelve proposed amendments to the \nConstitution. Ten of these were adopted and became known as the Bill of \nRights.\n  James Madison presided over the Louisiana Purchase as Secretary of \nState under President Jefferson and prosecuted the War of 1812 as \nPresident. He was a named party in Marbury vs. Madison, the famous \ncourt case in which the Supreme Court defined its role as arbiter of \nthe Constitution by asserting it had the authority to declare acts of \nCongress unconstitutional.\n  James Madison was born March 16, 1751, in Orange County, Virginia. \nAccordingly, I urge your support of the James Madison Commemoration \nCommission Act, legislation that will recognize the life and \naccomplishments of James Madison on the 250th anniversary of his birth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9597-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9597-S9598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROPOSED MERGER OF UNITED AIRLINES AND US AIRWAYS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the Coastal \nZone Management Act of 2000, legislation to reauthorize the Coastal \nZone Management Act. This bill, S. 1534, was passed last Thursday \nevening by unanimous consent.\n  To begin, I want to thank Senator Snowe, our chairman on the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for putting this \nlegislation on the Committee agenda this Congress and working for its \nenactment\n  When Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972, it \nmade the critical finding that, ``Important ecological, cultural, \nhistoric, and esthetic values in the coastal zone are being \nirretrievably damaged or lost.'' As we deliberated CZMA's \nreauthorization this session, I measured our progress against that \nalmost 30-year-old congressional finding. And, I concluded that while \nwe have made tremendous gains in coastal environmental protection, the \nincreasing challenges have made this congressional finding is as true \ntoday as it was then.\n  At our oversight hearing on this legislation, Dr. Sylvia Earle \ntestified on the current and future state of our coastal areas. Dr. \nEarle has dedicated her career to understanding the coastal and marine \nenvironment, and knows as much about it as anyone. She warned us that, \n``We are now paying for the loss of wetlands, marshes, mangroves, \nforests barrier beaches, natural dunes and other systems with \nincreasing costs of dealing somehow with the services these systems \nonce provided--excessive storm damage, benign recycling of wastes, \nnatural filtration and cleansing of water, production of oxygen back to \nthe atmosphere, natural absorption of carbon dioxide, stabilization of \nsoil, and much more. Future generations will continue to pay, and pay \nand pay unless we can take measures now to reverse those costly \ntrends.''\n  The Coastal States Organization, represented by their chair, Sarah \nCooksey, told the Committee that, ``In both economic and human terms, \nour coastal challenges were dramatically demonstrated in 1998, by \nnumerous fish-kills associated with the outbreaks of harmful algal \nblooms, the expansion of the dead zone of the Gulf coast, and the \nextensive damage resulting from the record number of coastal hurricanes \nand el Nino events. Although there has been significant progress in \nprotecting and restoring coastal resources since the CZMA and Clean \nWater Acts were passed in 1972, many shell fish beds remain closed, \nfish advisories continue to be issued, and swimming at bathing beaches \nacross the country is too often restricted to protect public health.''\n  It is clear from the evidence presented to the Committee in our \noversight process and from other input that I have received, that a \ngreat need exists for the federal government to increase its support \nfor states and local communities that are working to protect and \npreserve our coastal zone. To accomplish that goal, the Committee has \nreported a bill that substantially increases annual authorizations for \nthe CZMA program and targets funding at controlling coastal polluted \nrunoff, one the more difficult challenges we face in the coastal \nenvironment.\n  S. 1534 would provide a significant increase to the CZMA Program. \nTotal authorization levels would increase to $136.5 million in FY2001. \nFor grants under Section 306, 306A, and 309, the bill would authorize \n$70 million beginning in FY00 and increasing to $90.5 million in FY04. \nFor grants under section 309A, the bill would authorize $25 million in \nFY00, increasing to $29 million in FY 04; of this amount, $10 million \nor 35 percent, whichever is less, would be dedicated to approved \ncoastal nonpoint pollution control strategies and measures. For the \nNERRS, the bill would provide $12 million annually for construction \nprojects, and for operation costs, $12 million in FY 2001, increasing \nto $15 million in FY04. Finally, the bill would provide $6.5 million \nfor CZMA administration.\n  This reauthorization also tackles the problem of coastal runoff \npollution. This is one of the great environmental and economic \nchallenges we face in the coastal zone. At the same time that pollution \nfrom industrial, commercial and residential sources has increased in \nthe coastal zone, the destruction of wetlands, marshes, mangroves and \nother natural systems has reduced the capacity of these systems to \nfilter pollution. Together, these two trends have resulted in \nenvironmental and economic damage to our coastal areas. These effects \ninclude beach closures around the nation, the discovery of a recurring \n``Dead Zone'' covering more than 6,000 square miles in the Gulf of \nMexico, the outbreak of Pfiesteria on the Mid-Atlantic, the clogging of \nshipping channels in the Great Lakes, and harm to the Florida Bay and \nKeys ecosystems. In Massachusetts, we've faced a dramatic rise in shell \nfish beds closures, which have put many of our fishermen out of work.\n  To tackle this problem, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 \ntargets up $10 million annually to, ``assist coastal communities to \ncoordinate and implement approved coastal nonpoint pollution control \nstrategies and measures that reduce the causes and impacts of polluted \nrunoff on coastal waters and habitats.'' This is an important \namendment. For the first time, we have elevated the local management of \nrunoff as national priority within the context of the CZMA program. \nRunoff is not a state-by-state problem; the marine environment is far \ntoo dynamic. States share the same coastlines and border large bodies \nof waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay or the Long \nIsland Sound, so that pollutants from one state can detrimentally \naffect the quality of the marine environment in other states. We are \nseeing the effects of polluted runoff both in our coastal communities \nand on our nation's living marine resources and habitats. I'm pleased \nthat we've included the runoff provision in S. 1534. It's an important \nstep forward and I believe we will see the benefits in our coastal \nenvironment and economy.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, Mr. President, has been \nendorsed by the 35 coastal states and territories through the Coastal \nState Organization. It also has the endorsement of the Great Lakes \nCommission, American Oceans Campaign, Coast Alliance, Center for Marine \nConservation, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, California \nCoastKeeper and many other groups. It's a long list. I will ask \nunanimous consent to have printed into the Record a letter from support \norganizations. I add that S. 1534 passed the Senate Commerce Committee, \nwith its regionally diverse membership, unanimously.\n  I want to thank some of those assisted my staff with this \nlegislation, and helping us pass it in the Senate. They include the \nMassachusetts Coastal Zone Program office and its Director, Tom \nSkinner, who provided technical assistance on the program, as well as \nthe Center for Marine Conservation, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nAmerican Ocean Campaign, the Coastal States Organization and the Coast \nAlliance. And I thank my colleagues on the Commerce Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the following \n     organizations, we are writing to urge you to schedule S. \n     1534, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, for floor \n     consideration as soon as possible. Sponsored by Senators \n     Snowe and Kerry, S. 1534 has been reported out of the \n     Commerce Committee with unanimous bipartisan support.\n       Since its enactment in 1972, the Coastal Zone Management \n     Act (CZMA) has helped protect and improve the quality of life \n     along the coast by providing incentives to states to develop \n     comprehensive programs to meet the challenges facing coastal \n     communities reducing their vulnerability to storms and \n     erosion, the effects of pollution on shellfish beds and \n     bathing water quality, and loss of habitat, to name a few.\n       The CZMA has proven to be a model statute for promoting \n     national, state and local objectives for balancing the many \n     uses along the coasts. There is no better testament to the \n     success of the state/federal partnership forged by the CZMA \n     than the fact that 34 of 35 eligible coastal states, \n     commonwealths and territories have chosen to participate in \n     the program. Federal assistance provided under the Act is \n     matched by states dollar for dollar. Each state can point to \n     significant benefits resulting from the Act, such as improved \n     coastal ecosystem health; revitalized waterfront communities; \n     coastal habitat\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\n     conservation and restoration; increased maritime trade, \n     recreation, and tourism; and the establishment of estuarine \n     research reserves which serve as living laboratories and \n     classrooms.\n       The lands and waters of our coastal zone are subject to \n     increasingly intensive and competing uses. More than half of \n     the Nation's expanding population is located near the coast. \n     S. 1534 will improve the Act by authorizing ``Coastal \n     Community Grants'' to assist states in enabling communities \n     to develop strategies for accommodating growth in a manner \n     which protects the resources and uses which contribute to the \n     quality of life in coastal communities. The bill will help \n     build community capacity for growth management and resource \n     protection; dedicate funding for communities to reduce the \n     causes and impacts of polluted runoff on coastal waters and \n     habitats; and reduce the pressure on natural resources caused \n     by sprawl by targeting areas for revitalization.\n       As a measure of the support the CZMA has enjoyed, it is \n     worth noting that in 1996, the CZMA reauthorization bill \n     passed by a unanimous vote in the House, and passed the \n     Senate by voice vote. We hope that passage of S. 1534 will \n     form part of the legacy of significant accomplishments of the \n     106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n       Anthony B.

Mr. President, few individuals ever touch the lives of \npeople like the late Mike McKevitt did. Former Congressman and \nAssistant U.S. Attorney General James D. ``Mike'' McKevitt passed away \nlast week here in Washington, DC. He was a remarkable man, a selfless \npublic servant, and a loyal friend. He was always working on behalf of \nothers to make the world better.\n  His positive attitude, personal warmth and absolute sense of fair \nplay were most unique in a far too often cynical, and mean-spirited \ntown called Washington, DC. For 30 years, he rose above the pettiness, \nnonsense and nastiness that often dominates the environment of the \nworld's most powerful city. He made it more fun to be here. He made it \nall seem more noble than most of it is.\n  We will all miss Mike McKevitt. We are all better because of him. Our \nprayers and thoughts go out to his wonderful wife Judy and his \ndaughters and grandchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached obituary from The \nWashington Post on Congressman McKevitt be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2000]\n\n           Congressman James D. ``Mike'' McKevitt, 71, Dies]\n\n       James D. ``Mike'' McKevitt, 71, a partner in the Washington \n     government affairs firm of McKevitt & Schneier who was a \n     former congressman and U.S. assistant attorney general, died \n     Sept. 28 at Sibley Memorial Hospital after a heart attach. He \n     lived in McLean.\n       Mr. McKevitt served in the House as a Colorado Republican \n     for one term before losing a reelection bid in 1972. During \n     his years in the House, he served on the Judiciary, Interior \n     and Small Business committees.\n       In 1973, he served as assistant attorney general for \n     legislative affairs, then in 1973 and 1974 was counsel to the \n     White House Energy Policy Office.\n       From 1974 to 1986, he was federal legislation director of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business. He then \n     practiced law before founding the McKevitt & Schneier \n     government affairs firm in 1986.\n       Mr. McKevitt was a founding member of the Korean War \n     Veterans Memorial Board. In 1987, the former representative \n     of Colorado's 1st District was honored by Sen. William \n     Armstrong (R-Colo.) as a moving force in the enactment of \n     legislation creating the memorial.\n       Over the years, he also had served on the board of the USO, \n     the U.S. Capitol Historical Society and the International \n     Consortium for Research on the Health Effects of Radiation. \n     He was a past president of the University Club of Washington, \n     parliamentarian of the 1986 White House Conference on Small \n     Business and a member of the Bowen Commission on Medicare. \n     His hobbies included sailing the Chesapeake Bay.\n       Mr. McKevitt, who was born in Spokane, Wash., was a 1951 \n     graduate of the University of Idaho and a 1956 graduate of \n     the University of Denver law school. During the Korean War, \n     he served as an Air Force combat intelligence officer in \n     Korea.\n       He was admitted to the Colorado Bar in 1956 and practiced \n     law in Boulder before serving as an assistant attorney \n     general of Colorado from 1958 to 1967.

Mr. President, the Administration recently launched a new \nwebsite, www.firstgov.gov. That website is the first all-government \nportal and will offer one stop information from over 20,000 separate \nfederal websites. This promises to be a great tool. Throughout the \ncountry people will be able to download tax forms, read up on the \nstatus of legislation, better understand the Social Security system. \nBut Mr. President, meaningful access to all of the important \ninformation depends on what side of the Digital Divide you find \nyourself. To benefit from websites like firstgov, you must have a \ncomputer and understand how to use it, and you must have an Internet \nconnection with speeds fast enough to search databases, view graphics \nand download documents.\n  As the demand for high speed Internet access grows, numerous \ncompanies are responding in areas of dense population. While urban \nAmerica is quickly gaining high speed access, rural America is being \nleft behind. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological \ncapability is essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of \nfairness, but it is also an issue of economic survival.\n  To remedy the information gap between urban and rural America, I \nalong with Senator Daschle introduced S. 2307, the Rural Broadband \nEnhancement Act, which gives new authority to the Rural Utilities \nService to make low interest loans to companies that are deploying \nbroadband technology to rural America.\n  The Rural Utilities Service has helped before; it can help again. \nWhen we were faced with electrifying all of the country, we enacted the \nRural Electrification Act. When telephone service was only being \nprovided to well-populated communities, we expanded the Rural \nElectrification Act and created the Rural Utilities Service to oversee \nrural telephone deployment. The equitable deployment of broadband \nservices is only the next step in keeping American connected, and our \nlegislation would ensure that.\n  If we fail to act, rural America will be left behind once again. As \nthe economy moves further and further towards online transactions and \ncommunications, rural America must be able to participate. They must be \nable to start their own online business if they so desire and access \ninformation about government services efficiently.\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to address \nthis problem and to bring meaningful data access to all parts of this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9600-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MARITIME ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last Thursday, the Senate passed S. 2487, \nthe Maritime Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. \nPassage of this measure will help to ensure our nation's maritime \nindustry has the support and guidance it needs to continue to compete \nin the world market.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations for the Maritime Administration \n[MarAd] for fiscal year 2001. It covers operations and training and the \nloan guarantee program authorized by title XI of the Merchant Marine \nAct 1936. The House Committee on Armed Services, which has jurisdiction \nof maritime matters in that body, has chosen to include provisions \nrelating to these authorizations in the House-passed version of H.R. \n4205, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. \nFurther, the House conferees on that measure have refused to fully \naccept S. 2487 as the Senate position as part of the on-going House-\nSenate conference deliberations in part, due to the Senate's slow \naction on the measure. I hope by passing S. 2487 we will change that \ncourse.\n  In addition to the authorizations for operations and training and the \nloan guarantee program, S. 2487 amends Title IX of the Merchant Marine \nAct of 1936 to provide a wavier to eliminate the three year period that \nbulk and breakbulk vessels newly registered under the U.S. flag must \nwait in order to carry government-impelled cargo. The bill also \nprovides a one year window of opportunity for vessels newly registered \nunder the U.S.-flag to enter into the cargo preference trade without \nwaiting the traditional three year period.\n  The bill also would amend the National Maritime Heritage Act of 1994 \nand allow the Secretary to scrap obsolete vessels in both domestic and \ninternational market. It would further convey ownership of the National \nDefense Reserve Fleet Vessel, Glacier to the Glacier Society for use as \nmuseum and require the Maritime Administration to including the source \nand intended use of all funding in reports to Congress. Finally, it \namends Public Law 101-115 to recognize National Maritime Enhancement \nInstitutes as if they were University Transportation Centers for \npurposes of the award of research funds for maritime and intermodal \nresearch and requires the Secretary of Transportation to review the \nfunding of maritime research in relation to other modes of \ntransportation.\n  I want to thank the cosponsors of this measure, Senator Hollings and \nSenator Inouye for the assistance in moving this measure forward. I \nhope my colleagues in the House will join us in supporting passage of \nthis legislation so we can move it on to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9600-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9600-S9601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE LATINO IMMIGRATION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, last week, the Senate majority blocked \nefforts to bring the Latino Immigration Fairness Act to the floor. This \nbill embodies the essence of America: providing safe haven to the \npersecuted and down trodden, supporting equal opportunity for the \ndisadvantaged, and promoting family values to our country's residents.\n  Many of my Senate colleagues perceive this provision to be a \nnecessary addition to the H-1B Visa bill, which extends temporary \nresidence to 195,000 foreign workers each year for the next two years. \nThe Latino Immigration Fairness Act legitimates certain workers who \nhave been living in the U.S. for over five years, and are ready, \nwilling, and able to permanently contribute to our workforce and \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately, the Majority's leadership has used parliamentary \nprocedures to block this bill from coming to the floor. I am \ndisappointed that too few Republican leaders support this meaningful \nlegislation becoming law. I am convinced that the Latino Immigration \nFairness bill has been proposed in the best interests of our country \nand in accordance with our obligations to promoting democracy and \nfreedom in our hemisphere.\n  My support for this legislation is based on four fundamental reasons: \nFirst, this bill would provide Central American immigrants previously \nexcluded under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act, NACARA, \nthe opportunity to legalize their status; it would allow immigrants \napplying for permanent residency to remain in the U.S. with their \nfamilies instead of forcing them to return to their country of origin \nto apply (a process that can take months to years to complete); and it \nwould change the registry cut-off date to 1986, which would resolve the \n14-year bureaucratic limbo that has denied amnesty to qualified \nimmigrants who sought to adjust their status under the 1986 Immigration \nReform and Control Act. Finally, this bill would resolve the status of \nso many valuable members of American society. There are an estimated 6 \nmillion immigrants in the United States who are not yet citizens. A \nmajority of these immigrants have been here for many years and are \nworking hard, paying taxes, buying homes, opening businesses and \nraising families.\n  For years, U.S. immigration policy has provided refuge to tens of \nthousands of these Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, \nHondurans, and Haitians fleeing civil war and social unrest in their \nown countries. In 1997 the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American \nRelief Act was signed into law. This statute protects Cuban and \nNicaraguan nationals from deportation from the United States. Those \nresidents who have been in the U.S. since December 1995 can now adjust \nto permanent resident status. But Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, \nand Haitians are still not as fully protected.\n  In the last decade, Louisiana has provided refuge to thousands of \nHondurans seeking relief from natural and human disasters. Displaced by \nstorms, floods, war, and social unrest, many of these people have found \nwarm and comforting homes for their families in the American Bayou.\n  My State, particularly in New Orleans, boasts a proud tradition of \ncultural diversity. The Honduran community was originally brought to \nLouisiana through a thriving banana trade between the Port of Louisiana \nand Gulf of Honduras in the early twentieth century. As the community \ngrew, Louisiana's Honduran population became the largest outside of \nHonduras. For this reason, Louisiana seemed the most logical \ndestination for Hondurans fleeing instability during the 1980s and \n1990s. Once again, my state, like many others, opened her doors to our \ndesperate Central American brothers.\n  The Latino Immigration Fairness Act will help fulfill a promise this \ngovernment has made to these refugees, and attempt to finish the work \nof Presidents Reagan and Clinton. Under the Reagan Administration, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service set up special asylum programs \nfor these people to reside legally in the U.S.\n\n  Since then, they have greatly contributed to American society--\nraising children, paying taxes, and establishing successful businesses \nthroughout our country--as well as contributed direct support to their \nrelatives left behind in their homelands.\n  In a democracy such as ours, we must be consistent in the principles \nwe uphold for our Latin neighbors seeking asylum. These people have \nfled political instability and social upheaval in their native lands.\n  As the guardian of Democratic ideals and chief opponent of repression \nin the Western Hemisphere, we must ensure that these residents adjust \ntheir status to legal resident under the same procedure permitted for \nCubans and Nicaraguans.\n  In sum, I urge my colleagues to consider the United States' historic \ncommitment to fair immigration policies. Our country has been built and \ncontinues to be sustained by immigrants.\n  In her poem, The Colossus, Emma Lazarus named our country the \n``Mother of Exiles.'' Personified by the Statue of Liberty, the United \nStates of America continues to shine her torch on refugees from \ninstability and strife--We have opened our doors to people of all races \nand nationalities, and have prospered from their valuable contributions \nto labor, community, and culture.\n  Now, failure to pass Fairness legislation will take away our promise \nof\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\nfreedom to so many deserving residents, and deny us the gifts they have \nimparted to our shores.\n  Contrary to what our critics say, supporting this bill does not \ncondone illegal entry into this country. I am proud of our historic \nvalue of the rule of law and territorial integrity. At the same time, I \nam equally concerned that once certain people have resided in this \ncountry for years and contributed to our country's prosperity, some \nwould have us uproot such valuable members of our society.\n  Let us not eject Honduran, Haitian, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran \nnationals, who have, for so long, woven into the American fabric, \nmaking American families, paying American taxes, building American \nhomes and businesses, and working for American labor.\n  Let us not revoke the American promise of freedom, and help deport so \nmany valuable members of our society. Let us vote for passage of this \nvery American legislation, the Latino Immigration Fairness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9601-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the 27th Olympiad is now finished, \nand the United States of America should be very proud of our \nparticipants. They showed the world that Americans put their hearts and \nsouls into everything that they do. Part of the reason that I support \nthe Olympic tradition is that these special games are a reflection of \nthe diversity, brotherhood, and spirit that the United States \ncelebrates everyday. I am especially proud of my state and the Olympic \nparticipants we sent to Sydney, Australia.\n  Lori Harrigan, Tasha Schwikert, and Charlene Tagaloa were three \nNevadan athletes who gave wholly to the U.S. team in their respective \nsports.\n  Lori Harrigan, a pitcher for the champion U.S. softball team, helped \nher team bring home a second gold medal in as many Olympic Games. Lori \nhas had an amazing softball career for many years now, and since she \ngraduated from UNLV, Lori has won 13 international medals for the \nUnited States. Lori will be remembered in Olympic history as the first \nsoftball player to pitch a complete no-hitter game, which she \naccomplished this summer in the opening round game. This summer she \nlived up to the legacy that she blazed as a UNLV Runnin' Rebel, and her \nsoftball accomplishments are properly hallmarked by her retired jersey \nthat UNLV has proudly displayed since 1998.\n  Las Vegan Tasha Schwikert has been the sweet surprise of the Olympic \nGames. She was not one of the original members of the U.S. gymnastics \nteam. However, she was later chosen as a second alternate. An \nunfortunate injury to another gymnast gave Tasha the chance that she \ndeserved for an Olympic appearance. Although Tasha didn't medal, she \nstill showed the world a strong performance. And because of her youth \nand newly developed international experience, we can expect to see \nTasha as a leader in future gymnastic competitions.\n  The United States women's volleyball team was the underdog of the \nOlympic indoor volleyball competition, and many did not even expect the \nteam to contend for a medal in Sydney. With the help of Las Vegan, \nCharlene Tagaloa, the women's volleyball team played in the bronze \nmedal math.\n  Nevada demonstrated its miulticulturalism during the Olympic Games, \nbecause six other current or former UNLV Runnin' Rebels competed for \ntheir native countries. These unique individuals include four swimmers \nand two track runners. These athletes are as follows: swimmers Mike \nMintenko of Canada, Jacint Simon of Hungary, Andrew Livingston of \nPuerto Rico, Lorena Diaconescu of Romania, and sprinters, Ayanna \nHutchinson and Alicia Tyson, of Trinidad and Tobago.\n  Nevada's contribution to the Olympic Games does not end with the \nefforts of its athletes.\n  Karen Dennis is not only the head of the UNLV women's track team, but \nshe was chosen to be the U.S. women's track coach. Her talent and \nexpertise undoubtedly contributed to the multiple medals and stellar \nperformances we saw from the U.S. track team this Olympics.\n  Las Vegan Jim Lykins was chosen to be one of the two umpires from the \nUnited States to referee women's softball. He gleefully did not umpire \nthe championship game, because Olympic rules prevent umpires from \nworking any games played by their home country. Not being able to \numpire the championship match was a worthwhile sacrifice for the gold \nmedal that we won in the fast pitch softball competition.\n  We should all remember the character of the 2000 Olympic Games, both \nthe smile evoking and heartbreaking moments, and continue to support \nthe Nevadan and American athletes who have the integrity, dedication, \nand ability to represent our nation, now and in the future. \nCongratulations to all of our Olympic participants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9601-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE KARNES ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, on September 28, 2000, the United \nStates Senate unanimously approved legislation to provide private \nrelief for Frances Schochenmaier of Bonesteel, South Dakota. Frances' \ncase clearly warrants action by the United States Congress to correct \nan injustice inflicted upon her family over 50 years ago. I am pleased \nthat the Senate has taken this important step by passing the Private \nRelief Bill for Frances Schochenmaier, which I was proud to have \nintroduced and was cosponsored by my friend and colleague from South \nDakota Senator Tom Daschle. I will continue to work diligently with \nMembers of the House of Representatives to ensure the legislation is \npassed before the end of this Congressional session and signed by the \nPresident.\n  Frances' husband, Hermann Schochenmaier, was one of the thousands of \nyoung men who valiantly answered his country's call to duty during \nWorld War II. While serving in Europe, Hermann was wounded--shot in the \narm in what medical personnel referred to as a through-and-through'' \nwound. Upon returning home, the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded \nHermann a 10 percent disability rating. For 50 years, Hermann received \ndisability compensation for the injury he received during his service \nin the United States military. Then, in 1995,\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs acknowledged that it was ``clearly \nand unmistakably erroneous'' in rating Hermann's injury too low. \nInstead of a 10 percent rating, Hermann's injuries during World War II \nwere consistent with a 30 percent disability rating.\n  Over these 50 years, Hermann received approximately $10,000, when he \nshould have actually received closer to $70,000. Unfortunately, only \none week prior to the Department of Veterans Affairs correcting this \nproblem, Hermann Schochenmaier passed away. To further complicate \nmatters, the Department of Veterans Affairs refused to give Hermann's \nfamily the disability benefits he rightfully earned.\n  For the past five years, I have worked with Frances to exhaust every \navenue within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The answer was always \nthe same: the law does not allow for veterans' widows to receive these \nlost benefits. So, I decided that it must take an act of Congress--\nliterally--to ensure that a veteran's widow from Bonesteel received the \nbenefits her husband earned, but was denied from receiving in his \nlifetime.\n  Thanks to the perseverance from members of my office, the continued \nfaith of Frances and her family, and some bipartisanship among members \nof Congress, we were able to pass this important legislation in the \nSenate and put it on a track to be signed into law by the President \nbefore the end of this year.\n  My wife, Barbara, and I are parents of a son who serves our country \nin the Army, and we know the sacrifices families make when their loved-\nones travel overseas in the military. I am sorry that fate denied \nHermann the opportunity to see justice done with the correction of his \ndisability rating. I am thankful that fate and old-fashioned elbow-\ngrease over these past five years has given our country the opportunity \nto make things right with Frances and the Schochenmaier family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9602-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE WELLPINIT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor of the Senate \ntoday to tell you about the hard working teachers, faculty and parents \nof the Wellpinit School District and their efforts to improve their \nchildren's education by bringing technology to the classroom. For their \ndedication, I am delighted to present the Wellpinit School District \nwith one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards.\n  The Wellpinit School District is located on the Spokane Indian \nReservation in Eastern Washington and educates 440 students of which 95 \npercent are of Native American descent. The K-12 school has already far \nexceeded any other rural school in Washington state with its efforts to \nboost the use of technology in the classroom. Under the direction of \nWellpinit's Board of Directors and Superintendent Reid Reidlinger, \nWellpinit implemented an innovative program that includes increasing \nstudent access to computers and improving students' use of the internet \nand intranet.\n  Wellpinit reconfigured its curriculum, integrating it with a computer \nprogram that allows students from both elementary and secondary grades \nto access an individualized instructional program for any core subject. \nThe computerized curriculum has been highly effective in increasing \nnational test scores. In fact, Wellpinit was named the highest \nachieving Indian Reservation school based on the Iowa Test of Basic \nSkills. Wellpinit has also been selected as one of America's Top 100 \nWired Schools by the editors of Family PC Magazine.\n  Earlier this year, I awarded Quillayute Valley School District one of \nmy ``Innovation in Education'' Awards for developing the Washington \nVirtual Classroom Consortium (WVCC), which links rural schools together \nvia the Internet in order to pool resources and expand learning \nopportunities for students and staff. Wellpinit has joined the WVCC to \nfurther enhance the educational opportunities for all students.\n  Superintendent Reid Reidlinger told me, ``Wellpinit has been a model \nfor other schools. Federal grants have helped with bringing technology \nto our district, and as a result, we have very advanced students.''\n  I commend all those who have contributed to Wellpinit's technology \nplan and ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the hard work and \ncommitment of the students, teachers and faculty at the Wellpinit \nSchool District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9602-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF TOM WILKENS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

It gives me \ngreat pleasure to extend my congratulations to Tom Wilkens on winning \nthe bronze medal in the men's 2000 meter individual medley event at the \nXXVIIth Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\n  Despite having asthma and a severe allergy to chlorine, Tom Wilkens \nhas consistently performed as a champion. At the 1999 Pan Pacific \nChampionships, he won a medal of each color, gold in the 200 meter \nindividual medley, silver in the 200 meter breaststroke, and bronze in \nthe 400 meter individual medley. To this impressive collection, he adds \na bronze from the Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad.\n  Tom Wilkens represents the best of New Jersey's athletes.

Her focus \nwas always on doing the right thing for our service members and their \nfamilies.\n  Mrs. Lewis has earned a reputation as someone on whom we could rely \nto provide fresh ideas, detailed research, and practical solutions to \ncomplex problems. Her professional abilities and expertise have earned \nher the respect and trust of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand in both Houses of the Congress. Mrs. Lewis' ability to clearly see \na viable alternative when others could only see the fog of confusion \ncontributed to the success of the Committee on Armed Services in \ndeveloping the legislation that will, for the first time in history, \ndefinitively entitle retired military personnel to the lifetime of \nhealth care that they were promised when they were recruited and \nreenlisted. With Mrs. Lewis' help, we are finally able to fulfill that \ncommitment.\n  Mr. President, initiative, caring service and professionalism are the \nterms used to describe Mrs. Lewis. Patty Lewis is a great credit to the \nSenate and the Nation. As she now departs to share her experience and \nexpertise with the Department of Defense I call upon my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to recognize her service to the Senate and wish \nher well in her new assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9602-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9602-S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING INDUCTEES INTO THE HALL OF VALOR\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

All the\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\nveterans being recognized have received either the Silver Star or the \ndistinguished Flying Cross and are residents of Allegheny County and \nother areas of Pennsylvania.\n  Each inductee has distinguished himself through gallantry and courage \nat the risk of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty. This \nnation values their service and has recognized these acts of heroism \nand bravery and those of other servicemen and women. Today, I would \nlike to remember and acknowledge the extraordinary valor each inductee \ndisplayed in the name of freedom.\n  Induction in the Hall of Valor is one way we can bear witness to and \nacknowledge the service of each inductee. I wish to extend my sincere \ngratitude for their sacrifice and dedication in the U.S. Armed Forces. \nAll of the heroes we honor today--both those present and those who have \ngone before us--deserve the highest esteem and admiration. I ask my \nSenate colleagues to join me in recognizing a few of our nation's \nveterans as they are inducted into the Hall of Valor at Soldiers' & \nSailors' Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh, PA.\n  In recognition of their actions, Joseph Burdis, Jr., Samuel L. \nCollier, James J.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to David Villotti of Amherst, NH, on being nominated for the \n``Angels in Adoption'' award. David has worked tirelessly to improve \nthe lives of many children throughout New Hampshire.\n  David's mission is to provide care and support to the neediest \nchildren and families in New Hampshire. David has worked to reunite \n``his'' children at the Nashua Children's Home to their biological \nfamilies or, if necessary, have them placed in foster care or adopted \ninto loving families. Some of these children have experienced a \ntremendous amount of emotional and physical trauma. David creates an \nenvironment that is safe for these children to grow while they await \nword on their family situation.\n  When David first began working at the Nashua Children's Home 15 years \nago, there were 18 children in residence. Today there are 46. David and \nhis staff continue to provide support to families while allowing \nchildren the environment that they need to grow and mature into well-\nadjusted teenagers and adults. I am proud to have nominated David for \nthe ``Angels in Adoption'' award for the state of New Hampshire.\n  David, it is an honor to serve you in the U.S. Senate. I wish you all \nthe best in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire \nthose around you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9603-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. WENDELL WEART\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to commend a fellow New \nMexican, Dr. Wendell Weart. He is a remarkable scientist, an \ninternational authority on radioactive waste management, and the Senior \nFellow at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \nAfter his distinguished career, he is retiring in October. His \noutstanding abilities have been crucial to the success of the world's \nfirst deep geologic repository for radioactive waste. It is highly \nappropriate that we recognize his contributions to that project and to \nthe nation.\n  The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico began receiving \ndefense-program radioactive wastes in 1999. The process that led to its \nopening was long and difficult, requiring the solution of innumerable \ntechnical and social problems. Although many people contributed to the \nsolution of those problems, Dr. Weart's role was paramount throughout.\n  He led Sandia's technical support for the project from its beginnings \nin the early 1970s. In the early years his efforts were essential to \nthe exploratory investigations and the final selection of the \nrepository site. He then led the project through the conceptual design \nof the repository, through the formulation and implementation of the \ninvestigations that demonstrated the site's suitability, and through \nthe arduous process of obtaining regulatory approvals. The rigorous \nscientific basis finally achieved for the repository was due in no \nsmall part to Dr. Weart's own scientific expertise and to his unmatched \nleadership.\n  At least as important as these highly technical contributions was Dr. \nWeart's ability to instill confidence among the scientific community \nand the public. His skill in explaining complex issues, his \ntruthfulness in all controversies, and his tireless patience in dealing \nwith questions and frustrations for more than twenty-five years--all \nwere indispensable contributions to the project. Without the trust Dr. \nWeart engendered, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, though \nscientifically well grounded, might still have failed to obtain \nscientific, regulatory, and social approval.\n  The permanent disposal of radioactive wastes has proved intractable \nin many countries. Thanks largely to Wendell Weart, the United States \nnow has an operating repository. Congress and the American taxpayers \nowe him our most sincere thanks and our best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9603-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/02/senate-section/article/S9603-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 29, 2000, during the recess \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House disagrees to the amendment of the Senate to \nthe bill (H.R. 4461) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies programs \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes, \nand agrees to the conference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses thereon.

A bill to expand the boundary of the George Washington \nBirthplace National Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             GEORGE WASHINGTON BIRTHPLACE NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the boundary of the George Washington Birthplace National \nMonument in Westmoreland County, Virginia by allowing the U.S. Park \nService to acquire portions of the surrounding property from willing \nsellers. Previously, on September 28, 2000, I offered S. 3132 to allow \nthe Park Service to acquire one acre of property adjacent to the park. \nThe bill I introduce today will allow the Park Service to acquire 115 \nacres from willing sellers, including the one acre referenced in S. \n3132. I urge my colleagues to support the preservation of George \nWashington's birthplace. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GEORGE WASHINGTON BIRTHPLACE NATIONAL MONUMENT \n                   BOUNDARIES ADJUSTED.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``George \n     Washington Birthplace National Monument Boundary Adjustment \n     Act of 2000''.\n       (b) Boundary of George Washington Birthplace National \n     Monument.--The boundary of the George Washington Birthplace \n     National Monument (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``monument'') is modified to include the area comprising \n     approximately 115 acres, as generally depicted on the map \n     entitled ``George Washington Birthplace National Monument \n     Boundary Map Westmoreland County Virginia'', numbered 332/\n     80,011B, and dated July 2000.

A bill to improve the integrity of the Federal student loan \nprograms under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 with \nrespect to students at foreign institutions; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             federal student loan programs improvements act\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am concerned that we as a Congress \nhave not been effective enough in oversight; that is, looking at the \nFederal agencies and Departments of this Government to make sure they \nare operating effectively.\n  We ooh and ah and make complaints and express concern, but we do not \noften follow through. I know fundamentally it is the responsibility of \nthe administration to run the executive branch, but Congress does fund \nthat branch and has every right to insist that branch does its duty \neffectively, expeditiously, and economically with minimum waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  I had the pleasure about a year ago to have a conversation with a \nwonderful lady, Melanie DeMayo, who used to work with Senator Proxmire \nand was involved in his ``Golden Fleece Award'' presentations. She \nconvinced me I could play a role in helping to make sure, when a dollar \nis extracted from a hard-working American citizen and is brought to \nthis Senate, this Government, to be spent, that it is spent wisely and \nnot wasted or abused or ineffectively utilized to carry out whatever \nworthwhile program was intended. I appreciate her insight and help in \nthinking this through.\n  I have developed what I call Integrity Watch. I spent a number of \nyears as a Federal prosecutor. I believe we can do a better job of \nmaintaining integrity in this Government. When we are spending $1.7 \ntrillion a year, it is incumbent upon us to make sure there is \noversight over these programs.\n  I have come to realize that we have a very large student loan \nprogram, and there are some problems with it. Today I am offering \nlegislation to create a 12-month fraud control pilot program to reduce \nthe incidence of fraud in the Federal Family Education Loan Program and \nother programs under title IV.\n  In recent years, there have been a number of cases of so-called \nstudents falsely claiming they are attending foreign schools, directing \nthat their student loan checks be paid directly to them and not to the \nschool, and then taking the money and spending it on themselves and not \nattending the foreign school. This fraud has been documented with many \nexamples listed in a 1997 Department of Education inspector general's \nreport.\n  In addition, the report contains recommendations on tightening \ncontrols for the program. Too often these reports are dry, detailed, \nand complicated. Nobody in this body even reads them, much less acts on \nthem. Certainly, I doubt the President, who says he wants to increase \nforeign student loans, has read the report. We certainly have not seen \nany request from the administration to improve this. I believe we can \nand should do it in Congress.\n  It is time, I believe, for this Congress to close the loopholes which \nallow these phantom students to defraud the Government.\n  On April 19, 2000, President Clinton and Secretary of Education Riley \ndeclared that international education is a priority with them. They \nwant to encourage more students to study abroad. In fact, the President \nissued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies \nstating that the United States is committed to promoting study abroad \nby U.S. students. He stated:\n\n       The Secretaries of State and Education shall support the \n     efforts of schools and colleges to improve access to high-\n     quality international educational experiences by increasing \n     the number and diversity of students who study and intern \n     abroad, encouraging students and institutions to choose \n     nontraditional study-abroad locations, and helping under-\n     represented United States institutions offer and promote \n     study-abroad opportunities for their students.\n\n  Study abroad can be a wonderful experience for a student, and I do \nnot oppose some form of student loan aid to students who want to take \nadvantage of that. It can be an extraordinarily enriching experience. \nWe do need to ensure that the program involves study and not a European \nvacation at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers for whom a \nvisit to the ball park is often beyond their budget.\n\n  This new initiative by the administration will increase the risk of \nfraud unless we institute sound controls immediately. I am not \nreferring to U.S. universities that have foreign programs or \ncooperative programs with foreign universities. I am talking about \nmainly the unsupervised foreign-based\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\ninstitutions. Some of these institutions have already been criticized \nby General Accounting Office studies. Often these marginal schools are \nthe very schools the so-called students use in their fraud scam. Their \nfraud is committed when they state they are registering in these \nschools and then simply pocket the money with no one the wiser.\n  Since 1995, there have been 25 felony convictions of students who \nfraudulently claimed they were attending a foreign school, and then \nthey just cashed their Government loan check and simply did not attend \nclass. In the United States, the check is made out to the school and \nthe student, but with regard to foreign schools, the check is made out \nsimply to the students. These are only the students who were caught \ndoing their fraudulent activity. I have no doubt there are many more \nwho have not been apprehended. That is why we ought to take action. We \nmust prevent cases such as this one.\n  Mr. Conrad Cortez claimed to be such a student, and he applied for \nstudent loans. In March of 2000, he admitted to charges of submitting \n19 fraudulent student loan applications over a 3-year period. He pled \nguilty before a U.S. district court judge to numerous accounts of mail \nfraud, bank fraud, and Social Security account number fraud in the \nState of Massachusetts. The prosecutor told the court in that case that \nCortez was responsible for dozens of other loans filed outside \nMassachusetts--in Florida and Texas.\n  The absolute disregard for the American taxpayers was epitomized by \nConrad Cortez. Mr. Cortez was living high at the expense of American \ntaxpayers and in violation of law by filing false documents to receive \nloan money from the Government.\n  During the period from 1996 through 1999, he bought gifts for his \nfriends, including jewelry and cars, paid for private tennis lessons, \nmade a downpayment on a house, sent some money back to his native \nColombia, ate in the best restaurants, and even paid restitution for a \nprevious charge of defrauding the Government, and he did this all with \nthe American taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. Cortez' fraud only ended when he was turned in by his sister's \nboyfriend, who claimed that Mr. Cortez had used his identity to obtain \nadditional loans. In fact, Mr. Cortez was about to help himself to \n$800,000 that you and I pay in income taxes. He had filed 37 false \nclaims in all, spending the money as fast as it came in to him.\n  The inspector general's office of the Department of Education, with \nthe FBI, and the attorney general's office in Boston combined forces to \napprehend him before he could get all the money that was coming to him \nthrough those false loans. He did, however, pocket about $300,000 \nbefore he was caught.\n  This is not an isolated case. In 1994, the General Accounting Office \nfound that the Department of Education had approved student loans to \nhundreds of students attending 91 foreign medical schools. Frankly, I \nam not sure there are 91 medical schools out there in this world, \noutside the United States, for which we ought to be funding education. \nIf somebody comes to this country expecting to be a doctor, we need to \nknow they have met certain quality education standards. But, at any \nrate, that is what we hear.\n  In applying its standards, the Department of Education relies \nexclusively on information submitted by those foreign schools as to \ntheir viability. Enforcement and oversight problems at the Department \nstill abound. Who is to say how many students have fraudulently applied \nfor loans? There isn't a report on that. Those are unknown unknowns, as \nthey say in management. We cannot measure what we do not know.\n  Most likely, the greatest abuse of the system occurs when the \nstudent, for various reasons, just pockets the money and never goes to \nclass. Under the present system, who will know? We do know that the \nsystem is broken. This legislation is one step toward fixing it.\n  Another abuse occurs when a foreign school is actually paid the \ntuition but does not insist that the student attend class and provides \nno real education to the student. I guess a foreign school could simply \nbe glad to get the American money, the American check, and at that \npoint it is up to the student whether or not he or she actually attends \nclass or learns anything. I think we need to have the Department of \nEducation look into that and make sure students are actually attending \nclass and not taking a European vacation.\n  Mr. Cortez demonstrated a perfect example of why this program is high \nrisk. There simply is not enough oversight. Currently, the methodology \nfor approving and releasing student loan funds is vulnerable. Current \nlaw states that the student may request a check be issued directly to \nhim or her, when claiming they are attending a foreign school, and a \ncheck will be sent directly to them, without the requirement of a \ncosignature by the school.\n  The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Education \nidentified weaknesses and deficiencies in the following areas of the \nforeign school attendance programs: Verification of enrollment, the \ndisbursement process, the determination of the borrowers' eligibility, \nstandards of administrative and financial capability on the part of the \nforeign school, and general oversight of foreign schools.\n  The same Office of Inspector General report--that is the Department \nof Education's own inspector general's office within that Department--\nstated that the number of students claiming to attend foreign schools \nand applying for loans increased each academic year from 1993 to 1997 \nand went from 4,594 students to 10,715 students. Later figures show the \nnumber continues to increase. Indeed, in 1998-1999 there were 12,000 \nforeign loans.\n  My legislation will require the Secretary of Education to initiate a \n12-month fraud control pilot program involving guaranty agencies--those \nare the people who put up the loan money guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment--lenders, and a representative group of foreign schools to \nreduce the incidence of fraud in the student loan program. I believe \nthe Secretary should look into a number of solutions.\n\n  Maybe the guaranty agencies should confirm that the student is \nenrolled in the foreign school before the loan is actually disbursed. \nAfter the money has been disbursed to the student, maybe the guaranty \nagencies should confirm that the student remains registered.\n  The Secretary should also determine whether it would be advantageous \nto require a loan check to be endorsed by both the student and the \nforeign institution. I am inclined to think it is. But we shall see. \nMaybe this evaluation period can help us determine that.\n  The question then becomes, Why are we paying for students to go to \nforeign schools? These are American taxpayers' dollars flowing to \nforeign economies where the standards of education may not be as high \nas ours. I have checked with the higher education systems in my State. \nThey certainly are not at full capacity and certainly can handle more \nstudents.\n  Perhaps there should be some limit on the number of years of study \nabroad. How many? Five? Six? Seven? Is that limited today? No, it is \nnot. Maybe we ought to limit the number of years that the taxpayers \nwill fund foreign education. Today there is no limit. Students can \ncomplete their entire education abroad, supported by the taxpayers, \nsometimes not in good institutions. Perhaps the quality of the \ninstitution should be verified, among other things. But this will not \nbe an issue raised by our legislation today.\n  Our legislation will simply go to the question of whether or not we \ncan improve the way we guard against actual fraud in these loans. It \nwill begin the process of erasing the fraudulent behavior of \n``students'' claiming they are attending foreign schools and then \npocketing the money for their personal lifestyle.\n  So I introduce this legislation today and hope my colleagues will \nquickly support such a measure as this because I believe it will reduce \nthe fraud that has been plainly demonstrated in a critical report by \nthe Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education.\n  In the course of working on this, I would like to express my \nappreciation to a number of people who have played an important role in \nthis. I thank the cosponsors of this legislation, including Senator \nJeffords, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee; Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, who is here, who has \nbeen a supporter and has had a great interest in this as a cosponsor; \nalong with Senators Brownback and Collins.\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\n  I also express my appreciation to Scott Giles of Senator Jeffords's \noffice; to Melanie DeMayo, who has done such a tremendous job helping \nus identify and research this problem; and Anthony Leigh of my staff, \nwho is with me now, who has helped me work on this.\n  We believe this is perhaps not a glamorous issue but an important \nissue, an important step we can take to eliminate plain fraud that is \nclearly occurring around this country to a substantial degree, \ndefrauding the taxpayers of the money they have sent to Washington.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama for his work in this area. I am glad I am cosponsoring the \nbill. Senator Sessions has been one of the tireless leaders in \neducation and in rooting out fraud and abuse in the Department of \nEducation.\n  I also mention, with Senator Sessions' help on the Education \nCommittee, we recently sent a bill out that I sponsored on the Senate \nside, that passed the House of Representatives, which would require a \nfraud audit of the Department of Education be performed by the General \nAccounting Office within 6 months.\n  While the Senator is dealing with one specific area of fraud that is \nvery serious, for which this legislation needs to be enacted, there are \nother examples of fraud, mismanagement, and abuse within the Department \nof Education that have come to light in recent days.\n  We are hopeful that legislation can move before this session ends. It \nis ironic that there are those who want the Department of Education to \nhave even more power, such as in the hiring of 100,000 teachers or in \nschool construction projects, when it is clearly a troubled agency that \nhas had a real problem in even having a clean audit of their books.\n  So I commend the Senator heartily and appreciate the work he is \ndoing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 3147.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to authorize \na memorial and gardens in honor and commemoration of Frederick \nDouglass. Frederick Douglass was a renowned abolitionist and civil \nrights leader. As a powerful orator, Douglass spoke out against \nslavery. As an advisor to President Abraham Lincoln, Douglass advocated \nfor equal voting rights for African Americans. Frederick Douglass spent \nover 20 years living in the Anacostia region of Washington, D.C. and it \nis appropriate that we dedicate the National Memorial and Gardens to \nhis memory in the community where he lived. As companion legislation \ngains momentum in the House, it is important that we pledge our support \nto this worthy endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3148. A bill to provide children with better access to books and \nother reading materials and resources from birth to adulthood, \nincluding opportunities to own books; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    access to books for children act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to enhance our \nefforts to provide children with opportunities to develop literacy \nskills and a love of reading through access to and ownership of books. \nI am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Jeffords, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Murray.\n  This bill would continue the good work of the Inexpensive Book \nDistribution program which we know as Reading is Fundamental (RIF), and \nwould authorize two new programs to support public/private partnerships \nwith the mission of making books and reading an integral part of \nchildhood and of providing books to children who may have no books of \ntheir own. Books opened a new world for me as a child and I want to \nmake sure that all children have that same opportunity.\n  Books are almost magical in their power. They inspire children to \ndream, to imagine infinite possibilities and ultimately to work to make \nsome of those possibilities real. But for too many children, the power \nof books is unrealized because of their own inability to read and \nbecause of limited access to books in their homes and communities. In \n1998, 38 percent of fourth graders in America ranked below the basic \nlevel of reading according to the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress. Sixty-four percent of African American and 60 percent of \nHispanic American fourth graders read below the basic level of reading.\n  These children are at high risk of never learning to read at an \nadvanced level. When children do not learn to read in the early years \nof elementary school, it is virtually impossible to catch up in later \nyears. Research shows that if a child cannot read well by third grade, \nthe prospect of later success is significantly diminished. Seventy-five \npercent of students who score below grade level in reading in third \ngrade will be behind grade level in high school.\n  But the foundation on which literacy is built, begins much earlier. \nReading to babies teaches them the rhythms and sounds of language. As \nearly as pre-school, children can recognize specific books, can \nunderstand how to handle them, and can listen to stories for in books. \nThe National Research Council's 1998 landmark study, ``Preventing \nReading Difficulties in Young Children,'' makes clear that to become \ngood readers, children need to learn letters and sounds, they need to \nlearn to read for meaning, and they must practice reading with many \ntypes of books to gain the speed and fluency that makes reading \nrewarding.\n  We know that children who live in print-rich environments and are \nread to in their early years are much more likely to learn to read on \nschedule. However, parents of children living in poverty often lack the \nresources to buy books, rarely have easy access to children's books, \nand may face reading difficulties of their own. For many families, \nwhere the choice is between buying books to read at home and buying \nfood or clothes, federal programs that support book donations and \nliteracy can change lives.\n  This legislation creates what I call the Access to Books for Children \nprogram (or ABC). It provides children with better access to books and \nresources from birth to adulthood, including opportunities to own \nbooks. The success of the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program is \nwell-known. This program has enabled Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF) \nto put books in the hands and homes of America's neediest and most at-\nrisk children. RIF is the nation's largest children's and family \nliteracy organization. Through a contract with the U.S. Department of \nEducation, RIF provides federal matching funds to thousands of school \nand community based organizations that sponsor local RIF projects. Some \n240,000 parents, educators, care givers, and community volunteers run \nRIF programs at more than 16,500 sites that reach out to serve 3.5 \nmillion kids nationwide. This bill would continue the good work of the \nInexpensive Book Distribution Program and increase the authorization \nfor this program to $25 million.\n  This legislation also supports two new public/private partnerships to \nreach children with books and literacy services. The Local Partnerships \nfor Books programs is funded not to support a new literacy project, but \nto support the ones that already exist with low cost or donated books. \nThe program would support local partnerships that link with grassroots \norganizations to provide them with low-cost or donated books for at-\nrisk, low income children. Local Partnerships for Books is organized \naround the principle that the private sector should be a major player \nin this effort to put books in the hands of our Nation's children \nthrough donations and partnerships.\n  This legislation would also support Partnerships for Infants and \nYoung Children--a program that makes early literacy part of pediatric \nprimary care. This program would support linking\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nliteracy and a healthy childhood. Visits to a pediatrician are a \nregular part of early childhood and offer an excellent opportunity to \nempower parents to build the foundations for literacy. This initiative \nis modeled on Reach Out and Read (ROR) which utilizes a comprehensive \napproach--including volunteer readers in waiting rooms, physician \ntraining in literacy, and providing each child with an age appropriate \nbook during each visit--to support parents in developing literacy in \ntheir children. An evaluation of this program found that parents are \nten times more likely to read to their children if they received a book \nfrom their pediatrician.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is just one piece of the larger \npuzzle we must confront as we struggle to improve our children's \nliteracy skills--but it is a piece that cannot be overlooked. To learn \nto read, kids need books to read; it is as simple as that. This \nlegislation will harness the energies and commitment of volunteers, \ncorporate America, local literacy programs, doctors and teachers to \nmake books, and book ownership, a reality for every child.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and an endorsement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I enthusiastically welcome the \n     ``Access to Books for Children Act'' that you, along with \n     Senators Jeffords and Dodd, are introducing before the U.S. \n     Senate in the coming days.\n       In my years as a pediatrician, I have witnessed the wide-\n     ranging impact of poverty on thousands of families, \n     particularly as it relates to the healthy development of \n     children. One particularly troublesome manifestation of \n     poverty is the barrier that it erects to having books in the \n     home.\n       We know that early brain development requires environmental \n     stimulation, and we also know that book sharing assures the \n     language stimulation essential for neuronal complexity and \n     maturation. None of this will happen without books nearby--\n     books in the home.\n       Making sure that all children have the opportunity to grow \n     up with books requires the participation of all professionals \n     that care for young children. Through the more than 740 Reach \n     Out and Read sites across the country, we are mobilizing the \n     pediatric community to do our part in meeting this challenge. \n     We are delighted by the prospect of support for our efforts \n     through this legislation.\n       I thank you for the leadership you continue to show in \n     supporting parents in their efforts to help their children \n     grow up healthy. We look forward to helping in any way we \n     can.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Barry Zuckerman, MD,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the \nAccess to Books for Children Act, the ``ABC'' Act. I commend Senator \nJeffords, Senator Dodd, and Senator Murray for their leadership on this \nlegislation.\n  Many successful programs are helping children learn to read well. But \ntoo often, the best programs are not available to all children. As a \nresult, large numbers of children are denied the opportunity to learn \nto read well. 40 percent of 4th grade students do not reach the basic \nreading level, and 70 percent of 4th graders are not proficient in \nreading.\n  Children who fail to acquire basic reading skills early in life are \nat a disadvantage throughout their education and later careers. They \nare more likely to drop out of school, and to be unemployed. This \nimportant grant will help many more children learn to read well--and \nlearn to read well early--so that they have a greater chance for \nsuccessful lives and careers.\n  The programs authorized in the ABC Act complement the work already \nunder way in Massachusetts and other states under the Reading \nExcellence Act and under the America Reads program. In 1996, President \nClinton and the First Lady initiated a new effort to achieve greater \nnational progress on child literacy by proposing their ``America Read \nChallenge.'' This worthwhile initiative encourages colleges and \nuniversities to use a portion of their Work-Study funds to support \ncollege students who serve as literacy tutors. Institutions of higher \neducation across Massachusetts are already creating strong \nrelationships with their surrounding communities, and participation in \nthis initiative enhances those relationships. Today, over 1,400 \ncolleges and universities are committed to the President's ``America \nReads Work Study Program,'' and 74 of these institutions are in \nMassachusetts.\n  The Reading Excellence Act was enacted in 1999 to provide competitive \nreading and literacy grants to states. States that receive funding then \naward competitive subgrants to school districts to support local \nreading improvement programs. The lowest-achieving and poorest schools \nwill benefit the most. The program will help children learn to read in \ntheir early childhood years and through the 3rd grade using effective \nclassroom instruction, high-quality family literacy programs, and early \nliteracy intervention for children who have reading difficulties. \nMassachusetts is one of 17 states to receive funding under this \ncompetitive program.\n  In addition to good instruction, children need to have reading \nmaterials outside of school--and even before they start school. They \nalso need adults to read with them, so that they can develop a love of \nreading early in life.\n  The ABC Act authorizes three programs to provide children from birth \nthrough high school age with low-cost or no-cost books. The programs \ncomplement one another by reaching different communities through \ndifferent means, so that every child can have a book to read.\n\n  The act reauthorizes $25 million for the successful Reading Is \nFundamental Program, which distributes books to school-age children. \nThis program has been especially effective in Massachusetts. It is \nhelping over 45,000 children at 70 sites across the state obtain access \nto books. As a teacher from Methuen said, ``RIF continues to excite our \nstudents by providing them with books they can call their own, exposing \nthem to a variety of literature, and offering these children worlds \nunknown.''\n  Founded in 1966, Reading Is Fundamental serves more than 3.5 million \nchildren annually at 17,000 sites in all 50 states, the District of \nColumbia, and U.S. territories. Over two-thirds of the children served \nhave economic or learning needs that put them at risk of failing to \nachieve basic educational goals. By the end of 2000, it will have \nplaced 200 million books in the hands and homes of America's children.\n  The act also authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of Education to \naward grants to organizations that provide low-cost or no-cost books \nfor local tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs. Programs \nsuch as First Book have been very successful in encouraging reading. In \n1998, First Book was able to distribute more than\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\n2.4 million new books to children living below the poverty line \nthroughout the United States. First book originally committed to \ndistribute two million new books to children over 3 years and add 100 \nadditional First Book communities. Through the extraordinary efforts of \nits Local Advisory Boards and national partners, First Book has met and \nfar exceeded its book distribution pledge of 2 million books, and has \nmet its expansion goals. We should continue to support programs like \nFirst Book that involve businesses and community resources in programs \nto help ensure that all children have access to books.\n  The ABC Act also authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of \nEducation to award grants to the organizations that provide free books \nto children under age 5 in pediatric clinics. Programs like Reach Out \nand Read in Boston are shining examples of how to provide children with \naccess to books and prereading skills through health checkups with \ntheir pediatricians.\n  For the past 10 years, through private funding, Reach Out and Read \nhas been helping young children ages 0-5 get the early reading skills \nthey need to become successful readers. Reach Out and Read currently \nserves 930,000 children in 556 local sites in 48 states. Evaluations of \nthe program show that Reach Out and Read increases parents' \nunderstanding of reading and their attitude towards reading--especially \nto their children. Parents are ten times more likely to read to their \nchildren if they have received a book from a pediatrician. Children's \nbrain activity is stimulated by reading, enhancing their intellectual \nand language development. In addition, the program is cost-effective--\non average, the cost is only $5 per child.\n  Holyoke Reach Out and Read is run by Holyoke Pediatric Associates, a \nlarge medical practice serving 30,000 clients from Holyoke and \nsurrounding communities in Massachusetts. Sixty percent of the clients \nare low-income or medicaid eligible families. The program distributed \nover 3,000 books to children in 1999.\n  It may seem unusual to talk about literacy in a hospital, but it \nmakes perfect sense. To see that children learn to read, everyone needs \nto lend a hand. Physicians can be a major part of being of the effort. \nThey can help children and parents understand that reading will enhance \nthe well-being of every child, just as milk and vitamins do. A good \nbook may turn out to be the most important thing a doctor prescribes \nfor a child.\n  Reach Out and Read is making it possible for many more young children \nto have access to books and take the first steps toward learning to \nread and toward becoming good readers in their early years. It is \nbringing books and the love of reading to many new children every day.\n  Reading is the foundation of learning and the golden door to \nopportunity. But for too many children, it becomes a senseless obstacle \nto the future. Children need and deserve programs like Reading Is \nFundamental, First Book, and Reach Out and Read. None of us should rest \nuntil every child across the nation has the opportunity to own a book, \nenjoy a book, and read a book. The nation's future depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   First Book,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of First Book's Board of \n     Directors, national volunteer network, and the children and \n     families we serve, I congratulate you and the other co-\n     sponsors of The Access to Books for Children Act. This \n     legislation will change the lives of millions of low-income \n     children by providing these children with personal libraries \n     of their very own. Yours is a piece of legislation whose time \n     has come.\n       As you know, First Book is a national nonprofit \n     organization with a single mission: to provide an ongoing \n     supply of free, new books to economically disadvantaged \n     children and families participating in community-based \n     tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs nationwide, \n     as well as those children without access to libraries. \n     Through our Local Advisory Board network, First Book \n     effectively promotes the growth and strengthening of local \n     partnerships with the goal of leveraging federal book \n     distribution efforts and building upon the work of existing \n     community programs designed to enhance reading motivation for \n     at-risk children.\n       First Book Local Advisory Boards develop these local \n     partnerships by identifying local resources and securing \n     donations to meet the needs of community-based literacy \n     programs serving low-income children by providing them with \n     access to free books. I look forward to working with the \n     Secretary to support and promote these local programs in \n     order to consistently reach the children who need our help \n     the most.\n       First Book is deeply grateful, Senator Murray, for your \n     continual support of our mission as well as your commitment \n     to the education of all children. Since we began our work \n     together in 1997, First Book Local Advisory Boards in \n     Washington state have distributed more than 250,000 new books \n     to 48,000 children in 250 local programs. I am also proud to \n     announce that there are currently 15 Local Advisory Boards \n     leveraging the power of community-based partnerships in your \n     home state. As you know, First Book is active nationally in \n     hundreds of communities providing millions of new books to \n     hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged children. Because of \n     your efforts, the ABC Act will enable First Book to build \n     upon this great success in Washington state and across the \n     country.\n       I also salute the co-sponsors of the ABC Act. Senators \n     James Jeffords, Edward Kennedy, and Chris Dodd have each \n     strongly supported First Book at both the national and local \n     levels in our constant efforts to reach additional children. \n     Through their own volunteer efforts working with low-income \n     children, Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Dodd have served as \n     inspiring examples in Washington, D.C. and nationally. In the \n     same way, you and your co-sponsors have provided essential \n     leadership to promote the education of children across the \n     country and have also directly supported First Book, most \n     notably through the First Book National Book Bank initiative \n     launched last June on the grounds of the Capital.\n       In closing, I would like to share a quote from a letter I \n     received this morning from an Even Start teacher who \n     incorporates First Book books into home visits in which she \n     teaches low-income parents how to read with their children. \n     ``It has been very rewarding to be able to give the books to \n     the children at the home visits. Before First Book, we took a \n     book to share with the family and then had to take the book \n     away with us. Many times there were screams of protest from \n     young children. [After First Book] we find that the families \n     are thrilled with the books and look forward to receiving \n     them.''\n       Simply put, it shouldn't take ``screams of protest'' from \n     young children to remind us of what we need to do. \n     Thankfully, you and the other co-sponsors are aware of the \n     many challenges facing these young children and you have \n     developed a thoughtful and effective plan to meet their needs \n     and strengthen on-going efforts at the community level. The \n     Access to Books for Children Act will provide millions of new \n     books to low-income children lacking books of their own. I \n     look forward to working with you to bring the magic of book \n     ownership to these many children still waiting for our help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kyle Zimmer,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest to establish an \n     effective, coordinated, and cost-effective means by which \n     records on specific subjects of extraordinary public interest \n     that do not undermine the national security interests of the \n     United States may be collected, retained, reviewed, and \n     disseminated to Congress, policymakers in the executive \n     branch, and the public.\n       (2) Ensuring, through such measures, public access to \n     information that does not require continued protection to \n     maintain the national security interests of the United States \n     is a key to striking the balance between secrecy essential to \n     national security and the openness that is central to the \n     proper functioning of the political institutions of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 603.

DESIGNATION OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN PLACE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) during the second half of the twentieth century, \n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan promoted the importance of \n     architecture and urban planning in the Nation's Capital, \n     particularly with respect to the portion of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue between the White House and the United States Capitol \n     (referred to in this subsection as the ``Avenue'');\n       (2) Senator Moynihan has stressed the unique significance \n     of the Avenue as conceived by Pierre Charles L'Enfant to be \n     the ``grand axis'' of the Nation's Capital as well as a \n     symbolic representation of the separate yet unified branches \n     of the United States Government;\n       (3) through his service to the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal \n     Office Space (1961-1962), as a member of the President's \n     Council on Pennsylvania Avenue (1962-1964), and as vice-\n     chairman of the President's Temporary Commission on \n     Pennsylvania Avenue (1965-1969), and in his various \n     capacities in the executive and legislative branches, Senator \n     Moynihan has consistently and creatively sought to fulfill \n     President Kennedy's recommendation of June 1, 1962, that the \n     Avenue not become a ``solid phalanx of public and private \n     office buildings which close down completely at night and on \n     weekends,'' but that it be ``lively, friendly, and inviting, \n     as well as dignified and impressive'';\n       (4)(A) Senator Moynihan helped draft a Federal \n     architectural policy, known as the ``Guiding Principles for \n     Federal Architecture,'' that recommends a choice of designs \n     that are ``efficient and economical'' and that provide \n     ``visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and \n     stability'' of the United States Government; and\n       (B) the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture further \n     state that the ``development of an official style must be \n     avoided. Design must flow from the architectural profession \n     to the Government, and not vice versa.'';\n       (5) Senator Moynihan has encouraged--\n       (A) the construction of new buildings along the Avenue, \n     such as the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade \n     Center; and\n       (B) the establishment of an academic institution along the \n     Avenue, namely the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \n     Scholars, a living memorial to President Wilson; and\n       (6) as Senator Moynihan's service in the Senate concludes, \n     it is appropriate to commemorate his legacy of public service \n     and his commitment to thoughtful urban design in the Nation's \n     Capital.\n       (b) Designation.--The parcel of land located in the \n     northwest quadrant of Washington, District of Columbia, and \n     described in subsection (c) shall be known and designated as \n     ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan Place''.\n       (c) Boundaries.--The parcel of land described in this \n     subsection is the portion of Woodrow Wilson Plaza (as \n     designated by Public Law 103-284 (108 Stat. 1448)) that is \n     bounded--\n       (1) on the west by the eastern facade of the Ronald Reagan \n     Building and International Trade Center;\n       (2) on the east by the western facade of the Ariel Rios \n     Building;\n       (3) on the north by the southern edge of the sidewalk \n     abutting Pennsylvania Avenue; and\n       (4) on the south by the line that, bisecting the atrium of \n     the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, \n     continues east to bisect the western hemicycle of the Ariel \n     Rios Building.\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\n       (d) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     parcel of land described in subsection (c) shall be deemed to \n     be a reference to Daniel Patrick Moynihan Place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SHELBY AMENDMENT NO. 4285\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Shelby) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2507. \nsupra;

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur in the \namendment of the House, with a further amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4286) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of important \nlegislation to re-authorize the Small Business Innovation and Research \n(SBIR) program and other essential programs at the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA). On Monday, September 25, 2000, the House of \nRepresentatives amended the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2392, the \nSmall Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000, \nby adding the following bills to this legislation: H.R. 2614 (The \nCertified Development Company Program Improvement Act of 2000), H.R. \n2615, (to make improvements to the 7(a) guaranteed business loan \nprogram), H.R. 3843, (the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000), \nand H.R. 3845, (the Small Business Investment Corrections Act of 2000).\n  While the House-passed bill includes many important programs to help \nsmall businesses, there are some serious omissions. Although I strongly \nsupport H.R. 2392 as amended by the House, Senator John Kerry and I are \noffering an amendment in the nature of a substitute to restore some of \nthe most serious omissions to H.R. 2392. Our amendment adds to, but \ndoes not remove, any provisions from the House-passed bill.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 2392 failed to include some very key \nprovisions that are critical to the mission of SBA in Fiscal Year 2001. \nThe House bill did include the Senate-passed bill to improve and extend \nthe SBIR program for eight years, and it did adopt authorization levels \nfor SBA programs included in the Senate version of the Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 2000. However, the House bill failed to include \nmany key provisions that were approved by the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness earlier this year. Our Substitute Amendment will restore some \nof the most important omitted provisions.\n  The following is a list of the program amendments that were excluded \nfrom the House bill that we have included in the Bond-Kerry substitute \namendment: Senator Kerry's Microloan program amendments that make \nextensive improvements in this key small business credit program; re-\nauthorization of the National Women's Business Council, an amendment \nsponsored by Senator Landrieu during the committee markup; a change in \nthe small business size standard system proposed by Senator Feinstein \nthat will help small fresh fruit and vegetable packing houses to \nqualify for Federal disaster relief; comprehensive amendments that I \nsponsored to improve the HUBZone program, which is designed to create \njobs and investments in economically distressed inner cities and rural \ncounties; the Native American Small Business Development Center \nNetwork; and 7(a) guarantee business loan guarantee fee simplification \nplan.\n  The Senate Committee on Small Business has approved the provisions \nbeing added to this legislation. In the case of the SBIR \nReauthorization Act, the full Senate has also passed separate \nlegislation. Most of the provisions included in the Bond-Kerry \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2392 are discussed at length in the \nfollowing committee reports that have been filed in the Senate: Senate \nReport 106-289, Small Business Innovation Research Program \nReauthorization Act of 2000; and Senate Report 106-422, Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 2000.\n  There are two major provisions that were included in S. 3121, the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, which was reported \nfavorably from the Senate Committee on Small Business, but which have \nnot been included in the Bond-Kerry substitute amendment. I have \nwithdrawn the two provisions in order to expedite congressional passage \nand the enactment of this important SBA and SBIR re-authorization \nlegislation. It is my intention to make passage of these provisions a \nhigh priority in the next Congress.\n  Earlier this year, the Committee on Small Business approved an \nimportant provision that would reverse a serious problem caused by the \nSBA in its implementation of the HUBZone Program, which the Congress \nenacted in 1997 as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act. As \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate know, the HUBZone Program directs a \nportion of the Federal contracting dollars into economically distressed \nareas of the country that have been out of the economic mainstream for \nfar too long.\n  HUBZone areas, which include qualified census tracts, rural counties, \nand Indian reservations, often are relatively out-of-the-way places \nthat the stream of commerce often by-passe. They tend to be low-traffic \nareas that do not have a reliable customer base to support business \ndevelopment. As a result, business has been reluctant to move into \nthese areas. It simply has not been profitable absent a customer base \nto keep them operating.\n  The HUBZone Act seeks to overcome this problem by making it possible \nfor the Federal government to become a customer for small businesses \nthat locate in HUBZones. While a small business works to establish its \nregular customer base, a Federal contract can help it stabilize its \nrevenues and its profitability. This program provides small business a \nchance to gain an economic foothold and to provide jobs to these areas. \nNew businesses, more investments and new job opportunities mean new \nlife and new hope for these communities.\n\n  When Congress enacted the HUBZone program in 1997, a lot of people \nwere concerned about how the HUBZone program would interact with the \n8(a) minority enterprise program. We in Congress agreed at that time to \nprotect the 8(a) program by saying the two programs would have parity--\nneither one would have an automatic preference over the other in \ngetting Federal government contracts.\n  Notwithstanding the 1997 Act, SBA has decided to disregard the \ninstructions of the Congress and put 8(a) ahead of HUBZones in every \ncase. Even if the Government is failing to reach its HUBZone goal and \nis meeting its Small Disadvantaged Business goal (of which 8(a) is a \npart), SBA insists that the 8(a) program still has a priority over the \nHUBZone Program.\n  SBA has abandoned the protection Congress included in the 1997 law \nwhen\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\nit enacted the HUBZone Program. Contrary to the law, SBA is setting up \nthe two programs in competition with each other, which is precisely \nwhat Congress sought to prevent. Putting either program in competition \nwith the other is a prescription for one of the programs to fail.\n  SBA's position does real harm to minority communities as well. The \n8(a) program has a role to play in ensuring minority communities own \nassets in the economy. It ensures minority business owners get the \nopportunity to be self-supporting, independent citizens with a full \nstake in our economy. It's important that all Americans have a piece of \nthe economic pie.\n  HUBZones and 8(a) are two prongs of the same fork. They both have a \nvital role to play in ensuring opportunity. That's why it's important \nto correct SBA's current position and to keep the two programs from \ncompeting with each other. The remedial language that I have withdrawn \nfrom the Substitute Amendment would have reversed the SBA position and \nrestore the equal footing Congress established when it created the \nHUBZone program three years ago. I intend to pursue a comprehensive \nremedy to this problem early next year.\n  On November 5, 1999, the Senate approved unanimously S. 1346, a bill \nI introduced to make the SBA Office of Advocacy a stronger, more \neffective advocate for all small businesses throughout the United \nStates. This bill was referred to the House Committee on Small Business \non November 8, 1999, and it has failed since then to take action on \nthis important legislation that has the strong support of almost every \nsegment of the small business community.\n  Consequently, when the Senate Small Business Committee marked up the \nS. 3121, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, it \nincorporated the entire text of S. 1346 as a separate title. It was the \ncommittee's intention that this action might spur the House committee \nto take action on this bill. Unfortunately, the Houses remains adamant \nin its opposition. Both Chairman Jim Talent and Ranking Democrat, Nydia \nVelazquez from the House Small Business Committee have insisted that \nthe title to strengthen SBA's Office of Advocacy be stricken from the \nbill. Therefore, I am withdrawing S. 1346 in order to clear the way for \nswift passage by the Senate and House of Representatives of H.R. 2392 \nwith the Bond/Kerry substitute amendment.\n  Senator Kerry and I have taken some very dramatic steps to insure \nthat the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 is enacted as soon \nas possible. It is critical that the Senate act quickly to adopt the \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2392. Our substitute amendment will have a \npositive impact on nearly every SBA program, from guaranteed business \nloans, to equity investments, to management and technical assistance \nfor small businesses and budding entrepreneurs. Now is not the time to \nturn our backs on the critical role played by small businesses in our \nvibrant economy. We need to enact this comprehensive legislation now so \nthat small businesses and their employees can receive the full benefit \nof these programs.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of this much \nneeded bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the Small \nBusiness Reauthorization Act of 2000 and the managers' amendment that \nthe Senate is considering today. While I applaud the House for their \naction to ensure the continuation of important Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) programs, the managers' amendment offered by \nChairman Bond and myself includes key provisions extending and \nimproving important SBA programs. This bill, with the inclusion of the \nmanagers' amendment, is comprehensive. It reauthorizes all of the SBA's \nprograms, setting the funding levels for the credit and business \ndevelopment programs, and making improvements where needed. Without \nthis legislation, the 504 loan program would shut down; the venture \ncapital debenture program would shut down; and funding to the states \nfor their small business development centers would be in jeopardy. The \nlist goes on. I just can't emphasize enough how important this \nlegislation is.\n  The SBA's contribution is significant. In the past eight years, the \nSBA has helped almost 375,000 small businesses get more than $80 \nbillion in loans. That's double what it has loaned in the preceding 40 \nyears since the agency's creation. The SBA is better run than ever \nbefore, with four straight years of clean financial audits; it has a \nquarter less staff, but makes twice as many loans; and its credit and \nfinance programs are a bargain. For a relatively small investment, \ntaxpayers are leveraging their money to help thousands of small \nbusinesses every year and fuel the economy.\n  Let me just give you one example. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers \nspend $1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well known \nsuccesses like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are clear examples of the \nprogram's effectiveness.\n  Overall, I agree with the program levels in the three-year \nreauthorization bill. As I said during the Small Business Committee's \nhearing on SBA's budget earlier in the year, I believe the program \nlevels are realistic and appropriate based on the growing demand for \nthe programs and the prosperity of the country. I also think they are \nadequate should the economy slow down and lenders have less cash to \ninvest. Consistent with SBA's mission, in good times or bad, we need to \nmake sure that small businesses have access to credit and capital so \nthat our economy benefits from the services, products and jobs they \nprovide. As First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says, we don't want good \nideas dying in the parking lot of banks. We also want a safety net when \nour states are hit hard by a natural disaster. There are many members \nof this Chamber, and their constituents, who know all too well the \nvalue of SBA disaster loans after floods, fires and tornadoes.\n  I will only take a short time to talk about some of important the \nprovisions of this bill and our managers' amendment.\n  I am pleased that we are considering legislation to extend the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) program for 8 more years as part of \nthis comprehensive SBA reauthorization bill. As many of my colleagues \nmay know, this program is set to expire on September 30, along with \nmany other important programs critical to our nation's small \nbusinesses. While I am sorry the process has taken this long, in no way \nshould it imply that there is not strong support for the SBIR program, \nthe Small Business Administration, or our nation's innovative small \nbusinesses.\n  The SBIR program is of vital importance to the high-technology sector \nthroughout the country. For the past decade, growth in the high-\ntechnology field has been a major source of the resurgence of the \nAmerican economy we now enjoy. While many Americans know of the success \nof Microsoft, Oracle, and many of the dot.com companies, few realize \nthat it is America's small businesses that are working in industries \nlike software, hardware, medical research, aerospace technologies, and \nbio-technology that are helping to fuel this resurgence--and that it is \nthe SBIR program that makes much of this possible. By setting aside \nFederal research and development dollars specifically for small high-\ntech businesses, SBIR is making important contributions to our economy.\n  These companies have helped launch the space shuttle; found a vaccine \nfor Hepatitis C; and made B-2 Bomber missions safer and more effective.\n  Since the start of the SBIR program in 1983, more than 17,600 firms \nhave received over $9.8 billion in assistance. In 1999 alone, nearly \n$1.1 billion was awarded to small high-tech firms through the SBIR \nprogram, assisting more than 4,500 firms.\n  The SBIR program has been, and remains, an excellent example of how \ngovernment and small business can work together to advance the cause of \nboth science and our economy. Access to risk capital is vital to the \ngrowth of small high technology companies, which accounted for over 40 \npercent of all jobs in the high technology sector of our economy in \n1998. The SBIR program gives these companies access to Federal research \nand development money and encourages those who do the research to \ncommercialize their results. Because research is crucial to ensuring \nthat our nation is the leader in\n\n[[Page S9641]]\n\nknowledge-based industries, which will generate the largest job growth \nin the next century, the SBIR program is a good investment for the \nfuture.\n  I am proud of the many SBIR successes that have come from my state of \nMassachusetts. Companies like Advanced Magnetics of Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, illustrate that success. Advanced Magnetics used SBIR \nfunding to develop a drug making it easier for hospitals to find tumors \nin patients. The development of this drug increased company sales and \nallowed Advanced Magnetics to hire additional employees. This is \nexactly the kind of economic growth we need in this nation, because \njobs in the high-technology field pay well and raise everyone's \nstandard of living. That is why I am such a strong supporter and \nproponent of the SBIR program and fully support its reauthorization.\n  This legislation also includes H.R. 2614, which reauthorizes SBA's \n504 loan program, which passed the Senate on June 14, 2000. The bill \nand our managers' amendment make common-sense changes to this critical \neconomic development tool. These changes will greatly increase the \nopportunity for small business owners to build a facility, buy more \nequipment, or acquire a new building. In turn, small business owners \nwill be able to expand their companies and hire new workers, ultimately \nresulting in an improved local economy.\n  Since 1980, over 25,000 businesses have received more than $20 \nbillion in fixed-asset financing through the 504 program. In my home \nstate of Massachusetts, over the last decade small businesses have \nreceived $318 million in 504 loans that created more than 10,000 jobs. \nThe stories behind those numbers say a lot about how SBA's 504 loans \nhelp business owners and communities. For instance, in Fall River, \nMassachusetts, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a \ncustom packing plant for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to \n30 employees in just two short years and is in the process of another \nexpansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs.\n  Under this reauthorization bill, the maximum debenture size for \nSection 504 loans has been increased from $750,000 to $1 million. For \nloans that meet special public policy goals, the maximum debenture size \nhas been increased from $1 million to $1.3 million. It has been \na decade since we increased the maximum guarantee amount. If we were to \nchange it to keep pace with inflation, the maximum guarantee would be \napproximately $1.25 million instead of $1 million. Instead of \nimplementing such a sharp increase, we are striking a balance between \nrising costs and increasing the government's exposure and only seeking \nto increase the cap to $1 million.\n\n  I am pleased to say that this legislation also includes a provision \nassisting women-owned businesses, which I first introduced in 1998 as \npart of S. 2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. This \nprovision adds women-owned businesses to the current list of businesses \neligible for the larger public policy loans. As the role of women-owned \nbusinesses in our economy continues to increase, we would be remiss if \nwe did not encourage their growth and success by adding them to this \nlist.\n  The 504 loan program gets results. It expands the opportunities of \nsmall businesses, creates jobs and betters communities. It is crucial \nthat it be reauthorized, and that is what this legislation does.\n  Another important program reauthorized under this legislation and \nstrengthened by the managers' amendment is the Microloan program. I \nhave long been a believer in microloans and their power to help people \ngain economic independence while improving the communities in which \nthey live. This bill authorizes lower levels for the microloan program \nthan the Administration requested. Of course, I would prefer to have \nfull funding because I believe it is important to expand the program so \nthat it is available everywhere. But, compromise is part of the \nlegislative process, and a moderate increase is better than none at \nall. Nevertheless, I will be monitoring usage of microloan technical \nassistance and have told Chairman Bond that the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business should revisit the issue before the end of the three-\nyear reauthorization period if the level authorized is inadequate to \nmeet program needs.\n  In addition to funding, our managers' amendment also makes important \nchanges to the microloan program. We have heard from intermediaries and \neconomic development activists around the country that with some \nadministrative and legislative changes, this program could have a \ngreater impact. This bill takes some important steps in the right \ndirection. Right now we have 156 microlending intermediaries. This bill \nwill permit the program to grow to 250 in FY 2001; to 300 in FY 2002, \nand to 350 in FY 2003. It also increases loan levels and technical \nassistance levels over three years. With more technical assistance, we \nwill be able to increase the number of intermediaries, and therefore \nreach more borrowers in rural areas or large states. I also support the \nprovision to raise the cap on microloans from $25,000 to $35,000, \nmaking it adequate to help micro-entrepreneurs in states and urban \nareas where operating costs are more expensive. Senator Snowe's \nprovision to establish $1 million for peer-to-peer training for \nmicrolenders is also included. I strongly support this concept because \nit will help the program grow while maintaining its high quality and \nlow loss rates.\n  Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) are also reauthorized under \nthis legislation. SBDCs serve tens of thousands of small business \nowners and prospective owners every year. This bill takes a giant step \nto retool the formula that determines how much funding each state \nreceives. This is an important program for all of our states and we \nwant no confusion about its funding. Without this change, some states \nwould have suffered sharp decreases in funding, disproportionate to \ntheir needs. I appreciate and am glad that the SBA and the Association \nof Small Business Development Centers worked with me to develop an \nacceptable formula so that small businesses continue to be adequately \nserved.\n  This legislation also reauthorized the National Women's Business \nCouncil. For such a tiny office, with minimal funding and staff, it has \nmanaged to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the \nimpact of women-owned businesses in our economy. It has also done \npioneer work in raising awareness of business practices that work \nagainst women-owned business, such as some in the area of Federal \nprocurement. Recently, they completed two studies that documented the \nworld of Federal procurement and its impact on women-owned businesses.\n  According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, over \nthe past decade, the number of women-owned businesses in this country \nhas grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms. These firms \ngenerate almost $3.6 trillion in sales annually and employ more than \n27.5 million workers. With the impact of women-owned businesses on our \neconomy increasing at an unprecedented rate, Congress relies on the \nCouncil to serve as its eyes and ears as it anticipates the needs of \nthis burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. Since it was established in \n1988, the bipartisan Council has provided important unbiased advice and \ncounsel to Congress.\n  This Act recognizes the Council's work and reauthorizes it for three \nyears, from FY 2001 to 2003. It also increases the annual appropriation \nfrom $600,000 to $1 million. The increase in funding will allow the \ncouncil to: support new and ongoing research; produce and distribute \nreports and recommendations prepared by the Council; and create an \ninfrastructure to assist states develop women's business advisory \ncouncils, coordinate summits and establish an interstate communication \nnetwork.\n  The Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or ``HUBZone'' program, \nwhich passed this Committee in 1997, has tremendous potential to create \neconomic prosperity and development in those areas of our Nation that \nhave not seen great rewards, even in this time of unprecedented \neconomic health and stability. This program is similar to my New \nMarkets legislation in that it creates an incentive to hire from, and \nperform work in, areas of this country that need assistance the most. \nThis bill would authorize the HUBZone program at $10 million for the \nnext 3 years, which is $5 million above the Administration's request.\n\n[[Page S9642]]\n\n  Additionally, the managers' amendment included very important \nprovisions to include those areas which were inadvertently missed when \nthis legislation was crafted--namely, Indian tribal lands. I appreciate \nthe willingness of the Committee on Indian Affairs to work with our \nCommittee to create HUBZone opportunities in the states of Alaska and \nHawaii, and in other Indian tribal lands.\n  The HUBZone section does not contain any provision addressing the \ninteraction of the HUBZone and 8(a) minority contracting programs. I \nbelieve that the 8(a) program is an important and necessary tool to \nhelp minority small businesses receive access to government contracts. \nThe Chairman and I agree that there is a need to enhance the \nparticipation of both 8(a) and HUBZone companies in Federal \nprocurement. It is my intention that the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness consider the issue of enhancing small business procurement in \nthe next Congress.\n  The Senate managers' amendment also includes a provision relating to \nSBA's cosponsorship authority. This authority allows SBA and its \nprograms to cosponsor events and activities with private sector \nentities, thus leveraging the Agency's limited resources. The managers' \namendment extends the authority for three additional years. This \nprovision also adds ``information and education'' to the types of \nassistance that can be provided to small businesses by public and \nprivate sector organizations working with the SBA. This provision was \nrecommended by the SBA as an effective change to training programs that \nare jointly run by the SBA and partner organizations.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding my colleagues that all of \nour states benefit from the success and abundance of small businesses. \nThis legislation makes their jobs a little easier.
