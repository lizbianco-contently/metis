Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business, with Senators Grams and Durbin in control of the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. Momentarily, I intend to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that provides for debate on two FEC nominations, beginning at \n11:30 a.m., and consuming the remainder of the day. There will also be \ndebate time on several judicial nominations, with any votes ordered \nduring today's session to occur on Wednesday.\n  For the information of all Senators, it is my intention to begin \nconsideration of the legislative branch appropriations bill, as well as \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill, later this week. It is hoped that \nthe Senate can complete action on both of these very important spending \nbills prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n  Now, again, for the information of Senators, we will have this debate \non the nominations throughout the day. Beginning tomorrow, in the \nmorning, I presume, right after the opening activities, we will go to \nthe legislative branch appropriations bill. We hope to be able to \nfinish that in a reasonable period of time. But regardless of that, \nsometime in midafternoon--I presume, 3:30, 4:00, 4:30; we will have to \nlook at the time and work out that exact time--we will begin a series \nof votes that will probably mean votes on either four or five or six--I \nhope it is five or four and not the full six, but we could still have \nas many as six votes in a row Wednesday afternoon. Then we hope to turn \nto the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4241-7", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4241-S4242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 \na.m., Tuesday, May 23, the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider Executive Calendar No. 436, the nomination of Bradley Smith to \nbe a member of the FEC. I further ask consent that debate be limited on \nthe nomination as follows: Senator McConnell, 2 hours; Senator Dodd, or \nhis designee, 2 hours; Senator Wellstone, 2 hours; Senator McCain, 2 \nhours; Senator Feingold, 2 hours.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of \ntime, the nomination be laid aside, with a vote to occur on the \nconfirmation of the nomination during Wednesday's session of the Senate \nat a time to be determined by the two leaders, with 20 minutes for \nclosing remarks, equally divided, just prior to the vote. If we need a \nfew more minutes than that, we will work with the interested parties to \nsee if that can be achieved.\n  I also ask consent that immediately following that vote, the Senate \nproceed\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nto a confirmation vote on the nomination of Danny McDonald, Calendar \nNo. 435.\n  I further ask consent that also on Tuesday, May 23, the Senate then \nproceed to the nomination of Timothy Dyk to be a U.S. circuit judge, \nCalendar No. 291, and the debate be limited to the following: Senator \nSessions, 30 minutes; Senator Hatch, 15 minutes; and Senator Leahy, 15 \nminutes.\n  I further ask consent that on Tuesday, the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 498, the nomination of Gerard Lynch, and there be 40 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, between the opponents and proponents. I also \nask consent that all debate time on the nominations be consumed or \nconsidered yielded back during Tuesday's session of the Senate.\n  I further ask consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the \nDyk nomination third in the voting sequence on Wednesday, to be \nfollowed by votes on Executive Calendar No. 498, No. 519, and No. 520.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following those votes, the \nSenate immediately proceed to the consideration of the following \nnominations on the Executive Calendar:\n  Nos. 206, 334, 424, 433, 434, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, \n445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 452, 453, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, \n462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 472, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, \n481, 482, 483, 496, 497, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 518, \n521, 522, 523, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements \nrelating to the nominations be printed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend the unanimous consent request which stated there \nwould be 20 minutes for closing remarks, equally divided, just prior to \nthe vote. I amend that to say, 20 minutes for closing remarks, equally \ndivided, plus an additional 10 minutes for Senator McCain and 10 \nminutes for Senator Feingold.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say that \nthere are 19 nominations still pending on the calendar if we are able \nto adopt this unanimous consent request today. Some of those \nnominations have been on the calendar for well over a year. I think it \nis the view of virtually every member of the caucus on our side that to \nhold nominations that long is cruel. It is wrong. It should not be \ntolerated. We are in a position to clear all nominations, including \nthose 19.\n  I ask whether the majority leader might be able to clear those as \nwell?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will respond. I know that at least one \nappointment is waiting on a companion appointment from the \nadministration, where you have a Democratic nominee for a commission or \na board, and we usually try to move them together. That is one case. \nThen we have seven IRS members who can be cleared if--I understand \nthere is opposition to at least one of those from the Democratic side.\n  But my goal in working to get this large package done is so we can \ncontinue to work to get companion nominations and move more \nnominations. I discussed this with Senator Daschle yesterday. It is not \neasy, but we hope to continue to work together to get the nominations \nin a position where they can be cleared, or where we have debate time \nand a vote and arrange for that to occur. We will keep working on it. \nIt has been reduced by some 70 or more nominations if this entire \npackage is completed, and if all of them--well, it will either be voted \non and approved or defeated, leaving only 19. So that is a major step \ntoward getting nominations confirmed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, \nobviously, I hope the majority leader will work with us to work through \nthese 19 names. As I say, some of them have put their lives on hold now \nfor over a year. It is just intolerable to them, and it should be \nintolerable to us that we would accept that kind of a practice. I will \nwork with the majority leader and, hopefully, resolve these outstanding \nproblems. I will not object to this request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I simply \nthank both the leaders for their patience in working out this very \ndifficult agreement. I appreciate the majority leader extending us time \nprior to the vote to summarize our arguments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak about Sierra Leone and \nespecially about the attempts I have made to address this issue as \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nState, and the Judiciary.\n  The New York Times and a number of other daily papers have reported \nthat I have limited the ability of the State Department to spend money \non behalf of the United Nations, or send money to the U.N. for the \npurpose of peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, and that is correct. However, \nthe numbers that the New York Times, at least, used were incorrect.\n  I think the record needs to be corrected. I presume this story came \nfrom a momentum within the U.N. to try to put pressure on the Congress \nto spend money on U.N. initiatives. Obviously, the U.N. feels that by \nusing our media sources in this country, they can influence the \nactivity of the Congress, specifically of the Senate. However, I would \nhave hoped that the New York Times reporter would have reviewed the \nactual facts and determined the facts before reporting them as facts. \nObviously, this reporter got his information from somebody, I presume, \nat the U.N., or maybe the State Department, and did not bother to check \nthe facts.\n  It was represented in the story, for example, that the amount of \nmoney that was owed to the U.N. in the area of peacekeeping was \nsomewhere in the vicinity of $1.7 billion. This number is inaccurate \nand the story was, therefore, inaccurate.\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n  Let me review the numbers specifically. In accounting for the amount \nof money that the U.N. is owed, there is a regular budget assessment of \napproximately $300 million. This is included in the $1.7 billion, which \nI presume they got from the U.N., or they could not have gotten to that \nnumber. However, that $300 million is not owed. We paid that money on a \n9-month delay. We have always paid it on a 9-month delay because of the \nbudgeting process of the Federal Government. So you can reduce that \nnumber by the $300 million figure because that money will be paid on \nOctober 1, as it always is.\n  Second, the Times must have been counting as a U.N. assessment the \npeacekeeping moneys of $500 million. Well, the $500 million is the \namount we have allocated for peacekeeping in our budgets for the \nbenefit of the U.N. But that $500 million has not yet been called upon \nby the U.N. In fact, of that $500 million, we have received requests \nfor approximately $300 million. We have not received requests for the \nfull $500 million. We have received requests for about $300 million. We \nhave paid--of that $300 million requested--approximately $55 million. \nThe balance is in issue, but it is being worked out. So that number is \ninaccurate, and you can reduce that $1.7 billion by at least $200 \nmillion that we have not received a request for, and the $55 million we \nhave paid and, in my opinion, by significant other numbers also.\n  Third, the Times must have been counting the $926 million which is an \narrearage payment. The arrearage issue was settled last year. It had \nbeen delayed for 3 years because of the Mexico City language, which did \nnot need to be delayed. But the administration put such a hard line on \nobscure language dealing with Mexico City Planned Parenthood that they \nended up tying up the arrears that we as the Senate were willing to \npay. We appropriated that money every year, by the way. There was an \nagreement reached between ourselves and the State Department and the \nWhite House, known as the Helms-Biden agreement, which said we would \npay that money. So that money is in the pipeline to be paid, subject to \nthe U.N. meeting certain conditions. That is not in issue.\n\n  So when you take all the numbers, there is no $1.7 billion at issue. \nActually, it is closer to $100 million than $1.7 billion. So the \nexaggeration in the story was inaccurate. It reflects, I think, shoddy \njournalism.\n  Secondly, the story implied that my position was basically an \nisolationist position and that I am opposing peacekeeping everywhere in \nthe world.\n  No, I am not. In fact, we have approved peacekeeping in my committee \nin a number of areas. We have approved peacekeeping in the Golan \nHeights for $4 million, Lebanon for $15 million, Cyprus for $3 million, \nGeorgia for over $3 million, in Tajikistan for $2 million, and the \nYugoslavia and Rwanda War Crime Tribunal for $22 million. The list goes \non and on.\n  So we have approved a significant amount of peacekeeping dollars for \na variety of different missions that have been undertaken by the U.N. \nHowever, the problem I have is that in Sierra Leone, what we ended up \ndoing was endorsing a policy that brought into power parties who had \ncommitted rape, murder, and atrocities against the people of Sierra \nLeone. And instead of having these people brought to justice under the \nWar Crimes Tribunal, as they should have been, what we have done is \nendorsed these people in the Lome Accord and said they should be \nbrought into the Government. That policy makes no sense.\n  We are seeing a deterioration of that policy by what is happening to \nthe peacekeepers in Sierra Leone today. Instead of taking weapons from \nthe rebels who are basically killing people arbitrarily and, as part of \nthe policy, hacking limbs off of people--instead of taking their \nweapons, the U.N. has given up more weapons than it has taken in Sierra \nLeone.\n  Right now, we still have actually hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers who \nhave been taken hostage over there. Why? Because the policy being \npursued in Sierra Leone was misdirected from the start. We should not \nhave been making peace. We should not have been bringing into the \nGovernment people who acted in such a barbaric way toward their own \npeople. We should have been taking a harder line. We should have been \nsending in U.N. peacekeepers--in Sierra Leone honoraria we may not want \nto--people who had the capacity and the equipment to defend themselves, \nand had the portfolio and the directions so they could defend \nthemselves and use force.\n  Unfortunately, we didn't send those types of troops in there--or the \nU.N. didn't. America is complicit in this. American taxpayers have to \nask themselves, why are we spending this money? Why would we want to \nspend money to support, encourage, and endorse people who are \nessentially criminals and moving those criminals into the Government of \nSierra Leone and giving them the authority to act? Well, that was my \nreason for putting a hold, as we call it, on this. It was actually a \ndenial of the funds for Sierra Leone.\n  It appears, having said that, I guess, that suddenly people have \nawakened and are saying, hey, maybe that is right. In fact, as of \nyesterday, the State Department changed its position as to the rebel \nleader over there. Instead of him being a conciliatory, positive force \nfor the basis on which they might base the peace accord over there, \nthis person--or people--should be brought before an international \ntribunal when they have committed crimes against humanity, which this \nindividual clearly has. Maybe there is a shift of attitude occurring \nwithin the State Department. I hope there is because that would move us \ndown the road towards resolving this issue. But the representation that \nthe committee I chair, and in which the ranking member, Senator \nHollings, participates in very aggressively, has in some way opposed \npeacekeeping is inaccurate. The numbers used in the article are \ninaccurate. The fact is, we have raised legitimate concerns to protect \nthe taxpayers of this country, which is our job. I believe we are doing \nit effectively.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, time \nuntil 10:05 a.m. is under the control of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I understand Senator \nThomas is to control the time from 10 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. He will not \nbe to the floor right away. I ask unanimous consent to have 15 minutes \nof additional time from Senator Thomas' time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you very much. Mr. President, I have a lot to go \nthrough in a very short period of time. But I wanted to come to the \nfloor this morning to make a few remarks on a vitally important issue \nfacing our Nation, which is how we are going to strengthen and save \nSocial Security.\n  But, first, I would like to commend George W. Bush for bringing \nSocial Security reform to the forefront by proposing to allow workers \nto invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in personal \nretirement accounts. I believe this is the best solution to the fast \napproaching insolvency of Social Security.\n  Governor Bush's vision of courage and leadership is greatly \nappreciated by all of us who are concerned about saving this Nation's \nretirement programs, including the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is in \nthe chair this morning, who has also worked very hard and tirelessly to \nfind a way to save Social Security in the future.\n  In contrast to the efforts by Governor Bush to explore solutions to \nfix our retirement system, his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, offers \nno workable plan and only politicizes the issue. He accuses Governor \nBush of being too willing to take risks with the nation's retirement \nprogram. He also believes that younger workers should not be allowed to \ninvest some of their payroll taxes because they would not be capable of \nmanaging their own investments.\n  Besides the usual scare tactics, Vice President Gore has taken the \nsame approach as President Clinton in dealing with Social Security \nproblems--basically, they refuse to make hard choices and use double \ncounting and other budget gimmicks to mask the threat to Social \nSecurity.\n  Under current law, Social Security will begin running a deficit by \n2015.\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nThe Clinton/Gore proposal would not extend this date by a single year.\n  They simply put more IOUs in the Social Security trust fund which \nwill significantly increase the national debt, and then claim they have \nsaved Social Security.\n  But their numbers simply do not add up. Between 2015 and 2036, the \ngovernment will have to come up with $11.3 trillion from general \nrevenues to make up the annual shortfall in the Social Security system. \nThis is nearly three times the amount the government will save from \npaying down the publicly held debt during that period.\n  Worse still, the Clinton/Gore plan does not trust the American people \nto manage their own money, and they instead propose government \ninvestment of Americans' Social Security surplus--this despite Vice \nPresident Gore's recent denial that their plan called for the \ngovernment to invest payroll taxes in the stock market. ``We didn't \nreally propose it. We talked about the idea,'' he said.\n  Vice President Gore obviously has a short memory. He forgot their \ngovernment investment proposal was included in their budgets for FY \n1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001.\n  I remember that when the Clinton administration first proposed the \ngovernment investment scheme, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan whether we should allow the government to invest the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds in the markets, and whether or not this was the \nright approach. Here are his exact words:\n\n       No, I think it's very dangerous . . . I don't know of any \n     way that you can essentially insulate government decision-\n     makers from having access to what will amount to very large \n     investments in American private industry. . . .\n       I am fearful that we are taking on a position here, at \n     least in conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential \n     danger for a free American economy and a free American \n     society. It is a wholly different phenomenon of having \n     private investment in the market, where individuals own the \n     stock and vote the claims on management (from) having \n     government (doing so).\n       I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from \n     the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. \n     I have been around long enough to realize that that is just \n     not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that \n     breach will be broken.\n\n  Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan was among the first to raise the \nissue of Social Security's unfunded liabilities and warned Congress a \nfew years ago about the consequences if we fail to fix Social Security.\n  Mr. President, we should never venture out onto what Chairman \nGreenspan calls ``a slippery slope of extraordinary magnitude.'' We \nmust move from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded retirement \nsystem, which he supports. This is the only way to save Social \nSecurity.\n  The recently released annual report of the Social Security Trust \nFund's Board of Trustees shows it is even more urgent for us to find a \nsolution to Social Security's approaching insolvency. The report shows \nsome short-term improvement but continued long-term deterioration. The \ninflation-adjusted cumulative deficit between 2015 and 2075 is not \nprojected to be $21.6 trillion, up nearly 7 percent from last year's \nprojection. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the \ndemographic assumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go \nbankrupt much sooner.\n  Clearly, Vice President Gore is just plain wrong about Social \nSecurity, about government investment, and the ability of working \nAmericans to manage their own money. His use of scare tactics dodges \nthe real issue: that we must solve the insolvency problem. Americans' \nretirement should be above politics, and we should have an honest \ndebate on the best way to avoid the fast approaching Social Security \ncrisis, and to ensure retirement security for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, to achieve this goal, we must understand how we got \nhere, what problems we are facing and what options we have to save our \nretirement system. Now, Mr. President, let us take a look back in time \nto see what we can learn and also what I believe is the best plan to \nachieve retirement security.\n  Clearly, Vice President Al Gore is just plain wrong about Social \nSecurity, and I am glad that he and Governor Bush have framed the \ndebate in what we are going to be talking about as far as Social \nSecurity over the next 5 months of a very important campaign and into \nthe 107th Congress.\n  I have been doing a series of town meetings in Minnesota, trying to \noutline the problems that we find with Social Security. Social Security \nhas done the job we have asked it to do over the last 65 years; that \nis, to provide minimum retirement benefits to millions of Americans. \nBut a public Social Security system was even questioned by Franklin \nRoosevelt back in 1935. He thought at one time during part of the \ndebate that we should have included a private retirement account as \npart of the options. He even said when the Social Security program was \ncreated that he wanted the feature of a private sector component to \nbuild retirement income. It was not included. In fact, it was taken out \nin conference after being approved here on this Senate floor with the \npromise that a private investment concept would be brought back the \nnext year to be debated as part of the Social Security program. That \nnever happened. It was one of the first big lies dealing with Social \nSecurity.\n  Why are we having problems today? Social Security is now a system \nbeing stretched to its limits. Seventy-eight million baby boomers will \nbegin retiring in the year 2008. Social Security spending will exceed \ntax revenues by the year 2015. In other words, the surpluses we hear \nabout today will not exist past 2015. In fact, at that time the system \nwill be bringing in less money than the demand will be for those \nbenefits, and the Social Security trust funds would go broke in 2037; \nthat is, if we could turn the IOUs between now and the year 2015 into \ncash and be able to use them to supplement the system. Without it, the \nAmerican taxpayer is going to be asked as early as 2015 to begin paying \nhigher taxes to redeem those IOUs which exist today with the pay-as-\nyou-go system.\n  Why are we in trouble? Why is it being stretched to the limit?\n  In 1940, there were about 100 workers for every person on retirement. \nYou remember the old Ponzi system, the pyramid scheme, where you had a \nlot of people at the bottom and you could support a few at the top. \nThat is the way the system was. It worked then because of the pyramid \nstyle of 100 workers and 1 retiree. Today there are about three workers \nfor every retiree. By the year 2050, there will be about two workers \nfor every retiree.\n  So you can see the strain that we are going to put on the system. But \nwhat is the system? That system is going to be your children, your \ngrandchildren, and your great-grandchildren. They are going to be put \nunder a tremendous financial strain in order to support an outdated \nsystem.\n  As I mentioned, right now we are in a surplus mode. But by the year \n2015, we are going to begin accumulating deficits, and this is going to \ncontinue on a very downward pattern over the next 70 years. This is \nwhat we are going to accumulate. The Government is coming up short with \nmore than a $20 trillion shortfall between the year 2015 and the year \n2070. That means these are the benefits the Government has promised to \npay and this is what we are going to come up with, and we will be short \nof revenues from the current FICA tax or withholding tax in order to \npay these benefits.\n  From where is this $20 trillion-plus going to come? As I said, it \nwill come from paying back the IOUs that have already gone out. It is \nthe American taxpayer who is going to see tax increases of at least \ntwentyfold in order to do this.\n  My plan, which is a totally funded retirement system, is going to \ncost--our estimate--at least $13 trillion, and it is going to take a \nlittle bit shorter curve in over to attain by the year 2050. We need to \nsolve this problem, and we will be in the black in a system that will \npay for itself by the year 2015. But if you look at the current system, \nin the year 2070, it is $20 trillion in debt, and it is heading \ndownhill at an ever increasing rate.\n  I am going through these a little fast because we don't have a lot of \ntime this morning. But I will try to get in all of this information.\n  The biggest risk we have facing Social Security today is doing \nnothing at all.\n  Again, this is the way Vice President Al Gore has framed the debate. \nLet's\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\ndo nothing. Let's just put our arms around this. Let's put a Band-Aid \nover the real problem dealing with Social Security or our retirement \nfuture. Let's put a Band-Aid over it and do nothing, despite the fact \nthere is over $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities.\n  The Social Security trust fund is nothing but IOUs. If this is how \nthe system will remain solvent, I say why not write an IOU to yourself? \nMake it for $1 million; put it in your checking account. How many banks \nwill allow you to write a check? Not one, until you redeem the IOU.\n  To pay promised Social Security benefits, the payroll tax paid today, \nwhich is one-eighth of everything taxpayers make, will have to be \nincreased by at least 50 percent or benefits will have to be reduced. \nWe are leaving our kids and grandchildren a future of paying more for \nretirement, getting less, and they are talking of raising the \nretirement age further. Is that the kind of system we want to leave our \nchildren? I don't think so.\n  Payroll taxes keep rising. Today, in the year 2000, 15.4 percent of \nyour income is deducted in FICA taxes to pay for Social Security and \nMedicare. By the year 2030, that will be about 23 percent, according to \nlow estimates; it will be about 28 percent according to even higher \nprojections. Somewhere in between there is what we are going to see our \nchildren paying in FICA taxes. If they are paying nearly 30 percent in \nFICA taxes, and thrown on top of that is an average of 28-percent \nFederal taxes, we are now up to 48 percent. My home State of Minnesota \nhas an 8\\1/2\\ percent State tax, so now we are 57 percent. Add in your \nsales tax, estate tax, property taxes, and everything, and our children \nare going to be paying taxes that could be in the range of 65 to 70 \npercent of their income. Again, is this the future we want to leave our \nchildren?\n  Diminishing returns of Social Security is another problem. Right now, \nSocial Security is paying less than a 2 percent return. If someone \nretired in 1950 or 1960, they got back all the money paid into Social \nSecurity within 18 months. Today's workers are getting back less than 2 \npercent on their investment. Many of the minority groups in our society \nare now getting a negative return. In other words, they are supporting \nSocial Security with their dollars because they are receiving less \nbecause of life expectancy. For those today under 50 years old, when \nthey retire they will actually receive a zero return or less, a \nnegative return. I don't know how many people will stand in front of a \nwindow to invest their money when they are promising to pay you 2 \npercent and, in the future, less than 0 percent on the investment. I \ndon't think many people want to do that.\n  I compare this with the market return over the last 75 years. The \nmarkets have paid back better than 7 percent real return. This is after \ninflation adjusted. And this is 75 years, including the crash of 1929, \nthe Great Depression and everything else. The markets have been a \nbetter source of revenue than what we can expect from Social Security \nin the future.\n  There is no Social Security account with your name on it. I know a \nlot of people think: I have paid into Social Security all my working \nlife; surely, there has to be an account in Washington in my name.\n  There is not. There is not an account in your name. There is not one \ndollar set aside for your retirement. It is a pay-as-you-go system. All \none can hope is when retiring there are people working yet so we can \ntake money from their check and give it to you as a benefit in \nretirement. The money we collected the first of May will go out in \nbenefits at the end of May. It is a pay-as-you-go system. No \ninvestments, no cash, no accumulation of wealth, no assets--nothing for \nyour retirement, just the hope there will be workers.\n\n  When they talk about solvency and Social Security until 2037, because \nof the IOUs, the President has actually had to put into his budget \ncertain words so he is legally correct in dealing with the IOUs. The \nstatement begins ``These [trust fund]''--and the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Hollings, says there is no ``trust'' and there is no \n``funds'' in trust funds.\n\n       These [trust fund] balances are available to finance future \n     benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only \n     in a bookkeeping sense. They are claims on the Treasury, \n     that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising \n     taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or \n     other expenditures.\n\n  In their own budget, they had to very clearly spell out that the IOUs \nwe are talking about in the Social Security trust fund are nothing but \npaper.\n  The Social Security lockbox is very important. The moneys we are \ntaking in now, the surplus in Social Security, needs to be locked away. \nWe need to save the Social Security trust fund dollars for Social \nSecurity and keep Washington's big spenders from using trust fund \ndollars for other Government functions. I introduced a Grams Social \nSecurity lockbox concept that takes care of this.\n  The Grams lockbox offers a double lock on Social Security. It \ntriggers an automatic reduction in all Government discretionary \nspending, including Congressional Members' pay, if any of the Social \nSecurity surplus is spent, returning it to the Social Security trust \nfund. In other words, in Washington, we are always at ``best guess'' \nestimates. We have an estimate on what our revenues will be, we have a \nbest guess on estimates on what spending will be. My lockbox says we \nhave promised not to take one dime from Social Security. If the \nestimates are off, even if only off a million dollars, all other \nspending would be reduced so Social Security would not pay one dime.\n  Right now, any deficit spending has to come out of the surplus, and \nthat is out of Social Security funds. If we are honest about not taking \na dime out of Social Security, we should do that.\n  My plan, the six principles for saving Social Security, protects \ncurrent and future beneficiaries. Anyone on Social Security today or \nplanning on retiring and staying with this system--that is your \noption--we guarantee protection of future benefits. That is a guarantee \nwe have to make. Seniors today and those who want to retire should not \nbe afraid of allowing their children or grandchildren to have options. \nWe guarantee your benefits today. This is an agreement I believe the \nGovernment has made with you. Taxpayers have said: I will pay into the \nsystem, and I expect a retirement benefit in return. That is the \nagreement. I think we need to make sure that happens.\n  Allow freedom of choice--your kids, your grandchildren to have the \nchance to have a private retirement account.\n  Preserve the safety nets for disability and survivor benefits as the \nsystem today. Make sure that is included.\n  Make Americans better off, not worse. My plan says you cannot retire \nwith less than 150 percent of poverty. That is your income. Today, \nnearly 20 percent of Americans retire into poverty because Social \nSecurity is so low. The majority of those are women. Social Security is \na system that discriminates against women.\n  Create a fully funded system. And no tax increases in the future.\n  The Grams plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act I \nintroduced in September last year, and in the 105th Congress, my staff \nsays, is the third rail of politics. Members cannot talk about \nretirement or Social Security or they will never get reelected. I \nthought it was so important we had to talk about it I said then it \nwould become an important issue of this Presidential campaign. As I \nmentioned earlier, Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore have now \nframed this debate and it will be an important part of the elections in \n2000.\n  Right now, 12.4 percent of workers' income goes into Social Security, \none-eighth of everything they make. My plan says you can take 10 \npercent of your income and put that into a personal retirement account. \nThat would be managed by Government-approved private investment \ncompanies. Safe and sound. We hear the scare tactics; we will invest \nyour money and lose it. Some do better than others. They say you are \ntoo dumb to manage your own money. You don't know how to save for your \nfuture.\n  Our plan says we have faith in you. Under Government-approved \nguidelines as those used in your IRAs and the FDIC account at your \nbanks, provisions are made for safety. These plans are the same. Your \nretirement would be safe, sound, and secure. The only difference is it \nwould accumulate and grow much faster, and taxpayers receive much \nbetter returns than Social Security.\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\n  For those who say: I have paid into Social Security for so long, \nfirst, if your wage is $30,000, under Social Security today, $3,720 is \nput into the Social Security account. Under my plan, $3,000 goes into \nyour account. A passbook shows assets of $3,000 plus interest at the \nend of the first year. The other $720 is part of our financing plan, to \nmake sure there are benefits for those who stay in Social Security. The \n$720 goes into that system. Hopefully, that would be absolved in 20 \nyears and would then be a tax cut. Ten percent of your salary would go \ninto your account to begin to grow assets for you and your family.\n  If you make an average of $36,000 a year, after your lifetime of \nwork, $1,280 a month is your maximum benefit from Social Security. Take \n10 percent, put it into an average return market account, and your \nretirement would be $6,514 a month, a much better return for your \nretirement than the $1,280. These are average returns, nothing \nspectacular, as we have seen in the markets as of late. Based on an \nincome of $36,000--we have heard of everything from taking just 2 \npercent of the 12.4, maybe taking 6 percent or about half of the Social \nSecurity. My plan would put it all into private accounts, and these are \nwhat we could expect as the differences.\n\n  After 20 years at 2 percent, you would only have $33,000 in a \nseparate account. Under our plan, you would have, after 20 years, \n$168,000. But after a lifetime at an average income of $36,000, if you \ncould take 10 percent of your wages and put it into a personal \nretirement account, you would have, not $171,000 but $855,000 cash \nmoney in an account for you and your family for your retirement \nbenefits and part of your estate as well. That is for a single worker.\n  An average family in the United States right now has an income of \nabout $58,500. If we could take these same scenarios, after a lifetime \nof work, under 2 percent, you would set aside an additional $278,000 \nfor your retirement--better than Social Security, granted, because this \nwill be a supplement to that. But if you could put 10 percent away, you \nwould have nearly $1.4 million put away for your retirement--$1.4 \nmillion put away for your retirement. That is after 40 years at 10 \npercent, with an average salary of $58,000 a year: $1.4 million on \nwhich you can retire.\n  We look at Galveston County, TX. When Social Security was implemented \nin 1936, one part of the law said if you were a public worker and had a \nprivate retirement account, you did not have to go into Social \nSecurity. We have something like 5 million Americans who are public \nemployees today who have their own private retirement accounts and are \nnot in Social Security. Galveston County, TX, was one of those. They \njust entered in 1980, by the way, because an administrator found a \nloophole in the law. Of course, that was closed after Galveston County \ngot out.\n  But this is a comparison between Social Security and what Galveston \nCounty pays. They are very conservative, investing only in annuities, \nnot necessarily in the market. This is what they paid:\n  Social Security death benefit? My father passed away at 61 and \nreceived zero from Social Security, except for a $253 death benefit \nafter a lifetime of work, investing in Social Security--$253. In \nGalveston County: A minimum death benefit of $7,500.\n  Disability benefits under Social Security--maximum $1,280; for \nGalveston it is now $2,800 dollars.\n  In retirement benefits per month: Social Security, $1,280 maximum; in \nGalveston, $4,790--much better returns.\n  One lady's husband was 42; she was 44. He passed away suddenly from a \nheart attack. All she could say was, ``Thank God that some wise men \nprivatized Social Security here. If I had had regular Social Security, \nI'd be broke.'' She would have been in poverty with her three children. \nAfter her husband died, Wendy Colehill was able to use her death \nbenefit check of $126,000 to pay for his funeral and enter college. \nUnder Social Security, she would have received $255. So she got a death \nbenefit of $126,000 plus a survivors benefit to which Social Security \nnever would have come close. She said, ``Thank God for Galveston.''\n  In San Diego, a 30-year-old employee who earns a salary of $30,000 \nfor 35 years, contributing--in San Diego they only contribute 6 \npercent, not 12.4--6 percent, so they pay less than half into their \nretirement system than you do--would receive about $3,000 a month in \ntheir retirement compared to $1,077 under Social Security. They pay in \nless than half and get three times more.\n\n  The difference between San Diego's system of PRAs and Social Security \nis more than three times better under their private plan. Even those \nwho oppose PRAs--and there are many in this Senate who say, as Vice \nPresident Gore says, you just cannot handle your own retirement--agree \nthat the system in San Diego is better.\n  This is a letter written from Senators Barbara Boxer, Dianne \nFeinstein, and Ted Kennedy, among others, to President Clinton. Under \nthe President's plan for privatizing any part of Social Security, he \nwanted to take all these employees and bring them into Social Security. \nTake Galveston County, San Diego, take all of them, and they would have \nhad to become part of Social Security. But Senators Boxer, Feinstein, \nand Kennedy, among others, wrote to the President and said:\n\n       Millions of our constituents will receive higher retirement \n     benefits from their current public pensions than they would \n     under Social Security.\n\n  So they said leave San Diego alone.\n  My question is, If Social Security is so much better, why don't the \nresidents of San Diego, or the workers, get to enjoy that? But if \nprivate retirement accounts are better, why don't you and I get to \nenjoy the same thing as these three Senators speak of for San Diego?\n  The United States trails other countries in saving its retirement \nsystem. For nearly 19 years Chile offered PRAs; 95 percent have opted \ninto the system, and their average return last year was 11.3 percent. \nThey have had much higher than that, but last year it averaged 11.3 \npercent. Among other countries that are going to private retirement \naccounts--and I am talking totally private retirement accounts--are \nAustralia, Britain, Switzerland, and there are 11 others. Thirty \ncountries today are considering doing that.\n  We like to think we are ahead of the game on a lot of things here in \nthe United States, which we are in most cases, but when it comes to \nSocial Security, we are behind the curve of what other countries are \ndoing.\n  British workers chose PRAs with 10-percent returns. The question is, \nWho could blame them? Two out of three British workers are now enrolled \nin the second-tier; that is, private parts of their social security \nsystem. They chose to enroll in PRAs. British workers have enjoyed a \n10-percent return on their pension investments over the last 5 years--a \n10-percent return. I said our numbers are based on a conservative 7 \npercent. The pool of PRAs in Britain exceeds nearly $1.4 trillion \ntoday. That is how much they have accumulated in that account. That is \nlarger than the entire economy of Britain, and it is larger than the \nprivate pensions of all other European countries combined. This is what \nthe British workers have set away for their retirement.\n  Say you are 45 year old. You say: I have worked 20 years; I paid into \nthe system; How am I going to let that go?\n  A lot of young people who are 45 say: If you just let me out of the \nsystem, you can keep everything I paid in. But we said, again, it is a \ncontract with the Government.\n  We need to have a recognition bond. This is a sample. But if you have \npaid in $47,000 or $91,000, we should recognize that in a bond--put \nthat into your private account as seed money and pay you interest on \nit, due and payable when you reach the age of 65. If you choose to \nremain within the current system, the Government will guarantee your \nbenefits--again, part of that contract. If you stay with Social \nSecurity, we are going to guarantee your benefits. If you are on \nretirement today, we are going to guarantee those benefits, preserve \nthe safety net so no American will be retiring into poverty.\n\n  Again, the poverty level today is $8,240 a year. That means in the \nUnited States, you would have to retire with at least $12,400 a year. \nThis is again for a single individual. But you would not retire into \npoverty--providing safety and soundness. Again, they say this is risky. \nThis is not risky. We have similar rules that apply to IRAs, and they \nwould apply to the PRAs. A Federal Personal Retirement Investment\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nBoard, an independent agency, will oversee the PRAs. Investment \ncompanies that manage it would have to have an insurance plan to have \nsurvivors benefits, disability benefits, and also a floor that says you \nwould never get less than 2.5 percent of your investment that year. By \nthe way, you choose the company with which you want to put your money. \nIf it is better somewhere else, you can move your money.\n  Chile has 16 companies that do this with a population of under 20 \nmillion people. In our country, we would probably have 100 firms. Just \nlook at the numbers of mutual funds you can choose from today.\n  You also decide when to retire. This is an important part. Under the \ncurrent system, the Government tells you how much you are going to pay \ninto the system; the Government tells you when you are going to retire; \nyou have no choice, and the Government tells you what you are going to \nget as a benefit. They determine everything. You have nothing to say \nabout it. You are being led along like sheep into this system.\n  Ours says when you reach this 150 percent of poverty, if you can buy \nan annuity that will pay you the rest of your life at that, you can \nstop paying into the system. You can retire at that time. I don't care \nif you are 40 years old. Once you have met that requirement, you can \nget out of this system. You will no longer be considered a ward of the \nState; you will have enough to provide for your retirement. Some \nchoices: In divorce cases, PRAs are treated as community property. Upon \ndeath, a PRA benefit will go to the heirs without estate taxes.\n  Think, if you had that $1.4 million in your account when you die--not \nlike my father who got $253, but whatever you had accumulated in your \naccount, up to $1.4 million or more, that would be your money that \nwould go to your heirs without estate taxes, without capital gains. \nWorkers could arrange PRAs for nonworking children. They could put \n$1,000 in their account, and when they reached the age of 65, it would \nbe $250,000.\n\n  There will be no new taxes for this system. Retirement income would \nbe there for everybody, whether you stayed within Social Security or \nchose to build a personal retirement account. In Minnesota, workers can \ndecide when to retire and which options work best for them. With PRA, \naverage returns would be at least three to five times better.\n  This is the system. I hope when we continue these debates, and when \npeople hear these scare tactics, remember, that is all they are, \nrhetoric and scare tactics. We can develop a system that will be safe, \nsound, and will preserve better retirement benefits than we have today.\n  We should have that chance for our children, just as other countries. \nWhen hearing this debate, set aside the rhetoric and scare tactics and \nlook at the numbers. I hope we can continue this debate because this is \na very important part of America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.

Mr. President, it is interesting that Senator Grams and \nSenator Santorum came to the floor to praise Governor Bush's Social \nSecurity plan. I come here to express my deep alarm over this plan and \nto place into the Record the reasons I believe it is very dangerous to \nthe future of this country, to our senior citizens, and to those who \nreally depend on Social Security for themselves or for their aging \nparents.\n  I think the first question to ask is, What is Social Security? Why is \nit called security?\n  I used to be a stockbroker. I can tell you that I have seen the \nsmiles when the market goes up, and I have seen the tears when the \nmarket goes down. At the time I was a broker, there was a very \ntraumatic period in our history. It was the tragic assassination of our \ngreat President John Kennedy. I will never forget, the market was just \ncrashing that day. It went down so much that there was a halt in the \ntrading. Anyone who retired that day, and had an annuity plan, would \nhave been in the deepest trouble.\n  I believe in investments in the stock market. I believe in \ninvestments in the bond market. I think it is very important that we \nlet our people know Social Security is not meant to be your full \nretirement. What it is meant to be--and what it has worked so well as--\nis a basic foundation, a safety net, not guesswork but a basic return \nyou can expect every month with a check you will get which will meet \nyour basic needs.\n  Let me describe it this way: You have a house. It is very modest, but \nit is good. It has a roof. It protects you. It is a place where you can \nbe comfortable, warm. It works for you.\n  Maybe you want to add a room to that house. That is wonderful. That \nis an amenity. That is something additional you could use--a family \nroom, an extra bedroom. But you do not mess with the foundation of the \nhouse. You keep that a solid house--that Social Security. Anyone who \nchallenges this idea is making a huge mistake. I will explain why.\n  You do not have to go that far to look at the ultimate result if we \njust said: People can just have individual accounts and forget Social \nSecurity. Because we know that happened in Texas. I will show you what \nhappened in Texas when three counties left Social Security and went \ninto the market and said to their people: We will allow you to deal \nwith your accounts. This isn't theoretical; it has actually happened in \nTexas. Let me tell you about the Texas example where every single \nfamily lost out.\n  It was the same idea Governor Bush has. He started off talking about \n2 percent of your Social Security being diverted. As I understand it, \nlast week he said he could foresee a time when everybody has private \naccounts--100 percent. We know what happened in this experiment. The \nsource here is the U.S. General Accounting Office, February 1999.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n  They did a study of the Texas experiment. This is what happened. \nThose counties went off Social Security, instead of saying: We will \nhave a supplemental plan, like a 401(k). Keep your Social Security. \nLet's do a supplemental plan.\n  By the way, around here, a lot of us have a supplemental plan. We \nhave our basic Social Security, and then we have what we call thrift \nsavings, which is added on. That is fine. But we do not mess with \nSocial Security.\n  These counties messed with Social Security. They walked away. This is \nwhat happened: The bottom 10 percent of earners, had they stayed in \nSocial Security, would be getting a monthly benefit of $1,125. But in \ntheir retirement plan--where they just said forget Social Security, we \nwill have an individual account--they are getting $542 a month. That is \nutter poverty. If they are in the median, the moderate income, instead \nof getting $1,488 a month from Social Security, they are getting $810 a \nmonth. If they are in the highest income, instead of getting $1,984 a \nmonth, they are getting $1,621 a month.\n\n  So when Senator Santorum and Senator Grams come to the floor--I say \nto my friend from Illinois, they have been lauding the Bush plan--I \nthink we have to note that if you took the Bush plan to its ultimate, \nwhich he in fact said he could foresee, abandoning Social Security for \nindividual accounts, every family lost, regardless of their income \nbracket.\n  I do not want to see this for America's families. I do not want to \nsee it. I ask the next question: What happens if we go this route, and \npeople are living in poverty instead of having a social safety net \nbecause of this? Do you think Congress would turn its back on the \nfamilies of America? You know we would not. What would we do? We would \nsay: Oh, my God, we had better bail them out. We have done it before \nfor the savings and loans. We do not want to see people go destitute.\n  Then you have to ask yourself a question: If George Bush is President \nand he gets this huge tax cut for the wealthy but has used up all the \nmoney for that tax cut, where is he going to find the money to do this \nbailout? Are we going to go back to the days of printing money? We just \nfinally got out of that situation--thank God--where we were running \nthese deficits; we finally got it under control.\n  Let me tell you, this election is a watershed election. This is a \nrisky plan.\n  The women Democratic Senators held a press conference just a few days \nago. We decided to look at what this plan would do to women in our \nNation. We went to the experts and asked them how they felt about it. \nThis is what one of them said. I want to put his credentials into the \nmix. This is John Mueller, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, Inc., a \nformer adviser not to Al Gore, not to Barbara Boxer, not to Dick \nDurbin, but an adviser to Representative Jack Kemp, an adviser to \nRepublican Jack Kemp. This is what John Mueller said:\n\n       . . . the largest group of losers from ``privatizing'' \n     Social Security would be women. This is true for women in all \n     birth-years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of labor-\n     market behavior, and all income levels.\n\n  Why does he say this? We went into this in the press conference we \nwomen Senators held. I want to try to find that clip so I can share \nwith you why it is a fact that women will suffer.\n  First of all, there is no question that private accounts will lead to \nthe reduction of benefits. Why do I say that? I want to make sure \npeople understand that, because when you divert money away from Social \nSecurity into private accounts, what happens? The Social Security fund \ndrops, and we do not have enough money to keep paying those benefits. \nSo benefits would have to be cut. Women live longer, and they count on \nthose benefits, so they would lose more; they would suffer more.\n  Now, here is an irrefutable fact, and the group that analyzed this \nwas the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. With just a 2-percent \nprivatization--in other words, taking 2 percent of your taxes and \nputting it into an individual account--the trust fund will go broke in \nthe year 2023. That may sound like a long way off, but trust me when I \ntell you it is not; 20 years is not a lot of time. I remember back to \n1980, and it doesn't seem that long ago. Twenty years from now, with \nthe 2-percent privatization that George Bush is calling for, assuming \nhe does nothing to cut the benefits--and he won't admit to that--the \ntrust fund goes broke.\n  Right now, without doing anything, the trust fund is solvent until \n2037, so we make this trust fund go broke by many years. That is 14 \nyears sooner that the trust fund is broke. Al Gore has a plan to take \nthe interest payments on the debt he is going to save because he is \nmuch more conservative than George Bush in paying down the private \ndebt, which is the bonds. He is going to absolutely make sure we don't \nhave to keep issuing more bonds and we will pay down that debt. His \nplan keeps the funds solvent until 2050.\n  So let's take a look at the three scenarios. If you do nothing, the \nfund is solvent until 2037. If you follow the Gore plan, the fund is \nsolvent until 2050. If you do the Bush plan and you don't cut benefits \nor raise taxes--which he will not tell us what he is going to do--you \ngo bust in 2023. This is from a conservative. We know if you carry this \nplan to the ultimate extreme and go beyond 2 percent, you essentially \nknow, from looking at what has happened before, people will suffer. You \nset up a real problem and you may have to do an S bailout. That \nis not good.\n  So the women Democratic Members are very clear on all of this. Let me \nsay, in closing--and I know my friend, Senator Durbin, is anxious to \naddress this issue--I think a robust debate over Social Security is \nright on target. I think encouraging people to save and put money into \nthe stock market and have a nest egg there is good because I believe \nthat is a good idea. But don't mess with Social Security. If you want \nto have a supplemental plan, your basic Social Security plus a 401(k), \na thrift savings plan, and IRA, added on to the basic safety net, that \nis just fine. I believe in that. I think it is smart and good. But if \nyou mess with the foundation, you are in a lot of trouble.\n  Senator Schumer was talking about this earlier today. He made the \npoint that he is saving for his kids' college education. He decided he \nneeded to have that money, no ifs, ands, or buts. He took that money \nand put it into the safest Government bond-type of investment because \nhe can't gamble. What happens if on the day he has to start paying \nthose bills the market goes down? We have seen the volatility of these \nmarkets. He says: My kids have to go to college. I am not going to tell \nthem they can't go. So, yes, for other types of savings; it is a good \nidea to invest in markets; but for your basic retirement, don't gamble \nas they did in Texas. Don't gamble as the candidate for President, \nGeorge Bush, wants to do. There are a number of us who are sending a \nletter--and I hope Senator Durbin will describe it--to Governor Bush \nasking him to come clean on the details of his plan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document on solvency printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Privatizing Social Security: A Riverboat Gamble\n\n       Social Security Trust Fund Solvent Until: 2037.\n       With 2% Privatization, Trust Fund Solvent Until: 2023.\n       (Source: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, his plan will take us into the red. \nCombined with his risky tax scheme, he won't be able to bail out the \npeople. So it is a dangerous idea. Stock market investments are good, \nbut not as a foundation of an insurance plan, which is what Social \nSecurity is.\n  You will be hearing a lot more from the women Senators on our side of \nthe aisle on this question because, under the leadership of Senator \nMikulski, we have set up a checklist where we are going to judge every \nplan against this checklist that women should be able to count on. We \nshould be able to count on several things: Preserving the Social \nSecurity guaranteed lifetime inflation and protecting the benefit; \npreserving Social Security protections to workers when they are \ndisabled, as well as when they retire, and for workers, spouses, and \nchildren, and when workers are disabled, retired or die; three, protect \nagainst impoverishment of women by maintaining Social Security's \nprogressive benefit structure;\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\nfour, strengthen the financing of the Social Security system while \nensuring that women and other economically disadvantaged groups are \nprotected to the greatest degree possible.\n  Look at that plan. Does it further reduce poverty among older women? \nI told you that his plan does not. We certainly want to see if it \nincludes retirement savings options. Are these options something that \nwill work for women? That is where we are.\n  I will close by repeating a quote from an expert, John Mueller, a \nformer adviser to Representative Jack Kemp, who said:\n\n       The largest group of losers from ``privatizing'' Social \n     Security would be women. This is true for women in all birth-\n     years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of labor-market \n     behavior, and all income levels.\n\n  If you look at this experiment in Texas, everyone lost--all families, \nwomen, everyone. Let's not go down this path. We can't afford to do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANK AUKOFER\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of 40 years of \noutstanding reporting by my friend, Frank Aukofer, who is retiring from \nthe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel next week. With his retirement, the \nCapitol loses one of its finest journalists and Wisconsin loses one of \nits keenest eyes on Washington. I lose a reporter I admire and trust.\n  Frank is regarded as among the best in his profession, by both his \npeers and by those he covers. He is respected as a straight-shooter, \nvalued for his integrity and admired as an honorable man. As a \njournalist, he has reported on virtually every event of consequence in \nour country over more than three decades. He has an impressive working \nknowledge of Congress, of policy, and of politics. Frank is usually \nthree steps ahead of the story.\n  He is a journalist who didn't lose sight of the responsibilities of \nreporting, a professional who is a credit to his occupation.\n  Frank's love of his profession is evident in his long reach beyond \nthe newspaper. He will be honored later this month by the Freedom \nForum, a foundation dedicated to free press and free speech throughout \nthe world. He is recognized as a national expert on the media, and has \ntestified before Congress to promote access to government information. \nHe was a visiting professor at Vanderbilt University. He was an early \nand strong supporter of the Newseum, our country's premier news museum.\n  Frank is also an active member and former President of the National \nPress Club, and an enthusiastic, if not particularly gifted, performer \nfor the Gridiron Club. Earning the envy of his colleagues and sports \ncar enthusiasts everywhere, Frank has even managed to peddle a \nlegitimate weekly auto column to newspapers around the country.\n  As Frank closes this chapter of his career, I know he looks forward \nto new adventures and more time to spend with his grandkids. Frank has \nmany more years of ideas and ambitions ahead of him. While I am \nsaddened by his departure from the Capitol, I'm convinced that no one \nwill enjoy a busier retirement than Frank Aukofer. I wish him well, I \nwish him continued good health, and I will miss him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Thank you. I come to the floor this morning to talk about \nan issue which is dominating the Presidential race across the United \nStates. It is the issue about the future of Social Security.\n  It is interesting when you ask Americans how important it is. As an \nissue in this Presidential campaign, 71 percent of Americans say it is \nvery important. It is understandable, because, at least since the era \nof the New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt, Social Security has really been \nthere as an insurance policy against the devastating impact of age and \nretirement of people before its creation.\n  There was a time in America before Social Security when, if you were \nlucky enough to have saved some money, or if you were among the \nfortunate few with a pension, retirement was kind of an easy \nexperience. But for the vast majority of Americans who didn't have that \ngood fortune, retirement was a very troubling and dangerous experience.\n  It is no surprise that before Franklin Roosevelt conceived of the \nnotion of creating Social Security, one of the highest ranking groups \nof poor people in America was parents and grandparents who were \nelderly. In his era, President Franklin Roosevelt changed the thinking \nin America to say: we are going to create, basically, a safety net to \nsay to everyone, if you will give the Social Security fund some money \nas you work during the course of your employment, we will put that \naside and guarantee to you that there will be a safety net waiting for \nyou; that you will have a nest egg; that the Federal Government will be \nwatching; and it will be there.\n  Over the years, of course, because of medical science and other \nthings, we have gotten to the point where we live longer and more and \nmore people are taking advantage of Social Security. Over the years, \nthe amount of payroll tax for Social Security went up so you could take \ncare of those senior citizens. But Social Security in America, for 70 \nyears, has been that basic insurance policy.\n  When political leaders of either political party--Democrats or \nRepublicans--start talking about changing Social Security, a lot of \nAmerican families start listening--not only those who are receiving it \nbut many who are near retirement. Certainly, a lot of younger workers \nask very important questions, such as: Will it ever be there when I \nneed it? I think for the last three or four decades in America that \nquestion from younger workers has been very common. It is natural to be \nskeptical--when you are 20 years old or 25 years old--that the money \nyou are putting into the payroll tax for Social Security will ever help \nyou.\n  Yet if you take a look at the record in America, Social Security has \nalways been there. Payments have always been made. We have kept up with \nthe cost-of-living adjustments to try to improve and increase those \npayments over the years. But we have kept our promise. A program \ncreated almost 70 years ago has been an insurance policy for every \nAmerican family.\n  There are warnings, of course, for people: Do not count on Social \nSecurity for a living because it is a very spartan existence. It \ndoesn't provide a lavish lifestyle once you have retired. But you are \nnot going to starve. You are going to have some basic health and \nnecessities of life. Americans have built this into their thinking \nabout their future. What will happen to us at the age of 65? We would \nlike to think we are prepared with savings and retirement, but we \nalways know that we have worked for a sufficient number of quarters for \nour lives so that we will qualify for Social Security.\n  It is interesting. In the year 2000, in this Presidential campaign, \nthere is a brand new debate, and the debate suggests that we ought to \ntake a brand new look at Social Security. On one side, George Bush has \nsuggested we ought to change it rather dramatically; that we ought to \ntake at least 2 percent of the payroll savings taxes that are taken out \nfor Social Security and put that into a private account in which \nindividuals can invest.\n\n  There is some appeal to that because a lot of people say maybe that \nwill be a better idea--maybe I can make more money by investing it \npersonally and directing my investments than if the Federal Government \nbuys a very conservative investment plan with the whole Social Security \ntrust fund. It is not uncommon to think that people across America are \nfeeling good about directing their own future.\n  I say at the outset that--I think I speak for everyone in the Senate, \nboth Democrat and Republican--we believe in encouraging people to save \nfor their future. We believe in giving them options for investment. \nThat is why we have created IRAs and 401(k)s, and all sorts of vehicles \nunder the Tax Code so people can make plans for their future. But \nGeorge Bush raises a more important question, and one that I would like \nto address for a few minutes.\n  What would happen if George Bush had his way? If we took 2 percent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nproceeds going into the Social Security trust fund and said they will \nno longer go into the trust fund but people will be allowed to invest \nthem individually, what impact would that have? Frankly, it could have \na very serious and, I think, a very negative impact.\n  Keep in mind that the money being taken out of the payroll taxes each \nweek in America goes to pay the current benefits of Social Security \nretirees. There is not some huge savings account that is blossoming. \nBut basically we are talking about a pay-as-you-go system. If you take \n2 percent away, you are still going to have the retirees needing their \nSocial Security check. You are going to have to figure out some way to \nplug this gap.\n  If you say that 2 percent of payroll taxes will stop going into the \nSocial Security trust fund, who will make up the difference? How big is \nthat difference? Some estimate that the difference is $1 trillion. If \nyou think about that, you have to ask George Bush and others who \nsupport this: Where is that money coming from? How will we make up the \ndifference if we start saying to people they don't have to put it all \nin the trust fund, keep 2 percent and invest it personally? That $1 \ntrillion transition has to be taken in the context of George Bush's \nother suggestion of a $2 trillion tax cut primarily for the wealthiest \npeople in America.\n  I will concede that we are in good times in America for most \nfamilies. The economy is strong. For the first time in decades, we are \nseeing surpluses in the Federal accounts. You can attribute that to \nleadership in Washington, leadership in business, and leadership in \nfamilies. It has all come together in the last 8 years. America is \nmoving forward. We are in a surplus situation. Who would have thought \nwe would be talking about this on the floor of Congress just a few \nyears after we debated a balanced budget amendment?\n  But many of us believe that even in a surplus situation we should be \ncautious because we are not certain what is going to be around the \nbend. We want to make certain that the decisions we make now about \ninvesting surplus funds makes sense for ourselves, for our children, \nand for our grandchildren.\n  To come up with an idea for taking this surplus and putting it into a \nmassive tax cut for wealthy people or putting it into a Social Security \nchange that could cost us another trillion dollars, in my mind, is not \nfiscally conservative. Yes. That is right--fiscally conservative.\n  The conservative approach being proposed by President Clinton and \nVice President Gore says take the surplus and instead of putting it \ninto something of great risk, such as a tax cut or some privatization \nof Social Security, let us buy down parts of the national debt. The \nnational debt costs taxpayers in America $1 billion a day in interest. \nThat is right. You are paying taxes now--payroll taxes and income \ntaxes--to the tune of $1 billion a day for interest payments on old \ndebt.\n  If you think about it, what is a better gift to our children and \ntheir children than to reduce this debt, and to say to them that we are \ngoing to take care of our mortgage, the one that we were going to leave \nto you, by paying down the national debt? That is Vice President Gore's \nsuggestion. He says, in the Social Security program, pay down the debt \nin the trust funds. Pay down all of the bonds that have accumulated. \nWhen you do it, incidentally, you can extend the life of Social \nSecurity and make it stronger to the year 2050. It is a twofer--\nreducing the national debt and reducing the interest payment on it, and \nat the same time strengthening Social Security. That is the Gore \napproach. It a conservative approach. I will concede that. But I think \nit is the fiscally responsible approach.\n  On the other side, George Bush has said don't worry about paying down \ndebt; Let's talk about a tax cut of $2 trillion for wealthy people, and \nlet's talk about a new Social Security privatization idea that will \ncost at least $1 trillion in transition. That is not conservative, nor \ndo I think it is prudent. I think you can appropriately call it a risky \nidea.\n  I joined with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Senator \nCharles Schumer of New York and my friend and colleague Senator Boxer \nof California in sending a letter to George Bush saying to him: If you \nwant to talk about one of the most important programs to America's \nfamilies, Social Security, and you want to talk about dramatic changes \nin Social Security, then we want you to come forward with an idea about \nwhat this means. What impact will this have on families?\n  We are anxious to receive a reply because, you see, George Bush, in \nthe last few weeks, has gone beyond the 2-percent suggestion--that we \ncan take 2 percent and invest it in the stock market--and now he says \nhe can envision a day when we invest all of our Social Security in the \nstock market.\n  I readily concede that over the last 8 years, during President \nClinton's administration, the stock market has done very well. It \ndoesn't from day-to-day for those who follow it, but over the long term \nit has. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 3,000 back in 1993 is now \nup to 10,000. That suggests a lot of wealth has been created in \nAmerica. Those that were smart enough, and could, invested in the stock \nmarket and have seen their savings grow.\n  It is naive to believe this will go on indefinitely. We have \ncertainly seen in the last 6 months the roller coaster of the NASDAQ \nand the roller coaster of the New York Stock Exchange, to suggest there \nhave been good days and bad days. To take your life savings, or take 2 \npercent of your payroll tax and Social Security, and put it in the \nstock exchange, you understand there are risks. I think most Americans \nappreciate that fact.\n  As I said earlier, for those who want to invest their savings, that \nis their business. When it comes to Social Security, we have always \nsaid this is a part of our system that should be protected. If we go \nforward with George Bush's plan to privatize Social Security, it would \ntruly give to individuals some power to invest. However, it also raises \nquestions about the future of this Social Security system. Where will \nwe come up with the $1 trillion in transition payments?\n  There are only so many ways to achieve that: We can tax Social \nSecurity to come up with more revenue; we can reduce benefits, for \nthose who are currently receiving Social Security; or we can raise the \nretirement age under Social Security.\n  Frankly, I reject all three of those. I don't think America's \nfamilies who are looking forward to enjoying their retirement years and \ncounting on Social Security will sign up for George Bush's deal when \nthey understand it could jeopardize Social Security as we know it and \nas we count on it. That is truly one of the serious problems we face.\n  Second, if we accept the George Bush approach on privatizing Social \nSecurity, we don't have the money that Vice President Gore wants to \ninvest in paying off the national debt and paying off the debt of the \nSocial Security trust fund. So we leave that interest payment out there \nfor future generations. We don't stabilize Social Security. We don't \ngive it a longer life.\n  A point made earlier by my colleague from the State of California, \nSenator Boxer: What if George Bush guesses wrong? What if people invest \nsome part of their Social Security into the stock market and the market \ngoes down and they are losing money? What will the response be of the \nelected officials across this country? We don't know because we have \nnever faced it.\n  History tells us it is likely that Democrats and Republicans will \nsay: Wait a minute; we cannot let a sizable number of Americans fail. \nPeople cannot be in a position where they don't have enough money to \nlive on in retirement.\n  We are then likely, on a political basis, to ride to the rescue. \nAnyone remember not too long ago we did that with the savings and loan \nbailout? Too many institutions had lost money across America, and a lot \nof people lost their savings accounts. We bailed out the savings and \nloans. I didn't like voting for that, but I didn't see any alternative. \nThe economy was at stake and we did it.\n  I happen to believe if the Bush privatization scheme goes through and \nit doesn't work, this Congress will be called on to come up with the \nmoney to bail out the families who guessed wrong in the stock market. \nThink about where this leads. From the dark days of deep red ink and \ndeficits, we are now in a surplus. George Bush is saying let's try \nsomething that is a little new and a little innovative and\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nhasn't been tried. He is suggesting changes which could jeopardize the \nstrength of this economy, the strength of our recovery, and what we \nenvision as a strong American economy for decades to come. He is taking \nwhat I consider to be a leap of faith that some scheme which someone \nhas come up with will work.\n  Vice President Gore is urging a more conservative approach: Put the \nsurplus into bringing down the substantial debt, into strengthening the \nSocial Security trust fund; put the surplus into making certain that \nMedicare is there for years to come; reduce the national debt so our \nchildren and their children don't continue to pay $1 billion in \ninterest a day on old debt that we have accumulated.\n  That is the fundamental choice. It is not a question of whether \npeople should have the right to invest their savings in the stock \nmarket--that is their right in America; 50 percent of families are \ndoing that now. Our family is one of them--but whether or not you take \nthe Social Security system, and after 70 years, turn it upside down and \nsay we are now going to make this a much different system.\n  In the words of George Bush: We will privatize Social Security. I \nthink there is a great amount of risk to that. I can understand the \nskepticism of a lot of American families about this proposal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a couple of questions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. Once again, he has explained quite \nclearly what the risks are to this Bush plan.\n  I was reading some of the quotes that appeared in the press \nsurrounding the Bush plan. I ask my colleague to comment on some of \nthem.\n  Bush's top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, acknowledged somewhat \nsheepishly he bailed out of the market years ago. He said: That was \nbecause of my personal situation. I don't take risks. I hate losing \nmoney.\n  That was from the Philadelphia Inquirer: I don't take risks; I hate \nlosing money.\n  I think that reflects certain people are more conservative. Others \nare willing to take a risk.\n  The point my colleague and I have tried to make is that we think it \nis fine if you want to take a risk with certain accounts you have, but \nyou don't want to risk the foundation of your retirement, the safety \nnet of your retirement. You want to count on that.\n  Bush's top economic adviser is saying he hates losing money, and yet \nthe person he advises is essentially putting money at risk for other \npeople.\n  I want to mention something else. The word ``privatization'' is a \ngood word. I like it. It is similar to the word ``deregulation.'' It is \na nice word. Everybody likes ``privatization.'' It is a nice word that \nindicates individual control. Of course, much of what we do in our life \nis privatization. We have our own accounts, whether they are savings \naccounts, or we own bonds, and we direct them. However, Social Security \nis a little bit different. It is the foundation.\n  The Houston Chronicle reported that Bush said on Tuesday, his plan to \ncreate private savings accounts could be the first step toward a \ncomplete privatization of Social Security. That would be the end of a \nprogram that has worked for 70 years. There is more at stake than a 2-\npercent diversion of funds.\n  Finally, the New York Times reports, when answering the question \nabout his plan, Mr. Bush said the Government could not go from one \nregime to another overnight. It is going to take a while to transition \nto a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of \nthe investment vehicle. When he is asked by the Dallas Morning News, \nwould beneficiaries receive less money, he says: Maybe; maybe not.\n  I ask my friend for his comments on the volatility of the stock \nmarket expressed by Bush's own top economic adviser, the fact that this \ncould be the first step toward the end of Social Security, and the fact \nthat George Bush cannot answer today whether anyone would have to take \na cut in your benefits.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. Quoting George Bush \non this issue tells me more than anything else that he has not thought \nthis through. In the 18 years I have served on Capitol Hill, when the \nissue of Social Security has come up, I have had a tendency to step \nback and wait. I want to hear both sides.\n  This is complicated. We are literally talking about a Social Security \nsystem that benefits tens of millions of Americans today and that many \nmore Americans are counting on for the future. When people start \ntalking about change in Social Security, I am very cautious. I think \nthe people of Illinois who have sent me here expect me to be cautious.\n  I recall when the Senator from California and I were serving in the \nHouse of Representatives many years ago when there was a debate on the \nfloor about the so-called ``pickled-pepper'' amendment. Jake Pickle of \nTexas and Claude Pepper of Florida had a fight over the future of \nSocial Security and whether to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. \nI voted against that. I really think the retirement age is an important \nmilestone in people's lives, particularly if they have jobs involving \nmanual labor and physical work. So when people start talking about \nchanging Social Security--``We will change a little bit here and a \nlittle bit there''--I am very skeptical because I don't want to see us \nput in a position where someone's great campaign promise in the year \n2000 means someone trying to retire in just a few years from now finds \nout that the window is closed at Social Security:\n  ``No, you have to wait a few more years.''\n  ``Why?''\n  ``We wanted to try a new approach to Social Security.''\n  The Senator from California is right. When George Bush says--and this \nis a quote from the Houston Chronicle--``creating private savings \naccounts in Social Security could be the first step toward a complete \nprivatization of Social Security,'' that is a frightening idea. Let me \nexplain to you why.\n  If we ever privatize Social Security, we will still have millions of \nAmericans who worked their whole lives, paid their taxes, obeyed the \nlaws, and counted on Social Security, who need to receive their \nbenefits. If you are going to have that requirement out there, you have \nto figure out a way to keep Social Security moving while George Bush \ncreates a brand new system, his new idea, whatever it is. That is a \nmassive investment. When we talk about keeping America's economy moving \nforward, not increasing our deficit, creating more surpluses, keeping \njob creation online and businesses thriving, I think this is a risky \nventure by George Bush when it comes to Social Security.\n  Frankly, I think the American people should ask of George Bush what \nseveral Members of the Senate have asked: Sit down and explain this to \nus; put it on paper. Before you start messing with Social Security, \nexplain to us what you have in mind because a lot of us--a lot of \nfamilies across America--are counting on this system.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield further, I understand Senator \nGrams came down and quoted me as saying I like the idea of people \ninvesting in the market. I do. But not taking it away from the \nfoundation of Social Security. Social Security is that foundation. As \nmy friend pointed out, this is really serious.\n  Since Governor Bush is now saying he envisions the day when we don't \nhave any more Social Security, when it would all be private accounts--\nthat is not Social Security. He is right to point out: What happens to \nthose of us who have worked our 40 quarters? There would be nothing \ngoing into the Social Security fund to pay those benefits. What does \nthat mean? We are not going to let those people go poor; everyone knows \nthat. The pressure will be on us. We will bail out the system.\n  If you take it a step further and look at his $2 trillion tax cut, \nwhere is he going to get the money? He will print it. We will go back \nto those days his father oversaw, with $300 billion deficits which \nadded to the national debt. As my friend well knows, we had more debt \nin the Reagan-Bush years than we had from George Washington to Ronald \nReagan.\n  We do not want to go back to those days. We don't want to go back to \nthose days when our President had to go visit another country to find \nout how to run the economy. Those were\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nbad days for this Nation--bad, bad days. It took us a long time to get \nout of it. A lot of people lost their seats around here because they \nhad the courage to vote to balance this budget. It did not take courage \nto vote for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It did \ntake courage, however, to vote to actually balance the budget. It meant \nsome tough stuff.\n  I want to ask my friend, we have a colleague on this side of the \naisle who says: Yes, we ought to go into privatizing Social Security. \nBut he is one of the most courageous and straightforward colleagues, \nSenator Bob Kerrey. What does he say about it? He says if you are going \nto go that route, this is what you have to do: Raise the retirement \nage.\n  My friend has already pointed out we have raised it to 67 over time. \nWhat is it going to be, 75? People will die long before they get their \nchecks or they will be too old to really appreciate it. We don't want \nto see that happen, raising the retirement age after people worked so \nhard, and then make them work longer, or raise taxes on the Social \nSecurity that you get, or on your interest from these personal \naccounts. Raise taxes, raise their retirement age, lower benefits--you \nhave to do a combination of those things.\n  I have to say, there are a lot of things we do around here that are \nnot very good. But would my friend not agree we have a good system here \nthat has lasted through time--70 years, as he points out? It is a basic \nretirement, a basic safety net.\n  One last point I would make for my friend to comment on. Around here \nwe are like everybody else; we want to make sure we can take care of \nour families. I think what we do around here is a good system. We have \nhad Social Security since the 1980s. We decided to make sure we paid \nin. We have Social Security retirement as our basic foundation, and \nthen, if we want, we can add a thrift savings plan. So, yes, we can \npick out investing in the market--or, by the way, Government bonds, or \ncorporate bonds--in addition to our Social Security.\n  That will be my last question to my friend. We know it is good to not \nput all your eggs in one basket, but we also think it is important to \nhave a basic account, No. 1; No. 2, don't go back to the bad old days \nof these yearly deficits that were dragging our economy down. Yes, you \nwant to add something to sweeten your retirement pie, take a little \nrisk with it. We know some people who have taken some risks and didn't \ndo too well; others have done very well. That is fine. Don't mess with \nthe foundation of the house. If you want to add a room, fix it up. That \nis great. But don't mess with the foundation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend, the Senator from California.\n  It is interesting in this debate how the roles have been switched. It \nused to be not that long ago the Democrats were faulted for being \nfiscally irresponsible, too liberal when it came to tax and spend. In \nthis debate over the future of Social Security, the fiscally \nconservative and, I think, from my point of view, the prudent approach \nis being pushed on the Democratic side. That is, make certain before we \ntake the surplus economy for granted, and make certain before we talk \nabout any changes for Social Security, that we have thought them \nthrough.\n  Here we are in the middle of the Presidential campaign, with George \nBush, the Republican candidate, suggesting sweeping changes in Social \nSecurity, changes which could literally affect millions of American \nfamilies.\n  The concept that we would somehow privatize Social Security would \nhave been laughable not that many years ago. Now it is being said with \na straight face during the course of this Presidential campaign. \nUnfortunately, the candidate, George Bush, who is making these \nstatements, refuses to come forward and explain how he would achieve \nit.\n  I think it is natural for those of us on the other side, those \nsupporting Vice President Gore, to ask of him to be specific. If you \nare going to start talking about Social Security, start telling us in \nspecific terms how you are going to change it and what it is going to \ncost us.\n  I think the plan on the other side, from Vice President Gore, is a \nconservative, sensible approach that does not assume this economic boom \nwhich we have seen over the last 8 or 9 years will continue \nindefinitely. What Vice President Gore has said is take the surplus we \nhave coming into the Federal Government and invest it back to pay off \nthe debt of our Nation.\n  We in Illinois, I think, represent kind of a microcosm. I represent a \nmicrocosm of this Nation--rural, urban, liberal, conservative, and you \nname it--across our great State. When I go back and talk to business \nleaders about what to do with our surplus, they universally agree with \nVice President Gore's position: Be prudent, be sensible, take the \nsurplus and invest it in such a way so if 6 months from now we are in a \nrecession or a downturn, we will not regret decisions we have made.\n  Take a look at what has happened to us in just a short period of \ntime. Because we have had fiscal discipline for the last several years, \nthe Nation's debt is already $1.7 trillion lower than it would have \nbeen. In other words, if we had not made this decision a few years ago \nto balance the budget and to make certain that Social Security trust \nfunds were not spent for other reasons, we could be $1.7 trillion \ndeeper in debt, meaning we would have bondholders in the United States \nand around the world asking every month for their interest payment and \nbeing paid with taxes coming out of families, businesses, and \nindividuals across America.\n  We are on the right track. I think we in Washington got the message. \nUnder the Clinton-Gore administration, we have started bringing down \nthis debt and the economy has flourished for most people. There are \nexceptions: In the farm belt, exceptions in the inner city, exceptions \nin small towns. But by and large, most people believe America is moving \nin the right direction.\n  Along comes a Presidential campaign. Really, this is a referendum on \nour future. I am not going to question the motives of George Bush on \nthe Republican side, and I hope he would not question the motives of \nVice President Gore.\n  The American people basically have a crucial choice this November. In \na time of prosperity, what should America's future look like? What \nshould we be doing for the young people across America to say to them: \nWe want to create at least as good an opportunity for you as we have \nhad in this country.\n  Frankly, the Democratic approach, Vice President Gore's approach, is \nthe sensible one. It basically says: Don't assume prosperity forever; \npay down the debt so we don't have to collect more in taxes to pay \ninterest on this debt. Reduce the debt of the Social Security program \nso that it will be stronger for a long period of time.\n  In fact, under Vice President Gore's proposal, for another 50 years, \nit will be solvent, so we can even say to those who are just getting \ntheir driver's license this year: Social Security is going to be there \nwhen you show up at the window 50 years from now. That is a good thing \nto say to the future of America.\n  Also, we are saying when it comes to Medicare--this is a program \noften overlooked by this Congress; it is not overlooked by tens of \nmillions of elderly and disabled who count on Medicare for their health \ninsurance--we believe we should take part of this surplus and invest it \nin Medicare as well to make sure it is stronger and is affordable. This \nis the Gore approach.\n  The other side is a much different view of our future. What George \nBush has proposed for America's future is let's try something new and \nuntried. First, let's talk about a $2 billion tax cut, and it is a tax \ncut that is not targeted to families who need it. It is a tax cut that, \nfrankly, goes to a lot of people who are already wealthy.\n  I am joined on the floor by my colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer. Senator Schumer has a proposal most American families would \napplaud. He has suggested targeting the tax cuts where they are really \nneeded. One of Senator Schumer's proposals is to allow families to \ndeduct up to $10,000 a year in college expenses for their children. \nThat means about $2,800 in the bank for a lot of families to help pay \ncollege education expenses. That is a smart investment. That is a \ntargeted tax cut that does not go to the wealthiest in America but \nprepares the next generation of Americans to compete in a global \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n  This election is coming down to: Do you want the Bush tax cut for \nprimarily wealthy people, and do you want to target the tax cuts and \ninvest in paying down the debt? Do you want to keep Social Security \nstrong for decades to come, or try a privatization approach which \nGovernor Bush proposes which has never been tested and will cost us a \ntrillion dollars and runs the risk of more red ink, more deficits, and \nproblems in the future?\n  We are taking the Gore and Democratic side, fiscally prudent approach \nwhich says: Let's look to the future in real uncertain terms.\n  I know we only have until 11:30 for morning business.

Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have \nbeen killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read \nsome of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the \npast year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in \nsession.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following \nare the names of some people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago \ntoday. Before I read the names, these are names, just letters in black \nand white, but every one represents a life living and breathing, loving \nand was loved.

Mr. President, I once again bring the attention of the \nSenate to the importance of completing action on an issue that is of \nfundamental importance to families all across this country, and that is \nthe role of the Congress in addressing the elementary and secondary \neducation challenge which exists across our Nation in which local \ncommunities and States are taking action and in which the Federal \nGovernment is also a partner.\n  We have had a total of 6 days debate. Of the 6 days, 2 were debate \nonly. We were not permitted to have votes on 2 of those 6 days, so we \nhad 4 days of debate and votes. We had a total of 8 amendments. One was \na voice amendment. There were 7 rollcalls. Of the 7 rollcalls, 2 of \nthose rollcalls were on amendments we had indicated we were prepared to \naccept. Essentially, we have had 4 days of debate and 5 votes on this \nlegislation.\n  This is what our good Republican friends have indicated to us about \nthe priority of education.\n  In January 6, we have our majority leader saying:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. For \n     starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act. That is important.\n\n  These are his remarks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors luncheon on \nJanuary 29:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to be just words.\n\n  On June 22, he said:\n\n       Education is No. 1 on the agenda of Republicans in the \n     Congress this year.\n\n  In remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on February 1, 2000, he \nsaid:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I have been majority leader, and \n     Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  On February 3, in a speech to the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, he said:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. Education will be a high priority in this Congress.\n\n  Congress Daily, on April 20, said this:\n\n       Lott said last week that his top priorities in May include \n     an agriculture sanctions bill, ESEA reauthorization, and \n     passage of four appropriations bills.\n\n  May 1:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  On May 2, I asked Senator Lott:\n\n       On ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? Senator \n     Lott said:\n       No, I have not. . . . But education is No. 1 in the minds \n     of the American people all across the country, in every \n     State, including my own State. For us to have a good, \n     healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on \n     education I think is the way to go.\n\n  On May 9, at the time when the legislation was pulled down, I asked \nthe majority leader:\n\n       As I understand, we will have an opportunity to come back \n     to ESEA next week. Is that the leader's plan?\n\n  He said:\n\n       That is my hope and intent.\n\n  We are about to go out for a period of 10 days. We are reaching the \nend of May. We have no end in sight for the completion of legislation \ndealing with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have been \nprepared to enter into short time agreements on the various proposals. \nI don't know of a single amendment on this side on which we could not \nenter into a time agreement of 1 hour equally divided. We put that \nforward and we have outlined in detail the various education amendments \nthat we had intended to offer. But we are not getting focus, attention, \nand priority on this legislation.\n  I don't believe the American people want us to stonewall on the issue \nof education. I don't think they want the Senate gagged from having a \nfull debate, discussion and action. We have had other legislation, such \nas the bankruptcy bill, that went for 15 or 16 days of debate before \ncompletion. We can take the time that is necessary and also complete \nthe work on the appropriations bills. But we are serious about bringing \nthis matter to the floor. We are going to raise it continuously. We \nwant to take action. We think families across this country know \nappropriations are important, but those appropriations are not going to \nactually be expended until the fall. Families want to know, as we go on \ninto this year, what we are going to do on education and education \npolicy. We owe it\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nto the families, and we have every intention of pursuing it on this \nside of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4254-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4254-S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTERNET PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night, the FTC released its report on \nInternet privacy. We are, all of us, in the midst of an Internet \nrevolution in this country. It is extraordinary, when we think about \nit, to take note of the fact that the Internet has only been in \nexistence about 6 or 7 years now. During that time, it has had a \nprofound impact on everybody's life, particularly on business, and \nincreasingly on consumer opportunity.\n  I have tremendous respect for the work the FTC has done on this \nissue. Its monitoring of web sites and the convening of working groups \nhave been very helpful in educating all of us on a very complicated new \narena. The FTC plays an important role in oversight and regulating our \neconomy, and I think it is fair to say that its Commissioners have \nnavigated admirably through the complexity of the new economy.\n  But--and here is the ``but,'' Mr. President--at this particular \nmoment in time, I very respectfully disagree with the regulatory \napproach to Internet privacy proposed by the FTC. Let me be clear. Yes, \nconsumers have a legitimate expectation of privacy on the Internet, and \nthey will demand it, and I personally want that right of privacy \nprotected. But I also believe that they want an Internet that is free \nand that gives them more choices rather than fewer. I believe that a \nregulatory approach mandated by in-depth, detailed congressional \nlegislation at this particular point in time could actually harm \nconsumers in the long run by limiting their choices on the Internet.\n  On the Internet today, we can buy and sell anything. We can research \neverything from health information to sports scores to movie reviews. \nWe can keep track of our stock portfolios, tomorrow's weather, and the \nnews throughout the world. And we do most of that free of charge. The \nreason we can surf from page to page for free is because the Internet, \nlike television, is supported by advertising--or is struggling to be \nsupported by advertising. Obviously, access is by subscription in most \ncases; but the point is that advertising is increasingly growing. \nBusiness spent more than $1.9 billion to advertise on the web in 1998, \nwith spending on electronic advertising expected to climb to $6.7 \nbillion by 2001.\n  It is this advertising that is the reason we don't have a \nsubscription-based Internet--at least at this point in time. That would \nclearly limit a lot of people's online activities, and it would \ncontribute to the so-called digital divide. Instead, we have an \nInternet that we can freely explore. It is my sense that people like \nthis model of the Internet, and they understand that the banner ads \nthey see on their screens are necessary in order to try to keep the \nInternet free.\n  What I don't think people understand is that, at least for now, the \nmodel for Internet advertising is going to include ads that are \nnarrowly targeted to particular customers. The jury is still out on \nwhether a targeted model is going to work. Currently, the click-through \nrates--the average percentage of web surfers who click on any single \nbanner ad have fallen below the 1-percent mark, compared with about 2 \npercent in 1998. Some see that as a sign that the advertising model on \nthe Internet has failed. Others say the percentages are lower, but that \nis because more and more ads are being placed. What it tells me is that \nit is simply too soon for the Congress of the United States to step in \nand prevent that model from running its course. If, for the time being, \nwe allow or acknowledge that the economy of the Internet calls for \ntargeted advertising, we must also recognize that it won't attract \ncustomers if they believe their privacy is being violated.\n  Finding the fine balance of permitting enough free flow of \ninformation to allow ads to work and protecting consumers' privacy is \ngoing to be critical if the Internet is going to reach its full \npotential. I believe that we in Congress have a role to play in finding \nthat balance, although we should tread very lightly in doing so.\n  In the past, I have argued that self-regulation was the best answer \nfor consumers and the high-tech industry itself in relation to privacy. \nI hope we can continue to focus on self-regulation because Congress \nwill, frankly, never be light-footed enough--nor fast-footed enough--to \nkeep up with the technological changes that are taking place in the \nonline world.\n  However, poll after poll shows that consumers are anxious that their \nprivacy is not being protected when they go on line.\n  For example, a 1999 survey by the National Consumers League found 73 \npercent of online users are not comfortable providing credit card or \nfinancial information online and 70 percent are uncomfortable giving \nout personal information to businesses online. Moreover, due to privacy \nconcerns, 42 percent of those who use the Internet are using it solely \nto gather information rather than to make purchases online.\n  Likewise, a Business Week survey in March 2000 noted that concern \nover privacy on the Internet is rising. A clear majority--57 percent--\nfavor some sort of law regulating how personal information is collected \nand used. According to Business Week, regulation may become essential \nto the continued growth of e-commerce, since 41 percent of online \nshoppers say they are very concerned over the use of personal \ninformation, up from 31 percent two year ago. Perhaps more telling, \namong people who go online but have not shopped there, 63 percent are \nvery concerned, up from 52 percent two years ago.\n  In addition to it being too early in the process for Congress to \nembark on sweeping legislation, I believe there are still a number of \nfundamental questions that we need to answer. The first is whether \nthere is a difference between privacy in the offline and online worlds.\n  I think polls like that are the result of the failure, so far, of \nindustry to take the necessary initiative to protect consumers' \nprivacy. But we should not neglect to notice that industry is making \nprogress. When the Federal Trade Commission testified before the \nCommerce Committee about this time last year, it cited studies showing \nthat roughly two-thirds of some of the busiest Web sites had some form \nof disclosure of privacy policies. This year, the FTC reports that 90 \npercent of sites have disclosure policies. Likewise, last year the FTC \nfound that only 10 percent of sites implemented the four core privacy \nprinciples of notice, choice, access and security. This year the FTC \nreports that figure at 20 percent. That is still not high enough, but \nthis is a five-year-old industry. We've seen significant improvements \nwithout the need for intrusive congressional intervention. It is simply \ntoo soon to write off a market driven approach to privacy.\n  Most of us don't think about it. But I want to make a point about the \ndistinction between the offline and online world. When you go to the \nsupermarket and you walk into any store and swish your card through the \ncheckout scanner, that scanner has a record of precisely what you \nbought. In effect, today in the offline world, people are getting \nextraordinarily detailed information about what you are purchasing. The \nquestion, therefore, is to be asked: Is there some kind of preference \nabout what happens at the supermarket, or any other kind of store, and \nis that somehow less protected than the choice you make \nonline? Likewise, catalog companies compile and use offline information \nto make marketing decisions. These companies rent lists compiled by \nlist brokers. The list brokers obtain marketing data and names from the \npublic domain and governments, credit bureaus, financial institutions, \ncredit card companies, retail establishments, and other catalogers and \nmass mailers.\n\n  I have been collecting the catalogs that I have received just in the \nlast few weeks from not one online purchase, and I have been targeted \nby about 50 catalogs just on the basis of offline purchases that have \nbeen made and not because of an online existence.\n  Even in politics, off-line privacy protections may be less than those \nwe are already seeing online. For example, we all know that campaigns \ncan and do get voter registration lists from their states and can \nscreen based on how often individuals vote. They will take this data \nand add names from magazines--Democrats could use the New Republic and \nRepublicans might choose\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nthe National Review--and advocacy groups, and target all of them. With \nthose combined lists, campaigns decide which potential voters to target \nfor which mailings. The campaigns will also often share lists with each \nother and with party committees. All of this goes on offline.\n  On the other hand, when I go to the shopping mall and I walk into a \nstore and look at five different items, five sweaters, or five pairs of \npants, whatever it may be, and I don't buy any of them, there is no \nrecord of them at all. But there is a record of that kind of traveling \nor perusal, if you will, with respect to the web.\n  There are clearly questions that we have to resolve with respect to \nwhat kind of anonymity can be protected with respect to the online \ntransaction.\n  I just do not think this is the moment for us to legislate. I think \nwe need to study the issue of access very significantly.\n  There is a general agreement that consumers should have access to \ninformation that they provided to a web site. We still don't know \nwhether it is necessary or proper to have consumers have access to all \nof the information that is gathered about an individual.\n  Should consumers have access to click-stream data or so-called \nderived data by which a company uses compiled information to make a \nmarketing decision about the consumer? And if we decide that consumers \nneed some access for this type of information, is it technologically \nfeasible? Will there be unforeseen or unintended consequences such as \nan increased risk of security breaches? Will there be less rather than \nmore privacy due to the necessary coupling of names and data?\n  Again, I don't believe we have the answers, and I don't believe we \nare in a position to regulate until we have thoroughly examined and \nexperienced the work on those issues.\n  I disagree with those who think that this is the time for heavy-\nhanded legislation from the Congress. Nevertheless, I believe we can \nlegislate the outlines of a structure in which we provide some consumer \nprotections and in which we set certain goals with which we encourage \nthe consumer to familiarize themselves while we encourage the companies \nto develop the technology and the capacity to do it.\n  Clearly, opting in is a principle that most people believe ought to \nbe maximized. Anonymity is a principle that most people believe can \nhelp cure most of the ills of targeted sales. For instance, you don't \nneed to know if it is John Smith living on Myrtle Street. You simply \nneed to know how many times a particular kind of purchase may have been \nmade in a particular demographic. And it may be possible to maintain \nthe anonymity and provide the kind of protection without major \nlegislation. It seems to me that most companies will opt for that.\n  In addition to that, we need to resolve the question of how much \naccess an individual will have to their own information, and what \nrights they will have with respect to that.\n  Finally, we need to deal with the question of enforcement, which will \nbe particularly important. It is one that we need to examine further. I \nbelieve that there is much for us to examine. We should not, in a \nsense, intervene in a way that will have a negative impact on the \nextraordinary growth of the Internet, even as we protect privacy and \nestablish some principles by which we should guide ourselves. I believe \nthat the FTC proposal reaches too far in that regard.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in an effort to \nembrace goals without the kind of detailed intrusion that has been \nsuggested.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4255-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SMITH, OF OHIO, TO BE A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL \n                          ELECTION COMMISSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Bradley A. Smith, of \nOhio, to be a member of the Federal Election Commission.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, based on the caricatures of Professor \nBradley Smith, one would think he must have horns and a tail. I unveil \na picture of Brad Smith and his family in the hopes of putting to rest \nsome of these rumors.\n  Let me quote Professor Smith himself on this point, talking about the \nexperience he has had over the last 10 months. He said: In the last 10 \nmonths since my name first surfaced as a candidate, certain outside \ngroups and editorial writers opposed to this nomination have relied on \ninvective and ridicule to try to discredit me. Among other things, some \nhave likened nominating me to nominating Larry Flynt, a pornographer, \nto high office. Nominating me has been likened to nominating David \nDuke, one-time leader in the Ku Klux Klan, to high office. Nominating \nme has been likened to nominating Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, a \nmurderer, to high office.\n  Professor Smith went on and said: Just this week I saw a new one. I \nwas compared to nominating Jerry Springer, which is probably not a good \ncomparison since Springer is a Democrat. Other critics have attempted \nridicule, labeling me a ``flat Earth Society poobah,'' and more.\n  He says: I say all this not by way of complaint because I'm sure that \nMembers--he is referring to Members of the Senate--have probably been \ncalled similar or worse things in the course of their public lives.\n  I thought it might be appropriate to begin with a photograph of \nProfessor Smith and his family, which bears little resemblance to Larry \nFlynt, David Duke, or Theodore Kaczynski.\n  It is my distinct honor today to rise in support of the nomination of \nProfessor Bradley A. Smith to fill the open Republican seat on the \nbipartisan Federal Election Commission.\n  In considering the two FEC nominees, Professor Brad Smith and \nCommissioner Danny McDonald, the Senate must answer two fundamental \nquestions: Is each nominee experienced, principled, and ethical? And: \nWill the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission?\n  I might state this is a different kind of commission. It is a \ncommission set up on purpose to have three members of one party and \nthree members of another party so that neither party can take advantage \nof the other in these electoral matters that come before the \nCommission. The Federal Election Commission is charged with regulating \nthe political speech of individuals, groups, and parties without \nviolating the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and \nassociation--obviously, a delicate task.\n  Over the past quarter century, the FEC has had difficulty maintaining \nthis all-important balance and has been chastised, even sanctioned, by \nthe Federal courts for overzealous prosecution and enforcement that \ntreated the Constitution with contempt and trampled the rights of \nordinary citizens.\n  In light of the FEC's congressionally mandated balancing act and the \nfundamental constitutional freedoms at stake, Congress established the \nbalanced, bipartisan, six-member Federal Election Commission. The law \nand practice behind the FEC nominations process has been to allow each \nparty to select its FEC nominees. The Republicans pick the Republicans; \nthe Democrats pick the Democrats. As President Clinton said recently, \nthis is, ``the plain intent of the law, which requires that it be \nbipartisan and by all tradition, that the majority make the \nnomination'' to fill the Republican seat on the Commission.\n  Professor Bradley Smith was a Republican choice agreed to by the \nRepublicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate and put \nforward by the Republicans to the President of the United States, who \nhas nominated him.\n  Typically, Republicans complain that the Democratic nominees prefer \ntoo much regulation and too little freedom, while Democrats complain \nthat the Republican nominees prefer too little regulation and too much \nfreedom.\n  Ultimately both sides bluster and delay a bit, create a little free \nmedia attention, and then move the nominees forward. In fact, the \nSenate has never\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nvoted down another party's FEC nominee in a floor vote or even staged a \nfilibuster on the Senate floor.\n  At the end of the day, however, the bipartisan nature of the FEC \nserves the country well. The FEC gets a few commissioners that \nnaturally lean toward regulation and a few commissioners that naturally \nlean toward constitutionally-protected freedoms. And the country gets a \nsix-member bipartisan Federal Election Commission to walk the critical \nfine line between regulation and freedom.\n  The Dean of Stanford Law School, Kathleen Sullivan, has summed up the \nbalance as well as anyone. Specifically, she praised Professor Smith \nfor the instrumental role he would play in upholding constitutional \nvalues and establishing a bipartisan equilibrium:\n\n       I do think Mr. Smith's views are in the mainstream of \n     constitutional opinion. . . . I think it is a good thing, not \n     a bad thing, to have people who are very attuned to \n     constitutional values in Government positions, just as we \n     would think it is a good thing to have a prosecutor who \n     thinks very highly of the Fourth Amendment and wants to make \n     sure searches are always reasonable, maybe more so than some \n     of his colleagues. It is certainly good to have one of those \n     prosecutors in the shop, and it certainly would be a good \n     thing to have one Commissioner at least who has those views.\n\n  Let me say that I sincerely hope that we can uphold this bipartisan \nlaw and tradition that President Clinton invoked when he sent these two \nnominees to the Senate.\n  After all, Professor Smith's views are similar to the Republicans who \nhave gone before him. And, Commissioner McDonald's views are similar to \nthose he himself has held for the past 18 years as one of the \nDemocrats' commissioners at the FEC. In fact, Commissioner McDonald's \nviews are so consistent with and helpful to the Democratic Party that \nformer Congressman and current Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho has \nhailed Commissioner McDonald as ``the best strategic appointment'' the \nDemocrats ever made. So, notwithstanding the bluster and delay, these \ntwo nominees largely represent their parties' long line of past FEC \nCommissioners. One could argue that the only thing new in this debate \nis the opportunity for new headlines.\n  Again, let me restate the questions before the Senate on these two \nFEC nominees?\n  Is each nominee experienced, principled and ethical?\n  Will the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission?\n  I dedicate the remainder of my opening comments this morning to \nreading a few excerpts from the flood of letters I have received in \nsupport of Professor Smith since he was nominated. These letters from \nthose who agree and those who disagree with Professor Smith clearly \nestablish that: (1) Professor Smith is experienced, principled and \nethical, and (2) his service would help the FEC to be balanced and \nbipartisan.\n  Even staunch advocates of reform, including two past board members of \nCommon Cause, have written in support of Professor Smith's nomination. \nThese many letters attest to the central role that Professor Smith's \nscholarship has played in mainstream thought about campaign finance \nregulation. Equally important, these letters make clear that no one who \nknows Brad Smith personally or professionally, including self-avowed \nreformers, believes that he will fail to enforce the election laws as \nenacted by Congress or to fulfill his duties in a fair and even-handed \nmanner.\n\n  All of the scholars that have written urging the confirmation of \nProfessor Smith believe that his scholarly work is not radical but \nrather well-grounded in mainstream First Amendment doctrines and case \nlaw. Let me share with you a few examples of what these experts say.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of these letters that I am \ngoing to be reading be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. First, Professor Daniel Kobil, Capital Law School, \nReform Advocate and Past Director of Common Cause, Ohio:\n\n       Groups seeking to expand campaign regulations dramatically \n     might have misgivings about Brad's nomination. However, I \n     believe that much of that opposition is based not on what \n     Brad has said or written about campaign finance regulations, \n     but on crude caricatures of his ideas that have been \n     circulated. . . . I think that the FEC and the country in \n     general will benefit from Brad's diligence, expertise, and \n     solid principles if he is confirmed to serve on the \n     Commission.\n\n  Second, Professor Larry Sabato, Director of the University of \nVirginia Center for Governmental Studies, appointed by Senator George \nMitchell to the Senate's 1990 Campaign Finance Reform Panel:\n\n       Contrary to some of the misinformed commentary about \n     Professor Smith's work and views, his research and opinions \n     in the field of campaign finance are mainstream and \n     completely acceptable. For example, Professor Smith has \n     argued in several of his academic papers for a kind of \n     deregulation of the election rules in exchange for stronger \n     disclosure of political giving and spending. This is \n     precisely what I have written about and supported in a number \n     of publications as well. Bradley certainly supports much of \n     the work of the Federal Election Commission and understands \n     its importance to public confidence in our system of \n     elections. I have been greatly disturbed to see that some are \n     not satisfied to disagree with Professor Smith and make those \n     objections known, but believe it necessary to vilify the \n     professor in an almost McCarthyite way. I do not use that \n     historically hyper-charged word lightly, but it applies in \n     this case. Any academic with a wide ranging portfolio of \n     views on a controversial subject could be similarly tarred by \n     groups on the right or left.\n\n  Third, Professor John Copeland Nagle of Notre Dame Law School:\n\n       Professor Smith's view is shared by numerous leading \n     academics from across the political and ideological spectrum, \n     including Dean Kathleen Sullivan of the Stanford Law School \n     and Professor Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia \n     School of Law. His understanding of the First Amendment has \n     been adopted by the courts in sustaining state campaign \n     finance laws.\n\n  Fourth, Professor Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center at New York \nUniversity. There is no group in America that disagrees more \npassionately with Professor Smith on campaign finance than the Brennan \nCenter. Yet, listen to what Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of the \nBrennan Center had to say about Smith's scholarship.\n  Neuborne considers Professor Smith's writings to be ``thoughtful \ndiscussions of topics of extreme importance'' and concludes that Smith \nhas done ``excellent work in debunking the status quo.'' He goes on to \nsay of Professor Smith's scholarship:\n\n       I learned from it and altered aspects of my own approach as \n     a result of his argument. It is, in my opinion, thoughtful \n     scholarship that helps us move toward a better understanding \n     of an immensely important national issue. Higher praise than \n     that I cannot give.\n\n  It also speaks well of Professor Smith that constitutional scholars \nand election law experts that know him personally and are familiar with \nhis work, including some who have served on the board of Common Cause, \nare confident that he will faithfully enforce the law as enacted by \nCongress and upheld by the courts. Here are just a few examples of the \nconfidence these experts have in Brad Smith's integrity and commitment \nto the rule of law.\n  Fifth, Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, served six \nyears on Common Cause National Governing Board:\n\n       Anyone who compares his writings on campaign finance \n     regulation with mine will find that our views diverge \n     sharply. Despite these differences, I believe Smith is highly \n     qualified to serve on the FEC. . . . Smith possesses \n     integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an \n     excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to \n     enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it. . . . \n     In my opinion, although my views on the subject are not the \n     same as theirs, [the Senate Republican Leadership] deserves \n     considerable credit for having picked a distinguished \n     individual rather than a hack. . . . Although many people, \n     including myself, can find much to disagree with in Bradley \n     Smith's views, I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that he is \n     an individual of high intelligence and energy and \n     unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated \n     for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly \n     confirmed by the Senate.\n\n  Sixth, Professor Daniel Kobil of Capital Law School, former governing \nboard member of Common Cause, Ohio:\n\n       Knowing Brad personally, I have no doubt that his critics \n     are wrong in suggesting that as a FEC Commissioner, Brad \n     would refuse to enforce federal campaign regulations because \n     he disagrees with them. I have observed Brad's election law \n     class on several occasions and he always took the task of \n     educating his students about the meaning and scope of \n     election laws very seriously. I have never heard him \n     denigrating or advocating skirting state and federal laws, \n     even though he may have personally disagreed with some of \n     those laws. Indeed, several times in class he admonished \n     students who\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\n     seemed to be suggesting ignoring what they considered overly \n     harsh election laws. Brad is an ethical attorney who cares \n     deeply about the rule of law. I am confidant that he will \n     fairly administer the laws he is charged with enforcing as a \n     Commissioner.\n\n  Seventh, Professor Randy Barnett of Boston University Law School:\n\n       I . . . can tell you and your colleagues that [Professor \n     Smith] is a person of the highest character and integrity. If \n     confirmed, Brad will faithfully execute the election laws \n     which the Commission is charged to enforce--including those \n     with which he disagrees . . . . Brad's critics need not fear \n     that he will ignore current law, but those who violate it may \n     have reason to be apprehensive.\n\n  Let me close my opening comments by sharing with you Brad Smith's own \nclosing remarks in his statement before the Senate Rules Committee:\n\n       [S]hould you confirm my nomination to this seat, which I \n     hope that you will, here is my pledge to you. First, I will \n     defer to Congress to make law, and not seek to usurp that \n     function to the unelected bureaucracy. Second, when the \n     Commission must choose under the law, whether to act or not \n     to act, or how to shape rules necessary for the law's \n     enforcement, faithfulness to congressional intent and the \n     Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, will always be \n     central to my decision making. Third, I will act to enforce \n     the law as it is, even when I disagree with the law. . . . \n     Finally, I pledge that I will strive at all times to maintain \n     the humility that I believe is necessary for any person \n     entrusted with the public welfare to successfully carry out \n     his or her duties.\n\n  I think, with all due respect to current and past members of the FEC, \nthis is clearly the most outstanding individual ever nominated for that \ncommission. We all regret that this nomination has taken on some level \nof controversy because of Professor Smith's views, which are similar to \nthose of 95 percent of the Republicans in the Senate. But that happens \noccasionally.\n  I am confident that well-meaning Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwill remember that this is a bipartisan agency. It is supposed to have \nthree Democrats, picked by the Democrats, and three Republicans, picked \nby the Republicans. It is important for us to honor each others' \nchoices if the FEC is to work. So I am hopeful and confident that \nProfessor Smith's nomination will be confirmed tomorrow when the roll \nis called.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          University of California\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                               Los Angeles, CA, February 17, 2000.\n     Re Bradley Smith nomination.\n\n     (Attn: Andrew Siff)\n\n     Senator Micth McConnell,\n     Senate Rules Committee, Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I write in support of the \n     nomination of Bradley Smith to serve on the Federal Election \n     Commission. My support is not based on either partisan or \n     ideological grounds. To the contrary, I have been an active \n     Democrat since 1970, whereas, as is well known, Smith's \n     appointment to the FEC was proposed by Republicans. Anyone \n     who compares Smith's writings on campaign finance regulation \n     with mine will find that our views diverge sharply. Despite \n     these differences, I believe Smith is highly qualified to \n     serve on the FEC.\n       The difficulties that have affected the performance of the \n     FEC since its creation have not been caused by the \n     ideological views of its members, but by excessive \n     partisanship and, sometimes, by mediocrity. Smith possesses \n     integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an \n     excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to \n     enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it.\n       That the Senate Republican leaders should have proposed an \n     individual who matches their ideological views on campaign \n     finance regulations should not have surprised anyone. Law and \n     custom assume that the members of the FEC will have different \n     partisan and ideological backgrounds. In my opinion, though \n     my views on the subject are not the same as theirs, these \n     leaders deserve considerable credit for having picked a \n     distinguished individual rather than a hack.\n       That Smith is indeed distinguished can hardly be doubted. \n     He has published numerous articles on campaign finance \n     regulation in distinguished law journals. These articles are \n     widely recognized as leading statements of one of the major \n     positions in the campaign finance debate. In 1995 I published \n     the first American textbook of the twentieth century on \n     election law (Election Law, Carolina Academic Press). Not \n     long after the book was published, Smith published his first \n     major article on campaign finance in the Yale Law Journal. \n     With his permission, I included extended excerpts from that \n     article in the supplements that have been published for my \n     textbook. I certainly would not have done so unless I \n     regarded his article as intellectually distinguished.\n       It is understandable that in an area such as campaign \n     finance regulation, whose effects are so far-reaching for all \n     competitors in American politics, appointments should be \n     highly contested. However, as I mentioned above, the system \n     contemplates that individuals with different backgrounds and \n     beliefs will serve on the FEC. Although many people, \n     including myself, can find much to disagree with in Bradley \n     Smith's views, I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that he is \n     an individual of high intelligence and energy and \n     unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated \n     for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly \n     confirmed by the Senate. If such an individual is denied \n     confirmation, the result inevitably will be to compound the \n     already prevalent gridlock in this difficult area of public \n     policy.\n       If I can provide any additional information I should be \n     happy to do so.

Smith for Commissioner \n         on Federal Election Commission.\n\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing in support of \n     Professor Bradley A. Smith's nomination for a position as a \n     Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. I have known \n     Brad since he joined the faculty of Capital Law School in the \n     Fall of 1993 as a visiting professor, and have served as the \n     chair of his committee for purposes of considering his tenure \n     and promotion, most recently to Full Professor. He is, in my \n     view, an outstanding candidate for the position and should \n     certainly be confirmed.\n       As a friend and colleague of Brad's, I am of course aware \n     of the controversy surrounding his nomination to a position \n     on the FEC. Indeed, as a former governing board member for \n     Common Cause, Ohio, I can understand why groups seeking to \n     expand campaign regulations dramatically might have \n     misgivings about Brad's nomination. However, I believe that \n     much of that opposition is based not on what Brad has written \n     or said about campaign finance regulations, but on crude \n     caricatures of his ideas that have been circulated.\n       Although I do not agree with all of Brad's views on \n     campaign finance regulations, I believe that his scholarly \n     critique of these laws is cogent and largely within the \n     mainstream of current constitutional thought. I have taught \n     Constitutional Law at Capital Law School for nearly thirteen \n     years. I was also counsel for amicus curiae, the ACLU of \n     Ohio, in a significant case dealing with the intersection of \n     the First Amendment and election law, Pestrak v. Ohio \n     Elections Commission, 926 F2d 573 (6th Cir. 1991).\n       Brad's central premise, that limits on political \n     contributions burden expression and should only be upheld for \n     the most compelling reasons, is hardly radical. It has long \n     been a basic tenet of the Supreme Court's First Amendment \n     jurisprudence that the amount and content of speech cannot be \n     limited except for the most important reasons. Brad's \n     writings do question the Supreme Court's conclusion in \n     Buckley v. Valeo that the government's interest in preventing \n     the appearance of corruption is sufficient to outweigh the \n     burden campaign finance regulations place on speech. However, \n     this critique is not outlandish, but calls attention to the \n     one of the obvious tensions in Buckley that in my view ought \n     to be continuously reexamined by courts and scholars if the \n     basic values underlying the First Amendment are to be \n     adequately protected.\n       Moreover, having come to knowing Brad personally, I have no \n     doubt that his critics are wrong in suggesting that as a FEC \n     Commissioner, Brad would refuse to enforce federal campaign \n     regulations because he disagrees with the laws. I have \n     observed Brad's Election Law class on several occasions and \n     he always took the task of educating his students about the \n     meaning and scope of election laws very seriously. I have \n     never observed him denigrating or advocating skirting state \n     and federal election laws, even though he may have personally \n     disagreed with some of those laws. Indeed, several times in \n     class he admonished students who seemed to be suggesting \n     ignoring what they considered overly harsh election laws. \n     Brad is an ethical attorney who cares deeply about the rule \n     of law. I am confident that he will fairly administer the \n     laws he is charged with enforcing as a Commissioner.\n       In conclusion, I think that the FEC and the country in \n     general will benefit from Brad's diligence, expertise, and \n     solid principles if he is confirmed to serve on the \n     Commission. Please contact me if I can provide additional \n     information or assist the Committee in any way regarding \n     Brad's nomination.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n                                                  Daniel T.

I believe Professor Smith is a \n     solid and informed choice for the vital federal agency at a \n     critical moment in its history. I am pleased to be able to \n     add my voice to many who support Professor Smith.\n       My own credentials in this field are outlined in the \n     attached vita. I have published several books and many \n     articles in the field, including Pac Power: Inside the World \n     of Political Action Committees, Paying for Elections, and \n     Dirty Little Secrets. In addition, I was honored and \n     privileged to serve on the U.S. Senate's campaign finance \n     reform panel back in 1990, having being jointly appointed by \n     then-majority leader George Mitchell and minority leader \n     Robert J. Dole.\n       Contrary to some of the misinformed commentary about \n     Professor Smith's work and views, his research and opinions \n     in the field of campaign finance are mainstream and \n     completely acceptable. For example, Professor Smith has \n     argued in several of his academic papers for a kind of \n     deregulation of the election rules in exchange for stronger \n     disclosure of political giving and spending. This is \n     precisely what I have written about and supported in a number \n     of publications as well. Bradley certainly supports much of \n     the work of the Federal Election Commission and understands \n     its importance to public confidence in our system of \n     elections. I have been greatly disturbed to see that some are \n     not satisfied to disagree with Professor Smith and make those \n     objections known, but believe it is necessary to vilify the \n     professor in almost a McCarthyite way. I do not use that \n     historically hyper-charged word lightly, but it applies in \n     this case. Any academic with a wide-ranging portfolio of \n     views on a controversial subject could be similarly tarred by \n     groups on the right or left. I hope and trust that under your \n     able leadership, the Senate Rules Committee will not give in \n     to this kind of vicious sloganeering and character \n     assassination.\n       I should note that I don't completely agree with Professor \n     Smith's views and opinions in all respects. Even though we \n     have our differences, I fully respect his scholarship and the \n     clear argumentation and documentation that undergirds it. I \n     have not been a long acquaintance of Professor Smith so I \n     cannot be accused of simply backing an old chum! Instead, I \n     am supporting Bradley Smith because he is fully qualified for \n     the Federal Election Commission and I believe that he will do \n     an outstanding job, putting in long hours and thoroughly \n     analyzing the complicated subjects that come before the \n     Commission. I trust him to fulfill his public \n     responsibilities with great care and a determination to be \n     fair and honest. That is all one can reasonably ask from a \n     nominee.\n       Thank you for permitting me the opportunity to offer these \n     observations. Please let me know if I can be of any \n     additional help as Professor Smith's nomination moves \n     forward, as it should.\n       With every good wish,\n           Yours respectfully,\n     Dr. Larry J. Sabato.\n     Robert Kent Gooch,\n       Professor Of Government and Foreign Affairs, and Director \n     of the University of Virginia Center for Governmental \n     Studies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Notre Dame Law School,\n\n                                Notre Dame, IN, February 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     (Att'n: Andrew Siff)\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell: It is my privilege to recommend \n     Bradley A. Smith for appointment to the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC).\n       Professor Smith is a leading scholar in election law. His \n     work--which has appeared in such prestigious publications as \n     the Yale Law Journal and the Georgetown Law Journal--is \n     innovative, academically rigorous, and an exciting \n     contribution to the existing literature in the field of \n     campaign finance legislation. He is one of the few scholars \n     who has investigated how campaigns were financed before the \n     second half of the twentieth century, see Bradley A. Smith, \n     Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences of Campaign \n     Finance Reform, 105 Yale L.J. 1049, 1053-56 (1996), and his \n     scholarship builds upon the lessons that history teaches. For \n     example, he dispels a common perception by observing that \n     ``the role of the small contributor in financing campaigns . \n     . . has increased, rather than declined, over the years.'' \n     Id. at 1056. He has closely examined the way in which money \n     affects both political campaigns and the legislative process, \n     concluding that the precise relationship between campaign \n     spending and corruption is far more complicated than many \n     commonly assume. See id. at 1057-71; Bradley A. Smith. Money \n     Talks: Speech, Corruption, Equality, and Campaign Finance, 86 \n     Geo.L.J. 45, 58-60 (1997). Yet that is exactly the kind of \n     analysis that should be performed when considering what legal \n     regulation is merited, especially in light of the frequent \n     laments that the federal campaign finance laws enacted in the \n     1970's have not performed as Congress hoped or expected.\n       Professor Smith questions the compatibility of campaign \n     restrictions with the first amendment. In doing so, he gives \n     voice to the many organizations across the political and \n     idelolgical spectrum who fear the impact of some of the \n     proposed legal regulation on the ability of citizens and \n     groups of communicate their message to the public. Professor \n     Smith's view is shared by numerous leading academics, again \n     from across the political and ideological spectrum, including \n     Dean Kathleen Sullivan of the Stanford law School and \n     Professor Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia School \n     of Law. His understanding of the first amendment has been \n     adopted by the courts in sustaining state campaign finance \n     regulations. See Toledo Area AFL-CIO v. Pizza, 154 F.3d 307, \n     319 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting Professor Smith's description of \n     the first amendment). But Professor Smith sees the first \n     amendment in an affirmative light rather than a negative one. \n     As he has so eloquently explained:\n       ``By assuring freedom of speech and of the press, the First \n     Amendment allows for exposure of government corruption and \n     improper favors and provides voters with information on \n     sources of financial support. There is no shortage of \n     newspaper articles reporting on candidate spending and \n     campaign contributions, and candidates frequently make such \n     information an issue in campaigns. By keeping the government \n     out of the electoral arena, the First Amendment allows for a \n     full interplay of political ideas and prohibits the type of \n     incumbent self-dealing that has so vexed the reform movement. \n     It allows challengers to raise the funds necessary for a \n     successful campaign and keeps channels of political change \n     open. By prohibiting excessive regulation of political speech \n     and the political process, the First Amendment, properly \n     interpreted, frees individuals wishing to engage in political \n     discourse from the regulation that now restrains grassroots \n     political activity. And because the First Amendment, properly \n     applied to protect contributions and spending, makes no \n     distinctions between the power bases of different political \n     actors, it helps to keep any particular faction or interest \n     from permanently gaining the upper hand. In each respect, it \n     promotes true political equality.''\n     Smith, 105 Yale L.J AT 1090. This positive explanation far \n     better serves the first amendment than the frightening \n     prospect that the meaning of the Constitution's protections \n     might soon depend upon the perceived majority desire for the \n     stringent regulation of political campaigns. See Nixon v. \n     Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 120 S. Ct. 897 (2000) \n     (Breyer, J., concurring)(suggesting that the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of the first amendment should change if it \n     ``denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enact \n     comprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaign \n     finance'').\n       Yet Professor Smith understands the problems evidence in \n     our current system. He recognizes the need for ``radical'' \n     reform, see Bradley A. Smith, A Most Uncommon Cause: Some \n     Thoughts on Campaign Reform and a Response to Professor Paul, \n     30 Conn. L. Rev. 831, 837 N.37 (1998) , a sympathy that I \n     share. See John Copeland Nagle, The Recusal Alternative to \n     Campaign Finance Reform, 37 Harv. J. Legis. (forthcoming \n     February 2000). What impresses me most about Professor Smith \n     is his insistence that the problems evident in our existing \n     system be addressed in a manner that protects constitutional \n     rights. It is far too easy to assume that the first amendment \n     must be discarded when it is inconvenient to adhere to its \n     teachings. Moreover, apart from the commands of the \n     Constitution, Professor Smith has questioned whether the same \n     kinds of proposed solutions that have been tried and failed \n     for nearly thirty years are best suited for the kinds of \n     problems that we face today. Indeed, he has identified a \n     number of unintended effects of the standard restrictions on \n     campaign contributions and expenditures, including the \n     entrenchment of the status quo, the promotion of influence \n     peddling, the favoritism of select elites and special \n     interests, and perhaps most obviously, the encouragement of \n     wealthy candidates. See Smith, 105 Yale L.J. at 1072-84. \n     Instead, Professor Smith had advocated other actions that \n     could be taken to solve the problem, including increased \n     disclosure requirements. See Smith, 45 Geo. L.J. at 62-62. \n     But Professor Smith has clearly stated his preferred remedy: \n     ``I believe strongly that the best solution to any ills in \n     our political system lies in the American voter.'' Smith, 30 \n     Conn. L. Rev. at 862. I cannot imagine a more attractive view \n     to be possessed by a member of the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n       Perhaps most importantly, Professor Smith has displayed a \n     fidelity to the law. His writing about the first amendment \n     shows that the he abides by the Constitution regardless of \n     the consequences. Professor Smith is also faithful to the \n     laws enacted by Congress. He has counseled that both the \n     statues enacted by Congress and the constitutional decisions \n     of the courts are entitled to respect whether or not one \n     agrees or disagrees with them. See Bradley A. Smith, Soft \n     Money, Hard Realities: The Constitutional Prohibition on a \n     Soft Money Ban, 24 J. Legis, 170, 200 (1998), In sort, he \n     possesses the ``experience, integrity, impartiality, and good \n     judgment,'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(a)(3), necessary to serve on \n     the FEC.\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n       Please contact me at (219) 631-9407 or at \n     john.c.nagle.8@nd.edu if you have any further questions about \n     Professor Smith's nomination to the FEC.

I have \n     known Brad well since he was a student at Harvard Law School, \n     and have followed his academic career closely, and can tell \n     you and your colleagues that he is a person of the highest \n     character and integrity. If confirmed, Brad will faithfully \n     execute the election laws which the Commission is charged to \n     enforce--including those with which he disagrees--and he will \n     also take seriously the rights guaranteed by the \n     Constitution.\n       Though election law is not my specialty, I am generally \n     familiar with Brad's writings in the field and I have written \n     extensively on the Constitution and, in particular, the \n     constitutional protection of liberty. I believe that Brad's \n     positions on federal election laws in general, and campaign \n     finance laws in particular, are far more consonant with the \n     requirements of both the First Amendment and the Supreme \n     Court's first amendment jurisprudence than are the views of \n     his critics. These critics would deny public office to anyone \n     who disagrees with their views of good policy, or to anyone \n     who believes in reforming existing law in a manner with which \n     they disagree.\n       I share Brad's policy view that the goal of free, fair, and \n     competitive elections would be better served with less rather \n     than more regulation of elections. But I have no doubt \n     whatsoever that he will vigorously enforce current law. \n     Indeed, in recent years, we have seen wholesale and flagrant \n     violations of current election laws which have gone largely \n     unenforced by the FEC and the Justice Department. Brad's \n     critics need not fear that he will ignore current law, but \n     those who violate it may have reason to be apprehensive.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Randy E. Barnett,\n                                     Austin B. Fletcher Professor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the distinguished \nchairman of the Rules Committee for his leadership and for bringing \nthese matters to the floor. We will have roughly 6 hours of debate on \nthis matter. A number of my colleagues have some very strong views \nabout this nomination and will take the time to express them at the \nappropriate time.\n  I begin by apologizing to Danny Lee McDonald, the Democratic nominee \nfor the Federal Election Commission, and his family. I do not have a \npicture of Danny Lee McDonald. I do not know if he has a dog or not, or \ntwo dogs. I will try to correct that before the next 6 hours and see if \nI can come up with a nice picture of Mr. McDonald to show to our \ncolleagues and the public.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Had Commissioner McDonald been subjected to the same \nthings to which the Republican nominee has been subjected, my colleague \nmight have needed a picture with children and dogs. In any event, we \nare going to be voting on him as well after we vote on Professor Smith.\n  Mr. DODD. If he does not have a dog, maybe he can rent one. This is a \nfine looking dog here. Maybe we can borrow that fine looking red dog \nfor our picture. I apologize to Mr. McDonald, we do not have a similar \nphotograph of him and his family and dog before us.\n  I want to take our colleagues who are monitoring this back in time \nfor a historical framework before I get to the issue of the nominees \nbefore us because it might be helpful for people to understand the \nlegislative background as well as the historical background of these \nnominees and how the process has proceeded over this past quarter of a \ncentury. It has been 25 years since we created these positions. It \nmight be worthwhile to understand how this process has worked and how \nnominees have historically been handled.\n  My colleague from Kentucky has already alluded to that in his opening \ncomments. I thought it might be helpful to take a few minutes and give \na history lesson about the Federal Election Commission and about the \npeople who have been nominated to fill these positions.\n  We are here to consider two Presidential nominations. That is the \nfirst lesson. We are considering Presidential nominations. The \nRepublican Party may have promoted Brad Smith and the Democrats may \nhave promoted Danny McDonald, but, in fact, these are two nominations \nthat have been sent to us by President Clinton, as every other \nPresident has done during the consideration of nominees for the Federal \nElection Commission.\n  The two nominees are Danny McDonald of Oklahoma to fill the \nDemocratic seat and Brad Smith of Ohio to fill the Republican seat on \nthe Commission. Rollcall votes, as we know, will be conducted later \nthis week.\n  It is somewhat unusual, although not unprecedented, for the Senate to \ntake a significant amount of time to debate Presidential nominees to \nthe Federal Election Commission. I know some of my colleagues have \nplanned extensive remarks, and they are not out of order at all in \ndoing that. It has been done on other occasions.\n  It is even more unusual for the Senate to conduct a rollcall vote, \nhowever, on such nominees. It might be instructive to briefly review \nSenate action of FEC nominees over the past 25 years since the creation \nof the Commission.\n  Approximately 43 nominees, including reappointments, have been \nsubmitted to the Senate for consideration to this Commission. Of that \ntotal, only three nominations have required a rollcall vote by this \nbody in the past quarter of a century. In each of those \nthree instances, the nominees were confirmed by the Senate. The Senate \nhas never voted to reject a nominee to the Federal Election Commission \nsubmitted by respective Presidents.\n\n  Of the remaining 40 or so nominees, 3 were withdrawn by Presidents \nfor various reasons, 1 was returned to the President without action \nunder rule XXXI of the Senate, 3 were recess appointments, 2 of which \nwere confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent; and the remainder, \nsome 33 nominees, were all confirmed by unanimous consent without \nrecorded votes in the Senate.\n  In the last 10 years, pairs of nominees, one Democrat paired with one \nRepublican, have been considered by the Senate Rules Committee, \nreported to the Senate, and confirmed en bloc by unanimous consent. In \nthe most recent action by the Senate in 1997, four nominees, or two \npairs, were considered and confirmed in this manner and confirmed by \nunanimous consent, again en bloc.\n  How is it possible so many nominees, to what is considered by some to \nbe a controversial agency, have received the nearly unanimous support \nof this body throughout the past 25 years? I suggest the answer lies in \nthe very statute that created this Commission.\n  Chapter 14 of title 2 of the United States Code governs Federal \ncampaigns. Section 437c establishes the Federal Election Commission and \nprovides for the appointment of Commissioners. The statute provides \nfor--and I apologize for going through this laboriously, but it may \nhelp to understand the background of all of this--the statute provides \nfor the appointment by the President, with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, of six members to the Commission. Further, the statute \nprovides that no more than three members of the Commission be \naffiliated with the same political party; and that members shall serve \nfor 6 years, with the requirement that the initial six members serve \nstaggered terms, with two members not affiliated with the same \npolitical party being paired for each of the staggered terms. These \nrequirements were adopted by the Congress in the 1976 amendments to the \nFederal Election Campaign Act.\n  The Supreme Court struck down the original membership provision of \nthis act in the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo. The original \nprovisions of the 1971 act provided that the six members of the \nCommission be appointed by the President, the President pro tempore of \nthe Senate, and the Speaker of the House, with confirmation by a \nmajority of both Houses of Congress. The Buckley Court struck that \nprocess down.\n  What is obvious, however, is it has always been the intent of \nCongress that these nominees be appointed with regard to their party \naffiliation. That part has been quite clear.\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n  Moreover, these nominees are appointed and considered in pairs--one \nDemocratic nominee paired with a Republican nominee --and that is how \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration has also traditionally \nconsidered FEC nominees. The committee has similarly paired their \nconsideration so that no hearings are held, nor are the nominees \nreported, except in strict pairs.\n  In recent history, the Rules Committee has reported pairs of \nnominees, voting to report the pair en bloc to the Senate as a full \nbody. That is the case with the two nominees before the Senate today. \nThe Rules Committee held a confirmation hearing in which both nominees \nappeared, presented testimony, and answered questions of members of the \ncommittee. On March 8, the committee, by a voice vote, reported these \nnominations en bloc to the full body. That is also why the overwhelming \nmajority of these FEC nominees have moved through the Senate over the \npast 25 years by unanimous consent, often, again, confirmed en bloc.\n  The statute creates a presumption that the views of each of the two \nmajor political parties will be represented by the three members of the \nCommission. And the practice that has developed that the leadership of \nthe Congress, both Republican and Democratic leadership, communicate to \nthe President their preferences for the nominees.\n\n  Presidents have rejected these preferences in the past. I noted that \nearlier. This practice may be a holdover from the original provisions \nin which the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House \nactually chose the nominees under the 1971 statute. Now the \nrecommendations are made to the President, and the President makes the \nnomination. He can reject the recommendations, which Presidents have. \nRonald Reagan rejected a nominee, and I recall Jimmy Carter also. \nOthers may have a better recollection historically of that.\n  This practice may be a holdover from the original provisions in which \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House \nactually chose the nominees. Or it may reflect the reality that such \nnominees, because they are intended to reflect the relative views of \nthe political parties, must be confirmed by members of those parties in \nthe Senate. In either event, these nominees are accepted as somewhat \npartisan in their views and consequently are paired in their \nconsideration.\n\n  So why does the Senate find itself in the somewhat unusual position \nof taking the time of the body to fully debate and conduct rollcall \nvotes on these nominees? Not surprisingly, each of these nominees is \nvery closely associated with the majority views of their party on \nissues of campaign finance reform. Commissioner McDonald has been a \nmember of the FEC since 1982. He is currently Vice Chairman of the \nCommission. He has been reaffirmed to a seat on the Commission twice \nsince his original appointment. During his tenure, he served as \nChairman of the Commission three times, and as Vice Chairman four \ntimes.\n  Professor Bradley Smith is a distinguished professor of law at \nCapital University Law School in Columbus, OH. He is the author of \nnumerous scholarly articles on campaign finance and his views are well-\npublished and widely known on this subject matter.\n  In testimony before the Rules Committee, Mr. Smith acknowledged that, \nnotwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court in Buckley and the \nlong line of cases that follow, he happens to believe the first \namendment should be read to prohibit restrictions on campaign \ncontributions.\n  Mr. Smith has similarly argued that Congress needs to reverse course \nand loosen campaign finance regulations. He has argued that contrary to \nthe belief of a majority in Congress, and a majority of the American \npeople, that there is too much money in politics today, Mr. Smith \nargues that money increases speech and therefore we need more speech--\nand more money, I argue, from his point of view--in our campaigns. He \nalso argues that campaigns funded by small donors are not more \ndemocratic and that, in fact, large donors are healthier for the \nsystem. Mr. Smith has also argued that the perception that money buys \nelections is incorrect and that rather than corrupting the system, \nlimiting money corrupts the system by entrenching the status quo, \nfavoring wealthy individuals, and making the electoral process less \nresponsive to public opinion.\n  Let me categorically state for the record that I could not disagree \nmore with Mr. Smith's positions and his writings when it comes to \ncampaign finance. It is clear to me that money plays far too great a \nrole in campaigns today. I could not disagree more that limits on \ncontributions are not only constitutional but necessary for our form of \ndemocracy to survive.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that money corrupts, or has the \nappearance of corrupting our system, and this perception threatens to \nundermine our electoral system and jeopardize the confidence in our \nform of democracy.\n  I could not disagree more with Mr. Smith's conclusion that Congress \nneeds to reverse course and loosen campaign finance regulations. It is \npast time for this Congress to pass comprehensive campaign finance \nreform, which I have consistently supported and will continue to \nsupport.\n  That is what the debate in the Senate is about today--whether or not \nthis Congress will act on the will of the people and bring this system \nof campaign finance loopholes and the money chase to a close. My \nsupport for such action could not be more clear.\n  Notwithstanding my strong disagreement with his views, I am not going \nto oppose this nomination of Mr. Smith for the following reasons: \nTraditionally, there is a heightened level of deference given to the \nPresident's nominees, particularly when the position is designated to \nbe filled by one party. That is particularly the case with nominees to \nthe FEC, who by statute are to be the representatives of their \npolitical parties on that commission. Moreover, in performing our \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent to the \nPresident's nominations, the Senate should determine whether a nominee \nis qualified to hold the office to which he or she has been nominated.\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that Mr. Smith is qualified to hold \nthis office. He is clearly intellectually qualified for the position. \nHe is a recognized, although controversial, scholar on election law and \nthe Constitution. He is bright, articulate, and anxious to serve. \nAgain, I could not disagree with him more, but to say he is not \nqualified to serve is not to have spent time reading his writings or \nlistening to him. You can disagree with him--and I do vehemently--but \nhe is certainly qualified to sit on the FEC. Most importantly, he has \nappeared before the Senate Rules Committee and testified under oath \nthat if confirmed, he will uphold the Constitution of the United States \nand the election laws of the land.\n\n  During Rules Committee consideration of this nominee, I asked Mr. \nSmith if, notwithstanding his personal views, was he prepared to \nenforce the election laws founded on the congressional belief that \npolitical contributions can corrupt elections and need to be limited, \nas allowed by law and the Constitution. Mr. Smith responded that he \nwould ``proudly and without reservations'' take that oath of office.\n  Finally, this Senate, and the Rules Committee in particular, have an \nobligation, in my view, to fill vacancies on the Federal Election \nCommission. Otherwise, we face gridlock and inaction by our agencies. \nThe FEC is simply far too important, in my view, to be hamstrung by \nrefusing to confirm a controversial but otherwise well-qualified \nnominee.\n  My vote in favor of this nomination should not be read as an \nendorsement of his views. Nothing could be further from the truth. It \nis an endorsement of the process that allows our political parties to \nchoose nominees who hold views consistent with their own. I regret that \nthe majority party here--at least a majority of the majority party--\nembraces the views they do, and nobody holds them more strongly than my \nfriend and colleague from Kentucky. I think he is dead wrong in his \nviews on these issues, but he represents the views of the majority \nparty on this issue. They have made a choice that Bradley Smith \nreflects their views well on this issue. Therefore, they have the \nright, in my view, to have him confirmed to the seat, assuming that he \nis otherwise qualified to sit on the Commission. I would not vote for \nhim if it\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nwere strictly a case of endorsing his views as opposed to mine. But the \nFEC has never been a body where that has been a litmus test applied to \nPresidential nominees.\n  Whether or not this nominee is confirmed will not determine the real \nissue for Congress--and that is whether we will pass meaningful \ncampaign finance reform laws to restore the public's faith in our \nelected system of Government.\n  The fundamental problem we face is not whether Bradley Smith is on \nthe FEC, but whether or not this body, before we adjourn this Congress, \nis ever going to address the fundamental campaign laws that some of us \nwould like to see modified, including the McCain-Feingold legislation, \nwhich has been before this body in the past.\n  It is time, in my view, to confirm these nominees to ensure that this \nagency has a full complement of dedicated, talented Commissioners sworn \nto uphold the laws on the books.\n  It is time to get on with the work of the Senate to reform our \ncampaign finance laws and give the FEC the resources it needs --both \nfinancially and statutorily--to restore the public's confidence in our \nelectoral system.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly to the ranking \nmember of the Rules Committee, I listened carefully to his statement. I \nthank him very much for respecting the process by which we have \nselected our nominees for the Federal Election Commission. He made it \nclear that, had the choice been his, he would not have picked Professor \nSmith. I will make it clear a little later that had the choice been \nmine, I would not have picked Commissioner McDonald. This is the way \nthe FEC is supposed to work. I thank my colleague for honoring that \ntradition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is to \nrecess at 12:30.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

SMITH, OF OHIO, TO BE A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL \n                     ELECTION COMMISSION--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Today we are debating a nomination that may be just as important to \nthe cause of campaign finance reform as any bill that has been \nconsidered by the Senate in recent years. Tomorrow's vote on the \nnomination of Brad Smith may be just as significant for campaign \nfinance reform as any of the votes we had on those bills.\n  The issue here is the nomination of Brad Smith to a 6-year term on \nthe Federal Election Commission, and I oppose that nomination.\n  Like other speakers, I take note of the photograph of Brad Smith's \nfamily shown today on the floor only to make a point that this \nnomination is certainly not analogous to treatment that has been given \nto judicial appointments, where we have had to wait for years and years \nfor a confirmation vote. Mr. Smith was just nominated a couple of \nmonths ago. So this has not been a long drawn out delay of his \nnomination that would do harm to him, his family, or anybody else. In \nfact, I rejected that kind of approach to his nomination because, as \nfar as I know, Professor Smith is a perfectly reasonable man in terms \nof his integrity and his academic ability and the like. He deserved a \nvote on the floor and he is going to get it, a lot faster than many \njudicial nominees that President has sent to us.\n  The problem is that Professor Smith's views on Federal election laws \nas expressed in Law Review articles, interviews, op-eds, and speeches \nover the past half decade are startling. He should not be on the \nregulatory body charged with enforcing and interpreting those laws.\n  So when words are used on the floor such as ``vilification,'' or \nquestioning his integrity, or any other excuse not to get to the real \nissue, I have to strongly object. This debate is simply on the merits \nof what Professor Smith's views are of what the election laws are or \nshould be.\n  Over the course of the debate--and I note that a number of my \ncolleagues will be joining me on the floor to set out the case against \nProfessor Smith--we will explain, and I hope convince, our colleagues \nand the public that this nomination has to be defeated.\n  Let me again make it clear, because I think there was some attempt to \nsuggest the opposite, that I hold no personal animus towards Professor \nSmith. It is not a matter of personality. I am sure he is a good \nperson. I do not question his right to criticize the laws from his \noutside perch as a law professor and commentator. But his views on the \nvery laws he will be called upon to enforce give rise to grave doubt as \nto whether he can carry out the responsibilities of a Commissioner on \nthe FEC. It just isn't possible for us to ignore the views he has \nrepeatedly and stridently expressed simply because he now says he will \nfaithfully execute the laws if he is confirmed.\n  We would not accept, nor should we accept, such disclaimers from \nindividuals nominated to head other agencies of government. Sometimes a \ncliche is the best way to express an idea. Professor Smith on the FEC \nwould really be the classic case of the fox guarding the hen house.\n  Let me illustrate this by pointing out the views of Bradley Smith \nthat caused me and many others who care about campaign finance reform \nto have a lot of concern about his being on the FEC.\n  Professor Smith has been a prolific scholar on the first amendment \nand the Federal election laws, so there is a rich written record to \nreview. Let's start with one of his most bold statements. In a 1997 \nopinion in the Wall Street Journal, Professor Smith wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       When a law is in need of continual revision to close a \n     series of ever changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the law \n     and not the people that is in error. The most sensible reform \n     is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Elections Campaign \n     Act.\n\n  That is right. The man who we may be about to confirm for a seat on \nthe Federal Election Commission believes the very laws he is supposed \nto enforce should be repealed. Thomas Jefferson said we should have a \nrevolution in this country every 20 years. He believed laws should \nconstantly be revised and revisited to make sure they are responsive to \nthe needs of citizens at any given time. Yet Professor Smith sees the \nneed for closing a loophole in the Federal elections laws as evidence \nthat the whole system, the whole idea of campaign finance reform laws, \nshould be completely scrapped. In other words, what would be the \npurpose of the Federal Elections Commission under his view of the \nworld?\n  A majority of both the House and the Senate have voted to close the \nloophole in the law known as soft money. We know that loophole is \nundermining public confidence in our elections and our legislative \nprocess. We have seen that loophole grow until it threatens to swallow \nthe entire system. Many Members think it already has. A majority of the \nCongress wants to fix that problem. We are willing to legislate to \nimprove an imperfect system. But Brad Smith wants to junk the system \nentirely and let the big money flow, without limit.\n  So what are we doing? We are about to put somebody with that view on \nthe body charged with enforcing laws we pass. I don't think this makes \nany sense.\n  Another statement by Professor Smith that I think should give us \npause, in a policy paper published by the Cato Institute, for whom \nProfessor\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\nSmith has written extensively, he says the following:\n\n       The Federal Election Campaign Act and its various State \n     counterparts are profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at \n     odds with the First Amendment.\n\n  Of course, this is consistent with his views that the Federal \nElection Campaign Act should be repealed. The FEC has loopholes and \ndoesn't work. Not only that, it is profoundly undemocratic and \nprofoundly at odds with the first amendment.\n  How can a member of the FEC, how can Brad Smith, reconcile those \nviews with his new position as one of six individuals responsible for \nenforcing and implementing the statute and any future reforms that \nCongress may pass? He has shown such extreme disdain in his writings \nand public statements for the very law he would be charged to enforce \nthat I just don't think he should be entrusted with this important \nresponsibility.\n  Let me repeat, this nominee says that the Federal Election Campaign \nAct is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the first \namendment. Every bit of it. I am sure this body doesn't agree. Is it \nprofoundly undemocratic to believe that the tobacco companies, the \npharmaceutical companies, and the trial lawyers shouldn't be pouring \nmoney into campaigns through the parties, while they seek to influence \nlegislation that affects their bottom lines? Is it profoundly \nundemocratic to believe that $20,000 per year is enough for a wealthy \nperson to be able to contribute to a political party? Is it profoundly \nundemocratic to argue that the spending of outside groups to attack \ncandidates should be reported? That the public has a right to know the \nidentities and financial backers of groups that run vicious, negative \nads against candidates just weeks before an election?\n  I, for one, take great pride in being a strong defender of the first \namendment. I wouldn't vote for a bill that was ``profoundly at odds \nwith the first amendment,'' and I don't think my colleagues, who form a \nmajority of the Senate in support of campaign finance reform, would \neither. But we are being asked to confirm to a seat on the body that \nwill implement these laws someone who views these laws and our views as \ntotally illegitimate.\n  Professor Smith does believe, apparently, that disclosure is a good \nthing, but that is all the regulation he wants to see in our elections.\n  In another article, Professor Smith writes: I do think that Buckley \nis probably wrong in allowing contribution limits. He believes and he \nreaffirmed this belief in the hearings on his nomination held by the \nRules Committee that contribution limits are unconstitutional. \nProfessor Smith's view, as quoted by the Columbus Dispatch, is that \npeople should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics. \nWhatever they want. He thinks there is no problem with unlimited \ncontributions, none. Congress need not concern itself with that issue \nat all, apparently. In an interview at MSNBC he said: I think we should \nderegulate and just let it go. That is how our politics was run for \nover 100 years.\n  Think about what this is. We are asking somebody to enforce our \nelection laws who says, literally, ``just let it go.'' That is some \nenforcement. Professor Smith would have us go back to the late 19th \ncentury before Theodore Roosevelt pushed through the 1907 Tillman Act \nand prohibits corporate contributions to Federal elections.\n  The limits on contributions from individuals to candidates--the very \ncore of the campaign finance law that the Supreme Court upheld in \nBuckley v. Valeo and again in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC--\nBrad Smith would junk these provisions along with the very statute that \ncreated the FEC, the body on which he now seeks to serve.\n  Professor Smith thinks that contribution limits are expendable \nbecause, in his view, the concerns about corruption are just overblown.\n  Let's look at what Mr. Smith has to say about that: He wrote in a \n1997 law review article:\n\n       Whatever the particulars of reform proposals, it is \n     increasingly clear that reformers have overstated the \n     government interest in the anticorruption rationale. Money's \n     alleged corrupting influence are far from proven.\n\n  Well it just so happens, Mr. President, that the U.S. Supreme Court \ndoesn't agree. Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court issued a \nringing reaffirmation of the core holding of the Buckley decision that \nforms the basis for the reform effort. The Court once again held that \nCongress has the constitutional power to limit contributions to \npolitical campaigns in order to protect the integrity of the political \nprocess from corruption or the appearance of corruption. In upholding \ncontribution limits imposed by the Missouri Legislature, Justice Souter \nwrote for the Court:\n\n       [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  Mr. Smith thinks the dangers of corruption are overblown. The Supreme \nCourt says they are obvious. Professor Smith's disdain for campaign \nfinance reform is so great that he won't even admit the most basic fact \nabout our political life. That at some point, in some amount, \ncontributions can corrupt. Or at least they look like they corrupt, \nwhich the Supreme Court recognized is just as good a reason to limit \ncontributions to politicians. The appearance of corruption, Mr. \nPresident. We all know it's there. We hear it from our constituents \nregularly. We see it in the press, we hear about it on the news. But \nBrad Smith says the corrupting effect of money on the legislative \nprocess is far from proven.\n  Back home if I said that at any town meeting that is a laugh line. \nAmericans scoff at the notion that big money is not corrupting our \nsystem.\n  The Supreme Court held, and by the way, this wasn't a narrowly \ndivided Supreme Court decision in the Shrink Missouri case. This was a \n6-3 decision, with a majority containing four Justices appointed by \nRepublican Presidents including Chief Justice Rehnquist. The Supreme \nCourt held as follows:\n\n       Buckley demonstrates that the dangers or large, corrupt \n     contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are \n     corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. The opinion noted \n     that the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 \n     election demonstrate that the problem of corruption is not an \n     illusory one.\n\n  ``The problem of corruption is not an illusory one,'' said the Court. \nThe Supreme Court got it 25 years ago. Brad Smith still doesn't believe \nit. Professor Smith says: ``Money's alleged corrupting influence are \nfar from proven.'' That's what this debate is all about, Mr. President. \nIf someone can't even see the danger in unlimited contributions, \nhow can he adequately fulfill his duties as an FEC commissioner?\n\n  The campaign finance laws are not undemocratic. They are not \nunconstitutional. They are essential to the functioning of our \ndemocratic process and to the faith of the people in their government. \nAs the Supreme Court said in the Shrink Missouri case:\n\n       Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the \n     cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could \n     jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in \n     democratic governance. Democracy works `only if the people \n     have faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to be \n     shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in \n     activities which arouse suspicions of malfeasance and \n     corruption.\n\n  Now, in the wake of that clear declaration by the Court, how can \nBradley Smith continue to rationalize the gutting of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act? And how can we allow him the chance to carry it \nout as a member of the FEC?\n  We need FEC Commissioners who understand and accept the simple and \nbasic precepts about the influence of money on our political system \nthat the Court reemphasized in the Shrink Missouri case. We need FEC \nCommissioners who believe in the laws they are sworn to uphold. We need \nFEC Commissioners who will be vigilant for efforts to evade the law, to \navoid the clear will of the Congress. We need FEC Commissioners who \nwill be alert to the development of new and more clever loopholes, \ntricks by candidates or parties or advocacy groups to avoid \nconstitutionally valid limits on their activities or requirements that \nthey operate in the light of day. We do not need FEC Commissioners who \nhave an ideological agenda contrary to the core rationale of the laws \nthey must administer.\n  As any American who has been watching ``The West Wing'' in recent\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nweeks knows, nominees to the FEC come in pairs, one Democratic, one \nRepublican. And the members of the Commission by tradition are \nsuggested by the congressional leadership to the President. Now it \nwould be a pipe dream to think that the President would actually \nnominate two Commissioners at once who favor campaign finance reform, \nas has happened on TV. No, for reality to imitate art to that extent \nthat would be too much to hope for. But at least we shouldn't put the \nforemost academic critic of the election laws on the Commission. Surely \nthe Republican leadership can suggest another qualified individual for \nthis post who doesn't believe the election laws should be repealed.\n  We all know this nomination was made as part of an agreement to get a \nvote on the confirmation of another presidential nominee last year. I \nam sorry that the Senate's great responsibility to advise and consent \nto nominations has become a game of political horse trading. In the \nend, I think the country suffers when these kind of games are played, \nbut I know it goes on, and I did not stand in the way of this most \nrecent agreement to bring Mr. Smith to a vote as part of a larger \npackage of nominations. But we still have a duty of advise and consent \non each nomination, and I ask my colleagues to take a very hard look at \nthis particular nomination and after doing so I hope you come to the \nconclusion to vote no.\n  The public is entitled to FEC Commissioners who they can be confident \nwill not work to gut the efforts of Congress to provide fair and \ndemocratic rules to govern our political campaigns. The time has come \nfor the Senate to say no. The nomination of Brad Smith should not be \napproved.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, and strongly oppose the nomination of Bradley A. \nSmith to the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Smith has no confidence \nin federal election law, indeed he believes it to be ``undemocratic'' \nand ``unconstitutional.'' As a member of the FEC he will have the \nopportunity to put those views into practice and actually shape \nelection law through rulemaking. But worst of all, Mr. Smith doesn't \njust disagree with the law, he disagrees with the express purpose of \nthe law--limiting the corrupting influence of money in politic. An FEC \nnominee who's own personal beliefs and philosophies are so at odds with \nthe purposes and authority of the Federal Election Campaign Act should \nbe rejected by a pro-reform Congress.\n  I oppose the Smith nomination not only because his philosophies are \nantithetical to present law, but because I believe they are \nantithetical to broad political participation, to lowering the price of \naccess to the legislative process, restoring Americans faith in our \nsystem, and they are antithetical to everything that is necessary for a \nfunctioning democracy.\n  But before I make my case that the Senate should reject this \nnomination, let me say this. I have met Mr. Smith and found him to be \nan earnest and learned advocate of his point of view. I have no reason \nto question Mr. Smith's honor or his intentions and even his harshest \ncritics do not make the claim that Mr. Smith does not have a strong \ntechnical understanding of the law. He seems to be a good guy, so this \nis not personal and I hope that he does not take my criticisms \npersonally. But I do feel that given Mr. Smith's views, he is a poor \nfit for this job.\n  Mr. Smith is a very vocal and articulate critic of current election \nlaw--to say nothing of the various reform proposals introduced by \nmembers of this body. In fact, Mr. Smith is widely regarded as one of \nthe foremost critics of the current campaign finance system. He has \nwritten numerous articles on the subject, he has frequently appeared \nbefore Congressional Committees, sat on panels and has appeared on \ntelevision. Throughout the body of his writings and public appearances \nhe has been consistent: He believes the Federal Election Campaign Act \nis unworkable, unconstitutional, and undemocratic.\n  Mr Smith takes the argument one step further: he is an aggressive \nproponent of near complete deregulation of the campaign finance system \nand believes that nearly any attempts to regulate the relationship \nbetween money and elections is folly. For example, in a 1997 Georgetown \nLaw review article Mr. Smith states quote:\n\n       I have previously argued at length that campaign finance \n     regulation generally makes for bad public policy. Campaign \n     finance regulation tends to reduce the flow of information to \n     the public, to favor select elites, to hinder grass roots \n     political activity, to favor special interests, to promote \n     influence peddling, and to entrench incumbents in office.\n\n  I don't want to belabor this point. Other colleagues are speaking to \nthis issue and in all honesty it's the least of my objections to the \nnomination. But in all I would simply say this to my colleagues: I \ncannot remember a time when this body confirmed a nominee--for any \nexecutive position--who's own views were so completely at odds with the \nlaw he was meant to uphold. Mr. Smith claims that his own strong \nopinions notwithstanding he can and will enforce the law. Still, I \ndon't see how he can be true to both the law and his convictions. He \nwill be responsible for administering a law that in his view that pose \na threat to ``political liberty.'' He will be appointed to perpetuate a \nsystem that he feels was made ``more corrupt and unequal'' by the \nFederal Elections Campaign Act. Speaking for myself, I would not want \nto be charged with enforcing a law that is antithetical to everything I \nknow about politics, democracy, and good government--as Smith feels \nabout current law. But the Senate is being asked to confirm a nominee \nwith just that perspective.\n  If the FEC were simply an empty vessel, mindlessly executing the will \nof the Congress as stated in the Federal Election Campaign Act, Mr. \nSmith's extreme views would be trouble enough. But that isn't how the \nsystem works. And, in fact, the FEC has considerable leeway in \ninterpreting FECA when it issues rules. The following are three \nexamples of how a person with Smith's attitudes about the law could do \na lot of damage to the integrity of the system of regulations that \ngovern election spending:\n  No. 1. Redefining ``coordination''--Under current law, contributions \nto candidates are limited, but independent spending is unlimited. In \norder to avoid evasion of the contribution limits, the law specifies \nthat any spending that is done in coordination with a candidate counts \nas a contribution to the campaign. However, the FEC currently is \nconsidering a proposed rulemaking that would define ``coordination'' so \nnarrowly as to make it meaningless. Under the proposed rule, there \nwould be no coordination unless the FEC could prove that a candidate \nspecifically requested an expenditure, actually exercised control over \nthe expenditure, or reached an actual agreement with the candidate \nconcerning the expenditure. This rulemaking, if approved, would open a \nmassive loophole that would enable a spender to maintain high level \ncontacts with a campaign and still claim to be acting independently. \nThis is a prime example of how a Commissioner can eviscerate the law \nwhile claiming to enforce it.\n  No. 2. Neglecting to close the ``soft money'' loophole--Soft money--\nwhich the Senate has spent years trying to ban--was basically \n``created'' by an FEC interpretation of the law. Recently, a complaint \nfiled by five members of Congress and a separate complaint filed by \nPresident Clinton have urged the FEC to close the ``soft money'' \nloophole administratively. The FEC's Office of General Counsel has \nsubmitted a notice of proposed rulemaking which outlines the steps that \nthe Commission can take to close the ``soft money'' loophole if it so \nchooses. Brad Smith's view that it is unconstitutional to prohibit \n``soft money'' makes it likely that he would reject a recommendation \nfrom the General Counsel to close the ``soft money'' loophole.\n\n  No. 3. Regulation of election-related activity over the internet--The \nFEC is currently considering the whole range of issues raised by the \nuse of the internet to conduct political activity. This is a largely \nuncharted area, and the current and future FEC Commissioners will play \nan important role in determining how internet communications will be \ntreated under the law. Brad Smith's view that the federal government \nshould scrap all of its campaign\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nfinance reform efforts can be expected to strongly color his policy \njudgment about what regulations the FEC ultimately should issue in this \narea of the law.\n  I want my colleagues to be clear on this point: This nominee is no \nempty vessel. He will have the opportunity to actually shape election \nlaw through rulemaking--colleagues shouldn't kid themselves that FEC \ncommissioners can just ``follow the law'' and that their personal \nbiases don't matter. An anti-campaign finance law Commission, can \npromote anti-campaign finance law rules.\n  Mr. President, I do want to take some time to get to the heart of my \nobjection to the Smith nomination: He doesn't just disagree with the \nlaw, he disagrees with the express purpose of the law. The express \npurpose of the Federal Election Campaign Act is to limit the \ndisproportionate influence of wealthy individuals and special interest \ngroups on the outcome of federal elections; regulate spending in \ncampaigns for federal office; and deter abuses by mandating public \ndisclosure of campaign finances. Mr. Smith doesn't just quibble with \nhow the law achieves those goals, he disagrees with those goals \ncompletely! Mr. Smith believes that money--regardless of how much or \nwhere it comes from--has no corrupting or disenfranchising influence on \nelections.\n  For example lets look at what Smith wrote on the effect of money on \nhow the Congress conducts its business, on what gets considered and \nwhat doesn't, on who has power and who does not. This is from ``The \nSirens' Song: Campaign Finance Regulation and the First Amendment.'' \nSmith argues:\n\n       If campaign contributions have any meaningful effect on \n     legislative voting behavior, it appears to be on a limited \n     number of votes that are generally related to technical \n     issues arousing little public interest. On such issues, prior \n     contributions may provide the contributor with access to the \n     legislator of legislative staff. The contributor may then be \n     able to shape legislation to the extent that such efforts are \n     not incompatible with the dominant legislative motives of \n     ideology, party affiliation and agenda, and constituent \n     views. Whether the influence of campaign contributions on \n     these limited issues is good or bad depends on one's views of \n     the legislation. The exclusion of knowledgeable contributors \n     from the legislative process can just as easily lead to poor \n     legislation with unintended consequences as their inclusion. \n     But in any case, it must be stressed that such votes are few.\n\n  Let me explain what I find so chilling about this statement. It would \nbe one thing if Mr. Smith argued that money had no effect on policy. \nThat regardless of the endless anecdotes and personal testimonials of \nmembers of Congress past and present, that having lots of money on your \nside buys you no extra influence in Congress. Some members of this body \ntake that position. I think it's wrong, I think it's naive, I think the \nAmerican people see through it. In other words, it would be bad enough \nif that was Smith's view. But isn't. He asserts that money plays a role \nbut only on ``technical issues that arouse little public interest''--\nbut worse, doesn't seem to be concerned about it!\n  It does not appear to matter to Brad Smith that money affects the \nprocess on those issues that outside of the public attention! Well with \nall due respect, most of what we do takes place below the surface here! \nWe pass bills with scores of obscure provisions, hundred of pages long. \nNo one knows what they all do, we can't know. We vote on them without \nknowing. It is there that the system is most ripe for abuse, where the \ngreatest potential exists for those with the money, the clout, the \naccess to game the system, but Mr. Smith isn't much worried about it.\n  I agree with Smith that it is the small, stealth provisions which are \nmost likely to appear or disappear because of money. But where I \nstrongly disagree with Smith is that I believe that this is a problem. \nIt should be aberrational, not typical. I think it's outrageous that \nbecause a person is in a position to donate $200,000 to the NRSC or the \nDSCC that person is in a position to dictate policy--regardless of how \nobscure. I think it's wrong that a line in a bill can be bought and \npaid for with a campaign contribution. I think it's wrong that a patent \nextension or favorable tariff treatment is up for sale. Because the \nmatters are obscure, they are even more ripe for abuse. I won't speak \nfor my colleagues, but I'd like the Commissioners on the FEC to be \nconcerned with these abuses.\n  For example, I point my colleagues to an excellent article in the \nFebruary 7 issue of Time magazine entitled ``How to Become a Top \nBanana'' by Donald Barlett and James Steele. This article details how \nit came to pass that the U.S. government imposed 100% tariffs on \nobscure European imports in an ongoing attempt to force the European \nUnion to allow market access for Chiquita Bananas. As the article \nnotes, the U.S. Trade Representative imposed tariff rates on products \nessential to the economic health of several U.S. small businesses to \npromote the interests of a firm who does not even grow its bananas in \nthe United States. As it turns out, campaign contributions may have \nplayed a big role. The article concludes:\n\n       So what does the battlefield look like as the Great Banana \n     War's tariffs approach their first anniversary? Well, the \n     operators of some small businesses, like Reinert, are limping \n     along from month to month. Other small-business people are \n     filing fraudulent Customs documents to escape payment. Other \n     businesses are doing just fine because their suppliers in \n     Europe agreed to pick up the tariff or it applies to just a \n     small percentage of the goods they sell. In Europe as in \n     America, small businesses have been harmed by the U.S. \n     tariffs. Larger companies have been mostly unaffected. And \n     the European Union has kept in place its system of quotas and \n     licenses to limit Chiquita bananas. Who, then, is the winner \n     in this war?\n       That's easy. It's the President, many members of Congress \n     and the Democratic and Republican parties--all of whom have \n     milked the war for millions of dollars in campaign \n     contributions--along with the lobbyists who abetted the \n     process. A final note. While Lindner (owner of Chiquita \n     banana) had many areas of political interest beyond his \n     battle with the European Union, a partial accounting of the \n     flow of his dollars during the Great Banana War--as measured \n     by contributions of $1,000 or more--as well as lobbying \n     expenditures on the war, shows: Republicans--$4.2 million, \n     Democrats--$1.4 million Washington lobbyists--$1.5 million.\n\n  Just look at the bankruptcy bills passed by the House and the Senate. \nI'm told Committee staff refer to the provisions based on which \nindustry ``paid'' for them. This provision is for the credit card \ncompanies, this one for the real estate industry, and so on it goes. As \nthe Wall Street Journal noted on April 20 in an article entitled \n``Bankruptcy Reform Pits Industries Against Each Other'':\n\n       Lawmakers like to portray the battle over bankruptcy reform \n     as a clash of principles: stopping debtors from shirking \n     their obligations or creditors from fleecing the needy. But \n     in the back rooms of Capital Hill, the nature of the fight \n     changes. Industry lobbyists, many ostensibly allied in favor \n     of bankruptcy overhaul legislation, vie to carve out as many \n     favors for their clients as possible at the expense other \n     business groups. These contests pit auto companies against \n     credit card issuers, retailers against Realtors and the \n     Delaware bar against lawyers from the rest of the U.S.\n\n  Again, the major political parties seem to be the major winners in \nall of this (well, aside from the lenders)--and certainly not low and \nmoderate income debtors. Contributions from the lending industry to \nboth parties since 1997 tops $20 million.\n  But that doesn't much concern Mr. Smith, the man who would be in \ncharge of enforcing our campaign finance laws.\n  Smith even argues even more explicitly that tying legislation to \ncampaign contributions is not necessarily a bad thing. Or at least that \nbeing attentive to campaign contribution will make politicians more \nattentive to the public. He argues in ``A Most Uncommon Cause'':\n\n       What reformers mean by corruption is that legislators react \n     to the wishes of certain constituents, or what, in other \n     circumstances, might be called `responsiveness.' The \n     reformist position is that legislators shape their votes and \n     other activities based on campaign contributions. They call \n     this corruption. Money dominates the policy making process, \n     they argue, unfairly frustrating the popular will. . . . For \n     one this, it is proper, to some extent, for a legislator to \n     vote in ways that will please constituents, which may, from \n     the legislators viewpoint, have the beneficial effect of \n     making those constituents more likely to donate to the \n     legislators re-election campaign.''\n\n  But who does it make them more attentive to? The wealthy, the heavier \nhitters, the tiny proportion of the population who can make substantial \ncontributions to candidates. Again, the fact that Smith admits this is \nthe case is not surprising. Many critics of private money in politics \ndraw the same conclusion. What colleagues should find outrageous is \nthat Smith, again,\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\nsees nothing wrong with this relationship.\n  It is the money in politics which has stripped away from many \nAmericans the capacity to have one's vote weigh as much as the person \nin the next polling booth, to have a vote in the South Central, LA to \nbe worth as much as a vote in Beverly Hills. The vote is undermined by \nthe dollar. The vote may be equally distributed, but dollars are not. \nAs long as elections are privately financed, those who can afford to \ngive more will always have a leg up--in supporting candidates, in \nrunning for office themselves, and in gaining access and influence with \nthose who get elected. We all know this is the way it works. And the \nAmerican people know it, too.\n  Bizarrely, though, Smith argues that wealth, and therefore the \nability to affect elections is distributed equitably enough through out \nour society that the inordinate influence of money is not inordinately \nconcentrated among a small subset of the population. In a 1997 piece \nentitled ``Money Talks: Speech, Equality, and Campaign Finance'' Smith \nstates:\n\n       Very few citizens have the talent, physical and personal \n     attributes, luck of time and place, or wealth to influence \n     political affairs substantially. Thus a relatively small \n     number of individuals will always have political influence \n     far exceeding that of their neighbors. However, to the extent \n     that wealth (however that might be defined) than there are \n     citizens capable of running a political campaign, producing \n     quality political advertising, writing newspaper \n     editorials, coaching voice, and so on. In other words, it \n     may be true that more people are ``good looking'' than \n     rich, it may be true that more people are ``educated'' \n     than rich. However, the number of people capable of \n     meaningful nonmonetary contributions to a political \n     campaign--that is the type of contribution that will give \n     the individual some extra say in policy-making--is much \n     smaller than the group of monied people.\n\n  I frankly think this argument is ridiculous and insulting. It \nsuggests that if you're not a $500 an hour consultant telling the \ncandidate to wear earth tones, if you're not a big name pollster you \ncan't make a meaningful nonmonetary contribution to a political \ncampaign. No one who has actually run for office would hold this view. \nTaken to a logical extreme its effect would be to limit participation \nby those other than the monied elite--the hundred of folks who \nvolunteer at a phone bank, put up yard signs, or write letters to the \neditor. My point is that almost everyone has something to offer \nregardless of how wealthy they are.\n  But there is a larger point here; the fact that Brad Smith believes \nthat there are more people in America capable of donating $1000 than \nthere are people who can take a few afternoons to lick envelopes. I'm \nnot sure where Smith comes by this view but it obviously falls on its \nface.\n  Of course, it does explain where Smith is coming from. I mean, if you \nbelieve that money is speech and that campaign contributions profoundly \nimpacts the legislative process, you are one of two things: You are \neither a defender of a political oligarchy of the wealthy and well-\nheeled or you believe that this money, this power, is distributed \nequally throughout society. To be fair to Smith, he genuinely seems to \nhold the latter view. But while this might be a less cynical reason to \nbe comfortable with money influencing politics, he's still flat out \nwrong. In fact, he has it completely backward.\n  The picture of those who contribute the vast majority of money to \ncandidates under the current contribution limits does not look like \nAmerica, it is overwhelmingly white, male, and wealthy. A study \nconducted of donors in the `96 election found the following \ncharacteristics of such donors: 95 percent were white, 80 percent were \nmale, 50 percent were over 60 years of age and 81 percent had annual \nincomes of over $100,000. The population at large in the United States \nhad the following characteristics at that time: 17 percent was non-\nwhite, 51 percent were women, 12.8 percent were over 60, and only 4.8 \npercent had incomes over $100,000.\n  For example, the organization Public Campaign found that during the \n1996 elections, just one zip code--10021, in New York City--contributed \n$9.3 million. There are only 107,000 people in that exclusive slice of \nManhattan real estate and the vast majority (91 percent) are white. On \nthe other side of the lop-sided equation are 9.5 million residents of \nthe 483 U.S. communities that are more than 90 percent people of color. \nThey gave $5.5 million. Are these groups equal before the law?\n  Additionally, Only a spectacularly small portion of U.S. citizens \ncontribute more than $200 to political campaigns. In the first half of \n1999:\n\n       Only 4 out of every 10,000 Americans (.037%) has made a \n     contribution greater than $200.\n       As of June 30, 1999 only .022% of all Americans had given \n     $1000 to a presidential candidate.\n       In the `98 election, .06% of all Americans gave $1000, or 1 \n     in 5000.\n\n  So again, Smith has the argument precisely backward, because so few \ncan effectively participate through campaign contributions it is \ninherently unequal means of political participation. The fact that a \nfew actors--big corporations, Unions, the truly wealthy--have nearly \nlimitless funds to pour into races exacerbates the disparity between \nthe average citizen and the monied citizen. But other means of \npolitical participation are inherently limited--no matter who you are, \nthere are still no more than 24 hours in a day or seven days in a \nweek--do no one has that much of an advantage.\n  But Smith goes further than simply arguing that campaign \ncontributions can buy legislative favors, he argues in ``Money Talks'' \nthat money is speech--not in the sense that it buys speech or allows \nfor getting out the candidates message--but in the sense that making a \ncampaign contribution is an act of symbolic, political speech in of \nitself. This argument, I should point out to colleagues, goes way \nbeyond the Supreme Court's linkage between speech and money in Buckley. \nSmith argues:\n\n       The Court's rationale that contribution limits only \n     ``marginally'' burden First amendment rights is suspect on \n     its own and at odds with the traditional First Amendment \n     right of association. The Court was correct that the size of \n     a contribution does not express the underlying basis of \n     support, but wrong when it held that it involved ``little \n     direct restraint on political communication.'' Is not a \n     substantially different message communicated when a local \n     merchant pledges $10,000 to one charity (or political \n     campaign) and just $25 to another? In such an instance, is it \n     not the size of the donation, rather than the act of \n     donating, that sends the strongest message to the community? \n     It is true that the basis of support for the cause (or \n     candidate) remains vague, yet the message in each gift is \n     substantially different.\n  Combined with the fact that only a tiny percentage of voting citizens \nare making large hard money contributions (much less truly massive soft \nmoney contributions) Smith is advocating for a system where much \npolitical speech is effectively closed to most Americans because they \ncan't muster the means to make a send a loud ``message.''\n  If money equals speech, we can clearly see who we are letting do all \nthe talking--or at least those are the folks that we're listening to. \nThe hopes, dreams, concerns, and problems of the vast majority of the \nAmerican people are going unheard because the bullhorn of the $1,000 \ncontribution drowns them out. Why would be want to make that bullhorn \nbigger and louder? Why would we want to give greater access and more \ncontrol to those who already have it locked up? But that is the \ndirection that this FEC nominee would see us go in.\n  Like Smith, I too am a critic of our mechanism for financing of \nelections. This current system of funding congressional campaigns is \ninherently anti-democratic and unfair. It creates untenable conflicts \nof interests and screens out many good candidates. By favoring the deep \npockets of special interest groups, it tilts the playing field in a way \nthat sidelines the vast majority of Americans. But unlike Smith, I \nsupport reforms that would expand political participation. Unlike Smith \nI have no illusions that inequities in wealth--in a system where wealth \nrules--do not result in a distorted product.\n  In 1966 in the case of Harper versus Virginia State Board of \nElections, the Supreme Court struck down a poll tax of $1.50 in \nVirginia state elections. The Court stated in its decision that, quote, \nthe ``State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of \nany fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to \nwealth.''\n  In 1972 in Bullock versus Carter, the Court again faced the issue of \nwealth in\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nthe electoral process and again stated that such a barrier was \nunconstitutional. This time, the question concerned a system of high \nfiling fees that the state of Texas required candidates to pay, in \norder to appear on the primary ballot. The fees ranged from $150 to \n$8,900.\n  The Court invalidated the system on Equal Protection grounds. It \nfound that, with the high filing fees, quote: ``potential office \nseekers lacking both personal wealth and affluent backers are in every \npractical sense precluded from seeking the nomination of their chosen \nparty, no matter how qualified they might be and no matter how \nenthusiastic their popular support.''\n  The ``exclusionary character'' of the system also violated the \nconstitutional rights of non-affluent voters. ``We would ignore \nreality,'' the Court stated, ``were we not to find that this system \nfalls with unequal weight on voters, as well as candidates, according \nto their economic status.'' unquote. These cases may have no literal \nlegal implications for our system, where deep pockets--either one's own \nor one's political friends--are a prerequisite for success. But they do \nhave a moral implication.\n  I do believe that in America's elections today we have a wealth \nprimary, a barrier to participation to those who are not themselves \nwealthy or who refuse to buy in to monied interests. Is it an absolute \nbarrier? No. Does it mean that every candidate for federal office is \ncorrupt? No. However, the price we pay is what the economists would \ncall the ``opportunity cost.'' It is a cost represented by lost \nopportunities, by settling for those who are most electable rather than \nthose who are the best representatives of the American people. And I do \nnot believe that in a system where money equals power, inequality of \nwealth can be reconciled with equality of participation.\n  That, I say to my colleagues, is why I cannot support Mr. Smith's \nnomination. And it isn't that he is a critic of the present system. \nIndeed I agree with Smith that fixing the system is not fundamentally \nan issue of tightening already existing campaign financing laws, no \nlonger a question of what's legal and what's illegal. The real problem \nis that most of what's wrong with the current system is perfectly \nlegal.\n  Many people believe our political system is corrupted by special \ninterest money. I agree with them. It is not a matter of individual \ncorruption. I think it is probably extremely rare that a particular \ncontribution causes a member to cast a particular vote. But the special \ninterest money is always there, and I believe that we do suffer under \nwhat I have repeatedly called a systemic corruption. Unfortunately, \nthis is no longer a shocking announcement, even if it is a shocking \nfact. Money does shape what is considered do-able and realistic here in \nWashington. It does buy access. We have both the appearance and the \nreality of systemic corruption.\n  I wonder if anyone would bother to argue that the way we are moving \ntoward a balanced federal budget is unaffected by the connection of big \nspecial-interest money to politics? The cuts we are imposing most \ndeeply affect those who are least well off. That is well-documented. \nThe tax breaks we offer benefit not only the most affluent as a group, \nbut numerous very narrow wealthy special interests. Does anyone wonder \nwhy we retain massive subsidies and tax expenditures for oil and \npharmaceutical companies? What about tobacco? Are they curious why we \npromote a health care system dominated by insurance companies? Or why \nwe promote a version of ``free trade'' which disregards the need for \nfair labor and environmental standards, for democracy and human rights, \nand for lifting the standard of living of American workers, as well as \nworkers in the countries we trade with? How is it that we pass major \nlegislation that directly promotes the concentration of ownership and \npower in the telecommunications industry, in the agriculture and food \nbusiness, and in banking and securities? For the American people, how \nthis happens, I think, is no mystery.\n  For this reason, I support public financing of elections. It is a \nmatter of common sense, not to mention plain observation, that to \nwhatever extent campaigns are financed with private money, people with \nmore of it have an advantage and people with less of it are \ndisadvantaged.\n  I think most citizens believe there is a connection between big \nspecial interest money and outcomes in American politics. People \nrealize what is ``on the table'' or what is considered realistic here \nin Washington often has much to do with the flow of money to parties \nand to candidates. We must act to change this, but a vote for Smith is \nto move the FEC, and the debate over campaign finance reform, in the \nopposite direction.\n  Despite his obvious command of the law, Brad Smith has shown himself \nthrough his writings to be completely insensitive to the realities of \npolitical participation in America. He is smart enough to know better. \nThe Senate should send a message that it is smart enough to know better \ntoo. I urge a no vote.\n  Recently, a complaint was filed by five Members of Congress and a \nseparate complaint filed by President Clinton which urged the FEC to \nclose the soft money loophole. Brad Smith's view that it is \nunconstitutional to prohibit soft money makes it likely he will reject \nany recommendation from general counsel to close the soft money \nloophole.\n  Regulation of election-related activity on the Internet--the FEC is \nlooking at a whole range of issues that are based upon or deal with the \nuse of the Internet to conduct political activities. Again, I do not \nknow the potential for all the abuses and the ways in which people can \nattack and people can raise money for the attack and what they can do \non the Internet. I do know Brad Smith's view that the Federal \nGovernment should scrap all of its campaign finance reform efforts can \nbe expected to strongly color his policy judgment about what \nregulations the FEC ultimately should issue in this area of law.\n  For other colleagues who are thinking of coming to the floor, I will \nnot take a lot more time. I will reserve the remainder of my time. I \nwant to put forth a couple of points.\n  First of all, Senator Feingold and I have been in opposition. We were \npart of an agreement this nomination would come to the floor, but that \nhas to do also with the ability to get a number of judges considered. \nWe certainly need to start voting on judges.\n  I do not believe, I say to my colleagues, that these votes are \nindependent of one another. I do not think colleagues ought to be \nvoting for Brad Smith, the argument being that only if he is so \nconfirmed will judges pass. I do not believe that is part of any formal \nagreement, and it should not be a part of any informal agreement. We \nought to vote on these candidates on the basis of their qualifications. \nWe ought to be voting on them on the basis of what it is we ask them to \ndo in Government.\n  While I respect Brad Smith's intellectual ability and while I like \nhim as a person--and I am not just saying that--I believe it would be a \nterrible mistake for the Senate to confirm him. It sends a terrible \nmessage of our viewpoint of the mix of money in politics and whether or \nnot we are serious about any reform.\n  In many ways, this is the core problem--the mix of money in politics. \nI believe we have moved dangerously close to a system of democracy for \nthe few. Money has hijacked politics in this country. It is no wonder \nwe see a decline in the participation of people in public life and \npolitics. Most people believe money dominates politics, and it does.\n  I am in disagreement with Brad Smith. Money--other Senators can come \nto the floor and disagree and debate--determines all too often who gets \nto run. All too often it determines who wins the election or who loses \nthe election. All too often it determines what issues we even put on \nthe table and consider. All too often it determines the outcome of \nspecific votes on amendments or bills. All too often on a lot of the \ndetails of legislation, special interests are able to get their way. \nAll too often it is on the basis of some people, some organizations, \nsome groups having way too much wealth and power and the majority of \nthe people left out.\n  It is incredible to me. We have all become so used to this system \nthat we have forgotten the ways in which it can be so corrupting, not \nin terms of individual Senators doing wrong because someone offers them \na contribution and, therefore, a Senator votes\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nthis way or that way. I do not think that happens. I hope it does not \nhappen. I pray it does not happen.\n  I will say this. We have the worst kind of corruption of all. It is \nsystemic, and it is an imbalance between those people who have all the \nfinancial resources and the majority of people in the country who do \nnot. It is when too few of those people have way too much of the power \nand the majority of the people feel left out. When that happens, there \nis such an imbalance of access, influence, say, and power in the \ncountry that the basic standard in a democracy that each person should \ncount as one, and no more than one, is seriously violated.\n  It is interesting, I point out for colleagues, in the first half of \n1999, just looking at the contributions, only 4 out of every 10,000 \nAmericans, .03 percent, made a contribution greater than $200. As of \nJune 30, 1999, .022 percent of all Americans had given $1,000 to a \nPresidential candidate. In the 1998 election, .06 percent of all \nAmericans gave $1,000, and that was 1 in 5,000.\n  This does not even take into account all the soft money \ncontributions. This does not take into account the $500,000 and the $1 \nmillion contributions. What happens is that the vast majority of people \nin the country--I am sorry, not just poor people who do not have \nfinancial resources--the vast majority of people in the United States \nof America believe their concerns--for themselves, their families, and \ntheir communities--are of little concern in the corridors of power in \nWashington, DC, where they see a political system and a politics \ndominated by big money and, therefore, really believe they are shut \nout. We have given them entirely too much justification for that point \nof view.\n  I do not see how in the world we can vote for Brad Smith, given how \nclear he is in his opposition to reform. Given the positions he has \ntaken which go in the exact opposite direction of believing that money \nin any way, shape, or form can be corrupting of this political system \nand corrupting of democracy, we send a terrible message to people in \nthis country if we vote for this nominee.\n  Again, I am not all that excited about coming here and making these \narguments, especially when it is about an individual person. I am not \ntalking about Brad Smith; I am talking about his viewpoint. I think he \nis wrong. I would love to be in a debate with him. I probably would \nhave a tough time in a debate with him. He has a tremendous amount of \nability. It would be a fun debate. I would enjoy it.\n  The point is, you can respect someone; you can say you would love to \ndebate somebody; you appreciate their writing; you appreciate the \nspeech they have given; you appreciate the lecture they have given--I \nwas a college professor--but to see them on the Federal Election \nCommission is a different story when he is asked to implement the very \nlaws he says he does not believe in, when he is asked to be there to \nmake decisions--FEC is not an empty vessel, and he certainly is not an \nempty vessel--where key decisions are going to be made about \ncoordination, soft money, and a whole set of issues that are \ndramatically important to whether we have a democracy or not.\n  I cannot vote for him. I believe Senators should oppose this \nnomination. I do not know what the final vote will be. Maybe there will \nbe a majority vote for him, maybe there will not. His nomination is put \nforth at precisely the wrong time in the history of American politics \nin the country.\n  I say that because I believe people in this country yearn for change. \nSenator McCain is on the floor. He will be speaking later. His campaign \ncertainly tapped into that. His campaign brought that out in people. \nThat is but one powerful example.\n  People would love to have a Government they believe is their \nGovernment. They would love to have a Senate and a House of \nRepresentatives they believe belong to them. People right now--I have \nsaid it before in the Senate--believe that if you pay, you play, and if \nyou don't pay, you don't play.\n  Above and beyond this debate, I want us to get to the point where we \nmake some significant change. What is at stake on this whole reform \nquestion is basically whether or not we will continue to have a vibrant \nrepresentative democracy. If your standard is that each person should \ncount for no more than one, we have moved so far away from that \nstandard, it is frightening.\n  This may be a terrible thing to say on the floor of the Senate \nbecause I love being a Senator. I will thank Minnesota for the rest of \nmy life for giving me this chance. In many ways I think we have a \npseudodemocracy, a minidemocracy. We have participation, we have \ngovernment of, by and for maybe about 20 percent or less of the people.\n  There are many things that need to be done which can lead to \ndemocratic renewal. One of them is to get serious about the ways in \nwhich money has come to dominate politics, the ways in which we now \nhave the most severe imbalance of power we could imagine, which is \ndangerous to the very idea of representative democracy.\n  I want to see us move to a clean money-clean election. I love what \nMassachusetts has done; I love what Arizona has done; I love what Maine \nhas done; and I love what Vermont has done. I know other States want to \ndo it. If I ever get the chance, I am going to offer a bill or an \namendment that will say that every State should apply clean money-clean \nelection campaigns not only to their State races but to Federal races, \ngive the right to the States as to whether or not they want to have \nessentially a fund people can draw from--maybe everybody contributes a \nfew dollars a year--which enables people to say: By God, these are our \nelections; our voice counts; no one person and no one interest is \ndominant.\n  There will be the McCain-Feingold bill. I will be pushing hard for \nthe clean money-clean election effort. There are other people who have \nhad ideas. I want us to come out here and get serious about passing \nreform legislation. We are not there yet; I know that. I think the mode \nof power for change is going to have to come from a citizen politics; a \ncitizen politics will have to be the money politics. You will have to \nhave an engaged, energized, excited, empowered, determined citizen \npolitics that is going to force us to pass this reform legislation.\n  In the meantime, I urge colleagues not to vote for Brad Smith's \nnomination--not because he isn't a good person; he is--because of the \nbasic philosophy he holds, the basic viewpoint he holds which is so \nantithetical to reform. I think this is a test case as to whether or \nnot we are serious about the business of reform. I hope we vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nMr. Smith to the Federal Election Commission. I intend no personal \naspersions toward Mr. Smith, and I am sure he is a fine man. However, \nhe should not serve in the position to which he has been nominated. \nSending Brad Smith to the FEC is akin to confirming a conscientious \nobjector to be Secretary of Defense.\n  It would be well to put the debate we are having today and for a \nshort period tomorrow in the context of what is going on as we speak. \nTuesday, May 23, from an LA Times article, ``Democratic Fund-Raising \nKing Has 26 Million Reasons to Gloat''.\n\n       Brash, unapologetic Terry McAuliffe helps party raise \n     ``greatest amount of money ever.'' Critics decry ``political \n     extortion.''\n       Even on an average day, Terry McAuliffe is exuberant. But \n     these days, the Democrats' fund-raising master can barely \n     contain himself.\n       After six weeks of making 200 telephone calls a day, \n     attending happy-hour rallies with small time fund-raisers and \n     wooing new high-dollar givers at intimate dinners, McAuliffe \n     is on track to raise $26 million at a blue-jeans-and-barbecue \n     event at a downtown sports arena Wednesday night--``the \n     greatest amount of money ever in the history of American \n     politics.''\n       Then, turning to leave for another dinner where he would \n     woo a likely big-money contributor, McAuliffe added: ``Get \n     those checkbooks out!''\n       Although a $100,000 contribution was a benchmark in the \n     last presidential election, this time around fund-raisers are \n     collecting scores of checks for $250,000 and more from those \n     who want to qualify as political players.\n       For Wednesday night's event at Washington's MCI Center, no \n     fewer than 25 people raised or donated at least $500,000, \n     McAuliffe said.\n       By March, unregulated ``soft money'' donations to both \n     parties were soaring, with Democratic totals nearly matching \n     Republicans for the first time.\n       Officials of both parties say that the record-setting \n     inflow reflects enthusiasm for\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n     their candidates and their platforms, but the reality is more \n     complicated.\n       ``There is just raw greed on the part of the solicitors, \n     and it is corrupting,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime \n     leader in the effort to reform the nation's campaign finance \n     laws.\n       ``When you're dealing with $250,000 and $500,000 campaign \n     contributions you are flatly dealing with influence -buying \n     and -selling and with political extortion.''\n       Faced with what many would consider a daunting task, the \n     callers appeared driven by a mix of humor, commitment, \n     swagger and chutzpah.\n       ``I want to ask you a question,'' McAuliffe told one donor \n     on the phone. ``If the world blew up tomorrow would you do \n     500?'' meaning $500,000.\n       ``We should have gone for RFK,'' McAuliffe bellowed, \n     referring to the 50,000-seat stadium that once housed the \n     NFL's Washington Redskins.\n       But when one top DNC donor inquired about getting a second \n     table at the event, McAuliffe said, ``For 500 grand, I think \n     we could give him two tables.\n       In the few in-depth conversations . . . donors seem more \n     interested in talking about pet legislative issues than \n     about the merits of the Democrats' presidential nominee, \n     Al Gore.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the context in which we are considering the \nnomination of a man who has written extensively and spoken, not very \npersuasively, on the fact of no regulation whatsoever concerning the \nrole of money in American politics. We know that the role of the FEC is \nto ``administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulate policy \nwith respect to'' the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  The FEC has the exclusive authority with respect to civil enforcement \nof the act. Clearly, then, it is obvious that FEC Commissioners should \nbe dedicated to the proposition of Federal election regulation. Each \nCommissioner must be committed to ensuring a fair and open election \nprocess which is not tainted by the appearance of impropriety. Each \nCommissioner must be prepared to--I emphasize--uphold the law and \npreserve its intent by prohibiting the use and proliferation of \nloopholes.\n  I do not believe Mr. Smith has a philosophical commitment to \nupholding the intent of the law necessary to perform the duties of an \nFEC Commissioner. In fact, Mr. Smith has been highly critical of \ncampaign reform. It is not that Mr. Smith simply disagrees with \nparticular details of campaign finance reform. He disagrees with the \nbasic premise that campaigns should be regulated at all--a distinctly \nand unique minority position in America--or that campaign contributions \nplay any part in public cynicism of our political system.\n  I read from a March 17, 1997, article that Mr. Smith wrote, published \nin the Wall Street Journal. It is entitled ``Why Campaign Finance \nReform Never Works.'' The title says it all in terms of his philosophy. \nApparently, Mr. Smith never heard of Theodore Roosevelt.\n  I quote from his article, Mr. President:\n\n       In fact, constitutional or not, campaign finance reform has \n     turned out to be bad policy. For most of our history, \n     campaigns were essentially unregulated, yet democracy \n     survived and flourished. However, since passage of the \n     Federal Elections Campaign Act and similar State laws, the \n     influence of special interests has grown, voter turnout has \n     fallen, and incumbents have become tougher to dislodge. . . .\n\n  Apparently, Mr. Smith lived in some other nation during the Watergate \nscandal, when unlimited amounts of money would be carried around this \ntown in valises, when corporations and companies and individuals were \nliterally being extorted for money which was unaccounted for. \nApparently, Mr. Smith missed the widespread, nationwide revulsion at \nthese abuses, which brought about the campaign finance reform laws of \n1974. Apparently, Mr. Smith was not seeking public office, as I was in \n1982, when there was no such thing as soft money, where we had to go \nout and raise small amounts of money from many, many donors, where we \nhad to conduct the kind of grassroots campaign to which Americans have \ngrown accustomed. Perhaps Mr. Smith was not aware that, until late into \nthe 1980s, campaigns were conducted in a very different fashion than \ntoday.\n  Not recognizing any role that creative evasion of the laws has played \nin these results, Mr. Smith concludes his article by writing:\n\n       When a law is in continual revision to close a series of \n     everchanging ``loopholes,'' it is probably the law, and not \n     the people, that is in error. The most sensible reform is a \n     simple one--\n\n  I am quoting from Mr. Smith's article in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the \n     Federal Elections Campaign Act.\n\n  That is a remarkable statement, a remarkable statement, from one who \nis required in his new position to enforce the very law that he wants \nrepealed. Remarkable, Mr. President, remarkable.\n  Is someone who advocates a total repeal of the very law he would be \nenforcing as a Commissioner the right person for this job? \nAdditionally, what job, over time, does not need revision or \nreauthorization? I am pleased to be the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee. We spend a great deal of time reauthorizing agencies of \nGovernment. That is an important part of our duties because time and \ncircumstances and technology and issues change. For Mr. Smith to \nsomehow condemn a law that is as important as the Federal Election \nCampaign Act because it needs to be reviewed, revised, and renewed, is, \nof course, showing incredible ignorance of the way that Congress \nfunctions.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. In January 1998, Mr. \nSmith authored an article for USA Today. In that article, he said:\n\n       The First Amendment was based on the belief that political \n     speech was too important to be regulated by the government. \n     Campaign finance laws operate on the directly contrary \n     assumption that campaigns are so important that speech must \n     be regulated. . . . The solution to the campaign finance \n     dilemma is to recognize the flawed assumptions of the \n     campaign finance reformers, dismantle the Federal Elections \n     Campaign Act, and the FEC bureaucracy, and take seriously the \n     system of campaign finance ``regulation'' that the Founding \n     Fathers wrote into the Bill of Rights: ``Congress shall make \n     no law abridging the freedom of speech.''\n\n  Is Mr. Smith ignoring the fact that President Theodore Roosevelt led \nthe fight to enact meaningful reform in 1907? Is Mr. Smith ignoring the \nfact that Republican majorities in Congress led the fight to prohibit \nunion campaigns and corporate contributions to American political \ncampaigns? Is Mr. Smith ignorant of the fact that the overwhelming \nmajority of both Houses of Congress enacted comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform in 1974? I stand proudly by Theodore Roosevelt in \nbelieving the 1907 reforms were valid. Mr. Smith does not.\n  Apparently, Mr. Smith missed, or has not heard of, the recent \ndecision of the U.S. Supreme Court which directly repudiates Mr. \nSmith's assertions. I also find it curious that a person would hold \nviews that have been directly repudiated by the U.S. Supreme Court--not \nholding their views as to the validity or his commitment to them, but \ncertainly it is hard for me to understand how he would hold views that \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, in their appointed duties, has ruled as \nconstitutional.\n  In one of the comments made by the U.S. Supreme Court, in U.S. \nSupreme Court decisions, at the end of part B, the U.S. Supreme Court \ngoes out of its way to even mention Mr. Smith:\n\n       There might, of course, be need for a more extensive \n     evidentiary documentation if petitioners had made any showing \n     of their own to cast doubt on the apparent implications of \n     Buckley's evidence and the record here, but the closest \n     respondents come to challenging these conclusions is their \n     invocation of academic studies said to indicate that large \n     contributions to public officials or candidates do not \n     actually result in changes in candidate's positions. Brief \n     for Respondents Shrink Missouri Government PAC; Smith, Money \n     Talks: Speech, Corruption, Equality, and Campaign Finance; \n     Smith, Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences of \n     Campaign Finance Reform. Other studies, however, point the \n     other way.\n\n  Obviously, the U.S. Supreme Court did not agree with Mr. Smith's \nconclusions. If Mr. Smith were intellectually honest, he would note in \nhis next upholding of his view that his view has been directly \nrepudiated by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Another example. In light of Senator Thompson's investigation in the \n1996 finance scandal, the unfettered buying and selling of influence, \nwhich the Clinton-Gore campaign practiced, such as overnight stays at \nthe White House, selling seats on foreign trade missions, and receiving \nmoney from foreign governments, what Mr. Smith wrote in USA Today on \nJuly 8, 1997, was this:\n\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\n\n       Campaign reform is not about good government. It's about \n     silencing people whose views are inconvenient to those with \n     power. . . . The real campaign-finance scandal has little to \n     do with Senator Fred Thompson's investigation. The real \n     scandal is the brazen effort of reformers to silence the \n     American people.\n\n  I have been around here a lot of years. An allegation of that nature, \neven though I have been here for some period of time, I find very \noffensive. I repeat what Mr. Smith said:\n\n       The real scandal is the brazen effort of reformers to \n     silence the American people.\n\n  I think the record is clear of not only my advocacy but my service to \nthis Nation on behalf of free speech, and certainly to argue that those \nof us who have a different opinion than Mr. Smith are conducting a \nbrazen effort to silence the American people is obviously something \nthat not only do I find offensive, but something that I find \ndisqualifying in Mr. Smith.\n  It is clear that Mr. Smith believes there is no such thing as \nappropriate campaign finance reform. He believes that all campaign \ncontributions, spending, and influence peddling are protected without \nlimitation. He has advocated time and again the repeal of the very law \nhe would be sworn to uphold and enforce. How can we seriously consider \nconfirming his nomination to serve as a Commissioner?\n  I would like to say a word about his really inappropriate remarks \nabout Senator Fred Thompson's advice. Senator Fred Thompson's \ninvestigation got into some very serious issues, such as breach of \nnational security, such as foreign influence peddling, such as \nunlimited amounts of money coming in from foreign nations to influence \nour political process. Whether most Americans believe Senator \nThompson's conclusions were correct, I think they certainly agreed it \nwas an appropriate action. In fact, it was agreed to by both \nRepublicans and Democrats that Senator Thompson's investigative \nhearings take place.\n  Mr. Smith says, ``The real scandal is the brazen effort of reformers \nto silence the American people.'' That is a remarkable statement among \nmany remarkable statements Mr. Smith has made.\n  Others are equally concerned about Mr. Smith's suitability to serve \non the FEC. The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University \nSchool of Law has this to say. This is the Brennan Center for Justice \nat the New York University School of Law:\n\n       Imagine the President nominating an Attorney General who \n     believes that most of our criminal laws are `profoundly \n     undemocratic' and unconstitutional. Or an SEC Commissioner \n     who has publicly called for the repeal of all securities laws \n     with the plea, `We should deregulate and just let it go.' Or \n     a nominee for EPA Administrator who believes that the agency \n     he aspires to head and `its various state counterparts' \n     should be abolished. It would be unthinkable. In a society \n     rooted in the rule of law, we would never tolerate the \n     appointment of a law enforcement officer who has vocally and \n     repeatedly denounced the very laws he would be called upon to \n     enforce, much less one who has called for the repeal of those \n     laws and the abolition of the very agency he aspires to head.\n       `Unthinkable. Yet, President Clinton, at the urging of \n     Senator Lott and Senator McConnell, has nominated Bradley A. \n     Smith to fill one of the vacancies on the Federal Election \n     Commission. Brad Smith, a law professor at Capital University \n     Law School, has devoted his career to denouncing the FEC and \n     the laws it is entrusted to enforce in precisely those \n     strident terms. He believes that virtually the entire body of \n     the nation's campaign finance law is fundamentally flawed and \n     unworkable-indeed, unconstitutional. He has forcefully \n     advocated deregulation of the system. And if the James Watt \n     of campaign finance had his way, the FEC and its state \n     counterparts, would do little more than serve as a file \n     drawer for disclosure reports . . .\n       Brad Smith's sponsors and supporters are floating the myth \n     that it is campaign finance reformers, rather than Smith, who \n     are the radicals on these issues. However, the Supreme Court \n     only last month in Shrink Missouri cited two of Smith's \n     academic articles by name in its opinion and then repudiated \n     his view that there is no danger of corruption or the \n     appearance of corruption from large campaign contributions. \n     However, we do not need the U.S. Supreme Court to tell us \n     that Brad Smith is a radical, who is out of step with the \n     mainstream. In his own words, when he was approached about \n     serving on the FEC, Smith stated: `My first thought was \n     ``they've got to be just looking at me put my name on the \n     list so that whoever they really want will look less \n     radical.'' Even Smith did not believe, at first, that the \n     Republicans would seriously put forward his name for this \n     position because his views are so extreme. . .\n       Brad Smith and his supporters have asserted that, although \n     Smith personally disagrees with much of the law, he can \n     nevertheless be counted on to faithfully enforce it. One is \n     forced to ask, however, why an academic who has made his \n     career by criticizing the nation's election laws would want \n     the job of stoically enforcing those laws? The answer, of \n     course, is that Brad Smith recognizes that federal election \n     law, like any complex regulatory regime, is open to \n     interpretation and it is the process of interpretation that \n     gives the law its meaning. Brad Smith's goal, whenever there \n     is any room for interpretation, will doubtless be to allow \n     federal campaign finance law to whither on the vine. And any \n     member of Congress that supports additional campaign finance \n     regulations--such as McCain-Feingold or Shays-Meehan, should \n     be very troubled by the prospect that the rules and \n     regulations governing their implementation might be drafted \n     by such an arch-nemesis of those reforms.\n\n  I think there are a couple of additional points to be made here. One \nis, how can the President of the United States be committed to finance \nreform and submit Mr. Smith's name? That nominating process comes from \nthe President of the United States. The next time you hear the \nPresident of the United States reiterate his commitment to meaningful \ncampaign finance reform, remember the type of person who was nominated \nby the President of the United States for this position.\n  In deference to the President of the United States, we have a little \nunwritten rule that the President gets to appoint some and the \nmajority--in this case, the Republicans--appoint others. The President \nstill had the ability and the authority to reject this most extreme \nnominee for any position that I have seen in my years here since 1987.\n  There is another point that I think is important. Why would someone \nwho disagrees with campaign finance laws, who believes they should be \nscrapped, and who believes fundamentally they are unconstitutional--not \njust the personal dislike but a firmly held tenet that all campaign \nfinance laws should be scrapped and are unconstitutional--how in the \nworld could you then expect someone to face a fundamental contradiction \nof their basic beliefs that a law is unconstitutional and yet seek the \nposition where his sole duties are to enforce those laws? How Mr. Smith \ncould even take an oath to uphold the same laws of which he has time \nand again rejected and advocated their repeal is a mystery.\n  What does that say? Either he is willing and able to cast aside \nlifelong beliefs and principles in order to hold a prestigious position \nor he is less than sincere in undertaking enforcement of campaign \nreforms or enforcing existing law.\n  President Reagan once said no to a Democrat whose name was submitted. \nPresident Clinton could have done the same. I say, shame on you, Mr. \nPresident, for not rejecting this name.\n  Let me be perfectly clear that I do not oppose Mr. Smith simply \nbecause he disagrees with my proposed legislation. Many of my closest \nfriends take issue with aspects of McCain-Feingold. I respect the \nopinion of others, and I respect the right of Mr. Smith to hold a view \ncontrary to mine. It is because he objects to any form of campaign \nfinance regulation that I oppose him.\n  If you took a poll of the 100 Members of this body, I don't think you \nwould find more than perhaps 1 who would hold the view that Mr. Smith \ndoes. My friends on both sides of the aisle at least say we need some \nform of campaign finance reform. Most are offended by this latest \nloophole called 527. Most find it egregious that we now have $500,000 \ncontributors. Most of them believe the money chase has lurched out of \ncontrol to the point where, by actual acts of commission and omission, \nyoung Americans have become cynical and alienated from the political \nprocess. The 1996 election had the lowest voter turnout of 18- to 26-\nyear-olds than at any time in the history of this country.\n  There was recently a poll taken by the Pugh Research Center--which I \nwill submit for the Record at a later time--which showed that 67 \npercent of young Americans say they are disconnected from government. \nAnd the reason given is the influence of special interests and big \nmoney in Washington. The system cries out for reform, if not for \nMcCain-Feingold, then some other vision of reform.\n\n  Mr. Smith believes campaign finance reform is not about good \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\nIt is about silencing people whose views are inconvenient to those with \npower. The real scandal, Mr. Smith says, is the brazen effort of \nreformers to silence the American people.\n  A statement such as this impugns the motives of many millions of good \nand decent Americans who believe this reform is necessary in a \nremarkable way. I do not impugn the motives of Mr. Smith. I disagree \nwith him. I do not believe Mr. Smith is trying to silence the American \npeople. I do believe he is wrong in his positions and he is wrong for \nthis job.\n  It is because he objects to any form of campaign regulation that I \noppose him, because he can acknowledge all the examples of campaign \nabuse witnesses in the 1996 election, as he did in an article published \nby the American Jewish Committee in December 1997, and still he \ncontends that the only reform necessary is deregulation. So those kinds \nof abuses become the norm.\n  In that article he cited the many unsavory examples of fundraising by \nthe Clinton-Gore campaign. He goes on to say:\n\n       Yet, we now see, on videotape and in White House photos, \n     shots of the President of the United States meeting with arms \n     merchants and drug dealers; we learn of money being laundered \n     through Buddhist nuns and Indonesian gardeners; we read that \n     the acquaintance of the President are fleeing the country or \n     threatening to assert Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid \n     testifying before Congress. . . .\n\n  What troubles me most abut Mr. Smith is that, after acknowledging all \nof these incidents, he concludes that since campaign reform has not \neliminated those abuses, we should simply give up and allow a free for \nall. That's like saying, ``Since the laws against murder haven't \neliminated murders, we should simply legalize murders.'' Or, ``Since \nthe country's drug laws haven't been enforced sufficiently to eliminate \nillegal drug deals, we should simply legalize drug use.''\n  Is someone with that kind of attitude the right person for the job? I \ndon't think so, and I cannot believe that my colleagues can in good \nfaith and with a straight face assert that he is.\n  It should be a grave concern to my colleagues that Brad Smith \nconcedes all of the facts of the 1966 campaign scandal, but apparently \nsees nothing wrong with perpetuating and legalizing those wrongs. I do \nnot believe the American public concurs.\n  Mr. Smith advocates anything goes in election campaigns and says no \ntactic is too unseemly, too corrupt to be protected by the first \namendment of the Constitution. By the way, I believe it was Justice \nStevens who said in his opinion in the Shrink Missouri decision that \nmoney is property, money is not free speech.\n  I do not agree that our Founding Fathers could have intended such a \nresult any more than prosecuting someone yelling ``fire'' in a crowded \ntheater. The Supreme Court has concurred in the recent Shrink Missouri \ndecision in upholding the State of Missouri's campaign contribution \nlimits. The Court reiterated its determination from their earlier \nBuckley v. Valeo decision that the prevention of corruption and the \nappearance of corruption is a constitutionally sufficient justification \nfor limiting contributions as a form of speech.\n  Mr. Smith's position is in direct contradiction to what the U.S. \nSupreme Court stated in Shrink Missouri. I repeat, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt said the prevention of corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption is a constitutionally sufficient justification for limiting \ncontributions as a form of speech.\n\n       In speaking of ``improper influence'' and ``opportunities \n     for abuse'' in addition to ``quid pro quo'' arrangements, we \n     recognized a concern not confined to bribery of public \n     officials, but extending to the broader threat from \n     politicians too compliant with the wishes of large \n     contributors. These were the obvious points behind our \n     recognition that the Congress could constitutionally address \n     the power of money ``to influence governmental action'' in \n     ways less ``blatant and specific'' than bribery.\n\n  As Justice Stevens said in his concurring opinion in the Shrink case, \nresponding to the arguments raised by Justice Kennedy in his dissent:\n\n       Justice Kennedy suggests that the misuse of soft money \n     tolerated by this Court's misguided decision in Colorado \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election \n     Commission, demonstrates the need for a fresh examination of \n     the constitutional issues raised by Congress' enactment of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Acts of 1971 and 1974 and this \n     Court's resolution of those issues in Buckley v. Valeo. In \n     response to his call for a new beginning, therefore, I make \n     one simple point. Money is property; it is not speech.\n       Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a \n     multitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a battleground, or \n     even on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has the power to \n     pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks. It does not \n     follow, however, that the First Amendment provides the same \n     measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such \n     goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same \n     results.\n\n  I find it incredible that a law professor speaking on the topic of \nconstitutionality of campaign finance reform would not cite the most \nrecent Supreme Court ruling and opinion pertinent to the topic. Yet, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court issued its ruling in \nthe Shrink case in January of this year, in Mr. Smith's testimony \nduring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Rules Committee in \nMarch offered no recognition that the Supreme Court had most recently \nupheld campaign contribution limitations. He made no attempt to \nrenounce his earlier writings or opinions based upon the opinion. He \nmade no acknowledgment that the Supreme Court had recently reached a \nconclusion as to the constitutionality of contribution limitations at \nodds with his views. Instead, he focused his presentation on the \nuncertainty of the law, and in particular the confusion surrounding the \nBuckley opinion. This, even though the Supreme Court had in Shrink \nreiterated and clarified the state of the law. Perhaps it was because \nhe had not read the Shrink opinion, a disturbing omission for a law \nschool professor--or perhaps simply because he disagrees with it. In \neither case, I find the omission troubling and indicative of why Mr. \nSmith would be unsuitable as an FEC Commissioner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Senate Committee on Rules, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McConnell and Senator Dodd: While Common \n     Cause believes the Committee and the Senate would have been \n     better served with full and open hearings regarding the \n     nomination of Bradley A. Smith to be commissioner to the \n     Federal Election Committee (FEC), I request that this letter \n     be made part of the record.\n       Common Cause strongly urges the Committee to reject the \n     nomination of Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital \n     University in Ohio, to serve on the Federal Election \n     Commission. Mr. Smith has written extensively about the need \n     to deregulate the campaign finance system, has stated that \n     the FEC should be abolished, and has written that the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act (FECA) is unconstitutional. Clearly, as \n     someone who strongly opposes the law he would be duty-bound \n     to uphold and administer impartially, Mr. Smith should not be \n     confirmed.\n       The FEC was created for the sole purpose of upholding and \n     enforcing the FECA. Mr. Smith, however, strongly believes \n     that the Act should be repealed. In a 1997 op-ed published in \n     The Wall Street Journal, Smith stated: ``When a law is in \n     need of continual revision to close a series of ever-changing \n     `loopholes,' it is probably the law, and not the people, that \n     is in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal \n     of the Federal Election Campaign Act.''\n       Elimination of FECA would repeal, among other provisions, \n     the ban on corporate and labor union contributions to federal \n     candidates, the limits on individual and PAC contributions to \n     federal candidates, the ban on foreign contributions to \n     federal candidates, the ban on cash contributions of more \n     than $100 to federal candidates, and the prohibition on \n     federal officeholders converting campaign contributions to \n     personal use.\n       In short, repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act would \n     return this country to the days before Watergate when \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were being given \n     directly to candidates from undisclosed wealthy contributors.\n       Any member of a federal regulatory agency should, at a \n     minimum, believe in the mission of that agency, and the \n     constitutionality of those laws. Not only does Mr. Smith \n     demonstrate utter contempt for the agency, he also \n     demonstrates his comprehensive hostility to the federal \n     campaign finance laws--laws which he believes are wrong, \n     burdensome, and unconstitutional.\n       Mr. Smith is on record stating that federal campaign \n     finance laws are, in their entirety, unconstitutional. He has \n     written that ``FECA and its various state counterparts are \n     profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the First \n     Amendment.''\n       Smith also wrote: ``The solution is to recognize the flawed \n     assumptions of the campaign finance reformers, dismantle FECA\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n     and the FEC bureaucracy, and take seriously the system of \n     campaign finance regulation that the Founders wrote into the \n     Bill of Rights: `Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \n     the freedom of speech.' ''\n       Any individual who believes that an agency's organic \n     statute is unconstitutional and should be repealed in toto, \n     is not fit to serve as a Commissioner of the agency charged \n     with administering and enforcing that statute.\n       No one, for example, would conceive of appointing to head \n     the Drug Enforcement Agency an individual who believes all \n     federal anti-drug laws are unconstitutional and should be \n     repealed. Such an appointment would be viewed as an act of \n     utter disdain and disrespect for the laws to be administered \n     by the agency involved.\n       Mr. Smith believes the federal campaign finance laws are \n     not only unconstitutional, but misguided in their very \n     purpose. In supporting repeal of the campaign finance laws, \n     he has written that the country ``would best be served by \n     deregulating the electoral process.''\n       Mr. Smith's ideas are not simply a matter of whether one \n     takes a liberal or conservative view of the existing campaign \n     finance laws. What is at stake here is whether the law will \n     be administered and enforced to its full extent. While Mr. \n     Smith's ideas may be appropriate for an academic \n     participating in public debate, they are wholly unacceptable \n     for a Commissioner charged with administering and enforcing \n     the nation's anti-corruption laws enacted by Congress and \n     upheld by the Supreme Court. The purpose of the FEC is not to \n     be a debating society. The role of a FEC Commissioner is not \n     to be an advocate.\n       Indeed, Mr. Smith fails even to accept the fundamental \n     anti-corruption rationale for the campaign finance laws--the \n     rationale that was at the very heart of the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Buckley v. Valeo, upholding the constitutionality \n     of the existing campaign finance laws, and which was \n     reaffirmed this year by the Supreme Court in Nixon v. Shrink \n     Missouri Government PAC. In that case, Justice David Souter, \n     writing for the majority, stated ``There is little reason to \n     doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual \n     corruption of our political system, and no reason to question \n     the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.''\n       Mr. Smith dismisses the rationale by writing that ``money's \n     alleged corrupting effects are far from proven . . . that \n     portion of Buckley that relies on the anti-corruption \n     rationale is itself the weakest portion of the Buckley \n     opinion--both in its doctrinal foundations and in its \n     empirical ramifications.''\n       The FECA requires the members of the Federal Election \n     Commission shall be chosen ``on the basis of their \n     experience, integrity, impartiality, and good judgment.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. 437c(a)(3). While we believe President Clinton would \n     have been within precedent to reject the recommendation from \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) of Mr. Smith's \n     nomination (President Reagan rejected a proposed FEC nominee \n     in 1985), the Committee now has the responsibility to judge \n     whether Mr. Smith meets these criteria.\n       Mr. Smith is in no way ``impartial'' about the campaign \n     finance laws. He simply does not believe in them.\n       Mr. Smith's extreme opposition to the existence of the \n     federal campaign finance laws, and his clearly stated views \n     that they are unconstitutional, make him unfit to serve as a \n     Commissioner of the FEC.\n       Common Cause strongly urges the Committee to vote against \n     Mr. Smith's nomination. A vote to confirm Mr. Smith is a vote \n     against campaign finance reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Scott Harshbarger,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       The Wrong Man for the Job\n\n             (By Fred Wertheimer, President, Democracy 21)\n\n       Would an individual who believes the nation's drug laws \n     should be repealed and are unconstitutional be appointed to \n     head the Drug Enforcement Agency?\n       No way.\n       Would the United States Senate confirm an individual with \n     these views to be the nation's chief drug law enforcement \n     official?\n       Absolutely not.\n       Then, what in the world is Bradley Smith's name doing \n     pending before the Senate for confirmation to serve as a \n     Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission (FEC)?\n       Mr. Smith--who has stated that the nation's campaign \n     finance laws should be repealed and are unconstitutional--was \n     nominated by President Clinton earlier this month to serve on \n     the FEC, the agency responsible for enforcing the nation's \n     campaign finance laws.\n       That's the same President Clinton who is a self-proclaimed \n     supporter of campaign finance laws and campaign finance \n     reform.\n       The Smith nomination was dictated by Senate Republican \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott and Senator Mitch McConnell, the \n     leading Senate defenders of the corrupt campaign finance \n     status quo in Washington, and Smith's two leading advocates \n     for the Commission job.\n       President Clinton lamely explained his nomination of Smith, \n     a strong opponent of federal campaign finance laws, on the \n     grounds that he was just following custom in ceding to the \n     other major party the ability to name three of the six FEC \n     Commissioners. In fact, however, when the Republicans held \n     the White House, President Reagan had no problem rejecting \n     the appointment of an FEC nominee of the Democrats that he \n     found to be objectionable.\n       So what are the potential consequences of Clinton's \n     campaign finance betrayal if the Senate confirms Smith to \n     serve on the Commission?\n       Here is what Bradley Smith has said about the nation's \n     campaign finance laws: ``[T]he most sensible reform is a \n     simple one: repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA).''\n       And, here is what Mr. Smith's ``reform'' would accomplish: \n     repeal of the ban on corporate contributions to federal \n     candidates; repeal of the ban on labor union contributions to \n     federal candidates, and repeal of the limits on contributions \n     from individuals and PACs to federal candidates.\n       Mr. Smith's ``reform'' also would repeal the system for \n     financing our presidential elections, the ban on \n     officeholders and candidates pocketing campaign contributions \n     for their personal use, the ban on cash contributions of more \n     than $100, and various other provisions enacted to protect \n     the integrity of our democracy.\n       Mr. Smith also has stated that the federal campaign finance \n     law, known as the FECA, is ``profoundly undemocratic and \n     profoundly at odds with the First Amendment.''\n       Mr. Smith's position that the FECA, and its contribution \n     limits, are unconstitutional, however, is directly \n     contradicted by numerous Supreme Court decisions.\n       Just last month, for example, the Supreme Court reaffirmed \n     in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC that contribution \n     limits are constitutional.\n       The Court cited ``the prevention of corruption and the \n     appearance of corruption'' as the rationale for upholding \n     contribution limits, a rationale that Smith firmly rejects.\n       Justice Souter, writing for six of the nine Justices \n     including Chief Justice Rehoquist, stated, ``Leave the \n     perception of impropriety unanswered and the cynical \n     assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize \n     the willingness of voters to take part in democratic \n     governance.''\n       Mr. Smith, it goes without saying, is entitled to hold and \n     express whatever views and philosophy he may have about \n     campaign finance laws.\n       It should also go without saying, however, that the \n     American people are entitled to have law enforcement \n     officials who believe in the validity and constitutionality \n     of the laws they are charged to enforce, and who do not view \n     these laws with total disdain and hostility.\n       As The Washington Post noted in an editorial, Smith's \n     premises ``are contrary to the founding premises of the \n     commission on which he would serve. He simply does not \n     believe in the federal election law.''\n       And, The New York Times wrote in an editorial that Smith's \n     stated positions ``make plain that his agenda as a commission \n     member would be a further dismantling of reasonable campaign \n     limits intended to curb the corrupting influence of big money \n     rather than serious enforcement of current campaign finance \n     laws.''\n       Mr. Smith's nomination is a classic symbol of the breakdown \n     in law enforcement that has occurred when it comes to the \n     nation's campaign finance laws. Mr. Smith's confirmation to \n     be an FEC Commissioner would be an insult to the American \n     people.\n       United States Senators should not allow this to happen.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see my friend and comrade in arms, \nSenator Feingold. Let me mention what is going on not only as far as \nthe fundraiser is concerned, but recently we received information there \nwill be a hearing tomorrow before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee and \non Thursday before the House Government Reform Committee.\n\n       According to a December 9, 1996, memo by FBI Director Louis \n     J. Freeh, Mr. Radek [head of Justice Office of Public \n     Integrity] told Mr. Esposito [who was a deputy director of \n     the FBI] he was ``under a lot of pressure not to go forward \n     with the investigation,'' and that Ms. Reno's job ``might \n     hang in the balance.'' The memo said Mr. Freeh met with Ms. \n     Reno and personally suggested she and Mr. Radek recuse \n     themselves from the probe.\n\n  What we are talking about here is a situation that, if campaign \nfinance laws had been obeyed and enforced, we would not be subjected to \nas a nation; that is, disturbing allegations that information was \nbrought by the FBI, the Director of the FBI, Mr. Louis Freeh, and by \nMr. Charles LaBella, who was appointed as the head of the task force to \ninvestigate these very allegations by the Attorney General herself--\nthose recommendations were ignored by the Attorney General. The \nrecommendation for the appointment of an independent counsel was \nignored by the Attorney General of the United States. A recommendation \nby Mr. Freeh was not accepted by the Attorney General of the United \nStates and, according to the Deputy Director of the FBI, Mr. Radek, \nwhose office is described as the Office\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nof Public Integrity in the Justice Department, he said he was ``under a \nlot of pressure not to go forward with the investigation''--I wonder \nwho from--and that Ms. Reno's job ``might hang in the balance.''\n  This is the pernicious effect of a campaign finance system which has \nrun amok. That is not confined to the Democratic Party. There have been \nabuses on my side as well because this system knows no party \nidentification. This system knows only the increasing avariciousness of \na system that has run amok.\n  We are now about to confirm as one of those whose appointment is to \nenforce the law someone who is adamantly opposed to the law, believes \nthe law is unconstitutional. And we are in a situation in America today \nthat, in the view of more objective observers than I, can only be \ncompared to the turn of the century when the robber barons of this \nNation, through huge input of contributions to political campaigns, had \nbasically bought the American Congress. Thanks to the brave and \ncourageous efforts of one Theodore Roosevelt, joined by millions of \nother like-minded reformers, we brought an end to that corruption.\n\n  Now we are about to appoint to that body an individual who will not \nonly not be opposed, who will not only not support trying to clean up \nthis system, but will try to remove the last vestiges of campaign \nfinance reform law as it exists today. All I can say is it is a 5-year \nappointment. He will not be there forever. We will have campaign \nfinance reform.\n  As my colleagues know, I recently completed an unsuccessful campaign \nfor the nomination of my party for the Presidency of the United States. \nIt was one of the most rewarding and uplifting experiences of my life. \nI learned many things during that campaign. I will not clutter the \nRecord with the lessons I learned.\n  When I began the campaign, I said the theme of my campaign would be \nreform. Every political pundit said there was no room for reform in the \npolitical agenda. In hundreds of townhall meetings and thousands of \nspeeches, I said: Campaign finance reform is the linchpin; if we want \nto reform education, if we want to reform the military, if we want to \nreform the Tax Code, if we want to reform the institutions of \ngovernment, we must get this Government out of the hands of the special \ninterests and back to the people. I believe that message resonated then \nand resonates to this day.\n  We are about to appoint an individual now in complete contradiction \nto what I believe is strongly the will of the people, not only that \nexisting laws be enforced but new laws be enacted in order to close the \nloopholes that have been created since the passage of the 1974 law.\n  We, in our wisdom, are about to appoint an individual who flies in \nthe face of everything I learned in my campaign, despite a clear voice \nfrom the American people, particularly from our young, particularly \nfrom our young citizens to whom, sooner rather than later, we will pass \nthe torch of leadership of this Nation, who have become cynical and \neven alienated from the political process--not without good reason.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from Vermont. I \nmight say to the Senator from Vermont, I had a wonderful day in his \nState long ago, where he is well respected and well loved by the \ncitizens of his State. I appreciate the opportunity, always, to be in \nlovely Montpelier. I thank him and his fellow citizens for all their \nhospitality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ntake 7 minutes of the 15 minutes that is reserved to the Senator from \nVermont on the Timothy Dyk nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Arizona is still on \nthe floor, I was going to say at the beginning of my remarks, the \nVermont press showed very clearly how well respected the Senator from \nArizona is in Vermont and how well received he was. He was one of the \nbiggest vote getters our State has ever had. He did an extremely good \njob. He won his party's primary overwhelmingly. In Vermont his victory \nwas declared within, I think, 5 minutes after the polls closed on \nprimary day because the number was so overwhelming.\n  I say this because, while I was not at the convention where he spoke, \nas he can imagine--it was the Republican State convention--many of my \ndear friends and supporters were there. They told me also how much they \nrespected what the Senator from Arizona said, as they had when he had \nbeen in Burlington earlier in his campaign and spoke to an overflow \ncrowd. Montpelier is where I was born, so I always watch what happens \nthere. I say to my friend from Arizona, the calls and e-mails I got \nafter his appearance about him were all positive.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Timothy B. Dyk\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ngoing to vote this week on the confirmation of Timothy Dyk.\n  A vote on this nominee has been a long time coming. He was first \nnominated to a vacancy on the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in April \nof 1998--over 2 years ago--by some reckonings, in the last century. He \nhad a hearing. He was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee of \nthe Senate in September of 1998. His nomination was left on the Senate \ncalendar that year without any action and eventually was returned to \nthe President, 2 years ago as the 105th Congress adjourned.\n  Then Mr. Dyk was renominated in January of 1999. He was favorably \nreported to the Senate floor, again, in October of 1999. For the last 7 \nmonths, this nomination has been waiting on the Executive Calendar for \nSenate action.\n  Let me just tell you a little bit about Timothy Dyk. He has \ndistinguished himself with a long career of private practice in the \nDistrict of Columbia. From 1964 to 1999, he worked with Wilmer, Cutler, \nand Pickering as an associate and then as a partner. Since 1990 he has \nbeen with Jones, Day, Reavis, and Pogue as a partner. He has been the \nchair of its issues and appeals section.\n  He received his undergraduate degree in 1958 from Harvard College; \nhis law degree from Harvard Law School in 1961. Following law school, \nhe clerked for three U.S. Supreme Court Justices: Justices Reed and \nBurton, and Chief Justice Warren. He was also a special assistant to \nthe Assistant Attorney General in the Tax Division.\n  His is a distinguished career. He represented a wide array of \nclients, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Association of Broadcasters, \nthe National Trucking Association, and he has the support of a wide \nvariety of these organizations. We have received strong letters of \nsupport for him. Here are some of those who sent in letters saying \nlet's get this man confirmed:\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Trucking Association, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of \nBroadcasters, IBM, Gannett, Eastman Kodak, Brush Wellman, Rockwell, LTV \nCorporation, SkyTel Telecommunications, the Lubrizol Corporation, \nIngersoll-Rand, the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, the American Center for Law and Justice, and Trinity \nBroadcasting Network.\n  I said many times on the floor that we take far too long to confirm \ngood people. We are wrong and irresponsible to hold people up basically \non a whim until we feel like bringing up their names. Nominees deserve \nto be treated with dignity and dispatch, not delayed for 2 or 3 years. \nOf course, any Senator can vote as he or she wants, but let's \nunderstand the human aspect.\n  When somebody has gone for their hearings, when they have been voted \nout of committee, when they are pending in the Senate, their life is on \nhold until we act. It is unfair, it is unreasonable to tell somebody in \na law practice: The good news is the President has nominated you to the \nCourt of Appeals. You will be congratulated by your partners, by your \nclients, and then they will say: When are you going to be confirmed? If \nyou have to respond: When the Senate gets around to it, that is not a \ngood answer. Vote somebody up or vote somebody down.\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n  This is a man who should have broad, strong bipartisan support, just \nas the letters of support show broad, strong bipartisan support.\n  I am glad that Tim Dyk will be voted on for the Federal Circuit. We \nhave worked long and hard to get him the vote to which he is entitled. \nI worked to have him confirmed in 1998. I worked to have him confirmed \nin 1999. I am glad that finally, he will be accorded a vote on this \nlong pending nomination.\n  He and his entire family have much of which to be proud. His legal \ncareer has been exemplary. He will make a superb judge.\n  I know Timothy Dyk. I know him and his wife, both of whom have had \nlong, distinguished careers in the private sector and the public \nsector. Let's give the country the opportunity to have him join the \nFederal Circuit Court of Appeals, just as we did late last year with \nhis colleague, Richard Linn. It is time for the Senate to confirm \nTimothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. President, not seeing anybody on the floor, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum and ask unanimous consent that it not run against the time \nof either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield to myself as much time as I may \nconsume from Senator Leahy's time on the nomination of Mr. Gerard Lynch \nto become a district court judge for the Southern District of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Gerard Lynch\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader for coming together on an agreement that allows for a \nnumber of vital votes on judicial nominees. I also thank Chairman Hatch \nfor, again, tending to our judicial needs in my State and in so many \nStates, and for the fairness with which he has tried to move this \nprocess forward.\n  It is with great pride and pleasure that I rise in support of the \nnomination of Gerard Lynch to be district court judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. At my recommendation, President Clinton nominated \nProfessor Lynch to fill a vacant Federal judgeship in the Southern \nDistrict.\n  Professor Lynch's experiences and accomplishments as a prosecutor, as \na private lawyer, as a professor of law, and as a public servant make \nhim a superb candidate to be a Federal judge. I have never, in my days, \nseen such high recommendations from people from all parts of the \npolitical spectrum simply about this man's intellect and \naccomplishments.\n  Professor Lynch's background and career accomplishments are, frankly, \nstaggering. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, a place near and dear \nto my heart. He then attended Columbia College, where he graduated \nfirst in his class--a highly competitive school--followed by Columbia \nLaw School, where he also was No. 1 in his class.\n\n  After law school, he accepted two judicial clerkships-- first, with \none of New York's great jurists, Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the Second \nCircuit, and then with Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court. He \nwas at the top of the legal profession as he went through his education \nand his clerkships. You could not have a better record.\n  Since that time, he has had a multifaceted career, mostly as a \nprosecutor and professor, and that is as impressive as any judicial \ncandidate I have seen in years.\n  Since 1977, he has served as the Paul K. Kellner Professor of Law at \nColumbia Law School, where he teaches criminal law and criminal \nprocedure, as well as constitutional law and other courses.\n  He is a leading expert on the Federal racketeering laws and has \nwritten numerous articles on the subject. He has also published \narticles on other aspects of criminal law, constitutional theory, and \nlegal ethics.\n  Maybe most importantly, he is considered one of Columbia Law School's \noutstanding professors, winning a number of awards for excellence in \nteaching and serving as a guide and mentor to countless students over \nthe years.\n  Professor Lynch, however, has not only been a professor, he also \nspent many years as a Federal prosecutor in the Southern District of \nNew York, one of the premier U.S. Attorney's Offices in the country. He \ntried numerous cases, including white collar and political corruption \ncases, and eventually rose to be the chief of the appellate division.\n  In 1990, after a stint as a professor, he was asked to return to that \noffice as chief of the Criminal Division under U.S. Attorney Otto \nObermaier. In that capacity, he supervised more than 135 prosecutors \nand oversaw all of the office's criminal cases. Mr. Obermaier, a \nRepublican appointee, handpicked Professor Lynch to serve as his lead \ncriminal prosecutor. I know he has been outspoken in support of this \nnomination, and Mr. Obermaier was known as a hardnosed, rather \nconservative prosecutor in the Southern District.\n  Professor Lynch has also served as counsel to numerous city, State, \nand Federal commissions, and has worked with a number of special \nprosecutors investigating public corruption. Moreover, from 1988 to \n1990, he served as a part-time associate counsel for the Office of \nIndependent Counsel.\n  More recently, Professor Lynch has been counsel to a top New York law \nfirm, primarily handling white collar criminal matters and regulatory \nmatters, while still maintaining a full courseload teaching at \nColumbia.\n  So, intellectually, he is at the top of the list. Experience-wise, he \nhas done it all. He is also a wonderful, wonderful person. He loves \nLatin and Greek and he knows them well. He loves theater, art, and \nballet.\n  Just to let my colleagues know what a fine man he is and what an \nhonorable man he is, when Gerry went to Columbia College, the Vietnam \nwar was waging. He came from a working-class background and he knew \nthat many of his classmates in high school would be drafted. He, by \nbeing a college student, was not eligible for the draft, but he thought \nthat was unfair. He thought it was unfair that those lucky enough to \nget into college should have special advantages over working-class \nyoung men being called for the front line. So he refused to pursue an \nexemption. He was not called. But that shows you the mettle of the man.\n\n  I will close by admitting that I am very excited about the prospect \nof Professor Lynch becoming the next member of the Southern District \nbench. I know his wife and his son are proud of him, and rightfully so.\n  He meets the criteria I have set for myself in choosing judges, which \nare:\n  No. 1, excellence. There is no doubt;\n  No. 2, moderation. I try to avoid judges who are extreme in either \ncase;\n  And, No. 3, diversity. While Gerard doesn't quite qualify in that, I \nthink I fulfill that in some other nominations.\n  Gerard Lynch has the rare combination of intelligence, practical \nexperience, judicious temperament, fairness, and devotion to hard work \nthat makes for truly great judges. He is just what the Founding Fathers \nand all others throughout have wanted for a Federal judge. All too many \npeople of his qualification don't ask for and don't aspire to the \nbench. He does. We should take this opportunity and support him \nwholeheartedly.\n  I yield to my senior colleague and friend from the State of New York, \nSenator Moynihan. Is that the proper procedure, Mr. President? Should I \nyield to Senator Moynihan, or should I yield my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Moynihan is recognized in his own \nright.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. How very generous of you, Mr. President.\n  How kind of my beloved colleague and friend.\n  I rise with a measure of animus, if I may do, sir, this afternoon. I \nwas one of those who, with my colleague, introduced Mr. Lynch to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary with such very considerable pride to have \nthat opportunity.\n  My colleague remarked about the founders of the Constitution. I will \nspeak in just a moment about the Columbia Law School, which precedes \nthe Constitution, which Constitution was written in very large measure \nby a graduate of that law school, Alexander Hamilton, and whose first \nlarge treatise of explanation was written by\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\nChancellor Kent, as he is known, having been chancellor of New York \nState, with his commentaries on the laws of the United States.\n  It is not a small thing to become a member of that law faculty. It is \na large honor carefully reserved for lawyers of successive generations \nwho note history and demand its importance to this time.\n  We have before us, sir, the nomination of a great lawyer--I use that \ncarefully--who will be a superb judge.\n  I think he might have been surprised--we would not have been \nsurprised--that early in life and at another time he might not have \nchosen criminal law as his specialty. But he came of age in the bar \nwhen that was the first problem, singularly so, of the Southern \nDistrict of New York. And he went to work at it.\n  He was a serious prosecutor, sir, a successful one--a relentless one \nand a successful one. I want to say that, sir-- a successful one. None \ncame into his compass charged with a crime that he did not prosecute \nfairly, rigorously, relentlessly, and, in the end, sir, with an \nextraordinary range of success--and I defer to my revered colleague--\nwith an extraordinary range of success.\n\n  This is a man of whom criminals had never heard but, when they \nappeared in court with him, will never forget. This man understood that \nthe principles of a free society require adherence to law with a \nreverence and respect and, if necessary, a measure of fear: Do not \nappear before this judge with the burden of guilt or you shall be found \nguilty.\n  He has a range of intellectual pursuits. Ought not a member of the \nschool of law that taught Alexander Hamilton and graced by Chancellor \nKent and his great success--ought not there be such a range? Ought he \nnot be able to entertain alternative ideas, examine them, and consider \nthe possibilities?\n  We have, sir, a wonderful symbol--I do not know in my ignorance \nwhether it is from Greece or Rome--of Justice blindfolded, holding up a \nscale and weighing the evidence. He has done that in a great range of \nprofessional articles. He has done that in a long career of \nprosecution. And he has considered alternatives and made judgments \nbecause he is by nature a judge. He has been in the pits where judges \nhave to make determinations from whatever is presented to them as \nevidence. And he knows the process.\n  He graduated summa cum laude from Columbia Law School. He clerked for \nJudge Feinberg on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals --the Second \nCircuit, sir, the mother court, we should say--and for Justice Brennan \non the Supreme Court. Over the past 23 years, he has won award upon \naward, including the University-wide President's Award for Outstanding \nTeaching in 1997. He is nationally known as a criminal law expert, for \nhis writings, and particularly his writings on racketeering law.\n  I come before the Senate to say there has not been a finer judge \nproposed by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. We are honored to \nhave him before the Senate. I prayerfully hope none of us ever appear \nbefore him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to use my time on two judicial nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have great respect for Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Schumer. I know they have great affection and \nadmiration for Mr. Lynch. In no way do I question his integrity. I do \nnot question his legal ability. He is certainly a scholar and a person \nof intellect.\n  Except for two leaves of absence, he has been a law professor. The \nold rule must apply: The A students become professors; B students, \njudges; and C students make the money. Regardless, he has been a \nprofessor, worked on a few cases, and spent several years with the U.S. \nAttorney's Office prosecuting cases. By all accounts, he is a man of \ngood personal character.\n  The problem I have with this nomination is that I have come to \nbelieve from his writing that he is, indeed, a judge who is an \nactivist. There is only one opportunity for the people of this country \nto confront the question as to whether or not an individual nominated \nto be a judge will obtain a lifetime appointment. That is our role \nunder the Constitution, to advise and consent to nominations of the \nPresident. The President has nominated Mr. Lynch. I think it is our \nduty, if we are not to be a potted plant or rubber stamp his record, \nhis skill, his background, his philosophy, and see if we want to \nauthorize him, for the rest of his life, to preside over cases, to \ninterpret the law, to interpret the Constitution, and make major \ndecisions in that regard. That is our question: Do we want to do that?\n  It would be bad to impose upon the people of New York or any other \nState any person who is not clearly committed to the judicial role. The \njudicial role is that a judge should require himself to follow the \nConstitution of the United States and the laws duly passed by the \nCongress of the United States. The Constitution is a contract. It was \nan instrument of agreement between the American people and the \ngovernment when they formed it. They gave to the government certain \nlimited powers. They reserved for themselves and for the States other \npowers. That is a fundamental principle.\n  I think our courts in recent years have done a little better. At one \npoint, they were exceedingly activist. The leader of that activism \ncrusade in the Federal courts was none other than Justice Brennan for \nwhom Mr. Lynch clerked. Subsequent to that, he has written in the \nColumbia Law Review on two separate occasions. The Columbia Law Review \nis a prestigious law review and the Columbia Law School is a \nprestigious law school. One does not write for the Columbia Law Review \nwithout giving careful thought to each and every word he utilizes in \nthat law review, even more so if he is a professor at that school.\n  In the course of writing these articles, Mr. Lynch made some \nstatements that I think represent very serious indications of his \nphilosophy and his willingness to be bound by the law and the \nConstitution as a judge. Take, for example, this 1984 article, \n``Constitutional Law as Moral Philosophy'':\n\n       The Supreme Court, because it is free of immediate \n     political pressures of the sort that press on those who must \n     face the voters, is better placed to decide whether a \n     proposed course of action that meets short-term political \n     objectives is consistent with the fundamental moral values to \n     which our society considers itself pledged.\n\n  That is a very risky, dangerous statement, a carefully written \nstatement, words Mr. Lynch chose carefully. He says the Supreme Court, \nbecause it doesn't have to answer to the American people in elections, \nis better placed to decide a proposed course of action that meets \nshort-term political objectives and is consistent with moral values \nwhich our society considers itself bound.\n  Our Constitution is deeply rooted in our moral order and heritage, \nbut our Constitution is a contract; our Constitution is an agreement \nwith the people. It has specific ideas and requirements in it that I \nexpect a judge to abide by.\n  To show the danger in this philosophy, let me share the example of \nthe death penalty. The eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual \npunishment. Justice Brennan, for whom Mr. Lynch clerked, declared that \nthe death penalty was cruel and unusual and therefore it violates the \neighth amendment to the Constitution.\n  I suggest that is bizarre because at the time the Constitution was \nadopted, every State had a death penalty. There are six or more \nreferences within the very document itself, the Constitution, to a \ndeath penalty. Yet he feels it violates some sort of contemporary \nstandards of morality. Justice Brennan used his lifetime appointment as \na judge to dissent on every single death penalty case, saying it \nviolates the Constitution, while the Constitution contemplates and says \nyou can take life with due process in several different places.\n  That is judicial activism.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield? I am happy to yield to him some \nof my time.\n  I ask my colleague if he was aware that Professor Lynch is for the \ndeath penalty. In fact, he was questioned by Senator Thurmond, on our \ncommittee. I will read the question for the Record:\n       Do you have any personal objection to the death penalty \n     that would cause you to be reluctant to oppose or uphold the \n     death sentence?\n\n  And Professor Lynch answered:\n\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\n\n       No, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  So I submit to my friend that, while Justice Brennan may have had a \nmore broad--I tend to agree with my colleague. I am for the death \npenalty myself, but I tend to agree with my colleague on that issue. \nThat is not Professor Lynch's philosophy. In fact, when one becomes a \nClerk for the Supreme Court, high honor that it is, you are chosen \nsimply on your scholastic ability, not on your ideology. I thank the \nSenator for yielding and letting me add that to the record.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think Senator Schumer raises a good \npoint. I never said he opposed the death penalty. What I was trying to \npoint out is that judges, if they desire to impose their fundamental \nmoral values on people when they don't get elected, can end up doing \nthings like Justice Brennan did, for which, certainly, Mr. Lynch \nadmires him.\n  I have another quote I think is even more clear, a more clear \nindication of Mr. Lynch's willingness to utilize personal opinions--\njustifying judges who want to use personal opinions instead of \ninterpreting the law. He was talking about Justice Brennan. This was in \n1997, just a few years ago:\n\n       Justice Brennan's belief that the Constitution must be \n     given meaning for the present seems to me a simple necessity; \n     his long and untiring labor to articulate the principles of \n     fairness, liberty, and equality found in the Constitution--\n\n  Fairness, liberty, and equality sound a little bit like the French \nRevolution, words they used to chop off a lot of people's heads. Our \nConstitution is a document of restraint. But:\n\n       . . . in the way that he believed made most sense today.\n\n  Justice Brennan's belief that the Constitution must be given:\n\n       . . . meaning for the present in the way he believed made \n     most sense today seems far more honest and honorable than the \n     pretense that the meaning of those principles can be found in \n     18th- or 19th-century dictionaries.\n\n  In the course of my time on the Judiciary Committee, I have voted for \nwell over 90 percent of the nominees, I suppose, that the President has \nsubmitted. This Senate has confirmed a large number of them. I suggest \nthat this may be the most dramatic example of any nominee that we have \nhad, that they have explicitly stated that a judge has the ability to \nignore the meaning of the words that were put in the Constitution. In \nother words, he doesn't have to use the dictionary definition of words. \nHe doesn't have to use dictionary definitions of words. He just goes to \nwhatever the meaning of ``is,'' is, I suppose.\n  In other words, there is no constraint on a judge who will not adhere \nto the words himself and admit that he needs to be bound by the plain \nwords in a statute or our Constitution. He puts down the philosophy \nthat a judge has to show restraint. Even if he did not like the \nconstitutional provision, even if he or she did not like the statute \ninvolved, he would be bound to enforce it. It is a fundamental matter \nof great importance.\n  Just as Professor VanAlstyn, speaking at a Federal court conference a \nnumber of years ago, said:\n\n       It is absolutely critical that we enforce this \n     Constitution, the one that we have, the good and bad parts of \n     it.\n\n  That is what law is all about, enforcement of law that is written. \nWithout it, we do not have justice. Professor VanAlstyn says you do not \nrespect the Constitution if you don't enforce its plain meaning. You \nsay the Constitution is great; it is a living document. It is not; it \nis on paper. It is not living; it doesn't breathe. It is a contract \nwith the people of America about how they are going to give power to \npeople who govern them. It is a limited grant of power to the people \nwho govern them.\n  I will say this. That is another dramatic statement of a judge's \nability, according to Mr. Lynch, to redefine meanings of words and to \nline up contemporary events, as of today, so he can impose a ruling on \nthe people that he believes is just and fitting with community \nstandards and moral decencies and things of that nature. That is a very \ndangerous philosophy. It is not the philosophy of the mainstream law in \nAmerica today.\n  It was advocated by and probably reached its high-water mark under \nJustice Brennan when he tried to declare the death penalty to be in \nviolation of the U.S. Constitution, when the Constitution provided for \nthe death penalty. That is big-time stuff, when a Justice on the \nSupreme Court is prepared to say something like that and dissented on \nevery single death penalty case based on that theory.\n\n  I suggest Mr. Lynch is a brilliant lawyer, a man of great skill, a \nlawyer/professor, and he knows what he means and he said what he meant \nwhen he wrote that. What else can we think? If that is so, then I \nbelieve we cannot be sure, Members of this Senate, that he would \nconsider himself bound by the plain meaning of words, of statutes \npassed by this body or even more significant, not consider himself \nbound by the Constitution itself that was ratified by the American \npeople to protect their liberties.\n  Remember, when we have a judge who believes in activism, it is at its \nmost fundamental an antidemocratic act. It is an act that goes against \ndemocracy because we have a lifetime-appointed judge whose salary \ncannot be cut so long as he lives. He can stay on that bench as long as \nhe lives. He is asserting for himself or herself the right to declare \nwhat he or she thinks is appropriate today. ``It may not have been what \nthey thought when they wrote that old Constitution, but things have \nchanged today. I think today the death penalty is unconstitutional.'' \nThat kind of philosophy is a danger. It disrespects the Constitution. \nIt undermines the Constitution and undermines democracy.\n  I wish I would be able to support Mr. Lynch. I supported the \noverwhelming majority of the nominees, some of them maybe even more \nliberal than Mr. Lynch, but I haven't had anything to indicate that or \nI would have probably opposed them. Some I have.\n  This document, these law review articles are extraordinarily \ntroubling to me. I do not think it is a minor point. I think it is a \nbig point. I know the Senator from New York, both Senators from New \nYork, think highly of Mr. Lynch and I respect that. But based on what I \nhave observed, I believe his written remarks indicate he is unwilling \nto be bound by the law. Therefore we should not impose him on the \npeople of New York and the United States.\n  I see the Senator from New York might want to comment on that before \nI go to the next nominee? I have one more nominee I would like to \ncomment on.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama for his \nheartfelt remarks. I understand the passion from which he comes and, \nwhile I do not agree with him completely, as those on my judicial panel \nwill tell him, one of the things I always cross-examine them about is, \nIs this person going to go off and make their own law? Because I do not \nlike that either. As I said, my three watchwords in appointing judges \nin my first year, and I think I have lived up to them with every \nnominee, are: Excellence, moderation, and diversity.\n  Let me just say I think Judge Lynch is clearly a moderate and he \nclearly is not the kind of activist that my good friend from Alabama is \nsaying. In fact, he has criticized Justice Brennan for being \n``activist'' in some of his interviews. Judge Posner noted the same \nabout Judge lynch. Judge Posner is someone who probably agrees with the \nSenator from Alabama more than he agrees with the Senator from New \nYork.\n  But the two quotes there that my friend from Alabama cited are \nsnippets of articles. Two paragraphs later Professor Lynch expostulates \nfurther and greatly narrows what he has said here. Let me read a quote \nfrom the first article. I think it is important the record have it for \nthe edification of my good friend from Alabama.\n  Admittedly, Professor Lynch is a professor. He has written a lot more \nthan a lot of the other judges and, given as many writings as he has, I \nguess you could take two paragraphs and say: This man is a judicial \nactivist.\n  If you look at the entire warp and woof of his work, as well as what \nhe actually meant even in the two paragraphs my good friend from \nAlabama has mentioned, I think the Senator is not correctly stating \nProfessor Lynch's view.\n  I will read a paragraph from the same article from which the previous \nquote\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nthe Senator from Alabama had mentioned appears. This is what Professor \nLynch says a few paragraphs later:\n\n       It is the text itself that embodies and defines what has \n     been agreed on. What survived the rigorous ratification \n     process to become fundamental law, after all, was not what \n     Madison or Bingham believed in his heart, or even what they \n     said on the floor of the Convention or the House, but rather \n     what was contained in the text of the ratified provision. \n     Thus, the text is not merely evidence from which the mind of \n     the (perhaps partly mythological) lawgiver should be deduced; \n     rather, the text is the definitive expression of what was \n     legislated.\n\n  I will repeat that again for my colleague from Alabama:\n\n       . . . the text is the definitive expression of what was \n     legislated.\n\n  That is hardly the writing of somebody who wants to go far, far \nafield. As I mentioned, the example my good friend from Alabama keeps \nhearkening back to is the death penalty and the way Justice Brennan \ninterpreted it. If Professor Lynch agreed with that, I would say the \nSenator from Alabama had a point, but he explicitly disagrees and has \ncriticized Justice Brennan as being too active.\n  The second quote Senator Sessions focuses on, the quote before us on \nthe chart, comes from a tribute to the memory of Justice Brennan that \nProfessor Lynch, who clerked for Justice Brennan after graduating from \nlaw school, wrote in 1997. Again, in the context of the whole essay, \nProfessor Lynch's point is noncontroversial. He is writing here about \nwhat a judge is to do when the broad language in the Constitution does \nnot speak to a modern-day issue. We are not talking about expanding but \ninterpreting the spirit of the Constitution.\n  I say to my colleague from Alabama, when the fourth amendment speaks \nof unreasonable searches and seizures and says nothing about wiretaps \nof telephones or the Internet, it does not mean the judges are unable \nto interpret what search and seizure means in the context of telephones \nor wiretaps. That is all Professor Lynch is saying.\n  He is saying judges must look at the text and the values underlying \nthe text and interpret both in light of developments of the present. Do \nnot expand what unreasonable searches and seizures are, rather \ninterpret them in light of new changes in technologies, such as \ntelephones. Otherwise, the Constitution--and I am sure my colleague \nfrom Alabama can admit this--would be largely irrelevant to today's \nlegal problems.\n  Moreover, Professor Lynch was asked at his nomination hearing about \nthis article by Senator Thurmond. Here is what he said. His response \nwas unequivocal:\n\n       I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the starting place in \n     interpreting the Constitution is with the language of the \n     document. As with the legislation passed by the Congress, it \n     is the wording of the Constitution that was ratified by the \n     people and that constitutes the binding contract under which \n     our government is created.\n       In attempting to understand that language, it is most \n     important to look to the original intent of those who wrote \n     it and the context in which it was written.\n\n  It seems to me, and I did not realize it until I read this paragraph \nagain, those are the exact words my good friend from Alabama mentioned \nas his views of what the Constitution is all about: Not some document \nthat expands at the whim, wishes, or ideology of the judge but rather a \nwritten contract, words, black and white with the American people. \nJudge Lynch--I do not want to presume anything here, particularly in \nthis Chamber--Professor Lynch makes, in fact, the same point that my \ngood friend from Alabama did.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents of the nomination \nhas expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 1 additional \nminute of Senator Leahy's time on another judge where there is not \ngoing to be any contest or discussion be given to me. I am not \nexpanding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank Senator Leahy in absentia for allowing me to do \nthat. I hope he is not upset.\n  It is certainly the prerogative of my good friend from Alabama to \ninterpret snatches of text from book reviews and tributes to conclude \nthat maybe Professor Lynch has a judicial philosophy with which he \ndisagrees, but this is the definitive and current statement on the \nissue by the nominee, and I think it prevails.\n  In conclusion, if Professor Lynch is confirmed, I believe Senator \nSessions and I--and I have enjoyed working with him on so many issues--\nwill look back 5 or 10 years and both approve of the work Judge Lynch \nhas done, admire his faithfulness to the words of a document we both \nregard as sacred--and I believe he does as well--the Constitution, a \ndocument we are all sworn to uphold. I yield back any time and thank my \ncolleague for the dialog and for making us think and explore as he \nalways does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What is the time left on the Lynch nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note that Mr. Lynch's words are pretty \nexplicit and leave little doubt. I am pleased to see before his \nhearing--talk about a death-bed conversion. His testimony sounds \nsomewhat improved over the language here, but it does concern me when \nhe dismisses concepts such as actually looking at dictionaries that \nrefer to the time of the people who wrote the document and review words \nto see what they actually were intended to mean.\n  That is what a judge really ought to do, and Mr. Lynch dismisses that \nalmost with contempt. We have to consider it awfully dangerous when a \njudge feels the principles of the Constitution of liberty, equality, \nand fairness are in the Constitution when that phrase is really not in \nthe Constitution, and the danger of those words are they are great \nideals, but they are general; they have no definitiveness, and they \ngive a platform for a judge to leap off into different issues about \nwhich he may personally feel deeply and simply do so on the basis that \nit is fair or it is a question of equality: This is fairness so I will \njust rule this way.\n  We have preserved our Nation well by insisting that our judiciary \nremain faithful to the plain and simple words of the Constitution and \nthe statutes involved.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Timothy B. Dyk\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will use what time I have remaining on \nthe Lynch nomination for the Dyk nomination, and I will yield the floor \nto Senator Smith who wants to speak.\n  Mr. Dyk has been nominated to the Federal circuit here in Washington. \nMr. Dyk is a good lawyer, apparently with a good academic background, \nand has certain skills and abilities that I certainly do not dispute. I \ndo not have anything against him personally, but I do have serious \nconcerns about this court. I do not believe we need another judge on \nthis court.\n  The Federal circuit is a court of limited jurisdiction. It handles \npatent cases and Merit Systems Protection Board cases, certain \ninternational trade cases, and certain interlocutory orders from \ndistrict courts. It is a specialized court and does not get involved in \ntoo many generalized cases.\n  We have analyzed the caseload of this circuit. I serve on the \nAdministrative Oversight and Courts Subcommittee of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee with Senator Chuck Grassley, who is chairman. I \nhave been a practicing prosecutor for 15 years in Federal court before \nFederal judges; that is where I spent my career. I know certain judges \nare overwhelmed with work, and I have observed others who may not be as \noverwhelmed with work.\n  I will go over some numbers that indicate to me without doubt that \nthis circuit is the least worked circuit in America. It does not need \nanother judge, and I will share this concept with fellow Members of the \nSenate.\n  They handle appeals in the Federal Circuit, appeals from other court \ncases and boards. In 1995, there were 1,847 appeals filed in the \nFederal Circuit. Four years later, in 1999, that number had fallen to \n1,543 appeals, a 16-percent decline in cases filed.\n  Another way to look at the circuit is how many cases are terminated \nper judge. The Administrative Office of Courts provides a large \nstatistical report. They analyze, by weighted case factors, judges and \ncases by circuits and districts and so forth. It is a bound volume. \nThey report every year. The numbers are not to be argued with.\n  The Federal Circuit has by far the lowest number of dispositions per\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\njudge. The Federal Circuit has 141 cases per judge terminated. There \nare 11 judges now on that circuit. As a matter of fact, those 141 cases \nwere when the court had 10 judges. We now have 11 judges on that court, \nand we are talking about adding Mr. Dyk, who would be the 12th judge on \nthat court, to take the numbers down even further.\n  The next closest circuit is a circuit that is also overstaffed--the \nD.C. Circuit. I have opposed nominees to the D.C. Circuit in \nWashington. Oddly enough, both the circuits that I believe are \noverstaffed and underworked are located in this city. The average case \ndispositions for a circuit judge in America are more than double that. \nLet me provide some examples.\n  The Third Circuit average number of terminations per judge is 312; \nthe Fourth Circuit, 545; the Fifth Circuit, 668--that is four times \nwhat the Federal Circuit does--the Seventh Circuit, 352; Eighth \nCircuit, 440; Ninth Circuit, 455, the Tenth Circuit, 350; the Eleventh \nCircuit--my circuit, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia--820 cases, compared \nto 141. That is six times as many cases per judge in the Eleventh \nCircuit as in the Federal Circuit.\n  The taxpayers of this country need to give thought to whether or not \nwe need to add a judge to this circuit. It is pretty obvious we ought \nto consider that. Terminations per judge on the Federal Circuit \nrepresent only 17 percent of the cases terminated by a judge on the \nEleventh Circuit.\n  Senator Grassley issued a report on March 30, 1999, ``On the \nAppropriate Allocation of Judgeships in the United States Court of \nAppeals.'' The report assessed the need to fill one vacancy on the \nFederal Circuit. The court already had 11 active judges of the 12 \nauthorized.\n  The Federal Circuit also had five senior judges at that time. Senior \njudges contribute a lot to the workload. That is a pretty high number. \nAlmost half as many judges are senior judges who come in on a less-work \nlevel. They don't handle the most important en banc cases, but they \nparticipate in drafting opinions. They have law clerks. Many of them do \nalmost as many cases as an active judge. So they have five senior \nstatus judges. Maybe it is down to four now, but at that time there \nwere five senior judges.\n  The Grassley report states:\n\n       In fact, the current status of the circuit actually \n     supports the argument that the court could do its job with a \n     smaller complement of 11 judges. As such, the case has not \n     yet been made that the current vacancy should be filled.\n\n  That remains true today. The Federal circuit has 11 active judges now \nand 4 senior judges.\n  On the issue of the cost of a judgeship, people ask, how much does it \ncost to add another judge? Just add a judge and pay his salary, \n$140,000, $150,000 a year? That is not too bad. However, the actual \ncost of a Federal judge is $1 million annually. They have two, three \nlaw clerks, secretaries, office space, libraries, computers, travel \nbudgets, and everything that goes with being a Federal appellate judge. \nIt is an expensive process. That number is a legitimate number, 1 \nmillion bucks.\n  We have judges in this country who are working night and day, but \nthis circuit is not one of them. Before we do not fill some of those \nvacancies, before we do not add new judges to some of those districts--\nand it is not that many, but some are really overworked--we ought to \nthink about whether we ought to continue a judge where we don't need \none.\n  The Grassley report also dealt with the problem of having more judges \nthan you need, sort of a collegiality question. The report said:\n\n       Judge Tjoflat [chief judge at the Eleventh Circuit at one \n     time] testified that some scholars maintain that a \n     ``perfect'' appellate court size is about 7 to 9 judges, and \n     when a court reaches 10 or 11 judges, ``you have an \n     exponential increase in the tension on the court of the \n     ability of the law not to be certain.'' Judges claimed that \n     there is a marked decrease in collegiality when the appeals \n     court is staffed with more than 11 or 12 judges. Chief Judge \n     Posner of the Seventh Circuit thought that with 11 judges, \n     the Seventh Circuit was ``at the limit of what a court ought \n     to be'' in terms of size.\n\n  The Seventh Circuit had more than twice as many cases per judge as \nthe Federal Circuit does today.\n  The Grassley report further stated there is a consistency cost with \nexpanding courts:\n\n       Not only is there a loss in collegiality the larger a court \n     becomes, there is also an increase in work required by the \n     judges to maintain consistency in the law. Judge Wilkinson \n     felt that more judges would not lighten the burdens of a \n     court, but would actually aggravate these burdens further.\n\n  The Federal Circuit, to which this judge would like to be appointed--\nand it would be a good position to draw that big Federal judicial \nsalary and have the lowest caseload in America --has the lowest \nterminations per judge of any circuit court of appeals. It has a 16-\npercent decrease in overall caseload, with a clear recommendation from \nthe Grassley subcommittee report that there is not a need to add \nanother judge to this circuit.\n  I suggest that we not approve this judge, not because he is not a \ngood person but because we don't need to burden the taxpayers with $1 \nmillion a year for the rest of his life to serve on a court that \ndoesn't need another judge. In fact, they could probably get by with \ntwo or three fewer judges than they have right now and still have the \nlowest caseload per judge in America.\n  We don't have money to throw away. People act as though a million \ndollars isn't much money. A million dollars is a lot of money where I \ncame from. I think we ought to look at that and put our money where we \nhave to have some judges. There are some of those areas.\n  I thank the Chair for the time to express my thoughts on the Dyk \nmatter and yield the remainder of my time to Senator Smith from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes remain for the Senator from \nAlabama. Fifteen additional minutes are under the control of the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition \nto the nominations of both Mr. Dyk and Mr. Lynch. But I also rise to \nbriefly discuss the role of the Senate in judicial nominations, the \nissue of advice and consent. What is the appropriate role for the \nSenate? Should we be out here opposing nominations? You can be \ncriticized for it because they say: Well, the President is in the other \nparty; therefore, every time you oppose a nomination, it is for \npolitical reasons.\n  The truth is, by either voting for or not asking for a recorded vote, \nI have allowed many Clinton nominees to move forward. But I think we \nhave an obligation under the advise and consent clause of the \nConstitution that if we don't think the judge is qualified to be on the \nCourt, or perhaps he or she is too much of an activist and not really \nupholding the Constitution as it was written, then I think we have an \nobligation to say that.\n  It is with some reluctance I must do that. That is my view. When I \nsay ``qualified,'' we don't merely look at the educational background \nof the nominee or to the employment history to understand \nqualifications. I am more interested in the judicial philosophy: Is \nthis nominee going to be an activist judge for one issue or another? \nWhether conservative or liberal, is that the purpose of a judge--to go \non the Court and be an activist for some particular issue--or is it \nmore appropriate for the judge to go on the Court and be an activist \nfor the Constitution of the United States and interpret that \nConstitution correctly? The latter is what I believe is the appropriate \nthing to do.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have searched through many \nof the nominees this President has sent forward. I must say I am \nshocked at the amount of judicial activists. We have had some great \nclashes in this body on Presidential nominees for the Court--Robert \nBork, to name one, and Clarence Thomas was another. It seems that when \nthe liberal side of the aisle goes after a judge, it is always \nappropriate, but if we go after a judge because we think he or she is \ntoo far to the left in terms of activism, then, of course, it is wrong.\n\n  But article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \nConsuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the \nUnited States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \nfor, and which shall be established by Law.'' That means the lower \ncourts, to put it in simple terms.\n  The Senate is not a rubber stamp for any nomination, nor should it \nbe. We\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nhave a right to speak out, and I specifically, along with Senator \nSessions, asked for a recorded vote in the case of Mr. Dyk and Mr. \nLynch because I believe the Senate should go on record. Sometimes if \nthe nominees are not controversial but simply share a different \nphilosophical view from mine and are not activist, and based on their \nbackground I believe they will look at the Constitution as fairly as \npossible, in an objective manner, I don't object to those nominees.\n  I don't expect President Clinton to appoint a judge I might appoint. \nI respect that, and I understand that. That is not the reason for the \nadvise and consent clause, to simply disapprove every single nominee \nbecause you disagree with the President's politics.\n  The framers of our Constitution settled on a judicial selection \nprocess that would involve both the Senate and the President. Remember, \nthese are lifetime appointments. There is no going back, unless some \nhorrible thing happens in terms of malfeasance, where the judge is \nimpeached. But for the most part, a judicial appointment is lifetime. A \nFederal judge is a Federal judge for life. So if a few of us come down \nto the Senate floor, as Senator Sessions and I have done, and talk \nabout these nominees, I don't think that is so bad. They are appointed \nfor life. So if we have concerns, I think they should be raised. That \nis legitimate on either side of the aisle.\n  Nominees who are a danger to the separation of powers, who have shown \nevidence of legislating from the bench, those are the kinds of nominees \nto whom I am opposed. I am not opposed to nominees based on a \nPresident's political philosophy. I am opposed to nominees who have \nshown evidence of legislating from the bench. That is a very important \npoint to make.\n  I might also say, before discussing specifically the two nominees \njust for a moment, that there is some irony in this debate today \nbecause this is the first time nominations have come before the Senate \nfor a vote since the President of the United States has been \nrecommended for disbarment as an attorney by the State of Arkansas. \nNow, I don't know if that has happened in American history before. I \ndon't believe so. So I think I am correct in saying this is the first \ntime in American history that a sitting President has been recommended \nfor disbarment from the State he came from, and then that same \nPresident is submitting nominees to the courts in our land.\n  I do not mean to imply anything by this in terms of the \nqualifications of the nominees, about their conduct in office or \nanything such as that. That is not the intention. The intention here is \nto point out that it is somewhat ironic that a man who showed total \ndisregard for the law, according to the law in the State of Arkansas, \nwould now be sending judges up to the Senate for approval. So I bring \nthis to the attention of my colleagues because it is the first time in \nAmerican history this has ever happened. We are standing here in \njudgment of people who are appointed by a President who has been \nrecommended for disbarment.\n\n  The Arkansas bar, as you know, a day or so ago recommended this. A \ncommittee of the Arkansas Supreme Court recommended this past Monday \nthat the President be disbarred because of ``serious misconduct'' in \nthe Paula Jones sexual harassment case. A majority of the panelists who \nmet Friday to consider two complaints against the President found that \nthe President should be disciplined for false testimony about his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky, the Arkansas Supreme Court said. He \nwas, indeed, fined by another judge from Arkansas for lying under oath.\n  So it is ironic we are debating the qualifications of many fine \njurists, frankly, before us today, and in the newspapers we read about \nhow our President is facing disbarment. So it is a unique situation we \nface here and one I want everybody to understand.\n  We break a lot of ground here. We do a lot of things that have never \nbeen done before. We had an impeachment trial in the Senate a few \nmonths ago. The Senate, in its infinite wisdom, said the President was \nnot guilty, but the Arkansas bar said otherwise. So it is a very \ninteresting twist of fate that now nominees are being sent to the \nSenate by a man who is recommended for disbarment, and probably will be \ndisbarred, from the practice of law in the State of Arkansas.\n  Let me conclude on a couple of points on the nominees. I have spent a \nlot of time on the nomination of Timothy Dyk, and I am very much \nopposed to Mr. Dyk being a District Judge for the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit. Some of the material I looked at I am \nnot going to go into on the Senate floor. But a couple of things in \nwhich Mr. Dyk was involved concerned me.\n  In a Washington Post article appearing in May of 1984, the Post \nreported that Timothy Dyk ``agreed to work for free for the anti-\ncensorship lobby, People for the American Way, to sue the Texas Board \nof Education over the board's 10-year-old rule that evolution be taught \nas ``only one of several explanations of the origins of mankind.''\n  People for the American Way is pretty much a liberal activist, anti-\nChristian group that seeks to rid public education of any mention of \nGod at all in its educational language and literature, or in schools.\n  The president for the People for the American Way, Ralph G. Neas, \nspoke in January of 1999 about his vision of the People for the \nAmerican Way. Listen to what he said because you have to remember that \nMr. Dyk worked for them pro bono, for nothing. Mr. Neas said:\n\n       As you may know, People for the American Way has always \n     carefully monitored the radical religious right and its \n     political allies.\n\n  Mr. Neas believes that most if not all Republicans are members of the \n``radical right.''\n  He further said:\n\n       The effort by some elements of the conservative religious \n     and political movements to undermine support for public \n     education goes back decades before Phyllis Schlafly and Gary \n     Bauer and Pat Robertson came on the scene, before the days of \n     the Heritage Foundation, back before Newt Gingrich and the \n     Contract with America.\n\n  As you can see by his comments, People for the American Way is now \nand has always been an anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization.\n  He continues by attacking Orrin Hatch, Governor George Bush, and \nSenator John McCain for supporting schooling voucher legislation.\n  Let me repeat that. He attacked Senator John McCain, Senator Orrin \nHatch, and Governor George Bush for supporting school vouchers.\n  I guess Timothy Dyk might turn out to be one of the greatest judges \nin the history of the world, for all I know. I can't predict that. I am \nnot in the business of predicting the future. I am trying to take a \nlook at what I have before me to make a decision on whether or not a \nperson is fit to be on the court.\n  I understand that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a staunch \nsupporter, but I have to vote no because I don't believe that a \npotential judge who uses that kind of language and who makes those \nkinds of decisions with those kinds of organizations on a pro bono \nbasis is the kind of person I want on the court.\n  I must say that there are thousands of judges--and thousands of \npeople who want to be judges--all over America who serve, do it \nhonorably, and interpret the Constitution as fairly and as equitably as \npossible.\n  Why is it that time and time again before this body come these \noutrageous judicial activists appointed by this President? Some have \nsaid, well, the other side of the aisle gave you a lot of judges during \nthe Bush administration. A lot of those judges, if not most, were not \njudicial activists.\n  It is one thing to have a different philosophical view and to be \nnominated by a President of a different philosophical view. We are not \ninterested in philosophy on the Supreme Court, or on any court. We are \ninterested in supporting the Constitution and interpreting the \nConstitution the way the founders would have wanted us to do it. They \nare not your activists. I don't care about your activists. But I think \nwhen you hear people representing on a pro bono basis--for no money; \nyou are doing it because you want to do it; you are not getting paid--\nthere is a difference. When somebody retains you as a lawyer, you have \nevery right to do that. That is the American way, and you have every \nright to do it pro bono. But it tells you about somebody when they \nrepresent somebody pro bono. Terrorists were represented pro bono by \nMr. Dyk.\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\n  I think when you are looking at these things, you have to say to \nyourself, well, these are the people with whom he wants to surround \nhimself with pro bono services. I guess I have to ask, isn't there \nanybody out there somewhere that we could have as a nominee who doesn't \nhave to be out there talking about and criticizing Members of the \nSenate because they support school vouchers and are representing groups \nthat do that, or even on the issue of evolution? I think it is going \ntoo far. I think it is sad, frankly, that we have to deal with it.\n  The other nominee before us who has been talked about already is \nGerald Lynch for the Southern District of New York. The reason I oppose \nhis nomination is for the same reasons.\n  As my colleague, Senator Sessions, quoted, Attorney Lynch wrote:\n\n       Justice Brennan's belief that the Constitution must be \n     given meaning for the present seems to me a simple necessity; \n     his long and untiring labor to articulate the principles of \n     fairness, liberty, and equality found in the Constitution in \n     the way that he believed made most sense today seems far more \n     honest and honorable than the pretense that the meaning of \n     those principles can be found in eighteenth or nineteenth-\n     century dictionaries.\n\n  That is a pretty legalistic phrase. Let's put it in English. It means \nwhat the founders said in the 1700s isn't relevant. It is not relevant. \nIt is relevant today. What is relevant today is relevant today. And, \nfrankly, the Constitution those guys wrote in the late 1700s doesn't \napply to us today. The Constitution is not the same. It is totally \nwrong.\n  Why is it that we criticize those who wrote the Constitution when we \nattribute time and time again to some great people who profess to be \nscholars on the Constitution? They come down here on the Senate floor \nsaying: You know, the founders didn't mean that; that isn't what they \nmeant; they didn't mean to say that; if you look at it literally, it \ndoes not mean that.\n  When you go back and find the comments of the founders, over and over \nagain the founders say exactly what they meant. Not only did they write \nit in the Constitution but they explained it in their own words in the \ndebate. And they still say they didn't mean what they said.\n  I think if you find a document that was written by somebody and then \nyou find the explanation, and it says what they meant--they said, \n``This is what I meant''--that is pretty obvious.\n  I think we are seeing evidence here again of a person who will be \nanother judicial activist who is going to say the Constitution isn't \nrelevant today, so, therefore, I can put my interpretation into the \nConstitution. That is the kind of nominees that we are talking about \nhere. This is very troubling.\n  That is why I rise today to oppose both the nominations of Timothy \nDyk and Gerard Lynch, and I will also oppose a couple of other nominees \nin the future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to support the confirmation \nof Jerry Lynch to the District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork. Professor Lynch is the Paul J. Kellner Professor of Law at \nColumbia Law School, the outstanding law school from which he received \nhis law degree in 1975. He began his legal career by clerking on the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals for Judge Feinberg and then on the \nUnited States Supreme Court for Justice Brennan.\n  He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of \nNew York back in the early 1980's and as the Chief Appellate Attorney \nfor that office. In 1990 he returned to the office at the request of \nPresident Bush's U.S. Attorney to head the Criminal Division of that \noffice.\n  Even his opponents must describe him as ``a man of personal integrity \nand a man of considerable legal skill.'' That he is. He is also a \nperson who served as a prosecutor during two Republican \nAdministrations.\n  Professor Lynch is well aware that he has been nominated to the \nDistrict Court and not to the United States Supreme Court and that he \nwill be bound by precedent. He has committed to follow precedent and \nthe law and not to substitute his own views. In his answers to the \nJudiciary Committee, he wrote:\n\n       There is no question in my mind that the principal \n     functions of the courts is the resolution of disputes and \n     grievances brought to the courts by the parties. A judge who \n     comes to the bench with an agenda, or a set of social \n     problems he or she would like to ``solve,'' is in the wrong \n     business. In our system of separation of powers, the courts \n     exist to apply the Constitution and laws to the cases that \n     are presented to them, not to resolve political or social \n     issues. The bulk of the work of the lower courts consists of \n     criminal cases and the resolution of private disputes and \n     commercial matters.\n\n  In fact, in specific response to written questions from Senator \nSessions, Professor Lynch wrote that he understands that the role of a \ndistrict court judge requires him to follow the precedents of higher \ncourts faithfully and to give them full force and effect, even if he \npersonally disagrees with such precedents.\n  His opponents excerpt a couple lines of text from a 1984 book review \nand a eulogy to his former boss, Justice Brennan, rewrite them and \nargue that their revisions of his words indicate a judicial philosophy \nthat he will not enforce the Constitution but his own policy \npreferences. They are wrong.\n  I have read the articles from which opponents excerpted out of \ncontext a phrase here and a phrase there to try to construct some \njustification for opposing this nominee. In his 1984 book review, \nProfessor Lynch was criticizing a book that defended the legitimacy of \nconstitutional policymaking by the judiciary. That's right: Professor \nLynch was on the side of the debate that criticized personal \npolicymaking by judges and counseled judicial restraint.\n  Professor Lynch criticized the author for a ``theory justifying \njudges in writing their own systems of moral philosophy into the \nConstitution.'' Nonetheless, opponents of this nominee turn the review \non its head, as if Professor Lynch were the proponent of the \nproposition he was criticizing.\n  These opponents take a throw-away line out of context from the book \nreview and miss the point of the review. What his critics miss is the \nfact that Professor Lynch argued against the Supreme Court being the \npolitically activist institution that the book he is criticizing seeks \nto justify. Professor Lynch argues against judges, even Supreme Court \nJustices, becoming moral philosophers. He writes, following the excerpt \non which his critics rely:\n\n       [N]either of these claims has force when the Court speaks \n     through the medium of moral philosophy. First, there is \n     little reason to expect judges to be more likely than \n     legislators to reach correct answers to moral questions. \n     After all, judges possess no particular training or expertise \n     that gives them better insight than other citizens into \n     whether abortion is a fundamental right or an inexcusable \n     wrong. Disinterestedness alone does not determine success in \n     intellectual endeavor. . . .\n\n  Ignored by his critic is also the written answer that Professor Lynch \nfurnished Senator Sessions explaining what he meant by the statement \nthat is being misread and misinterpreted, again, by his opponents. \nProfessor Lynch explained:\n\n       The quoted statement comes from a book review in which I \n     sharply criticize a book that makes the claim that courts \n     have authority to enforce moral principles of its own \n     choosing, a position I do not share. In the quoted passage, I \n     was attempting to explain why the Supreme Court is given \n     power to enforce the text of a written Constitution.\n\n  The other quote being criticized is taken from a short memorial to \nJustice Brennan, a man for whom Professor Lynch had clerked and whom he \nrespected. The memorial was apparently written just after Justice \nBrennan's funeral. Professor Lynch wrote of Justice Brennan's humanity \nand his patriotism. Nonetheless, it appears that even this statement of \ntribute to a departed friend is grist for the mill of opponents looking \nfor something they can declare objectionable.\n  Ignored by opponents is the direct response to Senator Sessions' \nquestion about the eulogy for Justice Brennan. Professor Lynch \nresponded to Senator Sessions:\n\n       The statement quoted comes from a eulogy to Justice Brennan \n     on the occasion of his death. I do not believe that good \n     faith attempts to discern the original intent of the framers \n     are dishonest or dishonorable. Judges and historians daily \n     make honorable and honest attempts to understand the thoughts \n     of the framers.\n       Too often, however, the history that lawyers present to \n     courts is deliberately or inadvertently biased by the \n     position that lawyers as advocates would like to reach, and \n     such resort to partial and limited sources can be used to \n     support results that accord with policy preferences. While \n     Justice Brennan took positions that can be criticized as \n     activist, it\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\n     is generally agreed that he was forthright in stating his \n     approach.\n\n  Likewise ignored is Professor Lynch's statement to Senator Sessions: \n``The judge's role is to apply the law, not to make it.''\n  Also ignored are the acknowledgments by Professor Lynch in the course \nof the memorial itself that the ``charge that Justice Brennan confused \nhis own values with those of the Constitution does capture one piece of \nthe truth'' and that the ``problem, and here is the heart of the \nargument against Brennanism, is that there will always be different \ninterpretations of what those core shared values mean in particular \nsituations.'' I commend Professor Lynch for his candor.\n  It is sad that Senators have come to oppose nominees and the Senate \nhas refused to move forward on nominees because they clerked, as young \nlawyers just out of law school for a certain judge or because clients \nthey represented during the course of their practice and while \nfulfilling their professional responsibilities had certain types of \nclaims and charges against them or brought certain types of claims. \nThat is what underlies the opposition to both this highly qualified \nnominee and to Fred Woocher, a nominee to an emergency vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California.\n  Mr. Woocher participated in a confirmation hearing last November and \nhas been denied consideration by the Judiciary Committee for more than \nsix months. Mr. Woocher has had a distinguished legal career and is \nfully qualified to serve as a District Judge. But Mr. Woocher clerked \nfor Justice Brennan after his academic studies at Yale and Stanford.\n  Apparently, Senators who are holding up consideration of Mr. Woocher \nlikewise believe that those who do not favor the conservative activism \nof Justice Scalia or Chief Justice Rehnquist should oppose the \nappointment of people who clerked for such jurists. Certainly that is \nthe point that they are establishing by their opposition to these \noutstanding nominees.\n  Any Senator is entitled to his or her opinions and to vote as he or \nshe sees fit on this or any nominee. But the excerpts relied upon by \nopponents of Professor Lynch, from over 20 years of writing and legal \nwork, do not support the conclusion that Professor Lynch is insensitive \nto the proper role of a judge or that he would ignore the rule of law \nor precedent. To charge that Judge Lynch would consider himself not to \nbe bound by the plain words of the Constitution is to misperceive Jerry \nLynch and ignore his legal career.\n  With respect to the unfounded charge that Professor Lynch would \ninterpret the Constitution by ignoring its words, that is simply not \ntrue. Here is what Professor Lynch told Senator Thurmond at his \nconfirmation hearing:\n\n       I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the starting place in \n     interpreting the Constitution is with the language of the \n     document. As with legislation passed by the Congress, it is \n     the wording of the Constitution that was ratified by the \n     people and that constitutes the binding contract under which \n     our Government is created.\n       In attempting to understand the language, it is most \n     important to look to the original intent of those who wrote \n     it and the context in which it was written. At the same time, \n     with respect to many of those principles, the Framers \n     intended to adopt very broad principles. Sometimes the \n     understanding of those principles changes over time.\n\n  In truth, the opposition to this nomination seems to boil down to the \nfact that Professor Lynch clerked for Justice Brennan, a distinguished \nand respected member of the United States Supreme Court, more than 20 \nyears ago.\n  In light of the arguments made by the Senator of Alabama on the \nworkload of the Federal Circuit, I wanted to add to the Record the \nletter from the Chamber of Commerce to the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts from last summer. Although \nthese statistics are as out of date as those used by the Senator from \nAlabama, the letter makes several important points. The caseload of the \nFederal Circuit is not inflated by prisoner cases but is filled with \ncomplicated intellectual property cases and other complex litigation. I \nask consent to print the August 1999 letter from the Chamber of \nCommerce in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n         Courts, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: This letter again urges that the \n     Judiciary Committee promptly consider the nomination of \n     Timothy Dyk for the Federal Circuit and that that nomination \n     be reported out of Committee before August recess. It has \n     been almost sixteen months since Mr. Dyk was first nominated \n     to the Federal Circuit, it has been nearly a year since he \n     was first voted out of Committee. So far as the Chamber is \n     aware, he is the only judicial nominee voted out of Committee \n     last year who has been scheduled for a second hearing. We \n     urge that a second hearing is unnecessary.\n       We understand that the principal concern about Mr. Dyk's \n     nomination now relates to the need to fill the vacancy. There \n     are now not one, but two vacancies on the Federal Circuit. We \n     recommend that Mr. Dyk's nomination be acted upon promptly so \n     that the Federal Circuit will not be seriously understaffed.\n       The question about the need to fill the vacancy was \n     considered in the March 1999 Report on the Appropriate \n     Allocation of Judgeships in the United States Courts of \n     Appeals. The Report generally agrees that ``the best measure \n     of when a court requires additional judges is how long it \n     takes, after an appeal is filed with a court, to reach a \n     final decision on the merits.'' (p.5) The Report also states \n     that: Over the last five years, the Federal Circuit's ``mean \n     disposition is the lowest of any circuit court. . . .''\n       But the Report's comparison between the Federal Circuit and \n     the other Circuits is a comparison of apples and oranges. The \n     Federal Circuit data appear to have been computed using a \n     ``mean'' or average number, while the data for the other \n     Circuits was computed using a median number. Over the most \n     recent five-year period (1994-1998), using median data, the \n     disposition time for the Federal Circuit exceeded that for \n     the Second, the Third and the Eighth Circuits. The most \n     recent data (for 1998) show that the median disposition time \n     for the Federal Circuit equals or exceeds that from four \n     other Circuits (the First, Third, Eighth and District of \n     Columbia). Moreover, the median disposition time for the \n     Federal Circuit increased 20%; from 7.9 months in 1994 to 9.5 \n     months in 1998. These data directly support acting on the \n     pending nomination.\n       To be sure the Federal Circuit has a smaller numerical \n     caseload than other Circuits because the Federal Circuit, as \n     Congress prescribed, does not hear criminal or prisoner \n     cases. But it does have a heavy (and increasing) docket of \n     intellectual property cases and other forms of complex \n     litigation.\n       Congress intended to give the Federal Circuit exclusive \n     jurisdiction over patent cases, and to be the court of last \n     resort in the vast majority of those cases. (Supreme Court \n     Review is unlikely because there can be no conflict with \n     another Circuit). Under these circumstances, it is critical \n     to the Congressional design and to the business community \n     that the court not give short shrift to these important \n     cases. There is a substantial risk that if the Federal \n     Circuit is understaffed, and limited to ten judges, it will \n     not have time to give these cases the attention that they \n     deserve. The Chamber, as well as business-organizations such \n     as Eastman Kodak, Ingersoll Rand and Lubrizol, expressed this \n     concern to the Committee.\n       Finally, we understand Senator Grassley's concern that the \n     Federal Circuit does not have a formal mediation program. We \n     note that Mr. Dyk, in his first hearing, supported the \n     creation of such a program, and that he has extensive \n     experience in mediating intellectual property cases. He could \n     make it important to the Court in that area, and we urge that \n     the Court be allowed to secure the benefit of Mr. Dyk's \n     services as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lonnie P. Taylor.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to support the long overdue \nconfirmation of Tim Dyk to the Federal Circuit. The Judiciary Committee \nreported out Mr. Dyk in 1998 by an overwhelming, bipartisan margin. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Dyk's nomination died a slow death last Congress, as \nhe waited in vain for confirmation by unanimous consent or, in the \nalternative, at least a floor vote.\n  This Congress, Mr. Dyk has had wait yet another year and a half for \nSenate consideration after his renomination and second overwhelming \nJudiciary Committee approval. This delay has been unfair to Mr. Dyk and \nhis family, who have had to put their lives on hold as he awaits \nconfirmation. It has also been unfair to the Federal Circuit, which \nwill be enormously enhanced by his ascension. We are lucky Mr. Dyk was \nwilling to wait; other outstanding candidates, however, may be \ndissuaded from making the already arduous sacrifices necessary to serve \nin the federal judiciary.\n  Finally, it now appears that Mr. Dyk is reaching the end of his long \nroad to\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\nconfirmation and will soon take his deserved seat on the bench. He is \nan excellent candidate--a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law \nSchool, a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren on the Supreme Court, \nand a litigator with a long, distinguished practice and a history of \npublic service.\n  I strongly support this nominee and urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Bradley Smith\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield myself whatever time I consume.\n  Mr. President, I begin my comments by rebutting some of the points \nmade by colleagues on the other side of the Brad Smith nomination. One \nof the quotes used against Professor Smith out of context was that he \nsaid:\n\n       The most sensible reform is the repeal of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act.\n\n  Using this quotation to imply that Professor Smith would repeal the \nFECA exemplifies the meritless arguments being used to block the \nnomination of the most qualified FEC nominee in the history of the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  When this statement is read in context and the ellipsis are removed, \nit is clear that Professor Smith is only talking about the contribution \nlimits in the Federal Election Campaign Act. On that point he is in \npretty good company: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Hugo Black \nalso held that view. Justices Scalia and Thomas hold that view. \nProfessor George Priest of the Yale Law School, Professor John Lott of \nYale Law School, Dean Kathleen Sullivan at Stanford Law School, Dean \nNelson Polsby at George Mason Law School, and former Solicitor General \nand Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and now Harvard law \nprofessor, Charles Fried, have all espoused this view on campaign \ncontribution limits.\n  I assume all of them would by that argument be barred from serving on \nthe Federal Election Commission. Of course, they would not be barred \nfrom serving on the Federal Election Commission, and neither should \nProfessor Smith.\n  In holding this view, Mr. Smith is no more in disagreement with the \nlaw than the Brennan Center and Common Cause, Professor Neuborne, and \nothers who think the law should allow expenditure limits. These people \nat the Brennan Center and Common Cause advocate a position contrary to \nthe law as declared by the Supreme Court in Buckley and affirmed in \nShrink PAC. Under the standard being applied to Mr. Smith, all of them \nare barred also from serving on the FEC. Clearly, that would be an \nabsurd result.\n  The Democratic nominee before the Senate, Mr. McDonald, disagrees \neven more sharply with the Supreme Court than Professor Smith. In open \nand recorded meetings of the FEC on August 11, 1994, in response to a \nrecitation of election laws interpreted by the Supreme Court, Mr. \nMcDonald declared: The Court just didn't get it.\n  He doesn't care what the courts say. Clearly, we can't confirm him if \ndisagreement with the law disqualifies an FEC nominee. If there is \nanyone who has displayed contempt for the law, it is Danny McDonald, \nnot Brad Smith.\n  Mr. Smith has acknowledged that his view that there should be no \ncontribution limits is no more the law than is the view of the Brennan \nCenter and Common Cause and some of my colleagues that there should be \nexpenditure limits. Moreover, he has made clear he would have no \nproblem enforcing contribution limits.\n  When asked if he would pledge to uphold his oath, he said he would \nproudly and without reservation take that oath, and everyone who knows \nhim, including Dan Lowenstein, former national board member of Common \nCause, has no doubt that Brad Smith will faithfully enforce the laws \nwritten by Congress and interpreted by the courts.\n  Professor Smith's detractors fail to note that he has made clear in \nhis testimony before the Rules Committee that if the Shrink Missouri \ncase had been a Federal case and come before the FEC for an enforcement \naction, he would have had no problem voting for enforcement action in \nthat kind of case.\n  So the notion that Smith ignored Shrink PAC in his testimony is \ncompletely unfounded. I refer my colleagues to page 40 of the Rules \nCommittee Hearing Report dated March 8 of this year. Opponents argue \nProfessor Smith says problems with election law have been ``exacerbated \nor created by the Federal Election Campaign Act'' as interpreted by the \ncourts.\n\n  So what? Supreme Court Justices have expressed concern that the \nFederal Election Campaign Act as interpreted by the courts has had \nunintended consequences which have exacerbated or created problems with \nour campaign finance system. The Supreme Court Justices have said that. \nIn Shrink PAC, Justice Kennedy opined: It is the Court's duty to face \nup to adverse, unintended consequences flowing from our prior \ndecisions.\n  He goes on to assert, FECA and cases interpreting it have ``forced a \nsubstantial amount of political speech underground.'' Noting the \nproblems created by the Federal Election Campaign Act, Justice Kennedy \nexplained that under existing law ``issue advocacy, like soft money, is \nunrestricted--see Buckley at 42 to 44--while straightforward speech in \nthe form of financial contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject \nto full disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not * * * \nThis mocks the First Amendment. Our First Amendment principles surely \nsays that an interest thought to be the compelling reason for enacting \na law is cast into grave doubt when a worse evil surfaces than the \nlaw's actual operation.\n  In my view, that system creates dangers greater than the one it has \nreplaced.\n  So, I guess this passage would disqualify Justice Kennedy of the \nSupreme Court from serving on the Federal Election Commission. So, are \nwe to punish Professor Smith for telling the truth? Professor Burt \nNeuborne of the Brennan Center has written that at least three \nextremely unfortunate consequences flow from Buckley.\n  Neuborne also writes that:\n\n       Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty \n     existing in our political culture; furtherer deepening public \n     cynicism.\n\n  Then is Professor Neuborne prohibited from serving on FEC? We all \nknow that many of the problems with the current system are caused by \nexcessively low contribution limits. President Clinton, other \nDemocrats, and many people from my own party have publicly acknowledged \nthis reality and the need for raising hard money limits. So I guess all \nof those folks would also be disqualified from serving on the FEC.\n  Professor Smith is opposed also because he has written that the \nFederal election law is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds \nwith the first amendment.\n  It has been said that Professor Smith is unfit for the FEC because he \nbelieves that the Federal election law is profoundly at odds with the \nfirst amendment. Quoting his 1995 policy study from Cato Institute:\n  Here is the Supreme Court in Buckley. Justice Brennan, in fact, who \nis known to have written the opinion:\n\n       The Supreme Court's decisions in Mills v. Alabama and Miami \n     Herald Publishing v. Tornillo held that legislative \n     restrictions on advocacy of the election and defeat of \n     political candidates are wholly at odds with the first \n     amendment.\n\n  So, now we are keeping Professor Smith off the FEC, it is argued, for \nquoting from the majority opinion in the Buckley case? From quoting \nfrom the majority opinion in the Buckley case? Before reformers began \nattacking Justice Brennan for authoring this quotation that Mr. Smith \nhas cited, let me note that Justice Brennan's observation has been \nborne out by the fact that provisions of FECA are still being declared \nunconstitutional as recently as the first week of May, when the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional the party-\ncoordinated expenditure limits.\n  It is worth noting this was in a 1996 case on remand from the Supreme \nCourt, a case known as Colorado Republican, in which the Supreme Court \ndeclared unconstitutional the party\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nindependent expenditure limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act, \ndespite reformer assertions that they were undoubtedly constitutional.\n  So, it is simply absurd to attack Professor Smith for quoting from a \nmajority opinion in a Supreme Court case. But that is what Professor \nSmith's detractors are doing. They are saying he is unfit to serve on \nthe Supreme Court--in this case the Federal Election Commission--\nbecause he quotes majority opinions that are binding laws and factually \ncorrect statements of how FECA has been treated by the courts.\n  I might also note that efforts to paint this quotation as an absolute \nstatement of his views on the entire Federal Election Campaign Act also \nlack any merit. If one reads the article in which Bradley Smith recites \nthis quotation by the Court, he makes clear that he supports many \naspects of the Federal Election Campaign Act, including the statute's \ndisclosure provisions. Arguments being asserted against Professor Smith \nare, at best, half truths constructred by reform groups, but many \nsimply misstate Smith's position and reformers and their allies at the \nNew York Times and the Washington Post persist in advancing these \nspecious arguments, even after they have been shown to lack any merit \nwhatsoever.\n  It seems that Professor Smith's detractors will say anything to get \nwhat they want without any regard for either facts or logic.\n  I also note even the intellectual leader of the reform movement, Burt \nNeuborne, has written that:\n\n       The arguments against regulation are powerful and must be \n     respected.\n\n  Professor Smith's opponents conclude he should not be confirmed \nbecause he has said:\n\n       People should be allowed to spend whatever they want on \n     politics.\n\n  Well, so what? Under current law, people can spend whatever they want \nin the form of independent expenditures. Parties can spend whatever \nthey want in the form of independent expenditures and coordinated \nexpenditures. Wealthy candidates such as Jon Corzine in New Jersey can \nspend whatever they want from their personal fortunes. Moreover, this \nstatement clearly refers to expenditure limits. Since Buckley, the \nSupreme Court has consistently held expenditure limits \nunconstitutional. Although so-called reformers wish this were not the \nlaw, it is the law. So, again, we are punishing Professor Smith for \nstating what the law is, not what the reformers would like it to be.\n  I would also like to note that Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center \nagrees with Brad Smith that contribution and spending limits have \nundemocratic effects. Neuborne has written:\n\n       Contribution and spending limits and unfair allocation of \n     public subsidies freeze the political status quo, providing \n     unfair advantage to incumbents.\n\n  Even the Brennan Center acknowledges that disagreement over Buckley \ndoes not disqualify a person from interpreting Buckley. The Brennan \nCenter has come under fire for its book ``Buckley Stops Here,'' and its \nviews that the current Federal Election Campaign Act is flawed. I \nwonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would vote \nagainst the executive director of the Brennan Center or the legal \ndirector of the Brennan Center who have criticized the current campaign \nfinance law and the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley? The Brennan \nCenter has committed blasphemy, equal to that of Professor Smith, by \nactually criticizing the reformers.\n  For example, Burt Neuborne, the Brennan Center's legal director, has \nstated:\n\n       Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty \n     existing in our political culture, further deepening public \n     cynicism.\n\n  Moreover, Neuborne has written that:\n\n       Contribution and spending limits freeze the political \n     status quo by providing unfair advantages to incumbents.\n\n  Neuborne has gone after the Holy Grail here. He has actually \ncriticized Congress and the Federal Election Campaign Act. Would those \nwho oppose Brad Smith also oppose the Brennan Center?\n  I would hope not. In fact, the Brennan Center's own web page \nacknowledges that this type of reasoning is invalid. Let me quote the \nBrennan Center regarding disagreements over Buckley and the Federal \nElection Campaign Act:\n\n       The fact that a person believes that the Court should \n     revise its constitutional rulings does not mean that either \n     side disrespects the law or is disqualified from interpreting \n     Buckley. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between \n     attitudes towards Buckley and constitutional analysis of \n     proposed campaign finance reforms.\n\n  One of the most troubling solutions asserted during this confirmation \ndebate is that if a nominee has personally questioned the law of \nCongress, then somehow that nominee is disqualified from government \nservice. Implementing these new type of litmus tests for government \nservice seems shortsighted and ill advised, to put it mildly. Certainly \nmost Members of Congress would be disqualified from future service in \nthe executive or judicial branch under this new test, since nearly \neveryday we question the wisdom of our laws and regularly vote in \nopposition to various laws.\n  This new litmus test barring government service for those who \nquestion the law would clearly exclude many fine and capable men and \nwomen. For example, it is not uncommon for Federal judges to personally \ndisagree with Congress' efforts to establish mandatory minimum \nsentences or uniform sentences through the use of the Federal \nsentencing guidelines. Judge Jose Cabranes, of the Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit, is a widely respected legal scholar who has been \nmentioned by both Democrats and Republicans as a possible Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  Judge Cabranes, however, has been a frequent and outspoken critic of \nthe law he follows every day. He has written a book and law review \narticles arguing that current Federal sentencing laws and guidelines \nare ill conceived and ``born of a naive commitment to the ideal of \nrationality.'' Judge Cabranes has stated:\n\n       The utopian experiment known as the U.S. Sentencing \n     Guidelines is a failure. . ..\n\n  Moreover, the respected Judge Cabranes disagrees with what has been \npopularly referred to as reform. Specifically, the judge explains that \nthe sentencing reformers' ``fixation on reducing sentencing disparity. \n. .has been a mistake of tragic proportions. . ..[T]he ideal [of equal \ntreatment] cannot be, and should not be, pursued through complex, \nmandatory guidelines. We reject the premise of [the] reformers. . ..''\n  Does this mean Judge Cabranes is unfit to be a Federal judge because \nhe does not personally agree with the sentencing law he must follow \nevery day from the bench? Is Judge Cabranes, who is an otherwise widely \nrespected judge, unfit to serve because he disagrees with the \nreformers, the wisdom of Congress, and the sentencing laws? Of course \nnot.\n  Let's look to the Supreme Court for a moment on the specific issue of \ncampaign finance law where reasonable people have and do disagree.\n  In the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Court had the difficult \ntask of harmonizing the Federal Election Campaign Act with the First \nAmendment to the Constitution. Ultimately, the Court's decision in \nBuckley established what has been the law of the land now for the past \nquarter-century. I think it is worth noting, however, that every \nSupreme Court Justice sitting in that case disagreed with the law \nCongress had passed.\n  Several of these renowned Justices even questioned the law that was \nultimately established by the Court's interpretation in Buckley. For \nexample, Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented in part. Justice Blackmun \ndissented in part. Justice White, Chief Justice Burger, and the current \nChief Justice Rehnquist--all of these jurists disagreed with both the \nlaw Congress passed and the law the Court created through its \ninterpretation in Buckley.\n  Several years after Buckley, Justice Marshall continued to question \nthe law established in Buckley. Does that mean the Senate would have \ndenied Justice Thurgood Marshall a seat on the FEC if he had desired \nsuch a seat? Would Justice Marshall be unfit to serve a fixed term on a \nbipartisan commission?\n  What about Chief Justice Burger who argued Congress did not have the \npower to limit contributions, require disclosure of small \ncontributions, or publicly finance Presidential campaigns? If the\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nChief Justice had wanted a seat on the FEC, would the Senate have \nrejected Chief Justice Burger as unfit to serve? After all, Chief \nJustice Burger's opinion is in contrast with that of the New York \nTimes. Would Chief Justice Burger have been unfit to serve a fixed term \non a bipartisan commission?\n  What about my fellow colleagues who question the Court's decision in \nBuckley? The junior Senator from California, for example, said on the \nfloor of the Senate only a few months ago:\n\n       I am one of these people who believe the Supreme Court \n     ought to take another look at Buckley v. Valeo because I \n     think it is off the wall.\n\n  Would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the junior \nSenator from California if she retired from the Senate and wanted to \nbecome an FEC Commissioner? After all, she disagrees with the law and \nwith the Court's decision in Buckley. Would she be unfit to serve?\n  What about noted scholars such as Joel Gora, the associate dean of \nthe Brooklyn Law School, who has criticized the Federal Election \nCampaign Act? Or Ira Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union? \nBoth Gora and Glasser were lawyers in the original Buckley case. Or \nKathleen Sullivan, the dean of the Stanford Law School? Or Lillian \nBeVier of the University of Virginia Law School? Or Professor Larry \nSabato of the University of Virginia and a former member of the 1990 \nSenate Campaign Finance Reform Panel named by Majority Leader George \nMitchell? Would these respected scholars, who question the law and \nshare many of Professor Smith's election law views, be disqualified \nfrom Government service at the FEC?\n\n  Professor Smith's sin, in the eyes of the reform industry, is \ntwofold: One, he understands the constitutional limitations on the \nGovernment's ability to regulate political speech, and, two, he has \npersonally advocated reform that is different from the approach favored \nby the New York Times.\n  Let me say loudly and clearly, I believe that neither an appreciation \nfor the first amendment nor disagreement with the New York Times and \nCommon Cause should disqualify an election law expert for service on \nthe Federal Election Commission.\n  As the numerous letters that have been flooding to me at the \ncommittee establish, Professor Smith's views are well within the \nmainstream of constitutional jurisprudence and commend, not disqualify, \nhim for Government service at the FEC. Personally, I think Professor \nSmith's views would be a breath of fresh air at a Commission whose \nactions have all too frequently been struck down as unconstitutional by \nthe courts.\n  Let me point out that the world of campaign finance is generally \ndivided into two camps of reasonable people who disagree with the \nSupreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment in Buckley. One \ncamp prefers more regulation; another camp prefers less regulation. \nNeither camp is perfectly happy with the current state of the law.\n  One camp is made up of the New York Times, Common Cause, the Brennan \nCenter, and scholars such as Professors Ronald Dworkin, Daniel \nLowenstein, and Burt Neuborne. I might add that reformers Neuborne and \nLowenstein have both written strong letters in support of Brad Smith's \nscholarship and writings on campaign finance.\n  The other camp is occupied by citizen groups ranging from the ACLU to \nthe National Right to Life Committee, and scholars such as Dean \nKathleen Sullivan, and Professors Joel Gora, Lillian BeVier, and Larry \nSabato. It is probably fair to say Danny McDonald is in one camp and \nBrad Smith is in the other. I definitely agree with one camp more than \nI do the other, but I do not think agreement with either camp makes a \nperson a lawless radical or a wild-eyed fanatic. And, I certainly do \nnot think membership in either camp should disqualify a bright, \nintelligent, ethical election law expert from service on a bipartisan \nFederal Election Commission.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the overwhelming letters of support \nfor Brad Smith and his unequivocal testimony before the Rules Committee \nconvince me without a doubt that Brad Smith understands that the role \nof an FEC Commissioner is to enforce the law as written and not to \nremake the law in his own image.\n  As I mentioned earlier, critics who have philosophical differences \nwith Professor Smith should heed the words of Professor Daniel Kobil, a \nformer board member of Common Cause. This is what he had to say:\n\n       I believe that much of the opposition--\n\n  Referring to Professor Smith--\n\n     is based not on what Brad has written or said about campaign \n     finance regulations, but on crude caricatures of his ideas. . \n     . . Although I do not agree with all of Brad's views on \n     campaign finance regulations, I believe that his scholarly \n     critique of these laws is cogent and largely within the \n     mainstream of current constitutional thought. . . . I am \n     confident that he will fairly administer the laws he is \n     charged with enforcing. . . .\n\n  Let me add the sentiments of Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law \nSchool, also a former board member of Common Cause. This is what he had \nto say:\n\n       Smith possesses integrity and vigorous intelligence that \n     should make him an excellent commissioner. He will understand \n     that his job is to enforce the law, even when he does not \n     agree with it.\n\n  Let me say a few words about the Democrats' nominee to the FEC, \nCommissioner Danny McDonald. First, the obvious: McDonald and I are in \ndifferent campaign finance reform camps. If I followed the new litmus \ntest that is being put forth by some in this confirmation debate, then \nI would have no choice but to vigorously oppose his nomination.\n  I have serious questions about McDonald's 18-year track record at the \nFEC. Commissioner McDonald's views and actions have been soundly \nrejected by the Federal courts in dozens of cases.\n  One of these cases, decided earlier this year, Virginia Society for \nHuman Life v. FEC, resulted in a nationwide injunction against an FEC \nregulation that Commissioner McDonald has endorsed for years.\n  Let me point out that this McDonald-endorsed regulation had already \nbeen struck down by several other Federal courts. Yet McDonald has \ncontinued to defy the Federal court rulings and stubbornly refuses to \nsupport changing the regulation. Two other cases, FEC v. Christian \nAction Network and FEC v. Political Contributions Data, Inc. resulted \nin the U.S. Treasury paying fines because the action taken by McDonald \nand the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or fact.''\n  Just last Friday, the Tenth Circuit struck down yet another FEC \nenforcement action as unconstitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of a dozen \ncases where the Federal courts have rejected the actions of McDonald \nand the FEC as unconstitutional.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Commissioner Mcdonald's views have been soundly rejected by \n     the federal courts in dozens of cases. The following twelve \n     cases are examples of the court's rejection of Mcdonald's \n     views as unconstitutional.\n       One of these cases, decided earlier this year, Virginia \n     Society for Human Life v. FEC, resulted in a nationwide \n     injunction against an FEC regulation that Commissioner \n     Mcdonald has endorsed for years--in refinance of several \n     court rulings declaring it unconstitutional.\n       Two of these cases, FEC v. Christian Action Network and FEC \n     v. Political Contributions Data, Inc. resulted in the U.S. \n     Treasury paying fines because the action taken by Mcdonald \n     and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or \n     fact.''\n        1.

FEC, United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, \n     3:99CV559 (2000).\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The list certainly does not contain all the cases \nwhere McDonald's views have been rejected by the Federal courts, but it \nshould give Members on both sides of the aisle a sense for which \nnominee is truly out of step with the law, the courts, and the \nConstitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of a letter \nfrom a first amendment lawyer, Manuel Klausner, who has been honored \nwith the Lawyer of the Year award for the Los Angeles Bar Association. \nMr. Klausner details serious concerns about Commissioner McDonald's \nvoting record at the FEC.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Law Offices of Manuel S. Klausner,\n\n                               Los Angeles, CA, February 29, 2000.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, United States Senate Committee on Rules and \n         Administration, Senate Russell Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am an attorney in Los Angeles, \n     and my practice emphasizes First Amendment, election law and \n     civil rights litigation. By way of background, I am a \n     founding editor of REASON Magazine and a trustee of the \n     Reason Foundation. I serve as general counsel to the \n     Individual Rights Foundation. This letter is written on my \n     own behalf, and is not intended to reflect the views of \n     Reason Foundation or the Individual Rights Foundation.\n       I was formerly a member of the faculty of the University of \n     Chicago Law School and am a past recipient of the Lawyer-of-\n     the-Year Award from the Constitutional Rights Foundation and \n     the Los Angeles Bar Association. I have written and spoken on \n     First Amendment and election law issues at law schools and \n     conferences in the United States and Europe.\n       As an attorney well versed in the First Amendment, I am \n     writing to urge you to reject the nomination of Danny Lee \n     McDonald to the Federal Election Commission.\n       As you well know, for many years the FEC has sought to \n     expand the scope of its jurisdiction beyond the limitations \n     the First Amendment places on the agency's authority to \n     regulate political speech. This has resulted in the FEC \n     having the worst litigation record of any major government \n     agency. It has also resulted in many citizens and citizen \n     groups being needlessly persecuted for exercising their First \n     Amendment rights. Some have blamed an overzealous general \n     counsel for the FEC's long history of contempt for the First \n     Amendment. But it must be remembered that, under the FECA, \n     the general counsel cannot pursue litigation that \n     impermissible chills free speech--unless commissioners \n     such as Danny Lee McDonald vote to adopt and enforce \n     unconstitutional regulations.\n       Commissioner McDonald's disregard for the rule of law in \n     our constitutional system of government is illustrated by his \n     role in the FEC's ongoing efforts to expand the definition of \n     express advocacy. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 44 (1976), \n     the Supreme Court ruled that the FECA could be applied \n     consistent with the First Amendment only if it were limited \n     to expenditures for communications that include words which, \n     in and of themselves, advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate. This clear categorical limit served a fundamental \n     purpose: It provided a way for people wishing to engage in \n     open and robust discussion of public issues to know ex ante \n     whether their speech was of a nature such that it had to \n     comply with the regulatory regime established by the FECA. \n     The Court did not want people to have their core First \n     Amendment right to engage in discussion of public issues \n     (even those intimately tied to public officials) burdened by \n     the apprehension that, at some time in the future, their \n     speech might be interpreted by the government as advocating \n     the election of a particular candidate. Ten years after \n     Buckley, in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 \n     U.S. 238 (1986), the Court reaffirmed the objective, bright-\n     line express advocacy standard.\n       Despite these clear,unequivocal precedents from the Supreme \n     Court regarding the bright-line, prophylactic standard for \n     express advocacy, it is my view that Commissioner McDonald \n     has flouted the rule of law. He has consistently supported \n     FEC enforcement actions and regulations that seek to \n     establish a broad, vague and subjective standard for express \n     advocacy. In doing so, Commissioner McDonald seeks to create \n     exactly the type of apprehension among speakers that the \n     First Amendment (as interpreted by the Supreme Court) \n     prohibits.\n       After the 1992 presidential election, Commissioner McDonald \n     voted to pursue an enforcement action against the Christian \n     Action Newtwork (CAN) for issue ads it ran concerning \n     Governor Bill Clinton's views on family values. McDonald \n     supported the suit against CAN despite the fact that the \n     General Counsel conceded that CAN's advertisement ``did not \n     employ `explicit words,' `express words' or `language' \n     advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate \n     for public office.'' FEC v. Christian Action Network, 110 \n     F.3d 1049, 1050 (4th Cir. 1997). McDonald voted for the case \n     to proceed on the theory that the ad constituted express \n     advocacy--not because of any express calls to action used in \n     it, but rather because of ``the superimposition of selected \n     imagery, film footage, and music, over the non-prescriptive \n     background language.'' Id. This was basically an effort to \n     blur the objective standard for express advocacy into a \n     vague, subjective ``totality of the circumstances'' test.\n       The United States District Court for the Western District \n     of Virginia dismissed the FEC's complaint against CAN on the \n     grounds that it did not state a well-founded legal claim. FEC \n     v. Christian Action Network, 894 F. Supp. 946, 948 (1995). \n     This was because the agencies's subjective theory of express \n     advocacy was completely contrary to the bright-line standard \n     articulated in Buckley and MCFL. Id. After this stern rebuff \n     by the district court, Commissioner McDonald voted to appeal \n     the case to the United States Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. The Circuit Court summarily affirmed in a per curiam \n     opinion. FEC v. Christian Action Network, 92 F.3d 1178 (4th \n     Cir. 1996).\n       The Christian Action Network subsequently asked the court \n     to order the FEC to pay the expenses it had incurred in \n     defending against the FEC's baseless lawsuit. The Fourth \n     Circuit ruled in CAN's favor, explaining that:\n       ``In the face of unequivocal Supreme Court and other \n     authority discussed, an argument such as that made by the FEC \n     in this case, that `no words of advocacy are necessary to \n     expressly advocate the election of a candidate,' simply \n     cannot be advanced in good faith (as disingenuousness in the \n     FEC's submissions attests), much less with `substantial \n     justification.' ''\n       Commissioner McDonald's vote to authorize the CAN \n     litigation was unfortunate, because taxpayers ended up \n     footing the bill for CAN's defense of meritless litigation. \n     His vote was particularly disturbing, because the CAN case \n     was not the last time Commissioner McDonald voted to pursue \n     litigation based on an impermissibly broad and subjective \n     definition of express advocacy. See, e.g., FEC v. Freedom's \n     Heritage Forum, No. 3:98CV-549-S (W.D. Ky September 29, \n     1999). Sadly the CAN litigation did not cause Commissioner \n     McDonald to question his broad and subjective theory of \n     express advocacy. While the CAN case was being litigated, \n     Commissioner McDonald voted to enact a regulation that \n     defines express advocacy in exactly the same broad and \n     subjective terms that the courts have rejected. And despite \n     this regulation being declared unconstitutional on several \n     occasions, see, e.g., Maine Right to Life Committee v. FEC, \n     98 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1996), Commissioner McDonald has \n     repeatedly voted against amending the agency's definition of \n     express advocacy to comply with the law as declared by the \n     courts of the United States. Earlier this year, the United \n     States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia \n     issued a nationwide injunction against the FEC's enforcement \n     of the broad and subjective definition of express advocacy \n     that Commissioner McDonald has consistently supported. \n     Virginia Society for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, No. \n     3:99CV559 (E.D. Va. Jan. 4, 2000). Nevertheless, just a \n     few weeks ago, Commissioner McDonald voted against \n     reconsidering the agency's definition of express advocacy.\n       It must be noted that Commissioner McDonald cannot \n     reasonably assert that his support for a broad and subjective \n     definition of express advocacy is grounded in the Ninth \n     Circuit's decision in FEC v. Furgatch, 807 F.2d 857 (9th Cir. \n     1987). As more than one court has made clear, Furgatch is an \n     inherently suspect decision because it does not discuss or \n     even mention the Supreme Court's ruling in MCFL, which was \n     decided a month before Furgatch. But, even to the extent \n     Furgatch is good law, the broad definition of express \n     advocacy that Commissioner McDonald consistently supports \n     goes beyond what even the Furgatch court permitted. The \n     Fourth Circuit has aptly summarized the discrepancy between \n     the broad FEC regulation defining express advocacy (which \n     Commissioner McDonald voted to approve) and the loose \n     definition used in Furgatch:\n       ``It is plain that the FEC has simply selected certain \n     words or phrases from Furgatch that give the FEC the broadest \n     possible authority to regulate political speech * * * and \n     ignored those portions of Furgatch * * * which focus on the \n     words and text of the message.''\n       Moreover, the FEC itself has acknowledged that its broad \n     definition of express advocacy is not fully supported by \n     Furgatch. In its brief in opposition to Supreme Court review \n     of Furgatch the FEC described as dicta the portions from \n     Furgatch that made their way into the agency's express \n     advocacy regulation. See FEC Brief in Opposition to \n     Certiorari in Furgatch at 7. And just last year in FEC Agenda \n     Document No. 99-40 at 2, the FEC's General Counsel conceded \n     that the broad view of express advocacy Commissioner McDonald \n     endorses is not completely supported by Furgatch, but only \n     ``largely based'' on Furgatch. In short, neither the courts \n     nor the FEC view Furgatch as fully justifying the definition \n     of express advocacy that Commissioner McDonald endorses.\n       Unfortunately, the history of the FEC's express advocacy \n     rulemaking is just one of many examples I could proffer of \n     Commissioner McDonald's disregard for the Constitution and \n     the rule of law. By supporting the agency's willful efforts \n     to disregard the law as pronounced by the courts of the \n     United States, Commissioner McDonald has\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n     helped to create a situation in which an individual's First \n     Amendment rights vary--depending upon where they happen to \n     live in the United States. Of course, even people who reside \n     in regions of the country where the controlling court of \n     appeals has rejected the FEC's efforts to expand its \n     jurisdiction over political speech, are still chilled from \n     conveying their views on issues. After all, if they fund a \n     public communication that is broadcast into a neighboring \n     state that is in a federal circuit which has not ruled on the \n     FEC's novel theories, they may find themselves the test case \n     for that Circuit and be exposed to lengthy and costly \n     litigation.\n       When federal agencies are allowed to create such a \n     patchwork system of speech regulation, public confidence in \n     the competence and integrity of the administrative state \n     declines. People come to feel that their rights extend no \n     further than the capricious whims of government bureaucrats.\n       It is for Congress in its capacity as the body charged with \n     overseeing independent agencies to take the lead in remedying \n     such problems and reining in agencies that are out of \n     control. You can start reining in the FEC by making public \n     officials such as Commissioner McDonald accountable for \n     disregarding the rule of law and the constitutional rights of \n     citizens. By rejecting the nomination of Danny Lee McDonald, \n     Congress can signal that it will not tolerate FEC \n     Commissioners who arrogantly refuse to honor their oath to \n     uphold and defend the Constitution. By rejecting Danny Lee \n     McDonald--a man who has for almost twenty years demonstrated \n     contempt for the rights of ordinary Americans and the rulings \n     of federal courts--Congress can begin to restore confidence \n     that the Federal Election Commission will not continue to \n     trample on core First Amendment rights.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Manuel S. Klausner.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has \ndisplayed a disregard for the law, the courts, and the Constitution. It \nhas hurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally \nprotected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money.\n  Equally troubling is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently \nchose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee \nwhile serving as a Commissioner to the Federal Election Commission.\n  On August 22, 1997, the General Counsel to the Democratic National \nCommittee, Joseph Sandler, testified under oath that it was his \nunderstanding that Commissioner McDonald had pursued the \n``chairmanship'' of the DNC in late 1996 or 1997. I must say I am very \ntroubled by the fact that an FEC Commissioner, who is charged with \ndisplaying impartiality and good judgment, would seek the highest \nposition in the Democratic National Committee while regulating the \nDemocratic Party and its candidates and, I might add, while regulating \nthe archrival of his party; that is, the Republican Party, and its \ncandidates.\n  As the distinguished Minority Leader stated in a floor speech on \nFebruary 28 of this year:\n\n       [The] law states that [FEC] Commissioners should be \n     ``chosen on the basis of their experience, integrity, \n     impartiality and good judgment.''\n\n  I have serious questions about whether an FEC Commissioner exhibits \n``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks the highest position \nin his political party and simultaneously regulates that party and its \ncandidates and regulates the competitor party and its candidates.\n  All that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test \nwhereby we ``Bork'' nominations to a bipartisan panel based on their \nmembership in a particular campaign finance camp. I am prepared to \nfollow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to \nsupport Commissioner McDonald's nomination, assuming that McDonald's \nparty grants similar latitude to the Republican choice.\n  In fact, I believe it is the very presence of Commissioners such as \nMr. McDonald who make Professor Smith all the more necessary at the \nFEC. The FEC needs Brad Smith's constitutional expertise to help \nprevent the string of unconstitutional FEC actions which McDonald \nsupported. As Dean Kathleen Sullivan stated in support of Brad Smith:\n\n       I think it is a good thing . . . to have people who are \n     very attuned to constitutional values in government \n     positions[.]\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, I personally believe that Professor \nSmith's intelligence, his work ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of \nelection law, and, to quote from the statute, his ``experience, \nintegrity, impartiality and good judgment'' will be a tremendous asset \nto the FEC and to the American taxpayers who have been forced to pay \nfor unconstitutional FEC actions.\n  Professor Smith is a widely respected, prolific author on Federal \nelection law and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the 25-\nyear history of the Federal Election Commission. I am firmly convinced \nhe would faithfully and impartially uphold the law and the Constitution \nas a Commissioner at the FEC, and I wholeheartedly support his \nnomination.\n  In the words of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       This Mr. Smith should go to Washington.\n\n  Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 60 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first let me remind my colleagues that Mr. \nSmith, in an article he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, concluded his \narticle by saying:\n\n       The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the \n     Federal Elections Campaign Act.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article of Wednesday, March \n19, 1997, entitled ``Rule of Law, Why Campaign Finance Reform Never \nWorks,'' by Bradley A. Smith, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 19, 1997]\n\n                              Rule of Law\n\n                Why Campaign Finance Reform Never Works\n\n                         (By Bradley A. Smith)\n\n       Think campaign finance reform isn't an incumbent's \n     protection racket? Just look at the spending limits included \n     in the Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingld bills, the hot \n     ``reform'' bills on Capitol Hill.\n       Shays-Meehan would limit spending in House races to \n     $600,000. In 1996, every House incumbent who spent less than \n     $500,000 won compared with only 3% of challengers who spent \n     that little. However, challengers who spent between 0,000 and \n     $1 million won 40% of the time while challengers who spent \n     more than $1 million won five of six races. The McCain-\n     Feingold bill, which sets spending limits in Senate races, \n     would yield similar results. In both 1994 and 1996, every \n     challenger who spent less than its limits lost, but every \n     incumbent who did so won.\n       This anecdotal evidence supports comprehensive statistical \n     analysis: The key spending variable is not incumbent \n     spending, or the ratio of incumbent to challenger spending, \n     but the absolute level of challenger spending. Incumbents \n     begin races with high name and issue recognition, so added \n     spending doesn't help them much. Challengers, however, need \n     to build that recognition. Once a challenger has spent enough \n     to achieve similar name and issue recognition, campaign \n     spending limits kick in. Meanwhile the incumbent is just \n     beginning to spend. In other words, just as a challenger \n     starts to become competitive, campaign spending limits choke \n     off political competition.\n       This is not to suggest that the sponsors of McCain-Feingold \n     and Shays-Meehan sat down and tried to figure out how to \n     limit competition. However, when it comes to political \n     regulation and criticism of government, legislators have \n     strong vested interests that lead them to mistake what is \n     good for them with what is good for the country. Government \n     is inherently untrustworthy when it comes to regulating \n     political speech, and this tendency to use government power \n     to silence political criticism and stifle competition is a \n     major reason why we have the First Amendment.\n       The Supreme Court has recognized the danger that campaign \n     finance regulation poses to freedom of speech, and for the \n     past 20 years, beginning with Buckley v. Valeo, has struck \n     down many proposed restrictions on political spending and \n     advocacy, including mandatory spending limits. Supporters of \n     campaign finance reform like to ridicule Buckley as equating \n     money with speech. In fact, Buckley did no such thing.\n       Instead, Buckley recognized that limiting the amount of \n     money one can spend on political advocacy has the effect of \n     limiting speech. This is little more than common sense. For \n     example, the right to travel would lose much of its meaning \n     if we limited the amount that could be spent on any one trip \n     to $100.\n       Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold are Congress's most \n     ambitious attempt yet to get around Buckley. The spending \n     limits in each bill are supposedly voluntary, so as to comply \n     with Buckley, but in fact the provisions are so coercive as \n     to be all but mandatory, which should make them \n     unconstitutional.\n       For example, Shays-Meehan penalizes candidates who refuse \n     to limit spending by restricting their maximum contributions \n     to\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\n     just $250, while allowing their opponents to collect \n     contributions of up to $2,000. Shays-Meehan also attempts to \n     get around Buckley by restricting the ability of individuals \n     to speak out on public issues. The bill would sharply limit \n     financial support for the discussion of political issues \n     where such discussion ``refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate.'' In Buckley, the Supreme Court struck down a \n     similar provision as unconstitutionally vague.\n       Fueling the momentum to regulate ``issue advocacy'' is \n     Republican outrage over last year's advertising blitz by \n     organized labor attacking the Contract With America and the \n     GOP's stand on Social Security and Medicare. Even though the \n     AFL-CIO's ads were ostensibly about issues, there is no doubt \n     that they were aimed at helping Democrats regain control of \n     the House.\n       Of course, the purpose of political campaigns is to discuss \n     issues; and the purpose of discussing issues it to influence \n     who holds office and what policies they pursue. Naturally, \n     candidates don't like to be criticized, especially when they \n     believe that the criticisms rely on distortion and \n     demagoguery. But the Founders recognized that government \n     cannot be trusted to determine what is ``fair or unfair'' \n     when it comes to political discussion. The First Amendment \n     isn't promise us speech we like, but the right to engage in \n     speech that others may not like.\n       Recognizing that many proposed reforms run afoul of the \n     Constitution, some, such as former Sen. Bill Bradley and \n     current House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, are calling \n     for a constitutional amendment that would, in effect, amend \n     the First Amendment to allow government to regulate political \n     speech more heavily. This seems odd, indeed, for while left \n     and right have often battled over the extent to which the \n     First Amendment covers commercial speech or pornography, \n     until now no one has ever seriously questioned that it should \n     cover political speech.\n       If fact, constitutional or not, campaign finance reform has \n     turned out to be bad policy. For most of our history, \n     campaigns were essentially unregulated yet democracy survived \n     and flourished. However, since passage of the Federal \n     Elections Campaign Act and similar state laws, the influence \n     of special interests has grown, voter turnout has fallen, and \n     incumbents have become tougher to dislodge. Low contribution \n     limits have forced candidates to spend large amounts of time \n     seeking funds. Litigation has become a major campaign tactic, \n     with ordinary citizens hauled into court for passing out \n     homemade leaflets; and business and professional groups have \n     been restrained from communicating endorsements to their \n     dues-paying members.\n       The reformers' response is that more regulation is needed. \n     If only the ``loopholes'' in the system could be closed, they \n     argue, it would work. Of course, some of today's biggest \n     loopholes were yesterday's reforms. Political action \n     committees were an early 1970s reform intended to increase \n     the influence of small donors. Now the McCain-Feingold bill \n     seeks to ban them. (Even the bill's sponsors seem to \n     recognize that this is probably unconstitutional--Sen. \n     Feingold boasts that in anticipation of such a finding by the \n     Supreme Court, the bill includes a fallback position.) Soft \n     money, which both bills would sharply curtail, was a 1979 \n     reform intended to help parties engage in grasroots political \n     activity, such as get-out-the-vote drives.\n       When a law is in need of continual revision to close a \n     series of ever-changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the \n     law, and not the people, that is in error. The most sensible \n     reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Elections \n     Campaign Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. He begins by saying:\n\n       Think campaign finance reform isn't an incumbent's \n     protection racket? Just look at the spending limits included \n     in the Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold bills, the hot \n     ``reform'' bills on Capitol Hill.\n\n  I will provide for the Record that as increases in spending have gone \nup, they have favored the incumbents, and more incumbents have been \nreelected over time. Mr. Smith is obviously wrong in his allegations as \nfar as the facts are concerned. Then obviously he goes on to say at the \nend that campaign finance reform has turned out to be bad policy. He \ngoes on to say:\n\n       For most of our history campaigns were essentially \n     unregulated, yet democracy survived and flourished. However, \n     since passage of the Federal Elections Campaign Act and \n     similar State laws, the influence of special interests has \n     grown, voter turnout has fallen, and incumbents have become \n     tougher to dislodge.\n\n  That is an interesting view of history.\n  In 1974, we enacted campaign finance reform. The abuses of the 1972 \ncampaign were well known. They were extremely egregious and everyone \nknows there was a movement across America to clean up those incredible \nabuses that took place in the 1972 campaign. I guess what Mr. Smith \neither doesn't know or has ignored is that for a long period after \ncampaign finance reform was enacted, there were better campaigns in \nAmerica. They were a lot cleaner. They were more participatory.\n  It was not until beginning in the middle to late 1980s, as smart \npeople began to find loopholes, began to find ways around those \ncampaign finance restrictions, that the influence of special interests \ngrew, voter turnout fell, and incumbents became tougher to dislodge.\n\n  I am a student of history. One of the reasons why I am is because it \nhas a tendency to repeat itself. There was a period late in the last \ncentury, actually in the 19th century, when the robber barons took over \nAmerican politics. That is a matter of history and disputed by very few \nhistorians. Fortunately, a man came to the fore in American politics by \nthe name of Theodore Roosevelt. His words are as true today as they \nwere then.\n  I quote from his fifth annual message to the Congress, Washington, \nDecember 25, 1905:\n\n       All contributions by corporations to any political \n     committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by \n     law. Directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' \n     money for such purposes. And moreover, a prohibition of this \n     kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of \n     stopping the evils aimed at the Incorrupt Practices Act.\n\n  On October 26, 1904, Theodore Roosevelt made the following statement:\n\n       I have just been informed that the Standard Oil people have \n     contributed $100,000 to our campaign fund. This may be \n     entirely untrue. But if true I must ask you to direct that \n     the money be returned to them forthwith. . . . Moreover, it \n     is entirely legitimate to accept campaign contributions, no \n     matter how large they are, from individuals and corporations \n     on the terms on which I happen to know that you have accepted \n     them; that is, with the explicit understanding that they were \n     given and received with no thought of any more obligation on \n     the part of the National Committee or of the national \n     administration than is implied in the statement that every \n     man shall receive a square deal, no more, no less, and that \n     this I shall guarantee him in any event to the best of my \n     ability. . . . But we cannot under any circumstances afford \n     to take a contribution which can be even improperly construed \n     as putting us under an improper obligation, and in view of my \n     past relations with the Standard Oil Company, I fear such a \n     construction will be put upon receiving any aid from them.\n\n  On 1908, September 21, in a letter to the treasurer of the Republican \nNational Committee, Theodore Roosevelt wrote:\n\n       I have been informed that you, or someone on behalf of the \n     National Committee, have requested contributions both from \n     Mr. Archibold and Mr. Harriman. If this is true, I wish to \n     enter a most earnest protest, and to say that in my judgment \n     not only should such contributions not be solicited, but if \n     tendered, they should be refused; and if they have been \n     accepted they should immediately be returned. I am not the \n     candidate, but I am the head of the Republican \n     administration, which is an issue in this campaign, and I \n     protest earnestly against men whom we are prosecuting \n     being asked to contribute to elect a President who will \n     appoint an Attorney-General to continue these \n     prosecutions.\n\n  Mr. President, in his State of the Union speech, President Roosevelt \nsaid on August 31, 1910:\n\n       Now, this means that our Government, National and State, \n     must be freed from the sinister influence or control of \n     special interests. Exactly as the special interests of cotton \n     and slavery threatened our political integrity before the \n     Civil War, so now the great special business interests too \n     often control and corrupt the men and methods of government \n     for their own profit. We must drive the special interests out \n     of politics.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, Theodore Roosevelt's words in those days \nwere as true then as they are today. I believe we are again in the same \nsituation we were in before when he was able to get an all-out \nprohibition of corporate contributions to American political campaigns. \nThat law is still on the books. That law has never been repealed.\n  Why is it that tomorrow night there will be a fundraiser when \nindividuals and corporations are allowed to contribute as much as \n$500,000 to enjoy the hospitality of the Democratic National Committee \nat the MCI Center? It is because the loopholes have been exploited. \nPeople such as our nominee, Mr. Smith, have made the process such that \nwe can no longer expect the influence of special interests not to \npredominate here in our Nation's Capitol. Young Americans are tired of \nit. Young Americans are cynical, and they have become alienated.\n  The nomination of Mr. Smith has not gone unnoticed beyond the \nbeltway. The irony of his appointment to the FEC has been the subject \nof numerous editorials since the name first surfaced as a potential \nnominee. Let me read to you some of these editorials, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n  The Palm Beach Post:\n\n       You wouldn't put Charlton Heston in charge of gun control, \n     and you wouldn't put Bradley A. Smith in charge of enforcing \n     the nation's campaign-finance laws.\n       Come to think of it, Republicans want to do both.\n       Mr. Smith, a law professor in Ohio, feels about soft money \n     the way Mr. Heston feels about assault weapons: More is \n     better. . . . Mr. Smith has advocated the abolition of \n     Federal restrictions on campaign contributions. Yet, \n     Republicans want to nominate Mr. Smith to the Federal \n     Election Commission, which was founded in 1975 to enforce \n     campaign restrictions first imposed after Watergate. . . .\n       The quote underpinning Mr. Smith's philosophy is, ``People \n     should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.'' \n     But when Mr. Smith talks about ``people,'' he means \n     corporations and unions and political-action committees--the \n     big donors who give with the all-too-realistic expectation \n     that they will receive favors from Congress in return.\n\n  The story I quoted earlier from the New York Times mentioned that \nwhen the big donors were contacted by phone, they wanted to --guess \nwhat--talk about legislation before the Congress, for those who were \nsoliciting donations.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle, April 17:\n\n       Seldom has the metaphor of the fox keeping watch over the \n     chicken coop seemed more apt. Bradley Smith has built his \n     career arguing that the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act, \n     the law regulating campaign expenditures enacted after the \n     Watergate scandal, is unconstitutional and should be \n     abolished.\n       In various articles, Mr. Smith, an obscure professor at \n     Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, has argued that our \n     nation only spends a ``minuscule amount'' on campaigns, a \n     mere .05 percent of our Gross National Product. Rather than \n     corrupting the process, Smith says campaign spending promotes \n     democracy by generating interest in candidates and issues. . \n     . . ``If anything, we probably spend too little,'' he wrote \n     in one of several guest columns for the Wall Street Journal.\n       Smith might have remained little more than a professorial \n     provocateur behind the safe ramparts of the ivory tower had \n     not Republicans put forward his name to fill a vacant seat on \n     the Federal Election Commission, the body created by the very \n     law Smith thinks should be abolished.\n\n  Washington Post, February 11, 2000:\n\n       When the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that reasonable \n     campaign finance regulations were constitutional, President \n     Clinton sought to portray himself as a fighter for reform. \n     ``For years, I challenged Congress to pass regulations that \n     would ban the raising of unregulated soft money and address \n     back door spending by outside organizations.'' He said, ``Now \n     I am again asking Congress to restore the American people's \n     faith in their democracy and pass real reform this year.'' \n     This week, however, the President nominated to the Federal \n     Election Commission a law professor, Bradley Smith, who not \n     only opposes further reform, but believes that most existing \n     campaign finance law violates the first amendment. Quite \n     simply, Mr. Smith doesn't believe in the bulk of the FEC's \n     work. Mr. Clinton has no business putting him in charge of \n     it.\n\n  Mr. President, this is from the New York Times, February 17, 2000:\n\n       A vote to confirm Mr. Smith is a vote to perpetuate big-\n     money politics. Campaign restrictions are only as strong as \n     the FEC's interest in enforcing them--an interest Mr. Smith \n     plainly lacks. In an election year in which Washington's \n     failure to end the corrupt soft-money system has become a \n     rallying cause for John McCain's Presidential campaign, the \n     Senate should not seat someone on the FEC who questions the \n     need for change. Mr. Smith, as Mr. Gore aptly noted, \n     ``publicly questions not only the constitutionality of \n     proposed reform, but also the constitutionality of current \n     limitations.'' Mr. Smith does not belong on the FEC, and \n     anyone in the Senate who cares about fashioning a fair and \n     honest system for financing campaigns should vote against his \n     appointment.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't want to put too much credence and importance \non Mr. Smith's appointment. But I do not see, after the record is \nreplete with Mr. Smith's views concerning campaign finance reform, how \nanyone in this body who is a sincere supporter of campaign finance \nreform could possibly have the remotest idea of voting for Mr. Smith.\n  Finally, I have on this floor many times for too many years been \narguing the constitutionality of placing limitations on campaign \ncontributions.\n  The opponents, time after time, have taken the floor and said: Well, \nBuckley v. Valeo was only a 5-4 vote, a footnote, which perhaps has \nbecome one of the most famous footnotes in the history of any Supreme \nCourt decision concerning exactly what the words are both for and \nagainst. Over time, for reasons that are not clear to me, the opponents \nof campaign finance reform raise the concern in many people's minds \nthat the heart of McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional; in other words, \nthe ability to place a limit on campaign contributions.\n  I didn't quite understand that because in 1907 there was a law on the \nbooks that banned corporate contributions. That has never been \nrepealed, nor declared unconstitutional. There is a law on the books in \n1947 banning union contributions to American political campaigns, and \nthen of course there is the 1974 law.\n  On January 24 of this year, Shrink Missouri clearly and unequivocally \nin a 6-3 decision upheld the $1,000 limitation on a campaign \ncontribution.\n  By limiting the size of the largest contributions, such restrictions \nare aimed at democratizing the influence money itself may bring to bear \nupon the electoral service.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in a majority opinion, goes on to say that in \ndoing so, they seek to build public confidence in that process and \nbroaden the base of a candidate's meaningful financial support by \nencouraging the public participation in open discussion that the first \namendment itself presupposes.\n  Mr. Smith directly repudiates--and still does after the U.S. Supreme \nCourt spoke unequivocally--a 6-3 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nYet my colleagues feel that he is fit to enforce a law that he directly \nrepudiates.\n  This is a bit Orwellian, Mr. President.\n  The Court went on to say in unequivocal terms that the imposition of \na $1,000 limit is certainly not only constitutional but should be \nconstitutional because many of the Justices expressed their utter \ndismay at the state of campaign financing today in a rather forthright \nand candid manner, which is somewhat uncharacteristic of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. One of the Justices said, ``Money is not free speech. \nMoney is property.''\n  On the one hand, a decision to contribute money to a campaign is a \nmatter of first amendment concern, not because money is speech; it is \nnot, but because it enables speech through contributions. The \ncontributor associates himself with a candidate's cause and helps the \ncandidate communicate a political message with which the contributor \nagrees and helps the candidate win by attracting the votes of similarly \nminded voters. Both political association and political communications \nare at hand.\n  On the other hand, restrictions upon the amount that any one \nindividual can contribute to a particular candidate seek to protect the \nintegrity of the electoral process, the means through which a free \nsociety democratically translates political speech into concrete \ngovernment action.\n  Moreover, by limiting the size of the largest contributions, such \nrestrictions aim to democratize the influence money itself may bring to \nbear upon the electoral process.\n  I don't mean to paraphrase the Supreme Court of the United States, \nbut what they are saying is money in modest amounts is a way of \nparticipating in the political process, and it is a good and healthy \nthing.\n\n  One of the great events in politics in the American Southwest is to \nhave a barbecue and everyone pays $10, $15, or $20 to attend. You not \nonly participate in the political process, but you have made an \ninvestment in that candidate.\n  But when we are now at a point where $500,000 buys a ticket to a \nfundraiser, we have come a long way. We have come a long way. We have \ncome to a Congress which is gridlocked by the special interests.\n  If you want to look at our failure to enact a Patients' Bill of \nRights, if you want to look at our failure to enact modest gun control \nsuch as safety locks and instant background checks, if you want to look \nat our failure to enact meaningful military reform because we continue \nto buy weapons systems which the military doesn't want or need, and we \nhave 12,000 enlisted families on food stamps, you can look at a broad \narray of legislation that should have been acted on by any reasonable \ngroup of men and women who are elected to represent the people. \nInstead, it is the special interests.\n  What is the message we are about to send to the American people when \nwe affirm the appointment of Professor Brad Smith to the Federal \nElection Commission? We are saying that we are appointing a person for \n5 years who not only repudiates the decision of the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nSupreme Court but believes that at no time in our history have we \nneeded to clean up the abuses of the campaign finance system, and \nclearly has no interest in removing the incredible corruption that \npossesses the political process today, and is not interested in the \nfact that young Americans have become cynical and even alienated from \nthe political process, to wit: The 1998 election where we had the \nlowest voter turnout in history of 18- to 26-year-olds.\n  The message we are sending to America is: Americans, we are not ready \nyet to respond to the will of the people. We are still in the grips of \nspecial interests. Until we make their voices more clear and more \nstrongly felt, the chances of reforming this system and returning the \ngovernment to you is somewhat diminished.\n  I know my colleague who is on the floor, Senator Feingold, and I will \ncontinue our efforts to bring McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan to the \nattention of this body for votes between now and when we go out of \nsession. I don't know if we will be able to do that, but have no doubt \nabout what we are trying to do and how we are trying to do it.\n  All we ask for is a vote up or down. We will agree to 15 or 20 \nminutes equally divided on both sides on this issue because it has been \nventilated time after time on the floor of the Senate. For anyone who \nhas some idea we are trying to hold up legislation or block \nlegislation, all we are asking for is a vote. We know a majority of the \nSenate would vote in favor.\n  I think we are going to do something very wrong tomorrow. We are \nprobably going to affirm a person to an office in which the American \npeople place some trust in the enforcement of existing law. That person \nhas made it clear that he is not interested in enforcing existing law, \nand, in fact, he believes that existing law is unconstitutional.\n  I think this is a very serious mistake. I hope the American people \nnotice that this is something that will not work in their interests but \nwill clearly work to maintain the status quo in our Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although this, too, is an uphill battle, \nit is a good feeling to be on the floor again with my good friend, the \nSenator from Arizona, not only to fight this nomination, but also to \nsignal the fact that we are ready to move forward on the campaign \nfinance issue and a ban on soft money.\n  I think the debate today has turned out to be not only a good chance \nto review the inappropriateness of the Bradley Smith nomination, but to \nreview what has happened this year on the campaign finance front, \nparticularly the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Shrink \nMissouri case, and of course, more importantly, the tremendous profile \nthe Senator from Arizona has given to the campaign finance issue \nthrough his courageous campaign for President.\n  All of that is optimistic for the future. But today we have to \ncontinue the battle, as the Senator from Arizona has done, to try to \nprevent the Senate from making a terrible mistake with regard to the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  In that regard, let me first elaborate on one item the Senator from \nKentucky addressed. Earlier today, the Senator from Kentucky quoted \nfrom a number of letters from law professors, allegedly in support of \nthe nomination of Professor Brad Smith. One of those letters was from \nBurt Neuborne, a professor at NYU Law School and Legal Director at the \nBrennan Center for Justice, somebody for whom I have tremendous regard \nand respect. The Senator from Kentucky took great pleasure in quoting \nthat letter because the Brennan Center has been very effective and \noutspoken in its opposition to Professor Smith.\n  I was a little surprised by the quote the Senator from Kentucky read \nfrom Professor Neuborne, although I noted that Professor Neuborne \ndidn't seem to endorse Professor Smith for the FEC post in the portion \nof his letter the Senator from Kentucky read.\n  In the interim, I asked my staff to look into the letter. Although we \nhave not actually seen a copy, it seems the letter quoted by the \nSenator from Kentucky on the floor was actually a letter in support of \nProfessor Smith's effort to get tenure at his law school a few years \nago. I hope I don't need to point out, Mr. President, that there is a \nbig difference between tenure at a law school and a seat on the FEC. \nLaw professors can be and often are provocative, even outrageous, in \ntheir views, but FEC Commissioners have to enforce and interpret the \nlaw as intended by Congress. It is a very different job from being a \nprofessor.\n  So I want the Record to be clear. Professor Neuborne's comments were \nquoted at least a bit out of context, and those comments had nothing to \ndo with the decision that will soon be before the Senate on Professor \nSmith's nomination.\n  Now let me say a bit more about the nomination and its relationship \nto the issue of soft money, which the Senator from Arizona was \naddressing moments ago. I spoke earlier about some of the views of Brad \nSmith on our current election laws. Now I want to talk about his views \non the major reform issue that faces the Congress this year, the \nproposed ban on soft money.\n  Professor Smith believes a ban such as the one contained in the \nMcCain-Feingold bill would be unconstitutional. That is another reason \nI believe he should not be confirmed.\n  We have had a number of debates on the issue of campaign finance \nreform in the last few years. They have been hard fought and sometimes \nilluminating. Particularly interesting to me, I have noticed very \nfrequently the arguments of opponents of reform have changed over time. \nThe first few times the McCain-Feingold bill was brought to the floor, \nmuch of the argument was against the spending limits and benefits \ncontained in the original bill. We heard the cry of ``welfare for \npoliticians,'' over and over.\n  Then, when the bill was modified and spending limits for candidates \nwere dropped, opponents of reform focused on provisions that would have \nrestricted the use of unlimited corporate and union money to pay for \nphony issue ads that were really nothing more than campaign ads in \ndisguise. Opponents complained that these provisions violated the first \namendment. Then the accusation on this floor over and over again became \nthat we reformers were the so-called ``speech police'' and the \n``enemies of free speech.''\n\n  Last fall, however, Senator McCain and I decided to exclusively focus \nour attention on the worst loophole in the law, the problem that has \nundermined the whole of our Nation's election laws, the unlimited soft \nmoney contributions to the political parties. We found few, if any, \nopponents who were actually willing to come to the floor during the \nlatest debate to continue to press some kind of a constitutional attack \non this bill.\n  The reason was very simple. There is no credible argument that a ban \non soft money would be struck down by the Supreme Court. That view was \nsupported by a letter to Senator McCain and to me from 126 legal \nscholars. It was seconded by a letter from every living former \npresident, executive director, legal director, and legislative director \nof the American Civil Liberties Union. Even one of the strongest and \nmost consistent opponents of reform in this body, the Senator from \nWashington, Mr. Gorton, conceded on the floor that a ban on soft money \nis probably constitutional. He even conceded that.\n  Then we had the Supreme Court weighing in earlier this year in the \nShrink Missouri case, reaffirming a portion of the Buckley decision \nthat upheld contribution limits and stating in very strong and clear \nlanguage that the Congress has the power to limit contributions to \nprotect against actual or apparent corruption, the Court said:\n\n       There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  In my view, and I think in the view of any serious commentator on \nthis subject, the Supreme Court's ruling in the Shrink Missouri case \nremoves all doubt as to whether the Court would uphold the \nconstitutionality of a ban on soft money. That is the centerpiece of \nthe reform bill that has passed the House and is now awaiting Senate \naction. It is simply not credible to argue\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\nthat this same Court that just a couple of months ago so strongly \nupheld the Missouri contribution limits would somehow completely change \nits jurisprudence and turn around and strike down an act of Congress \nthat would outlaw soft money. It is simply not credible.\n  But then there is Bradley Smith, the nominee before the Senate. In a \npaper for the Notre Dame Law School Journal of Legislation, published \nin 1998, he wrote the following:\n\n       Regardless of what one thinks about soft money, or what one \n     thinks about the applicable Supreme Court precedents, a \n     blanket ban on soft money would be, under clear, well-\n     established First Amendment doctrine, constitutionally \n     infirm.\n\n  Professor Smith makes the argument that since the parties use soft \nmoney to run phony issue ads and since phony issue ads are \nconstitutionally protected, somehow a ban on soft money must be \nconstitutionally suspect.\n  The problem with this argument is that the justification for banning \nsoft money has nothing to do with stopping the parties from running \nphony issue ads. The purpose of a soft money ban is to stop the erosion \nof public confidence in the political process that unlimited \ncontributions from wealthy corporate, labor, and individual donors have \ncaused--in other words, to put it in simple terms, terms that are not \nmy own but those of the U.S. Supreme Court, to stop the appearance of \ncorruption.\n  Banning soft money is not about attacking speech, it is about \nattacking corruption. The parties can continue to run all the phony \nissue ads they want after soft money is banned; they will just have to \nuse hard money to pay for those ads.\n  Of course, Professor Smith doesn't agree that unlimited contributions \ncan cause a corruption problem. But the Supreme Court most certainly \ndoes.\n  A majority of this Senate has voted repeatedly in favor of a soft \nmoney ban. I cannot imagine that same majority will, tomorrow, vote to \nconfirm a nominee who believes such a ban is unconstitutional. That is \nwhy the vote on Mr. Smith is not simply a vote on an executive branch \nnominee, it is a vote on campaign finance reform\n\n  Here is the problem. If we succeed in passing a soft money ban this \nyear, the FEC is going to have to promulgate regulations to implement \nthat law. Numerous questions will undoubtedly arise on the mechanics of \nthat ban. We need an FEC that will vote to enforce the law and to \ninterpret it in a way that is consistent with congressional intent. I \nsimply have no confidence that Mr. Smith will be able do that--how can \nhe? It would be completely at odds with his own loudly professed \nprinciples. His view is that the whole exercise of prohibiting the \nparties from soliciting and receiving unlimited non-federal \ncontributions is illegitimate.\n  Shortly after his nomination, Mr. Smith was interviewed by the \nCapitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call. A story on February 14 of this year, \nstated as follows:\n\n       But Smith said ``the reason most'' why he's agreed to take \n     the position is to ``present the case that there's another \n     way to talk about reform than reform being equivalent to more \n     regulation.''\n\n  We are making a decision about putting someone on the Fec who is \nsupposed to enforce the laws we pass. The purpose is not to send an \nadvocate over to the FEC.\n  That's right, this nominee most wants to be on the regulatory body in \ncharge of administering the statutes that Congress passes in order to \npresent the view that we do not need more regulation. Not to implement \nCongress's will in passing reform, but to show there is another way of \ntalking about reform. I do not want that kind of Commissioner writing \nthe regulations that will put the soft money ban of the McCain-Feingold \nbill into practice.\n  I am not going to stand here and tell you that enactment of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill is assured in this session of Congress. We have a \nlot of work still to do to convince enough of those who are now voting \nto permit a filibuster to block us to change their minds. But if you \ntruly believe that soft money must be banished from our system, as you \nhave voted so many times in the past few years, you must vote against \nthe nomination of Brad Smith. Otherwise, you may very well be \nresponsible for ineffective FEC enforcement of the ban which will let \nsoft money back into the system, nullifying all that we have worked so \nhard to accomplish.\n  The Senator from Kentucky began his presentation this morning by in \nessence asking for sympathy for Professor Smith because he has inspired \nsuch strong opposition both in the Senate and from outside \ncommentators. He suggests that because the opposition is so heated that \nit must be distorted. And he quoted from law professors who have \nwritten in to defend Professor Smith and criticize the opposition to \nhim. He said that from all that has been said about Professor Smith, \none would think he has horns and a tail. I want to reiterate this \nbecause I think this approach the Senator from Kentucky has used is \nunfair to all of us who have opposed Professor Smith. Frankly, I think \nit is I unfair to Professor Smith.\n\n  The opposition to Professor Smith is not personal. There is not a \nshred of a personal element to it and there never has been. It is based \non his views, and in particular on his writings as a law professor and \ncommentator on the election laws. The quotes I have called attention to \ntoday are not distortions, they are not taken out of context, they are \nnot a caricature or a misrepresentation. These are Professor Smith's \nviews, and he has reaffirmed them over and over again, including in the \nhearings held by the Rules Committee on his nomination. Yes, as we saw \nearlier, he has a beautiful family, and a beautiful dog, but that does \nnot make his views on Federal election law any more acceptable to me or \nothers who care about campaign finance reform.\n  Professor Smith has not disavowed the views he expressed in his many \nwritings on campaign finance. He simply asks us to take on faith his \npromise that notwithstanding those views he will enforce the law. But \nit is not that simple. Issues come before the FEC that are not as clear \ncut as ``will you enforce the law or not?''\n  The FEC has to implement and administer the law. It has to promulgate \nregulations to cover complicated legal issue that come about because \ncandidates and groups do their utmost to get around the law. It has to \ninitiate investigations of suspicious activities, sometimes with great \npressure brought by the parties to do nothing.\n  I simply do not have confidence that an academic who holds the views \nexpressed so clearly by Professor Smith will discharge his duties in a \nway that will uphold the spirit as well as the letter of the law.\n  Let me also respond to the argument expressed by both the Chairman \nand the Ranking Member of the Rules Committee that his Senate is bound \nto rubber stamp the President's appointments because by tradition each \nparty is entitled to choose the members of the Commission.\n  First of all, I will say that I was very disappointed that President \nClinton put forward this nomination. I expected more from a President \nwho claims to support campaign finance reform. And I am pleased that \nVice-President Gore has announced his opposition to the nomination of \nProfessor Smith. I hope some day that we will have a President who will \nbreak with tradition--and that's all it is--tradition, and nominate \nindependents or people who are not strongly identified with the parties \nto the FEC. I don't think the FEC or the country are well served by the \nkind of ``balanced'' Commission that we now have, where the Democratic \nand Republican Commissioners reliably line up on opposite sides of \nissues that have a partisan flavor, and line up in lock step together \non issues that implicate the rights of third parties. I would like to \nsee Commissioners on both sides who have an appreciation of the \nimportance of the campaign finance laws and will vote to ensure \nfairness in elections.\n  But until we have that kind of President, who is willing to stand up \nto the leadership of the parties, we still have the Senate's duty of \nAdvice and Consent. Nowhere is it said in the Constitution that the \npower of Advice and Consent is any different for members of the FEC. \nOtherwise, why would we not just have the President nominate people and \nnot have the Senate vote. It is an abdication of the Senate's duty, I \nbelieve, for us to give any less scrutiny to this nominee simply \nbecause it is paired with another nominee from the other party.\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky also claimed that a nominee for a spot on \nthe FEC has never been defeated on the floor, and that is true. But it \nis not true that the wishes of each of the parties has always been \nrespected. In the mid-1980s, the Republican Party, under pressure from \nthe National Right to Work Committee, blocked the reappointment of a \nDemocratic Commissioner, Thomas Harris, because of his work as a lawyer \nrepresenting unions. President Reagan refused to renominate Harris, and \nafter a lengthy stalemate, another nominee was suggested.\n  So much of the argument in favor of this nominee today has been based \non this notion that to try to stop an FEC nomination is a complete \nbreak with precedent, that we have to simply rubberstamp this pairing \nof two FEC commissioners. The reality is contrary to the suggestion \nearlier today, the party of the Senator from Kentucky has not always \nacquiesced in the choice of the Democratic Party for its seats on the \ncommission.\n  Let me finally just dispel one misconception that I think some might \nhave about the negotiations and agreements that led to this debate, \nwhich is clearly tied to various judicial and other nominations. There \nis no requirement here that Professor Smith's nomination be approved by \nthe Senate in order for these other nominations to go forward. That is \na misconception that some, particularly on our side, may believe. It is \nsimply not the case with regard to the unanimous consent agreement and \nthe negotiations between the majority leader and minority leader. In \nfact, it would be an abdication of our responsibility not to vote on \nthe merits of this particular nominee regardless of the other \nnominations whose consideration was linked to the consideration of this \nnomination.\n  With that I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask the time be charged equally as I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the second Saturday of each May, \nletter carriers across the United States collect food donations on \ntheir postal routes to deliver to community food banks, shelters and \npantries. I commend the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) \nfor creating and sponsoring the largest one-day food drive in the \ncountry with over 100,000 letter carriers participating in more than \n10,000 cities and towns.\n  Not only do America's postal workers perform an important function in \nour economy and in our daily lives, they make a difference in improving \nthe lives of needy citizens. I extend my appreciation and thanks to \nNALC's leaders and members for their dedication and commitment to their \nstrong tradition of community service.\n  The food drive started as small pilot program in 10 cities and, as a \nresult of its huge success, was expanded nationwide. The program asks \npostal patrons to place a box or bag of food next to their mailboxes. \nThe food is picked up, sorted at postal stations and then delivered to \narea food banks by letter carriers.\n  I am pleased to note that in my home state, the California State \nAssociation of Letter Carriers was among those state associations which \ndonated the largest amount of food in the national drive. It is my hope \nthat during the month of May and throughout the year, Americans will \nconsider becoming involved in the NALC Food Drive and in other \nactivities serving the less fortunate in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4290-5", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ABC'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Merit shop companies employ approximately 80 \npercent, or four out of five, of all American construction workers and \nseek to provide the best management techniques, the finest \ncraftsmanship, and the most competitive bidding and pricing strategies \nin the industry. ABC believes that union and merit shop contractors and \ntheir employees should work together in harmony and that work should be \nawarded to the lowest responsible bidder regardless of labor \naffiliation.\n  I greatly appreciate ABC's commitment to developing a safe workplace \nand high-performance work force through quality education and training \nwith comprehensive safety and health programs. I also appreciate ABC's \ndedicated efforts to secure free enterprise, fair and open competition, \nless government, more opportunities for jobs, tax relief, increased \ntraining, and the elimination of frivolous complaints and over-\nregulation.\n  Accordingly, I thank ABC for their efforts and wish them continued \nsuccess in their efforts to ensure that the American construction \nindustry continues to afford the finest work product and greatest \nopportunity in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4290-6", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4290-S4291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LOCAL LEGACIES PROJECT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a select few \nindividuals from my home state of Montana. I have personally nominated \nthese individuals to represent Montana in the Library of Congress' \nLocal Legacies Project as part of their Bicentennial Celebration. The \nLocal Legacies project has allowed citizens to participate directly in \nthis great celebration. The participants have documented America's \ngrassroots heritage in every state, the U.S. Trusts and Territories, \nand the District of Columbia. Their documentation provides\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\na snapshot of the nation's unique traditions as we begin a new century. \nMy nominees for Montana's Local Legacies have worked hard to represent \nthe beauty and deeply rooted heritage of our rugged and wide open \nstate. The survival of our heritage is important for knowing not only \nwhere we came from, but where we are going. And for this, I commend \nthem.\n  Native Reign, is composed of Northern Cheyenne youth to promote the \nneed for education, respect for the environment, development of \npersonal skills, respect of tribal elders and a strong spiritual \nfoundation. They have been supported by their adult leader Ken \nBisonette and his efforts to make Native Reign the role model it has \nbecome. They combine traditional Native American dances, skits, with \ncontemporary music to celebrate the history and traditions of the \ntribe. On April 9, 1999, they received the Governor's Award at the \nState Capitol Building in Helena from Montana Governor Marc Racicot for \ntheir success in showing Montana youth an alternative lifestyle to teen \npregnancy, drugs and alcohol abuse, gangs, and violence. They are a \nrole model for not only the young people of Montana, but for the rest \nof the United States as well. Congratulations Native Reign, you are \ntruly a legacy!\n  Mike Logan, Montana's very own Cowboy Poet has contributed a book of \npoetry illustrated with original photographs he took during his travels \nthroughout our breathtaking state. His book is entitled ``Montana Is . \n. .'' Mike wanted to share some of the beauty he had been privileged to \nexperience and photograph in his 21 years living in Montana. As part of \nhis introduction to the book, Mike states: ``I love everything about \nMontana. . . . I still feel like I'm spending every day in heaven.'' \nWords that ring so true to my own heart. Mike paints a verbal and \nvisual picture true to the very poetic nature of Montana's scenic \nbeauty and spectacular wildlife. I would encourage everyone to pick up \nhis book and take a journey into Montana's rich heritage. Thank you \nMike, your poetry is one more part of our history we are lucky to have!\n  The Metis Project: When they Awake--was created and produced by \nHelena Presents, a production, presentation and film center based in \nHelena, Montana. It is a celebration of the extraordinary legacy of \nfiddle music of the Metis people. The project explores the musical and \nsocial legacy of a tribe without boundaries, whose heritage results \nfrom marriage between Indians and Europeans throughout the Northern \nPlains from Sault St. Marie, Michigan, to Choteau, Montana, across both \nsides of the 49th parallel. Central to the project is the creation of a \nnew musical work that references the indigenous American rhythms and \ndiverse European fiddle heritage that is present in Metis music. The \nname of the presentation is based on a prediction of Louis Riel, a \nteacher, writer, and hero to the Metis people:\n\n       My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they \n     awake, it will be the artists who give them their spirit \n     back.\n\n  Composer and performers Philip Aaberg and Darol Anger collaborated \nwith master Metis fiddler, Jimmie LaRocque to revive once again the \nmelodious spirit of the Metis people. Gentlemen, I take my hat off to \nyou!\n  Five St. Ignatius High School students from St. Ignatius, Montana, \nwho present and preserve their area's native traditions using \ninterviews with farmers and ranchers of the Mission Valley of Montana \nalong with poignant photographs which paint a dramatic picture of farm \nlife in the Mission Valley. The report summarizing their findings was \nwritten by their teacher Marta Brooks. Students in Brooks's English and \nhistory classes used the ``heritage education'' approach to the study \nof local culture. They collected stories, oral histories, historical \ndocuments, art and geological information that reflect the unity of \nlandscape and culture. Montana's traditional farmers and ranchers are \nbecoming a dying breed so because of the change in the local landscape \nwith the inevitable change in the local culture the students were \nprompted to initiate this project as a way to document and preserve the \narea's native culture and traditions before they cease to exist. Thank \nyou all for your efforts to immortalize our rich agricultural heritage. \nYour hard work brings a lot of pride to Montana!\n  Montana Horse Story, was brought to us through the use of still \nphotography, film, and field reporting, by a mother/son team, Allison \nand Joshua Collins. Allison and Joshua are part of a company called \nRelated Images. Their project documents the legacy of the horse for \nwork, transportation, and recreation as preserved by various Montana \nevents such as rodeo, the Miles City Bucking Horse Sale, Indian rodeo, \nand O-mok-see. Their work was last seen locally, in an exhibit of rodeo \nphotography, at the Holter Museum, in Helena, Mt. Much like the other \nLocal Legacies projects, Montana Horse Story pinpoints a vital part of \nMontana's rich traditions, that without it we would not be the people \nthat we have become. Joshua and Allison, you have captured our spirit \nin some of its best moments. Without your talents and dedication, our \nstory would never be heard. Thank you!\n  I conclude with one final remark: Without the hard work of all these \nindividuals, Montana's rich cultural heritage may never be known. You \nshould all be very proud of your efforts. I know Montanans are.

Mr. President, our nation's prosperity and \ncontinued success are directly related to the education of our \ncitizens. As the price tag of higher education continues to rise, the \nimportance of financial aid programs has never been greater. To \nrecognize those who help students achieve their goal of a higher \neducation and to promote the accessibility of higher education to \neveryone, May has been designated as National Scholarship Month.\n  I would like to draw attention to one organization in particular that \ndeserves accolades for its efforts to provide financial aid to \nstudents. The Minnesota-based Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of \nAmerica (CSFA) is the nation's largest private sector scholarship and \neducational support organization. Since its founding in 1958, CSFA has \ndistributed over $561 million to more than 572,000 students. Through \nmore than 800 ``Dollars for Scholars'' chapters, the Foundation has \nestablished a grassroots network, with proven results.\n  I applaud the Foundation's tireless efforts to increase private \nsponsorship of scholarships to our nation's youth. I also congratulate \nand thank the dozens of Minnesota companies, organizations, and \nfoundations that work with CSFA to help ensure that a higher education \nis an affordable education. Additionally, I join in CSFA's challenge to \nthe communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals that \nalready sponsor scholarships to double the number of awards, and I \ninvite others to establish scholarship programs this year.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that CSFA's leadership in the multitude \nof National Scholarship Month activities around the nation will broaden \nthe support for private scholarship dollars and increase the level of \nparticipation. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the \ngenerosity of our nation's scholarship sponsors during this National \nScholarship Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4291-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4291-S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BICENTENNIAL OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Library \nof Congress on the occasion of its Bicentennial. Since April 24, 1800, \nwhen President John Adams created the Library, it has stood as the \nforemost research library in the world. But more importantly it has \nbeen a symbol of the public's freedom of access to information, an idea \nwhich is the bedrock of our Republic.\n  The history of the Library of Congress is filled with some rather \ncompelling stories. The early days of the Library were turbulent, to \nsay the least. In 1813, in what may not have been our nation's proudest \nmoment, American troops burned the Parliament House and the Library of \nCanada in present day Toronto. Seeking revenge, a year later British \ntroops stormed into Washington, burned the White House and the Capitol, \nincluding the original Library of Congress. Recognizing that this \nnational treasure must be restored, the then retired Thomas Jefferson \noffered his personal library at Monticello as a replacement.\n  Today the Library is the most comprehensive library in the country, \nand\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nis almost completely open to the public. It is more than just Congress' \nlibrary, it is the nation's source of knowledge.\n  This year we have been marking the Library's 200th anniversary. It \ncomes as no surprise that the centerpiece of this year's Bicentennial \ncelebration is the Local Legacies Project, a volunteer project that \ncelebrates America's history, culture, and folklore. With this exhibit \nthe Library will showcase important events, places, and people from \naround the nation--things that help define who we are as Americans and \nwhat this country is all about.\n  I am proud that five projects from across New York State which I \ndesignated have been included as part of the Local Legacies Project. \nThey are the Little Falls Canal Celebration, Winter Olympics at Lake \nPlacid (Olympic Regional Development Authority), Summer at Jones Beach \n(New York State Parks), ``Immigrant Life in New York'' (Lower East Side \nTenement Museum), and the Allentown Arts Festival. I believe that these \nevents, along with those other projects nominated by my colleagues from \nthe New York Congressional Delegation, represent the diversity and rich \nhistory that is New York State.\n  The Lower East Side Tenement museum shows how New York City's large \nand diverse immigrant culture lived upon beginning their new lives in \nAmerica. Jones Beach represents the many recreation opportunities our \nstate offers and how families spend time together. The Little Falls \nCanal Celebration is about the history of our State's industrial \ndevelopment and the pride a local community has taken in that history. \nWere it not for the Erie Canal, New York would not be the Empire State. \nLake Placid, home of two Winter Olympics is about New York's rich \nsports history. It also is a showcase for the beauty and majesty of the \nAdirondack Mountains. Finally, the Allentown Arts Festival is about our \ncommitment to the arts, something which can be seen across the State \nbut especially in Allentown.\n  It was one of the great and inspired choices of our predecessors in \nthe Congress to purchase Thomas Jefferson's personal library, and \nthereafter establish the Library of Congress. As New Yorkers, with our \nPublic Library, we truly understand the eminence of the Library of \nCongress. It is the largest research library in this country, and \nindeed the world. The Local Legacies Project is a fitting way to \ncelebrate this great treasure. The Library is about preserving and \ndisseminating knowledge about many things, but especially about this \ngreat nation. The Local Legacies project is about commemorating and \nshowcasing that knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MATCHMAKERS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, when journalists and political \nscientists write about the activities here, they often prepare articles \nabout how a bill becomes a law. That is an interesting study, but it is \nonly half of the story. In fact, it is equally interesting to see how a \nlaw becomes a program--how words on the law books are transformed into \na working program that delivers services to our constituents.\n  The key to that process is people. Ultimately, someone has to take \nresponsibility for carrying out the laws we craft here. Today I want to \nrecognize a group of people who are aggressively working to give life \nto the HUBZone program we passed in 1997.\n  The HUBZone program seeks to use the Government's purchasing power to \nencourage economic growth and job creation in the Nation's most \nintransigent areas of poverty and unemployment. These areas often \npresent the greatest challenge because they lack a strong customer \nbase.\n  As a result, small businesses tend not to locate in these areas, \npreferring to set up their operations in more prosperous areas that \nhave an established stream of customer traffic. The HUBZone program \nseeks to offset this imbalance by making the Government a customer to \nfirms willing to invest in these hard-to-reach communities.\n  Over two years have passed since the HUBZone program was signed into \nlaw, but progress has been very slow. Recently the Small Business \nAdministration certified the 1,000th HUBZone small business concern, a \nmajor milestone. However, the need is much greater. Without a large \nbase of certified firms, the Government will not have enough \nparticipating companies to do business on the scale we envisioned in \nwriting the program.\n  Because of this lack of certified companies, some agencies are \nthrowing up their hands and opting not to carry out the HUBZone law. \nWithout enough vendors to bid on contracts, some agencies are letting \nthis tremendous new resource sit idle.\n  Defense Department agencies in the New England States have proved an \nexception to that rule. The Northeast Regional Council, which comprises \nsmall business officers from Defense agencies and Procurement Technical \nAssistance Centers, along with defense contractors large and small, \ncreated a special High Performance Team dubbed ``The Matchmakers'' to \nidentify problems in implementing the HUBZone program and to work \naggressively to solve them.\n  The Matchmakers found six components that were mismatched (``the \nhexa-mismatch problem''): contract requirements, suppliers, \ncommodities, agency databases, education and benefits under the \nprogram, and the HUBZones themselves. For example, commodities to be \npurchased were not matched with suppliers who could provide them, and \nthose suppliers were not necessarily matched to HUBZone areas that \nwould make them eligible to participate.\n  Having distilled the problem to its most basic elements, the \nMatchmakers are now setting out to track down suppliers who could fill \nthe agencies' procurement needs, identify those that are located in \nHUBZones, educate them about the program benefits, and get them to \napply for certification.\n  Mr. President, this kind of aggressive action is exactly what is \nnecessary to transform the HUBZone Act from mere words on a page into a \nprogram that helps real people and communities. Someday, when the \nHUBZone program is delivering benefits and creating jobs for people who \ncurrently do not have them, it will be essential to remember the people \nwho made it possible. So that their names are not forgotten, I ask to \ninclude in the Record a list of the members of the Matchmakers High \nPerformance Team, and I call the attention of my colleagues to their \nleadership and hard work.\n\n       Richard S.

Their vision was \nto cultivate and develop a robust technology-driven economy and to make\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nGeorgia's high-tech industry one of the best in the nation. I'm pleased \nto report that this vision is a reality today. Georgia is now the \nnation's leader in generating high-tech jobs and Atlanta is the \nundisputed high-tech capital of the Southeast! I'd like to pay tribute \nto the men and women of Georgia for their role in making these \nmonumental achievements possible.\n  One of the leading organizations that is responsible for advancing \nGeorgia's high-tech economy is the Georgia Research Alliance. The \nAlliance's mission is to develop Georgia's high-tech economy by \nenabling the states's research universities to become powerful engines \nof economic growth. The Alliance has carried out its mission over the \npast ten years by strategically investing $240 million in State and \nFederal funding and $65 million in matching funds from private sector \nfirms, like Bell South, Merial Corporation and Georgia Power. These \ninvestments are paying big dividends. First, Georgia has utilized over \n$600 million in Federal grants and contracts for building a premier \nhigh-tech research infrastructure through focused investments in the \nState's research universities, creating endowments for eminent \nscholars, building state-of-the-art research facilities and equipping \nthe State's research laboratories. The Alliance has also been \nresponsible for creating a high-tech, business friendly environment \nthat has created new businesses from the research findings developed in \nthe State's universities and enticed eminent scholars to relocate to \nGeorgia.\n  Another key achievement of the Alliance is growing high-tech jobs in \nthe state. Since the Alliance began serving Georgia just ten years ago, \nthe number of high-tech jobs in the state has more than doubled. These \nexceptional achievements have made Georgia the national leader in high-\ntech job growth and allowed Georgia to gain worldwide recognition for \nits ability to craft a state-of-the-art technology-based economy.\n  It is the efforts of many individuals, researchers and scholars, \nworking with and for the Alliance, that have led to the successes this \norganization has attained. The Alliance has been responsible for \nattracting some of the best researchers and scholars in the world to \nhelp build Georgia's premier high-tech infrastructure. For example, Dr. \nJulia Hilliard, an Alliance Eminent Scholar in molecular biotechnology \nat Georgia State University, has come to Georgia with an interest in \npreventing the spread of herpes-B, which is one of the most feared \noccupational hazards in biomedical science. Dr. Rafi Ahmed at the Emory \nUniversity School of Medicine is working to develop a vaccine that will \npermit the human immune system to respond with greater vigor when \nencountering a previously encountered pathogen. Included in this \ncutting-edge organization are world renowned researchers like Dr. Rao \nTummala of the Georgia Institute of Technology, whose interests are the \nnext generation electronic packaging, integral passive components, \nultra high-density substrate technologies. These are only a few of the \nmany dedicated researchers and scholars who are helping to shape \nGeorgia's high-tech economy for the 21st century and are ensuring that \nGeorgia becomes an even stronger world-class leader in high-tech \ndevelopment.\n  There are many others who are working on notable projects, from \nagricultural biotechnology to water and air quality enhancements to \ntechnology-based learning, to e-commerce and wireless communication. \nAll of the Eminent Scholars who have chosen Georgia to undertake their \nresearch do so for one reason--the strategic course Georgia has chosen \nto make its high-tech economy world class by the year 2010.\n  The major drive in developing Georgia's technology economic sector \nhas been the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to establish \nnew, leading-edge research programs, especially those involving \ncollaboration between academic and industrial scientists and engineers. \nThese investments have gone to developing research at Georgia's \nuniversities and have resulted in tremendous advances in technology \nrelated discoveries. These successes are continuing today by \ninvestments in people, laboratory construction and specialized \ninstrumentation in support of collaborative research and development.\n  This year the Alliance is expected to invest an additional $34 \nmillion to continue the progress being made to develop Georgia's \ntechnology-based economy. This effort includes $29.5 million for \nlaboratory construction in support of collaborative research and \ndevelopment conducted by eminent researchers. Another $3.75 million \nwill be used to fund endowments that will be used to recruit five \nadditional Eminent Scholars for Georgia. The remaining $750,000 will be \nspent to continue the Alliance's highly successful Technology \nPartnerships which encourage new relationships with industry and assist \nin the commercialization of university-based research.\n  One of the highly promising projects that is being considered for \nfuture development is a project at the University of Georgia to add \nworld-class and cutting edge animal genomics technology to Georgia's \nresearch and business sectors. For another project, it is envisioned \nthat a team of collaborating Eminent Scholars from Albany State \nUniversity and Georgia State University will be researching solutions \non how to effectively deal with water scarcity problems. To help combat \nglobal infectious diseases, a collaborative team of respected scholars \nfrom Emory University, the Medical College of Georgia, University of \nGeorgia, Georgia State and Geogia Tech will create a unique research \nprogram which will lead to the development and commercialization of new \nvaccines, diagnostics and drugs to prevent and treat infectious \ndiseases that threaten the health of the world's population and \nlivestock. This is only a sample of the extraordinary projects that are \nenvisioned for this year. Just wait until next year. The advancements \nmade by these projects will no doubt create even more exciting high-\ntech initiatives in the future.\n  The Alliance, through its hard work and dedicated people, has \nreceived worldwide recognition for its achievements and is prepared \nmore than ever before to attract and retain some of the best \nresearchers in the world. The Alliance has already been responsible for \ngenerating over 80,000 new jobs since 1990, and they are creating more \njobs than ever through the formation of new technology-based companies. \nThese companies are being formed almost daily in Georgia by converting \nresearch technology developed in university and industry laboratories \ninto new commercial applications. One example is AviGenics, Inc., a \ndevelopment-stage company formed to commercialize the results of novel \nlaboratory technologies in chicken transgenesis discovered at The \nUniversity of Georgia. The company's avian transgenesis platform is \nbeing used to improve poultry agronomic traits and helping the \npharmaceutical industry by producing high volumes of pharmaceutically-\nimportant proteins in eggs. Another successful high-tech upstart is the \nDigital Furnace Corporation. Formed in mid-1998, Digital Furnace is a \nspin-off from the Broadband Telecommunications Center led by Georgia \nResearch Alliance Eminent Scholar John Limb, who successfully developed \nbroadband technology to interconnect and automate the entire home. \nThese enterprises are benefitting directly from Georgia's investment in \nnew, state-of-the-art laboratories that the Alliance helped to build.\n\n  Even established major information technology companies are being \nattracted to Georgia by the presence of our strong science and \ntechnology programs and the state's commitment to growing the pool of \neminent scholars. Today companies like Lucent Technologies are seeking \nto capitalize on Georgia's high-tech infrastructure. Recently, Lucent \nTechnologies chose Atlanta to be home for its new Wireless Laboratory. \nThe decision was based largely on its ability to work in close \npartnership with Georgia's great researchers and the Alliance's \ncommitment to establish an eminent scholar chair and invest in a \nwireless systems laboratory at Georgia Tech. These investments are \nresulting in Georgia Tech's and Lucent's researchers working in \npartnership to further develop wireless communication capabilities. \nThis partnership is also helping to bridge the gap between a company's \nproblems and the expertise available at our research universities \nwhich, in\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nturn, is resulting in high-tech job creation and retention for the \nstate of Georgia.\n  The work of the Alliance has only begun and they have great plans to \nbuild on their current successes by creating a stronger technology \ninfrastructure in the State in the future. Their goal, as it has been \nin the past, is to make Georgia's technology economic sector one of the \ntop five in the nation by the year 2010. The outstanding successes of \nthe men and women of the Alliance have already proven that they are \ncapable of achieving this goal. Based on the successes they have \nalready achieved, I believe they will reach their goal sooner than \nexpected. Ladies and gentleman of the Georgia Research Alliance, I am \nvery grateful for your contributions and I am looking forward to your \ncontinued successes. Thank you very much for making Georgia a world \nclass leader in technology development and for making Georgia's \ntechnology economy one of the best in the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4294-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE IMPACT OF OSTEOPOROSIS\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'd like to take a few moments to \naddress a health issue of critical importance to Americans, especially \nolder women. Osteoporosis affects 28 million Americans, 80 percent of \nwhom are women. Nearly one in every two women and one in every eight \nmen over age 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in his or her \nlifetime. This disease measurably impact the ability of many older \nAmericans to maintain the independence and mobility so integral to \nmental well-being.\n  Osteoporosis is estimated to cost the United States care system $14 \nbillion annually. In my home state of Iowa, it is estimated that $2.9 \nbillion will be spent over the next 20 years as a result of hip, wrist \nand vetebral fractures. Annual costs are expected to increase from $76 \nmillion in 1995 to more than $229 million in 2015.\n  According to the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs, Iowa is the state \nwith the highest proportion of people considered to be the ``oldest \nold'' in the country. Twenty percent are 80 years of age and over. The \npeople in this age segment are more frequently women. They are usually \nliving alone; and they are probably the persons with the lowest \nincomes.\n  One of the most sobering facts is that osteoporosis is largely \npreventable. Prevention is a key element in fighting the disease, \nbecause while there are numerous treatments for osteoporosis, there is \nno cure. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, there are \nfour ways an individual can prevent osteoporosis. First, maintain a \nbalanced daily diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Participate in \nweight-bearing exercise. Do not smoke or drink excessively. And \nfinally, when appropriate, have your bone density tested and take any \nphysician-prescribed medications. All this to say, osteoporosis is a \ndisease which we in the Senate cannot afford to take lightly.\n  The National Osteoporosis Foundation has declared May to be National \nOsteoporosis Prevention Month. In my capacity as an honorary member of \nthe foundation's board of trustees, I am glad to have the opportunity \nto come to the floor to raise the issue of osteoporosis and speak on \nthe need for continued vigilance in battling this disease.\n  In addition to being National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, May also \nmarks a one-year anniversary for a special group in Iowa. In May 1999, \na group of Newton, Iowa, residents formed the Newton Support Group \nunder the leadership of Peg Bovenkamp and with the help of Skiff \nMedical Center. The Newton group is the first Iowa support network \naffiliated with the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Today, the \nmembers of the Newton Support Group are participating in Newton's \nSenior Citizen's Health Fair. I wish them success as they provide \ninformation to older Iowans about osteoporosis prevention and \ntreatment. It is my sincere hope that in coming years we will see \nsimilar groups form in other parts of my great state and throughout the \nregion.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, I have championed effort to increase \nawareness and research funding for osteoporosis. In the 102nd Congress, \nI introduced legislation to increase research at the Arthritis \nInstitute, form a research center on osteoporosis, and create a Health \nand Human Services interagency council to set priorities for \nosteoporosis research.\n  More recently, I cosponsored legislation which passed as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. The Bone Mass Measurement Coverage \nStandardization Act, as included in the BBA, provides Medicare \nreimbursement for bone mass density tests for vulnerable beneficiaries. \nThis benefit took effect July 1, 1998. And, yesterday I sent a letter \nto the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requesting \ninformation and the most recent data possible on program utilization.\n  Osteoporosis deeply affects the lives of older Americans, mostly \nwomen. And, it is preventable if healthy lifestyle choices are made at \na young age. As we recognize National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, I \nwould commend the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Strong Women \nInside and Out coalition, Peg Bovenkamp and the Newton Support Group, \nand all those working to raise awareness of the disease. It is my \nsincere hope that someday in the not too distant future, I can again \ncome to the floor with news of a cure for osteoporosis. Until that \ntime, I will continue supporting efforts to eradicate this devastating \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4294-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE HISTORIC WOMEN'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY BUILDING PRESERVATION ACT\n\n   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to announce that I have \nadded my name as a cosponsor to S. 2581, the Historic Women's Colleges \nand University Building Preservation Act, which supports the \npreservation and restoration of historic buildings at seven \nhistorically women's public colleges or universities. One of the \ncolleges eligible under this bill is Georgia College and State \nUniversity, which is located in Milledgeville, Georgia. This campus was \nfounded in 1889 as the sister institution to Georgia Tech. At the time, \nits emphasis was on preparing young women for teaching or industrial \ncareers.\n  Georgia College and State University has grown significantly over the \nyears and is now the state's designated liberal arts university, with a \nmission of combining the educational experiences typical of esteemed \nprivate liberal arts colleges with the affordability of public \neducation. The school serves as a residential learning community with \nan emphasis on undergraduate education and offers selected graduate \nprograms as well.\n  Several historic buildings comprise the campus which is located in \nthe heart of the historic district of the city, which served as my \nstate's capital for much of the 19th Century. The former Governor's \nmansion, the old Baldwin County Courthouse, and several historic \nresidence halls are all candidates for the $10 million proposed in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the schools which would receive funding under S. 2581 \nserve as a reminder of the struggle women went through to obtain access \nto higher education in our Nation. It is important that we do not allow \nthese campuses to fade into history. I encourage all of my colleagues \nin the Senate and House to fully support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4294-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4294-S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DRUG COURTS IN THE YEAR 2000\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Drug \nCourts and highlight the invaluable role they play in our Nation's war \non drugs. As I have done at this time of the year for the past two \nyears, I take this opportunity to call my colleagues' attention to the \nsignificant contribution Drug Courts make. Above all, I want to take \nthis opportunity to once again recognize and applaud the dedicated \nprofessionals who have made our Nation's Drug Courts the successes they \nare today.\n  As our Drug Courts enter their eleventh year of operation, they are \nas important as ever in our Nation's battle against drug abuse and the \ndevastating impact drugs have on our Nation and its families. Over the \npast year 100-plus new Drug Courts have been established throughout the \ncountry, bringing the\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\ntotal number to over 700. Additionally, Drug Courts are now expanding \ninternationally, underscoring their value around the world.\n  I am especially glad to hear that some of our Drug Courts' best \npractices are now being tailored to the needs and values of native \ncommunities, which for many years have suffered disproportionally from \nthe scourge of substance abuse. The kinds of programs offered by Drug \nCourts could play a vital role in breaking the ``Iron Triangle'' of \nsubstance abuse, gangs and crime that trap far too many of our Nation's \nNative Americans and others in a cycle of poverty and hopelessness.\n  Next week--from June 1st and 3rd, 2000--the National Association of \nDrug Court Professionals (NADCP) will host the 6th Annual NADCP Drug \nCourt Training Conference entitled ``Expanding the Vision: The New Drug \nCourt Pioneers.'' in San Francisco, California. The NADCP expects that \nthis year's drug court conference will be the largest ever, with over \n3,000 drug court professionals slated to attend.\n  This year, six individuals will receive the 2000 NADCP New Pioneers \nAward. I congratulate and thank each of these six outstanding people. I \nespecially want to recognize an award recipient from my home state of \nColorado, the Denver District Attorney, William Ritter, Jr.\n  The Denver Drug Court is the first--ever drug court system which now \nhandles 75 percent of all drug cases filed in the city and county of \nDenver. All offenders, with the exception of illegal aliens, those \narrested with a companion non-drug felony case or who have two or more \nprior felony convictions, are handled in this court. Most individuals \nare assessed within 24 hours of arrest. The pre-trial case managers \nmonitor offenders on bond, while they await entry into the program. \nOver 8,000 participants have entered the program since it began \noperations on July 1, 1994.\n  As the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, \nwhich funds the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), I took \nthe opportunity to visit the Denver Drug Court with ONDCP Director \nBarry McCaffrey. We met with the Drug Court professionals and observed \ntheir judicial procedures. We also saw first-hand how the court's \nprograms have a direct impact on drug-abusing offenders. I believe the \nDenver Drug Court serves as a role model for the next generation of \nDrug Court practitioners\n  Drug Courts continue to revolutionize the criminal justice system. \nThe strategy behind Drug Courts departs from traditional criminal \njustice practice by placing non-violent drug abusing offenders into \nintensive court supervised drug treatment programs instead of prison. \nDrug Courts aim to reduce drug abuse and crime by employing tools like \ncomprehensive judicial monitoring, drug testing, supervision, \ntreatment, rehabilitative services, as well as other sanctions and \nincentives for drug offenders.\n  Statistics show us that Drug Courts work. More than 70 percent of \nDrug Court clients have successfully completed the program or remain as \nactive participants. Drug Courts are also cost-effective. They help \nconvert many drug-using offenders into productive members of society. \nThis is clearly preferable to lengthy or repeated incarceration, which \ntraditionally has yielded few gains for those struggling with drugs or \nour Nation as a whole. Drug Courts are proving to be an effective tool \nin our fight against both drug abuse and other drug-related crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing those Drug Court \nprofessionals who are improving their communities by dedicating \nthemselves to this worthwhile concept and expanding the vision for the \nnext generation of practitioners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4295-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \ntreaties, nominations, and withdrawals which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4295-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n    AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE--A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 108\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)) (the ``Act''), I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the \nUnited States of America and the Republic of Chile on Social Security, \nwhich consists of two separate instruments: a principal agreement and \nan administrative arrangement.

A bill to provide for the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to fund, on a 1-year emergency basis, certain requests for \ngrant renewal under the programs for permanent supportive housing and \nshelter-plus-care for homeless persons; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                    homeless assistance legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \ndesigned to guarantee funding for Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) McKinney Act homeless assistance programs, including \nShelter Plus Care and the Supportive Housing Program (SHP).\n  The legislation I am introducing today mirrors legislation introduced \nearlier this year in the House by Representative LaFalce and included \nin the House version of the FY01 supplemental, which would renew \nexisting Shelter Plus and SHP contracts and fund them under the budget \nfor the HUD Section 8 housing assistance program.\n  The renewals funded under this legislation would provide grant \nfunding for existing programs that support assistance to some of the \nmost vulnerable Americans--the homeless. Without the resources that \nthis bill is designed to provide, many who receive assistance today \nwill literally be left out in the cold.\n  Keep in mind that these are not new programs--they are renewals. And \nthey fund community initiatives already in place in cities and towns \nacross the country that provide assistance to those in need. Under \nShelter Plus and SHP, states are awarded grants for services such as \nsubsidized housing for the homeless, many of whom are physically or \nmentally ill or disabled, or who suffer from substance abuse problems, \nas well as job training, shelters, health care, child care, and other \nservices for this population. Some of the victims that are helped are \nchildren, low-income families, single mothers, and battered spouses. \nMany are also veterans.\n  I have witnessed first-hand the dislocation that can be caused by \nnon-renewal. In January of last year, HUD issued homeless grant \nassistance announcements to most states but denied applications \nsubmitted by the Maine State Housing Authority and by the city of \nPortland, Maine leaving the state one of only four not to receive any \nfunds. We were alarmed to learn that this would mean that many homeless \nagencies and programs could lose\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nfunding altogether, and that in fact, over 70 homeless people with \nmental illnesses or substance abuse problems would lose housing \nsubsidies.\n  The Maine congressional delegation immediately protested the decision \nto HUD Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo. HUD officials ultimately restored \nabout $1 million in funding to the city of Portland, a portion of the \ncity's request, but refused to restore any State homeless funding.\n  In 1998, Maine homeless assistance providers received about $3.5 \nmillion for HUD, and the State had simply requested $1.2 million for \nrenewals and $1.27 million to meet additional needs in 1999. What did \nthey get to meet these needs--nothing. In spite of the proven track \nrecord of homeless programs in Maine, including praise by Secretary \nCuomo during an August 1998 visit to Maine, HUD completely zeroed out \nfunding for Maine. Not a penny for these disadvantaged children, \nbattered women, single mothers, disabled individuals, and veterans who \nsacrificed to preserve the freedoms we cherish.\n  This could happen anywhere, but it shouldn't. This is why I have also \ncosponsored legislation authored by my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins, to guarantee minimum funding for every state and assure a \nfairer, more equitable allocation of funding in the future. The \nlegislation requires HUD to provide a minimum of 0.5 percent of funding \nto each state under title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless \nAssistance Act.\n  Without this assistance, basic subsidized housing and shelter \nprograms suffer, and it is more difficult for states to provide job \ntraining, health care, child care, and other vital services to the \nvictims of homelessness.\n  In 1988, 14,653 people were temporarily housed in Maine's emergency \nhomeless shelters. Alarmingly, young people account for 30 percent of \nthe population staying in Maine's shelters, which is approximately 135 \nhomeless young people every night. Twenty-one percent of these young \npeople are between 5-12 with the average age being 13.\n  It is vitally important that changes be made to our homeless policy \nto ensure that no state falls through the cracks in the future. As \nsuch, I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for \nthe legislation I am proposing today. I hope this legislation will \ncontribute to the dialogue under way as to how best to enhance federal \nhomeless assistance initiatives, so that programs around the country \ncan continue to provide vital services to the less fortunate among us.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not express my \ngratitude to Senator Bond, who chairs the Senate VA-HUD Subcommittee \nfor his leadership and his support when HUD zeroed out funding for \nMaine's homeless programs. I am very grateful for his vision and \nleadership on issues of importance to homeless advocates nationwide. To \nthat end, I am pleased that the Senate version of the fiscal year 2001 \nAgriculture Department appropriations report contains language \nexpressing concern about the HUD policies that resulted in a number of \nlocal homeless assistance initiatives going unfunded in recent years, \nand urging HUD to ensure that expiring rental contracts are renewed. \nHUD is also directed to submit a report to Congress explaining why \nprojects with expiring grants were rejected during the 1999 round.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee as well as the Banking Committee as this year's \nlegislative and appropriations process continues, and as we endeavor to \ncraft a long-term solution to the homeless problem that is fiscally and \nsocially responsible and improves the effectiveness of federal homeless \nprograms for the future.\n  Once again, I applaud the leadership of the Senate VA-HUD and Banking \npanels on this important issue, and I am confident in their commitment \nto further improvements in the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2605. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nincome averaging to include the trade or business of fishing and to \nprovide a business credit against income for the purchase of fishing \nsafety equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                Tax Legislation for Commercial Fishermen\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to help commercial fishermen navigate the often choppy waters \nof the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The legislation I am introducing would make two commonsense changes \nto our tax laws. First, my legislation would extend a $1,500 tax credit \nto commercial fishermen to assist them in the purchase of important \nsafety equipment.\n  Commercial fishermen engage in one of the most dangerous professions \nin America. They have a higher fatality rate than even firefighters, \npolice officers, truck or taxi drivers. From 1994 to 1998, 396 \ncommercial fishermen lost their lives while fishing. Last year, in the \nwake of catastrophic events that killed 11 fishermen over the course of \nonly 1 month, the Coast Guard Fishing Vessel Casualty Task Force was \nconvened. The task force issued a report that draws several conclusions \nabout current fishing vessel safety. Despite the grim safety statistics \nsurrounding the profession of fishing, the report concludes that most \nfishing deaths are preventable. One significant way to prevent these \ntragic deaths is to make safety equipment on commercial fishing vessels \nmore widely available.\n  As those of us who represent States with commercial fishing \nindustries may recall, in 1988, Congress passed the Commercial Fishing \nIndustry Vessel Safety Act. This act required lifesaving and \nfirefighting equipment to be placed on board all fishing boats. \nUnfortunately, the cost of some of the safety equipment has proven to \nbe a serious practical impediment for many commercial fishermen. The \nmargin of profit for some commercial fishermen is simply too narrow and \nthey simply lack the funds required to purchase the expensive safety \nequipment they require.\n  Moreover, as the fishing industry has come under increasingly heavy \nFederal regulation, fishermen have often felt compelled to greatly \nincrease their productivity on those days when they are permitted to \nfish. As a result, too many take dangerous risks in order to earn a \nliving.\n  Just this last January, in my home State of Maine, a terrible and \ntragic incident highlighted the critical importance of safety \nequipment. Two very experienced fishermen tragically drowned off Cape \nNeddick when their commercial fishing vessel capsized during a storm. \nThe sole survivor of this tragedy was the fisherman who was able to \ncorrectly put on an immersion suit, a safety suit that the Coast Guard \nhas required on cold water commercial fishing boats since the early \n1990s.\n  In fact, immersion suits, liferafts, and emergency locater devices \nhave been credited with saving more than 200 lives since 1993. By \nproviding a $1,500 tax credit for fishermen to purchase safety \nequipment, my legislation would encourage the wider availability and \nuse of safety equipment on our Nation's commercial fishing boats. We \nshould take this sensible step to help ensure that fishermen do not set \noff without essential safety gear.\n  The second provision of my bill would eliminate some of the perils \nthat the Tax Code has that particularly affect commercial fishermen. I \npropose to allow fishermen to use income-averaging tax provisions that \nare now available to our Nation's farmers. For tax purposes, income \naveraging allows individuals to carry back income from a boom year to a \nprior less prosperous year. This tax treatment assists individuals who \nmust adapt to wide fluctuations in their income from year to year by \npreventing them from being pushed into higher tax brackets in random \ngood years.\n\n  Until 1986, both farmers and fishermen were covered under the Tax \nCode's income-averaging provisions. However, income averaging \ndisappeared as part of the tax restructuring undertaken in 1986. In \n1997, income-averaging provisions were again reintroduced into our Tax \nCode, but unfortunately, under the changes in the 1997 law, only \nfarmers were permitted to benefit from this tax relief. The Tax and \nTrade Relief Extension Act of 1998 permanently extended this tax relief \nprovision, but again only for our farmers.\n  Although I am very pleased that Congress has restored income \naveraging for our Nation's farmers, I do not believe our fishermen \nshould be left out in the\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\ncold and excluded from using income averaging. The legislation that I \nintroduce today would restore fairness by extending income averaging to \nour fishermen as well as our farmers.\n  Parallel tax treatment for fishermen and farmers is appropriate for \nmany reasons. Currently, unlike farmers, fishermen's sole tax \nprotection to handle fluctuations in income are found in the Tax Code's \nnet operating loss provisions. These provisions do not provide the tax \nbenefits of income averaging and are so complex in their computation \nthat it often defies the ability of any individual without a CPA after \nhis or her name.\n  Most importantly, both farm and fishing income can fluctuate widely \nfrom year to year due to a wide range of uncontrollable circumstances, \nincluding market prices, the weather and, in the case of fishing, \nGovernment restrictions.\n  I urge my colleagues to help our fishermen cope with the fluctuations \nin their income by restoring this important tax provision and by \nextending a safety tax credit to help protect them from the hazards \nthat their fishing profession entails.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 2606. A bill to protect the privacy of American consumers; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  the consumer privacy protection act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress one of the most pressing problems facing American consumers \ntoday--the constant assault on citizens' privacy by the denizens of the \nprivate marketplace. This legislation, the Consumer Privacy Protection \nAct of 2000, represents an attempt to provide basic, widespread, and \nwarranted privacy protections to consumers in both the online and \noffline marketplace. On the Internet, our bill sets forth a regulatory \nregime to ensure pro-consumer privacy protections, coupling a strong \nfederal standard with preemption of inconsistent state laws on Internet \nprivacy. We need a strong federal standard to protect consumer privacy \nonline, and we need preemption to ensure business certainty in the \nmarketplace, given the numerous state privacy initiatives that are \ncurrently pending. Off the Internet, this bill extends privacy \nprotections that are already on the books to similarly regulated \nindustries or business practices, and requires a broad examination of \nprivacy practices in the traditional marketplace to help Congress \nbetter understand whether further regulation is appropriate.\n  The introduction of this legislation comes as the Federal Trade \nCommission releases its eagerly awaited report on Internet Privacy. \nReleased yesterday, that report concludes that Internet industry self-\nregulation efforts have failed to protect adequately consumer privacy. \nAccordingly, the report calls for legislation that requires commercial \nweb sites to comply with the ``four widely accepted fair information \npractices'' of notice, consent, access, and security. The legislation \nthat we introduce today accomplishes just that.\n  On the Internet, many users unfortunately are unaware of the \nsignificant amount of information they are surrendering every time they \nvisit a web site. For many others, the fear of a loss of personal \nprivacy on the Internet represents the last hurdle impeding their full \nembrace of this exciting and promising new medium. Nonetheless, \nmillions of Americans every day utilize the Internet and put their \npersonal information at risk. As the Washington Post reported on May \n17, 2000:\n\n       The numbers tell the story. About 44.4 million households \n     will be online by the end of this year . . . up from 12.7 \n     million in 1995, an increase of nearly 250 percent over five \n     years. Roughly 55 million Americans log into the Internet on \n     a typical day. . . . Industry experts estimate that the \n     amount of Internet traffic doubles every 100 days. . . . \n     These changes are not without a price. Along with wired life \n     comes growing concern about intrusions into privacy and the \n     ability to protect identities online.\n\n  As Internet use proliferates, there needs to be some regulation and \nenforcement to ensure pro-consumer privacy policies, particularly where \nthe collection, consolidation, and dissemination of private, personal \ninformation is so readily achievable in this digital age. Indeed, \nadvances in technology have provided information gatherers the tools to \nseamlessly compile and enhance highly detailed personal histories of \nInternet users. Despite these indisputable facts, industry has to this \npoint nearly unanimously opposed even a basic regulatory framework that \nwould ensure the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet--a \nbasic framework that has been successfully adopted in other areas of \nour economy.\n  Our bill gives customers, not companies, control over their personal \ninformation on the Internet. It accomplishes this goal by establishing \nin law the five basic tenets of the long-established fair information \npractices standards--notice, consent, access, security, and \nenforcement. The premise of these standards is simple:\n  (1) Consumers should be given notice of companies' information \npractices and what they intend to do with people's personal \ninformation.\n  (2) Consumers should be given the opportunity to consent, or not to \nconsent, to those information practices.\n  (3) Consumers should be given the right to access whatever \ninformation has been collected about them and to correct that \ninformation where necessary.\n  (4) Companies should be required to establish reasonable procedures \nto ensure that consumers' personal information is kept secure.\n  (5) A viable enforcement mechanism must be established to safeguard \nconsumers' privacy rights.\n  While the Internet industry argues that the need for these \nprotections are premature, the threat to personal privacy posed by \nadvances in technology was anticipated twenty three years ago by the \nPrivacy Protection Study Commission, which was created pursuant to the \nPrivacy Act of 1974. In 1977, that Commission reported to the Congress \nand the federal government on the issue of privacy and technology. The \nCommission's portrait of the world in 1977 might well still be used \ntoday. That report found that society is increasingly dependant on \n``computer based record keeping systems,'' which result in a ``rapidly \nchanging world in which insufficient attention is being paid--by policy \nmakers, system designers, or system users--to the privacy protection \nimplications of these trends.'' The report went on to state that even \nwhere some privacy protections exist under the law, ``there is the \ndanger that personal privacy will be further eroded due to applications \nof new technology. Policy makers must not be complacent about this \npotential. The economic and social costs of incorporating privacy \nprotection safeguards into a record-keeping systems are always greater \nwhen it is done retroactively than when it is done at the system's \ninception.''\n  Today, twenty three years later, as we enter what America Online \nchairman Steve Case calls the ``Internet Century,'' the words of the \nPrivacy Commission could not be more appropriate. Poll after poll \nindicates that Americans fear that their privacy is not being \nsufficiently protected on the Internet. Last September, the Wall St. \nJournal reported that Americans' number one concern (measured at 29 \npercent as we enter the 21st century was a fear of a loss of personal \nprivacy. Just two months ago, Business Week reported that 57 percent of \nAmericans believe that Congress should pass laws to govern how personal \ninformation is collected and used on the Internet. Moreover, a recent \nsurvey by the Federal Trade Commission found that 87 percent of \nrespondents are concerned about threats to their privacy in relation to \ntheir online usage. And, while industry claims that self-regulation is \nworking, only 15 percent of those polled by Business Week believed that \nthe Government should defer to voluntary, industry-developed privacy \nstandards.\n  Are these fears significant enough to require federal action? \nAbsolutely, particularly in light of predictions by people such as John \nChambers, the CEO of CISCO Systems, who forecasts that one quarter of \nall global commerce will be conducted online by 2010. As the Privacy \nCommission stated a quarter of a century ago, the ``economic and social \ncosts'' of mandating pro-privacy protections will be far lower now than \nwhen the Internet is handling twenty\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nfive percent of all global commerce. Besides if John Chambers is right, \nthe Internet industry should embrace, rather than resist, strong \nprivacy policies. Simply put, strong privacy policies represent good \nbusiness. For example, a study conducted by Forrester Research in \nSeptember 1999 revealed that e-commerce spending was deprived of $2.8 \nbillion in possible revenue last year because of consumer fears over \nprivacy.\n  Indeed, the fears and concerns reflected in these analyses are borne \nout in study after study on the privacy practices--or lack thereof--of \nthe companies operating on the Internet. Last year, an industry \ncommissioned study found that of the top 100 web sites, while 99 \ncollect information about Internet users, only 22 comply with all four \nof the core privacy principles of notice, choice, access, and security. \nA broader industry funded survey reports that only 10 percent of the \ntop 350 Web sites implement all four of these privacy principles. This \nweek, our Committee will hold a hearing to receive the report of the \nFederal Trade Commission on its most recent analysis of the privacy \npolicies of the Internet industry. While the industry will claim that \nthey have made tremendous progress in their self-regulatory efforts, \nthe FTC apparently, is not convinced--finding in its report release \nyesterday that ``only 20% of the busiest sites on the World Wide Web \nimplement to some extent all four fair information practices in their \nprivacy disclosures. Even when only Notice and Choice are considered, \nfewer than half of the sites surveyed (41%) meet the relevant \nstandards.'' This record indicates that we should begin to consider \npassing pro-consumer privacy legislation this year. The public is \nclamoring for it, the  studies justify it, and the potential harm from \ninaction is simply too great.\n\n  It is worth noting that advocates of self-regulation often claim that \nthe collection and use of consumer information actually enhances the \nconsumer experience on the Internet. While there may be some truth to \nthat claim, many Internet users do not want companies to target them \nwith marketing based on their personal shopping habits. Those \nindividuals should be given control over whether and how their personal \ninformation is used via an ``opt-in'' mechanism. Moreover, even those \nconsumers who targeted marketing and want to ``opt-in'' to those \npractices, may not be willing to accept what happens to their \ninformation after it is used for this allegedly benign purpose.\n  For example, should it be acceptable business behavior to sell, rent, \nshare, or loan a historical record of a customers tobacco purchasing \nhabits to an insurance company. Should an Internet user's surfing \nhabits--including frequent visits to AIDS or diabetes, or other \nsensitive health-related websites be revealed to prospective employers \nwilling to pay a fee for such information? Should online surfing habits \nthat identify consumer shopping activities be merged with offline \ndatabase information already existing on a consumer to form a highly \ndetailed, intricate portrait of that individual? The answer to these \nquestions most assuredly is no. And yet right now, there is no law, or \nregulation, that would prohibit these objectionable practices.\n  We are already seeing evidence of these practices in the marketplace \ntoday. For example, on February 2, 2000, the New York Times reported on \na study by the California HealthCare Foundation that concluded that \n``19 of the top 21 health sites had privacy policies but . . . most \nfailed to live up to promises not to share information with third \nparties. . . . [N]one of the sites followed guidelines recommended by \nthe Federal Trade Commission on collection and use of personal data.'' \nDespite these reports, industry continues to insist that government \nwait and see, and let self-regulation and the marketplace protect \nagainst these articulable harms. We say that is like letting the fox \nguard the henhouse.\n  At the same time, we must not ignore those members of the industry \nwho at least place some importance on protecting consumer privacy on \nthe Internet. For example, in contrast to most Internet and online \nservice providers, American Online does not track its millions of users \nwhen they venture on the Internet and out of AOL's proprietary network. \nIn addition, IBM--while opposing federal legislation--refuses to \nadvertise on Internet sites that do not possess and post a clear \nprivacy policy. These are the types of practices that government \nwelcomes. Unfortunately, they are far and few between.\n  As a result, the time has come to permit consumers to decide for \nthemselves whether, and to what extent, they desire to permit \ncommercial entities access to their personal information. Industry will \nargue that this is an aggressive approach. They will assert that at \nmost, Congress should give customers the right to ``opt-in'' only with \nrespect to those information practices deemed to be ``sensitive''--such \nas the gathering of information regarding health, financial, ethnic, \nreligious, or other particularly private areas. The problem with this \nsuggestion is that it leaves it up to Congress and industry lawyers and \nlobbyists to define what is in fact ``sensitive'' for individual \nconsumers.\n  A better approach is to give consumers an ``opt-in'' right to control \naccess to all personally identifiable information that might be \ncollected online. This approach allows consumers to make their own, \npersonal, and subjective determination as to what they do or don't want \nknown about them by the companies with which they interact. If industry \nis right that most people want targeted advertising, then most people \nwill opt-in. Indeed, Alta Vista, a commonly used search portal on the \nInternet, employs an ``opt-in'' approach.\n  As if this evidence were not enough, we only need to look to the \nFebruary 24, 2000, article in TheStreet.Com entitled, ``DoubleClick \nExec Says Privacy Legislation Needn't Crimp Results.'' In that article, \na leading Internet executive from DoubleClick, the Internet's most well \nknown banner advertiser, states that his company would not ``face an \ninsurmountable problem'' in attempting to operate under strict privacy \nrules. Complying with such rules is ``not rocket science,'' the \nexecutive stated, ``it's execution.'' He went on to state that his \ncompany could continue to be successful under an ``opt-in'' regulatory \nregime. This is a phenomenal admission that ``opt-in'' policies would \nnot impede the basic functionality and commercial activity on the \nInternet. The admission is particularly stunning given that it comes \nfrom a company whose business model is to track consumer activities on \nthe Internet so as to target them with specific advertising.\n  Moreover, evidence in the marketplace demonstrates that ``opt-out'' \npolicies will not always lead to full informed consumer choice. First \nof all, ``opt-out'' policies place the burden on the consumer to take \ncertain steps to protect the privacy of their personal information. \nUnder an ``opt-out'' approach, the incentive exists for industry to \ndevelop privacy policies that discourage people from opting out. The \npolicies will be longer, harder to read, and the actual ``opt-out'' \noption will often be buried under hundreds, if not thousands of words \nof text. Consider the recent article in USA Today on this very issue. \nEntitled, ``Privacy isn't Public Knowledge,'' this May 1, 2000, article \noutlines the difficulty consumers have in opting out of the information \ncollection practices of Internet companies. While consumers may be \ninformed if they actually locate and read the company's privacy policy \nthat they are likely to be ``tracked by name . . . only with [their] \n`permission,' '' they may not be informed up front that it is assumed \nthat they have granted such permission unless they ``opt-out.'' \nMoreover, to get through the hundreds of words of required reading to \nfind the ``opt-out'' option, it turns out, according to this article, \nthat you need a graduate level or college education reading ability to \nsimply comprehend the policies in the first place. According to FTC \nChairman Robert Pitofsky, ``Some sites bury your rights in a long page \nof legal jargon so it's hard to find them hard to understand them once \nyou find them. Self-regulation that creates opt-out rights that cannot \nbe found [or] understood is really not an acceptable form of consumer \nprotection.'' One thing is clear from this article--``self-regulation'' \nis not working.\n\n  We know, however, that some companies do not collect personal \ninformation on the Internet. For example,\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nsome banner advertisers target their messages and ads to computers but \nnot to people individually. They do this by tracking the Internet \nactivity of a particular Internet Protocol address, without ever \nknowing who exactly is behind that address. Thus, they can never share \npersonal information about a consumer's preferences, shopping, or \nresearch habits online, because they don't know who that consumer is. \nAccording to the chief technology officer of Engage--a prominent banner \nadvertiser--``We don't need to know who someone is to make the [online] \nexperience relevant. We're trying to strike this balance between the \nconsumer's need for privacy and the marketer's need to be effective in \norder to sustain a free Internet.'' Such a business practice is an \nexample of marketplace forces providing better privacy protection and \nmy legislation recognizes that. Accordingly, if companies are only \ncollecting and using non-personal information online they could comply \nwith this bill by providing consumers with an ``opt-out,'' rather than \nan opt-in option.\n  Under this legislation, companies would be required to provide \nupdates to consumers notifying them of changes to their privacy \npolicies. Companies would also be prohibited from using information \nthat had been collected under a prior privacy policy, if such use did \nnot comport with that prior policy and if the consumer had not granted \nconsent to the new practices.\n  In addition, the bill would provide permanence to a consumer's \ndecision to grant or withhold consent, and allow the effect of that \ndecision to be altered only by the consumer. Consequently, companies \nwould not be permitted to let their customer's privacy preferences \nexpire, thereby requiring consumers to reaffirm their prior \ncommunication as to how they want their personal information handled.\n  Unfortunately, many privacy violations are often unknown by the very \nconsumers whose privacy has been violated. Therefore, the legislation \nwould provide whistleblower protection to employees of companies who \ncome forward with evidence of privacy violations.\n  In order to enforce these consumer protections, our bill would call \nupon the Federal Trade Commission to implement and enforce the \nprovisions of the legislation applicable to the Internet. The FTC is \nthe sole federal agency with substantial expertise in this area. Not \nonly has the FTC conducted extensive studies on Internet privacy and \nprofiling on the Internet in recent years, but it recently concluded a \ncomprehensive rulemaking to implement the fair information practice of \nnotice, consent, access, and security, as required by the Childrens \nOnline Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which we enacted in 1998.\n  In addition, the legislation provides the attorneys general with the \nability to enforce the bill on behalf of constituents in their \nindividual states. And, while the legislation would preempt \ninconsistent state law, citizens would be free to avail themselves of \nother applicable remedies such as fraud, contractual breach, unjust \nenrichment, or emotional distress. Finally, the bill would permit \nindividual consumers to bring a private right of action to enjoin \nInternet privacy violations.\n  While rules are clearly needed to protect consumer privacy on the \nInternet, we recognize that information is collected and shared in the \ntraditional marketplace as well. The rate of collection, however, and \nthe intrusiveness of the monitoring is nowhere near as significant as \nit is online. For example, when a consumer shops in a store in a mall \nand browses through items without purchasing anything, no one makes a \nlist of his or her every move. To the contrary, on the Internet, every \nbrowse, observation, and individual click of the mouse may be \nsurreptitiously monitored. Notwithstanding this distinction, it may be \nappropriate at some time to develop privacy protections for the general \nmarketplace, in addition to those set forth in this bill for \nthe Internet. That is why our bill asks the FTC to conduct an \nexhaustive study of privacy issues in the general marketplace and \nreport to the Congress as to what rules and regulations, if any, may be \nnecessary to protect consumers.\n\n  We are also learning that employers are increasingly monitoring their \nemployees--both in and out of the workplace--on the phone, on the \ncomputer, and in their daily activities on the job. While employees may \nbe justified in taking steps to ensure that their workers are \nproductive and efficient, such monitoring raises implications for those \nworkers' privacy. Accordingly, this legislation directs the Department \nof Labor to conduct a study of privacy issues in the workplace, and \nreport to Congress as to what--if any--regulations may be necessary to \nprotect worker privacy.\n  Additionally, the legislation extends some existing privacy \nprotections that we already know are working in the offline \nmarketplace. For example, the bill would extend the privacy protections \nconsumers enjoy while shopping in video stores to book and record \nstores, as well as to the digital delivery of those products. The bill \nwould also extend the privacy protections we put forth in the Cable Act \nof 1984 to customers who subscribe to multichannel video programming \nservices via satellite. And, the legislation would codify the Federal \nCommunications Commission's CPNI rules, to provide privacy protection \nto telephone customers. The bill would also ask the Federal \nCommunications Commission to harmonize existing privacy rules that \napply to disparate communications technologies so that the personal \nprivacy of subscribers to all communications services are protected \nequally. Finally, the legislation would clarify that personal \ninformation could not be deemed an asset if the company holding that \ninformation avails itself of the protection of our bankruptcy laws.\n  The development of a strong and comprehensive privacy regime must \nalso address the security of Internet-connected computers. This month, \nthe world was bitten by the ``love bug,'' a computer virus that \ndevastated computer systems in more than 20 countries and caused an \nestimated $10 billion in damages. One of the features of the ``love \nbug'' was an attempt to steal passwords stored on an infected hard \ndrive for later use. If successful, the virus-writer could have gained \naccess to thousands of Internet access accounts. The spread of the \nvirus highlighted the vulnerability of interconnected computer systems \nto malicious persons intent on disrupting or compromising legitimate \nuse of these systems.\n  The development of technology, policies, and expertise to effectively \nprotect a computer system from illegitimate users is a cornerstone of \nprivacy protection because a privacy policy is worthless if the company \ncannot adequately secure that information and control its \ndissemination. While it would be impossible for the Federal government \nto protect every web site from every threat, it can help users and \noperators of web sites by researching and developing better computer \nsecurity technologies and practices. Therefore, I have included a title \non computer security in this bill.\n  This title of the bill is an attempt to promote and enhance the \nprotection of computers connected to the Internet. First, the bill \nwould establish a 25-member computer security partnership council. This \ncouncil would build on the public-private partnership proposed in the \nwake of February's denial of service attacks which shut down leading e-\ncommerce sites like Yahoo! and E-bay. The council would identify \nthreats and help companies share solutions. It would be a major source \nof public information on computer security and could help educate the \ngeneral public and businesses on good computer protection practices. In \naddition, our bill calls on the Council to identify areas in which we \nhave not invested adequately in computer security research. This study \ncould be a blueprint for future research investments.\n\n  While the private sector has put significant resources into computer \nsecurity research, the President's Information Technology Advisory \nCouncil has noted that current information technology research is often \nfocused on the short-term and neglects long-term fundamental problems. \nThis bill would authorize appropriations for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology to invest in long-term computer security \nresearch needs. This research would complement private sector, market-\ndriven research and could be conducted at NIST or through grants to\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nacademic or private-sector researchers. The results of these \ninvestigations could power the next generation of advanced computer \nsecurity technologies.\n  Of course those technologies will not protect government, or \ncompanies and their customers, unless there are well-trained \nprofessionals to operate and secure computer systems. The problem is \nparticularly acute for the Federal government. According to a May 10th \nWashington Post article, the Federal government will need to replace or \nhire more than 35,000 high-tech workers by the year 2006. The last time \nI checked, the same people who could fill those government positions \nare in high demand from Silicon Valley and the Dulles Corridor \ncompanies, among other. Until the government is able to offer stock \noptions, we will continue to struggle to fill these positions. Our bill \nwould establish an ROTC-like program to train computer security \nprofessionals for government service. In exchange for loans or grants \nto complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in computer security, a \nstudent would be required to work for the government for a certain \nnumber of years. This would allow students to get high-quality computer \nsecurity training, to serve as a Federal employee for a short time, and \nthen, if they desire, to enter the private sector job market.\n  This legislation would also push the government to get its house in \norder and become an example for good computer security practices. It \nproposes increased scrutiny of government security practices and would \nestablish an Award for Quality of Government Security Practices to \nrecognize agencies and departments which have excellent policies and \nprocesses to protect their computer systems. The criteria for this \naward will be published by the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) and should encourage government to improve security \non its systems. In addition, these criteria could become a model for \ncomputer security professionals inside and outside the government.\n  Finally, the bill would tie research and theory to meaningful, on-\nthe-ground protections for Internet users. The bill calls on NIST to \nencourage and support the development of software standards that would \nallow users to set up an individual privacy regime at the outset and \nhave those preferences follow them--without further intervention--as \nthey surf the web.\n  This bill asks a lot of private companies in protecting the \npersonally-identifiable information of American citizens. It would be \nwrong for the Congress not to apply the same standard to itself as \nwell. Title IX of the bill calls for the development of Senate and \nHouse rules on protecting the privacy of information obtained through \nofficial web sites.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Consumer \nPrivacy Protection Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Privacy Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental \n     right worthy of protection through appropriate legislation.\n       (2) Consumers engaging in and interacting with companies \n     engaged in interstate commerce have an ownership interest in \n     their personal information, as well as a right to control how \n     that information is collected, used, or transferred.\n       (3) Existing State, local, and Federal laws provide \n     virtually no privacy protection for Internet users.\n       (4) Moreover, existing privacy regulation of the general, \n     or offline, marketplace provides inadequate consumer \n     protections in light of the significant data collection and \n     dissemination practices employed today.\n       (5) The Federal government thus far has eschewed general \n     Internet privacy laws in favor of industry self-regulation, \n     which has led to several self-policing schemes, none of which \n     are enforceable in any meaningful way or provide sufficient \n     consumer protection.\n       (6) State governments have been reluctant to enter the \n     field of Internet privacy regulation because use of the \n     Internet often crosses State, or even national, boundaries.\n       (7) States are nonetheless interested in providing greater \n     privacy protection to their citizens as evidenced by recent \n     lawsuits brought against offline and online companies by \n     State attorneys general to protect consumer privacy.\n       (8) Personal information flowing over the Internet requires \n     greater privacy protection than is currently available today. \n     Vast amounts of personal information about individual \n     Internet users are collected on the Internet and sold or \n     otherwise transferred to third parties.\n       (9) Poll after poll consistently demonstrates that \n     individual Internet users are highly troubled over their lack \n     of control over their personal information.\n       (10) Research on the Internet industry demonstrates that \n     consumer concerns about their privacy on the Internet has a \n     correlative negative impact on the development of e-commerce.\n       (11) Notwithstanding these concerns, the Internet is \n     becoming a major part of the personal and commercial lives of \n     millions of Americans, providing increased access to \n     information, as well as communications and commercial \n     opportunities.\n       (12) It is important to establish personal privacy rights \n     and industry obligations now so that consumers have \n     confidence that their personal privacy is fully protected on \n     our Nation's telecommunications networks and on the Internet.\n       (13) The social and economic costs of imposing obligations \n     on industry now will be lower than if Congress waits until \n     the Internet becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives in \n     coming years.\n       (14) Absent the recognition of these rights and the \n     establishment of consequent industry responsibilities to \n     safeguard those rights, consumer privacy will soon be more \n     gravely threatened.\n       (15) The ease of gathering and compiling personal \n     information on the Internet, both overtly and \n     surreptitiously, is becoming increasingly efficient and \n     effortless due to advances in digital communications \n     technology which have provided information gatherers the \n     ability to seamlessly compile highly detailed personal \n     histories of Internet users.\n       (16) Consumers must have--\n       (A) clear and conspicuous notice that information is being \n     collected about them;\n       (B) clear and conspicuous notice as to the information \n     gatherer's intent with respect to that information;\n       (C) the ability to control the extent to which information \n     is collected about them; and\n       (D) the right to prohibit any unauthorized use, reuse, \n     disclosure, transfer, or sale of their information.\n       (17) Fair information practices include providing consumers \n     with knowledge of any data collection clear and conspicuous \n     notice of an entity's information practices, the ability to \n     control whether or not those practices will be applied to \n     them personally, access to information collected about them, \n     and safeguards to ensure the integrity and security of that \n     information.\n       (18) Recent surveys of websites conducted by the Federal \n     Trade Commission and Georgetown University found that a small \n     minority of websites surveyed contained a privacy policy \n     embodying fair information practices such as notice, choice, \n     access, and security.\n       (19) Americans expect that their purchases of written \n     materials, videos, and music will remain confidential, \n     whether they are shopping online or in the traditional \n     workplace.\n       (20) Consumer privacy with respect to written materials, \n     music, and movies should be protected vigilantly to ensure \n     the free exercise of First Amendment rights of expression, \n     regardless of medium.\n       (21) Under current law, millions of American cable \n     customers are protected against disclosures of their personal \n     subscriber information without notice and choice, whereas no \n     similar protection is available to subscribers of \n     multichannel video programming via satellite.\n       (22) Almost every American is a consumer of some form of \n     communications service, be it wireless, wireline, cable, \n     broadcast, or satellite.\n       (23) In light of the convergence of and emerging \n     competition among and between wireless, wireline, satellite, \n     broadcast, and cable companies, privacy safeguards should be \n     applied uniformly across different communications media so as \n     to provide consistent consumer privacy protections as well as \n     a level competitive playing field for industry.\n       (24) Notwithstanding the recent focus on Internet privacy, \n     privacy issues abound in the traditional, or offline, \n     marketplace that merit Federal attention.\n       (25) The Congress would benefit from an exhaustive analysis \n     of general marketplace privacy issues conducted by the agency \n     with the most expertise in this area, the Federal Trade \n     Commission.\n       (26) While American workers are growing increasingly \n     concerned that their employers may be violating their \n     privacy, many workers are unaware that their activities in \n     the workplace may be subject to significant and potentially \n     invasive monitoring.\n       (27) While employers may have a legitimate need to maintain \n     an efficient and productive workforce, that need should not \n     improperly impinge on employee privacy rights in the \n     workplace.\n       (28) Databases containing personal information about \n     consumers' commercial purchasing, browsing, and shopping \n     habits, as well as their generalized product preferences, \n     represent considerable commercial value.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n       (29) These databases should not be considered an asset with \n     respect to creditors' interests if the asset holder has \n     availed itself of the protection of State or Federal \n     bankruptcy laws.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION OF INCONSISTENT STATE LAW OR REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this \n     Act preempts any State law, regulation, or rule that is \n     inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act preempts--\n       (1) the law of torts in any State;\n       (2) the common law in any State; or\n       (3) any State law, regulation, or rule that prohibits fraud \n     or provides a remedy for fraud.\n       (2) Private right-of-action.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a), if a State law provides for a private right-of-action \n     under a statute enacted to provide consumer protection, \n     nothing in this Act precludes a person from bringing such an \n     action under that statute, even if the statute is otherwise \n     preempted in whole or in part under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 4.

DISCLOSURE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR UNDER COURT \n                   ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this title, an Internet service provider, online service \n     provider, operator of a commercial website, or third party \n     that uses such a service or website to collect information \n     about users of that service or website may disclose \n     personally identifiable information about a user of that \n     service or website--\n       (1) to a law enforcement agency in response to a warrant \n     issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an \n     equivalent State warrant, or a court order issued in \n     accordance with subsection (c); and\n       (2) in response to a court order in a civil proceeding \n     granted upon a showing of compelling need for the information \n     that cannot be accommodated by any other means if--\n       (A) the user to whom the information relates is given \n     reasonable notice by the person seeking the information of \n     the court proceeding at which the order is requested; and\n       (B) that user is afforded a reasonable opportunity to \n     appear and contest the issuance of requested order or to \n     narrow its scope.\n       (b) Safeguards Against Further Disclosure.--A court that \n     issues an order described in subsection (a) shall impose \n     appropriate safeguards on the use of the information to \n     protect against its unauthorized disclosure.\n       (c) Court Orders.--A court order authorizing disclosure \n     under subsection (a)(1) may issue only with prior notice to \n     the user and only if the law enforcement agency shows that \n     there is probable cause to believe that the user has engaged, \n     is engaging, or is about to engage in criminal activity and \n     that the records or other information sought are material to \n     the investigation of such activity. In the case of a State \n     government authority, such a court order shall not issue if \n     prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order \n     pursuant to this subsection, on a motion made promptly by the \n     Internet service provider, online service provider, or \n     operator of the commercial website, may quash or modify such \n     order if the information or records requested are \n     unreasonably voluminous in nature or if compliance with such \n     order otherwise would cause an unreasonable burden on the \n     provider or operator.\n\n     SEC. 107. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This title takes effect after the Federal \n     Trade Commission completes the rulemaking procedure under \n     section 109.\n       (b) Application to Pre-existing Data.--\n       (1) In general.--After the effective date of this title, \n     and except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), sections \n     101, 102, and 103 apply to information collected before the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Collection of both kinds of information.--Section \n     102(b)(1) and 103(b)(1) do not apply to information collected \n     before the effective date of this title.\n       (3) Access to personally identifiable information.--Section \n     102(c) applies to personally identifiable information \n     collected before the effective date of this title unless it \n     is economically unfeasible for the Internet service provider, \n     online service provider, or commercial website operator to \n     comply with that section for the information.\n\n     SEC. 108.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Good computer security practices are an underpinning of \n     any privacy protection. The operator of a computer system \n     should protect that system from unauthorized use and secure \n     any private, personal information.\n       (2) The Federal Government should be a role model in \n     securing its computer systems and should ensure the \n     protection of private, personal information controlled by \n     Federal agencies.\n       (3) The National Institute of Standards and Technology has \n     the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines \n     needed to ensure the cost-effective security and privacy of \n     private, personal information in Federal computer systems.\n       (4) This Nation faces a shortage of trained, qualified \n     information technology workers, including computer security \n     professionals. As the demand for information technology \n     workers grows, the Federal government will have an \n     increasingly difficult time attracting such workers into the \n     Federal workforce.\n       (5) Some commercial off-the-shelf hardware and off-the-\n     shelf software components to protect computer systems are \n     widely available. There is still a need for long-term \n     computer security research, particularly in the area of \n     infrastructure protection.\n       (6) The Nation's information infrastructures are owned, for \n     the most part, by the private sector, and partnerships and \n     cooperation will be needed for the security of these \n     infrastructures.\n       (7) There is little financial incentive for private \n     companies to enhance the security of the Internet and other \n     infrastructures as a whole. The Federal government will need \n     to make investments in this area to address issues and \n     concerns not addressed by the private sector.\n\n     SEC. 702.

Mr. President, Big Browser is watching you. Almost every \ntime, you or I or an American consumer surfs the Internet, someone is \ntracking our movements. And someone is compiling a databank of \ninformation about our preferences and could even be profiling us.\n  Maybe they're doing it to make our experience better. Most of the \ntime, they probably are. But too often we are being profiled for \nprofit, and at the expense of privacy.\n  I am proud to co-sponsor Senator Hollings' legislation, the Consumer \nPrivacy Protection Act, that would help consumers gain control of their \nmost personal information. I believe that the measure we introduce \ntoday is a step in the right direction. It strikes the right balance. \nPrivacy is protected, while critical elements of the information \nrevolution are preserved. Consumer confidence in the Internet is \nbolstered, while businesses will not be overburdened by the \nrequirements.\n  We can enjoy the convenience of online shopping and allow e-commerce \nto thrive without putting profits over privacy. Consumers, not dot.com \ncompanies, should control the use of confidential information about \nbuying habits, credit card records and other personal information.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now. If not, we may wake up one day \nto find our privacy so thoroughly eroded that recovering it will be \nalmost impossible.\n  No one denies that the rapid development of modern technology has \nbeen beneficial. New and improved technologies have enabled us to \nobtain information more quickly and easily than ever before. Students \ncan participate in classes that are being taught in other states, or \neven in other countries. Almost no product or piece of information is \nbeyond the reach of Americans anymore. A farmer in Sampson County, \nNorth Carolina can go on the Internet and compare prices for anything \nhe needs to run his business. Or he can look up critical weather \ninformation on the Internet. Or he can just order a hard-to-get book. \nMeanwhile, companies have streamlined their processes for providing \ngoods and services.\n  But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They \nhave made it easier to track personal information such as medical and \nfinancial records and buying habits. They have made it profitable to do \nso. And in turn, our ability to keep our personal information private \nis being eaten away.\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n  The impact of this erosion ranges from the merely annoying--having \nyour mailbox flooded with junkmail--to the actually frightening--having \nyour identity stolen or being turned down for a loan because your bank \ngot copies of your medical records. There are thousands of ways that \nthe loss of our privacy can impact us. Many of them are intangible--\njust the discomfort of knowing that complete strangers can find out \neverything about you: where you shop, what books you buy, whether you \nhave allergies, and what your credit rating is. These strangers may not \ndo anything bad with the information, but they know all about you. I \nthink privacy is a value per se. Our founding fathers recognized it, \nand so too do most Americans.\n  ``Liberty in the constitutional sense,'' wrote Justice William O. \nDouglas, ``must mean more than freedom from unlawful governmental \nrestraint; it must include privacy as well, if it is to be a repository \nof freedom. The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all \nfreedom.''\n  Recent surveys indicate that the American public is increasingly \nuneasy about the degradation of their privacy. In a recent Business \nWeek poll, 92 percent of Internet users expressed discomfort about Web \nsites sharing personal information with other sites. Meanwhile, an FTC \nreport issued yesterday indicated that only 42 percent of the most \npopular Internet sites comply with the four key fair information \npractices--notice about what data is collected, consumer choice about \nwhether the data will be shared with third-parties, consumer access to \nthe data, and security regarding the transmission of data.\n  We must be vigilant that our privacy does not become a commodity to \nbe bought and sold.\n  I would also like to point out one area of privacy protection that I \nhave been deeply interested in. Last November, I introduced the \nTelephone Call Privacy Act. My bill would prevent telecommunications \ncompanies from using an individual's personal phone call records \nwithout their consent. Most Americans would be stunned to learn that \nthe law does not protect them from having their phone records sold to \nthird parties. Imagine getting a call one night--during dinner--and \nhaving a telemarketer try to sell you membership in a travel club \nbecause your phone calling patterns show frequent calls overseas. My \nlegislation would prevent this from occurring without the individuals's \npermission.\n  This measure we introduce today also contains a provision relating to \ntelephone privacy. It differs in at least one key respect from the \nlegislation I previously introduced, but my hope is that as we discuss \nthis issue over time, the differences will be resolved.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking Senators Hollings and \nLeahy for their leadership on this vital issue. Senator Hollings has \ncrafted the comprehensive and thoughtful proposal that we introduce \ntoday. Senator Leahy has led a coalition of Senators interested in this \nissue. I look forward to working with them and my other colleagues in \npassing this measure.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the information highway began just a few \nyears ago as a footpath and is now an unlimited lane expressway with no \nrush hour. People can now use the Internet to shop at virtual stores \nlocated thousands of miles away, find turn-by-turn directions to far \naway destinations and journey to hamlets, cities and states across the \ncountry--and indeed around the world--without ever leaving home.\n  While the virtual world is available to us with a few key strokes and \nmouse clicks, there is one area of the Internet that many are finding \ntroublesome. It is the collection and use of personnel data. All too \noften web surfers are providing personal information about themselves \nat the websites they visit, without their knowledge and consent. There \nis so much information being collected every day that it would take a \nbuilding the size of the Library of Congress to store it all in. That \nis a lot of information, much of which is very personal and I believe \nit must be kept that way.\n  Concern about one's privacy on the Internet is keeping people from \nfully enjoying this marvelous technology. According to a recent survey \nby the Center for Democracy & Technology, consumers' most pressing \nprivacy issues are the sale of personal information and tracking \npeople's use of the Web. In another recent survey, 66.7 percent of \nonline ``window shoppers'' state that assurances of privacy will be the \nbasis for their making online purchases. These surveys make the same \npoint that was made when credit cards were first introduced to the \nAmerican public. Back then, credit cards did not initially enjoy \nwidespread usage because of a fear that others could misuse the card. \nFrom these studies' findings it can be reasoned that the Internet is \nexperiencing the same effects because of privacy concerns. These \nconcerns are translating into lost opportunity, for consumers as well \nas electronic businesses.\n  Most of the Dot Com companies doing business over the Internet today \nare very cognizant of the fact that privacy is a major concern for \ntheir customers. Many of these firms allow visitors to their web site \nto ``opt out,'' or elect not to provide data they consider private and \ndo not wish to give. A Federal Trade Commission May 2000 Report to \nCongress found that 92 percent of a random sampling of websites were \ncollecting great amounts of personal information from consumers and \nonly 14% disclosed anything about how the information would be used. \nMore interesting in this report was the finding that a mere 41% of the \nrandomly selected websites notified the visitor of their information \npractices and offered the visitor choices on how their personal \nidentifying information would be used. These report findings seem to \nsuggest that industry efforts by themselves are not sufficient to \ncontrol the gathering and dissemination of personal data.\n  There are some Dot Coms that are not concerned about the privacy of \ntheir customers. These firms are successfully collecting enormous \namounts of data about a person and in turn sell it to others or use it \nto intensify the advertising aimed at that person. At one website \nvisit, a company can collect some very interesting facts about the \nperson who is on the other end. While surfing the web the other day, I \nhit on a website that was designed to provide me with information about \nmy PC. The report the site provided opened my eyes about the types of \ninformation that could be obtained from a website visitor in less one \nminute. In this small amount of time it could tell what other sites I \nhad visited, what sites I would likely visit in the future, what plug-\nins are installed on my PC, how my domain is configured and a whole lot \nmore information that I did not understand. Many consider this type of \ntracking capability akin to stalking. I believe that the information \nthat can be collected by website administrators can create problems for \npeople through a violation of trust and an invasion of privacy. Novice \nInternet users are generally unaware, as I was until visiting this \nsite, of the extent of the information being collected on them. Even \nthose who are aware of the capabilities of firms to collect private \ndata are frightened by what can happen with the information once it is \ncollected.\n  I am proud to be cosponsoring the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of \n2000 that was introduced today by Senator Hollings. This Act will \nlegitimize the practices currently being used by many reputable firms \nwho are collecting private data. Does it seem unreasonable that firms \ncollecting private data should notify consumers of the firm's \ninformation practices, offer the consumer choices on how the personal \ninformation will be used, allow consumers to access the information \nthat is collected on them and require the firms to take reasonable \nsteps to protect the security of the information that is collected? I \nthink not. Firms like Georgia-based VerticalOne are already performing \nunder standards very similar to these. I believe that all firms should \nbe held to the same standard and that a level playing field should be \nestablished for every firm that is collecting data. Taking these \nactions will translate into greater consumer confidence in the \nInternet.\n  Increasing the level of protection for private information to a level \nthat the people of our nation can live with should be a welcome relief \nto those firms already providing fair privacy treatment of their site \nvisitors. This Act certainly will be a relief to the people who are \nvisiting their sites.\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\nPassing this Consumer Privacy Protection Act will help prevent \nconfusion by establishing a common set of standards for all firms to \nfollow and all Americans to enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2607. A bill to promote pain management and palliative care \nwithout permitting assisted suicide euthanasia, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       Pain Relief Promotion Act\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich was actually authored by Senators Nickles and Hatch, and which \nthey have entitled the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' Their bill which \nI am now introducing is identical to H.R. 2260 as reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee on April 27, 2000, as amended. Today, it has been \nreferred by the Senate Parliamentarian to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions (HELP).\n  While I remain steadfastly opposed to the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act \nof 2000,'' I am introducing this bill for one reason: to call the \nSenate's attention to the fact that a far-reaching health policy bill--\nwhich many experts believe has the potential to sentence millions of \nsick and dying patients across the nation to needless pain and \nsuffering--was mistakenly referred to a committee with insufficient \nhealth policy resources and no health policy jurisdiction. It is that \nbill which the Judiciary Committee reported and which, without \nconsideration by the committee with health expertise, the Republican \nleadership wants to bring to the floor. The unintended consequence of \nthis could be the tragic decline of the quality of pain care across our \nnation.\n  Some historical context might help my colleagues and their staff \nbetter understand how the Senate finds itself in this unfortunate \nsituation, and the important issues that are at stake. On two separate \noccasions, the State of Oregon passed a ballot measure that would allow \nterminally ill persons, with less than six months left to live, to \nobtain a physician-assisted suicide if they met a variety of safeguard \nrequirements. As a private citizen, I voted twice with the minority of \nmy state in opposition to that measure.\n  In response to Oregon's vote, several of our congressional \ncolleagues, including Senator Nickles, Senator Lieberman, and \nCongressman Henry Hyde, promptly undertook legislative and other \nefforts to overturn Oregon's law. I do not, for the purposes of today, \ndebate the merits of the Oregon law, or the merits of physician-\nassisted suicide, generally.\n  The original ``Pain Relief Promotion Act,'' S. 1272, was introduced \nin the Senate by Senator Nickles, and referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) on June 23, 1999. That \ncommittee held one inconclusive hearing on October 13, 1999, at which \ntime it was reported that Senators on both sides of the aisle wished to \ninvestigate the matter more thoroughly before acting on the \nlegislation.\n  Then, on November 19, 1999, Bob Dove, the Senate Parliamentarian, \nmade what he termed ``a mistake'' when he referred H.R. 2260-- the \nvirtually identical House-passed version of the ``Pain Relief Promotion \nAct''--to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Over the course of my service \nin the Senate, I have come to know Mr. Dove to be a man of integrity \nand fairness, and one of the most dedicated and enduring public \nservants in Washington, D.C. When he discovered his mistake, to his \ngreat credit, Mr. Dove did something all-too-rare in this town; he \nsimply acknowledged his error. According to an article by the \nAssociated Press on December 7, 1999, Mr. Dove stated plainly that he \nhad mistakenly referred the bill to the Judiciary Committee, instead of \nthe HELP Committee.\n  Lord knows I've made a few mistakes in my day, so I want to make \nclear that I harbor nothing but respect for Mr. Dove, and that I do not \nfor one second question Mr. Dove's motives. But the mistake made on \nNovember 19, 1999, if left uncorrected, threatens unspeakably negative \nand long-lasting consequences for the future of health care in this \nnation.\n  The jurisdiction of the HELP Committee over the ``Pain Relief \nPromotion Act'' is clear. The Senate Manual describes the jurisdiction \nof this committee as including ``measures relating to education, labor, \nhealth, and public welfare''. The Senate Manual also describes the HELP \nCommittee as having jurisdiction over aging, biomedical research and \ndevelopment, handicapped individuals, occupational safety and health, \nand public health.\n  According to the Senate Manual, the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee includes bankruptcy, mutiny, espionage, counterfeiting, civil \nliberties, constitutional amendments, federal courts and judges, \ngovernment information, holidays and celebrations, immigration and \nnaturalization, interstate compacts generally, judicial proceedings, \nlocal courts in territories and possessions, measures relating to \nclaims against the United States, national penitentiaries, patent \noffice, patents, copyrights trademarks, protection of trade and \ncommerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies, revision and \ncodification of the statutes of the United States, and state and \nterritorial boundary lines.\n  The committee jurisdiction is not a close call, in this case. As the \nSenate's leading expert on jurisdiction has now demonstrated, this bill \nis fundamentally an issue of medical practice, which clearly is within \nthe jurisdiction of the HELP Committee.\n  Congress has heard conflicting messages from respected medical \nexperts on both sides of this debate about whether the ``Pain Relief \nPromotion Act'' may, in fact, have a chilling effect on physicians' \npain management, thus actually increasing suffering at the end of life. \nUnder the legislation, federal, state, and local law enforcement could \nreceive training to begin scrutinizing physicians' end-of-life care. \nMany believe that the legislation sends the wrong signal to physicians \nand others caring for those who are dying, noting the disparity between \nthe $5 million allotted for training in palliative care and the $80 \nmillion potentially available for law enforcement activities.\n  In addition, there is considerable concern that this legislation puts \ninto statute perceptions about pain medication that the scientific \nworld has been trying to change. Physicians often believe that the \naggressive use of certain pain medications, such as morphine, will \nhasten death. Recent scientific studies show this is not the case. Dr. \nKathleen M. Foley, Attending Neurologist in the Pain and Palliative \nCare Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Professor of \nNeurology, Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology at the Cornell \nUniversity, had this to say about the Nickles-Hatch legislation, ``In \nshort, the underpinnings of this legislation are not based on \nscientific evidence. It would be unwise to institutionalize the myth \ninto law that pain medications hasten death.''\n  Renowned medical ethicist, and Director of the Center for Bioethics \nat the University of Pennsylvania, Arthur L. Caplan, Ph.D., also \nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25, 2000. He \ntestified that: ``Doctors and nurses may not always fully understand \nwhat the law permits or does not, but when the issue requires an \nassessment of intent in an area as fraught with nuances and pitfalls as \nend of life care then I believe that this legislation will scare many \ndoctors and nurses and administrators into inaction in the face of \npain.''\n  Dr. Scott Fishman, the Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine and \nAssociate Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of California \nDavis School of Medicine wrote of the Hatch substitute: ``It is ironic \nthat the `Hatch substitute', which seeks to prevent physician assisted \nsuicide, will ultimately impair one of the truly effective counters to \nphysician assisted suicide, which is swift and effective pain \nmedicine.''\n  Dr. Foley, who also assisted the Institute of Medicine committee that \nwrote the report ``Approaching Death,'' further testified that, ``The \nPain Relief Promotion Act, by expanding the authority of the Controlled \nSubstances Act, will disturb the balance that we have worked so hard to \ncreate. Physician surveys by the New York State Department of Health \nhave shown that a strict regulatory environment negatively impacts \nphysician prescribing practices and leads them to intentionally \nundertreat patients with pain\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nbecause of concern of regulatory oversight.''\n  The New England Journal of Medicine editorialized against these \nlegislative approaches to overturning Oregon's law out of concern for \nits impacts on pain management nationwide, saying: ``Many doctors are \nconcerned about the scrutiny they invite when they prescribe or \nadminister controlled substances and they are hypersensitive to `drug-\nseeking behavior' in patients. Patients, as well as doctors, often have \nexaggerated fears of addiction and the side effects of narcotics. \nCongress could make this bad situation worse.''\n  It is worth noting that many people and organizations with expertise \nin pain management and palliative care are both opposed to physician \nassisted suicide and opposed to the Nickles-Hatch bill. There are over \nthirty organizations representing doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and \npatients who oppose the legislation, including: American Academy of \nFamily Physicians; American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, \nAmerican Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians; American Geriatrics \nSociety; American Nurses Association; American Pain Foundation; \nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association; American Society for Action on \nPain; American Society of Health-System Pharmacists; American Society \nof Pain Management Nurses; College on Problems of Drug Dependence; \nHospice and Palliative Nurses Association; National Foundation for the \nTreatment of Pain; Oncology Nursing Society; Society of General \nInternal Medicine; Triumph over Pain Foundation; California Medical \nAssociation; Massachusetts Medical Society; North Carolina Medical \nSociety; Oregon Medical Association; Rhode Island Medical Association; \nSan Francisco Medical Society; Indiana State Hospice and Palliative \nCare Association; Hospice Federation of Massachusetts; Kansas \nAssociation of Hospices; Maine Hospice Council; Maine Consortium of \nPalliative Care and Hospice; Missouri Hospice and Palliative Care \nAssociation; New Hampshire State Hospice Organization; New Jersey \nHospice and Palliative Care Organization; New York State Hospice \nOrganization; and, Oregon Hospice Association.\n  Physician-assisted suicide is not a cry for help from people \nexperiencing the failure of patents, copyrights and trademarks. \nPhysician-assisted suicide is a cry for help from people who, in many \ncases, are experiencing a failure in the health system. And those \nfailures occur across our nation; not just in Oregon. In one study \nreported in the August 12, 1998, issue of JAMA, over 15 percent of \noncologists admitted to participating in physician-assisted suicide or \neuthanasia. The February 1997 New England Journal of Medicine published \na report finding that 53 percent of physicians in a large, San \nFrancisco-based AIDS treatment consortium admitted assisting in a \nsuicide at least once. Personally, I am troubled and saddened that so \nmany of our loved ones are so dissatisfied with their end-of-life \noptions that they seek physician-assisted suicide, instead.\n  Whether or not this Congress decides to overturn Oregon's law, I \nbelieve it is critical that whatever we do must result in a reduced \ndemand for physician-assisted suicide, not only in Oregon, but across \nour nation. Many reputable experts believe the ``Pain Relief Promotion \nAct'' will cause physicians--far beyond Oregon's borders--to provide \nless aggressive pain care to their suffering and dying patients. If \nthis occurs, not only will millions of our elderly and dying \nconstituents suffer needlessly, we may unwittingly increase the demand \nfor suicide at the end of life.\n  I urge my colleagues, regardless of where they stand on the issue of \nOregon's law, to join with me in supporting the restoration of the HELP \nCommittee's jurisdiction. It would be unconscionable for the Senate to \nfail to correct an honest mistake that could contribute to a \ndevastatingly significant change in health policy. With so much at \nstake, shouldn't we follow the regular order of the Senate? Shouldn't \nwe insist that the Senate's best qualified health policy experts fully \nconsider the complex policy implications before taking such an \nextraordinary risk for our constituents, our friends, and our families?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain expenses of rural letter carriers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      legislation regarding the taxation of rural letter carriers\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service provides \na vital and important communication link for the Nation and the \ncitizens of my state of Iowa. Rural Letter Carriers play a special role \nand have a proud history as an important link in assuring the delivery \nof our mail. Rural Carriers first delivered the mail with their own \nhorses and buggies, later with their own motorcycles, and now in their \nown vehicles. They are responsible for maintenance and operation of \ntheir vehicles in all types of weather and road conditions. In the \nwinter, snow and ice is their enemy, while in the spring, the melting \nsnow and ice causes potholes and washboard roads. In spite of these \nquite adverse conditions, rural letter carriers daily drive over 3 \nmillion miles and serve 24 million American families on over 66,000 \nroutes.\n  Although the mission of rural carriers has not changed since the \nhorse and buggy days, the amount of mail they deliver has, as the \nNation's mail volume has continued to increase throughout the years, \nthe Postal Service is now delivering more than 200 billion pieces of \nmail a year. The average carrier delivers about 2,300 pieces of mail a \nday to about 500 addresses. Most recently, e-commerce has changed the \ntype of mail rural carriers deliver. This fact was confirmed in a \nrecent GAO study entitled ``U.S. Postal Service: Challenges to \nSustaining Performance Improvements Remain Formidable on the Brink of \nthe 21st Century,'' dated October 21, 1999. As this report explains, \nthe Postal Service expects declines in its core business, which is \nessentially letter mail, in the coming years. The growth of e-mail on \nthe Internet, electronic communications, and electronic commerce has \nthe potential to substantially affect the Postal Service's mail volume. \nFirst-Class mail has always been the bread and butter of the Postal \nService's revenue, but the amount of revenue from First-Class letters \nwill decline in the next few years. However, e-commerce is providing \nthe Postal Service with another opportunity to increase another part of\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\nits business. That's because what individuals and companies order over \nthe Internet must be delivered, sometimes by the Postal Service and \noften by rural carriers. Currently, the Postal Service has about 33% \npercent of the parcel business. Carriers are now delivering larger \nvolumes of business mail, parcels, and priority mail packages. But, \nmore parcel business will mean more cargo capacity will be necessary in \npostal delivery vehicles, especially in those owned and operated by \nrural letter carriers.\n  When delivering greeting cards or bills, or packages ordered over the \nInternet, Rural Letter Carriers use vehicles they currently purchase, \noperate and maintain. In exchange, they receive a reimbursement from \nthe Postal Service. This reimbursement is called an Equipment \nMaintenance Allowance (EMA). Congress recognizes that providing a \npersonal vehicle to deliver the U.S. Mail is not typical vehicle use. \nSo, when a rural carrier is ready to sell such a vehicle, it's going to \nhave little trade-in value because of the typically high mileage, \nextraordinary wear and tear, and the fact that it is probably right-\nhand drive. Therefore, Congress intended to exempt the EMA allowance \nfrom taxation in 1988 through a specific provision for rural mail \ncarriers in the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. That \nprovision allowed an employee of the U.S. Postal Service who was \ninvolved in the collection and delivery of mail on a rural route, to \ncompute their business use mileage deduction as 150% percent of the \nstandard mileage rate for all business use mileage. As an alternative, \nrural carrier taxpayers could elect to utilize the actual expense \nmethod (business portion of actual operation and maintenance of the \nvehicle, plus depreciation). If EMA exceeded the allowable vehicle \nexpense deductions, the excess was subject to tax. If EMA fell short of \nthe allowable vehicle expenses, a deduction was allowed only to the \nextent that the sum of the shortfall and all other miscellaneous \nitemized deductions exceeded two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted \ngross income.\n  The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 further simplified the tax returns \nof rural letter carriers. This act permits the EMA income and expenses \n``to wash,'' so that neither income nor expenses would have to be \nreported on a rural letter carrier's return. That simplified taxes for \napproximately 120,000 taxpayers, but the provision eliminated the \noption of filing the actual expense method for employee business \nvehicle expenses.\n  The lack of this option, combined with the dramatic changes the \nInternet has and will have on the mail, specifically on rural carriers \nand their vehicles, is a problem I believe Congress can and must \naddress.\n  The mail mix is changing and already Postal Service management has, \nunderstandably, encouraged rural carriers to purchase larger right-hand \ndrive vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), to handle the \nincrease in parcel loads. Large SUVs are much more expensive than \ntraditional vehicles, so without the ability to use the actual expense \nmethod and depreciation, rural carriers must use their salaries to \ncover vehicle expenses. Additionally, the Postal Service has placed \n11,000 postal vehicles on rural routes, which means those carriers \nreceive no EMA.\n  These developments have created a situation that is contrary to the \nhistorical congressional intent of using reimbursement to fund the \ngovernment service of delivering mail, and also has created an \ninequitable tax situation for rural carriers. If actual business \nexpenses exceed the EMA, a deduction for those expenses should be \nallowed. To correct this inequity, I am introducing a bill today, along \nwith Senator Roth, that would reinstate the ability of a rural letter \ncarrier to choose between using the actual expense method for computing \nthe deduction allowable for business use of a vehicle, or using the \ncurrent practice of deducting the reimbursed EMA expenses.\n  Rural carriers perform a necessary and valuable service and face many \nchanges and challenges in this new Internet era. Let us make sure that \nthese public servants receive fair and equitable tax treatment as they \nperform their essential role in fulfilling the Postal Service's mandate \nof binding the Nation together.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Roth and myself in supporting \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 2609. A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to enhance the \nfunds available for grants to States for fish and wildlife conservation \nprojects, and to increase opportunities for recreational hunting, bow \nhunting, trapping, archery, and fishing, by eliminating chances for \nwaste, fraud, abuse, maladministration, and unauthorized expenditures \nfor administration and implementation of those acts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  THE WILDLIFE AND SPORT FISH RESTORATION PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation along with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, that \nwill eliminate government waste, conserve wildlife, and provide hunter \nsafety opportunities.\n  We are all familiar with the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson \nfunds which impose an excise tax on firearms, archery equipment, and \nfishing equipment to conserve wildlife and provide funds to states for \nhunter safety programs. These funds were created decades ago with the \nsupport of both the sportsmen who pay the tax and the states who \nadminister the projects.\n  The federal government collects the tax, which amounts to around \nhalf-a-billion dollars a year, and is authorized to withhold a \npercentage of the funds for administration of the program. This is how \nit should be. However, thanks to the thorough oversight of the program \nby Mr. Young of Alaska, Chairman of the House Committee on Resources, \nit was uncovered that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency \ncharged with administering the program, abused the vagueness of the law \nin exactly what constituted an administrative expense.\n  Under current law, the Service is authorized to withhold \napproximately $32 million a year to administer the program and, quite \nfrankly, the law leaves it up to the Service as to what is an \nappropriate administrative expense. Mr. Young discovered that the \nService was spending this money on expenses that were outside the \nspirit of the law. These tax dollars paid by hunters and fishermen were \nbeing used for everything from foreign travel to grants to anti-hunting \ngroups to endangered species programs that work against the interests \nof hunters. In addition, they created unauthorized grant programs, some \nof which have merit and are authorized in our bill, but all of which \nwere created outside of the law.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to rehash all of the hearings that were \nheld in the House on this issue. What I will say is that it was an \nembarrassment to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and, not until all \nbut two members of the House supported legislation to fix the problems \ndid the Service begin cooperating with Congress and admitting there \nwere actions at the Service which they are not proud of.\n  In response to the waste, fraud, and abuse uncovered by his \nCommittee, Mr. Young introduced legislation to fix the problems. His \nlegislation caps the administrative expenses at around half of the \ncurrently authorized level, sets in stone what is an authorized \nadministrative expense, provides some specific money for hunter safety, \nauthorizes a multi-state grant program, and creates a position of \nAssistant Director for Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs. \nHis bill, H.R. 3671, passed the House on April 5th with an overwhelming \nvote of 423-2.\n  Mr. President, Senator Crapo and I have taken the lead of the House \nby using their bill as a model and simply strengthened it for the \nsportsmen who pay the excise tax. By providing more money, $15 million \nper year, for hunter safety programs and providing a total of $7 \nmillion per year, $2 million more than the House, for the Multi-State \nConservation Grant Program, this bill ensures that the money that \nsportsmen pay for wildlife conservation and hunter safety is actually \nused for those purposes.\n  Mr. President, this is a win-win for everyone--for wildlife and for \ntax payers--and I urge my colleagues to support it and work for its \nquick enactment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wildlife and\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nSport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000 with my \ncolleague, Senator Larry Craig, to bring accountability back to the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's administration of the Pittman-\nRobertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish \nRestoration Act. For years, the Fish and Wildlife Service has \napparently misused millions of dollars from these accounts, betraying \nthe trust of America's sportsman.\n  Congressional investigations and a General Accounting Office audit of \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have revealed that, contrary to \nexisting law, money has been routinely diverted to administrative slush \nfunds, withheld from states, and generally misused for purposes \nunrelated to either sportfishing or wildlife conservation. In addition, \nthe GAO called the Division of Federal Aid, ``if not the worst, one of \nthe worst-managed programs we have encountered.'' As an avid \noutdoorsman, I am particularly disturbed by this abuse.\n  Since 1937, sportsman have willingly paid an excise tax on hunting, \nand later fishing, equipment. These hunters, shooters, and anglers paid \nthis tax with the understanding that the money would be used for state \nfish and wildlife conservation programs. This partnership has been \ninstrumental in providing generations of Americans a quality \nrecreational experience. Through the years, it has been an experience \nthat I have enjoyed with both my parents and my children.\n  The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program, commonly known as \nthe Pittman-Robertson Act, provides funding for wildlife habitat \nrestoration and improvement, wildlife management research, hunter \neducation, and public target ranges. Funds for the Pittman-Robertson \nAct are derived from an 11 percent excise tax on sporting arms, \nammunition, and archery equipment, and a 10 percent tax on handguns.\n  The Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program, often referred to \nas the Dingell-Johnson and Wallop-Breaux Acts, is funded through a 10 \npercent excise tax on fishing equipment and a 3 percent tax on electric \ntrolling motors, sonor fish finders, taxes on motorboat fuels, and \nimport duties on fishing and pleasure boats. Through the cost \nreimbursement program, states use these funds to enhance sport fishing. \nThese enhancements come through fish stocking, acquisition and \nimprovement of habitat educational programs, and development of \nrecreational facilities that directly support sport fishing, such as \nboat ramps and fishing piers.\n  Under the law, revenue from these taxes are expected to be returned \nto state and local fish and game organizations for programs to manage \nand enhance sport fish and game species. The Fish and Wildlife Service \nis supposed to deduct only the cost of administering the programs, up \nto 8 percent of Pittman-Robertson revenues and 6 percent of Dingell-\nJohnson funds.\n  Unfortunatly, these funds have been misdirected and misused by the \nFish and Wildlife Service. Through their investment in the Federal Aid \nprogram, America's hunters and fisherman have proved themselves to be \nour nation's true conservationists. Through its misuse of these funds, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service has proven itself to be a negligent \nsteward of the public trust.\n  The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act, \nwould restore accountability to the administration of Federal Aid \nfunds. By limiting the amount of revenue that may be used on \nadministration, and the accounts that these funds may be used for, this \nbill will reign in the opportunities for misuse by the Fish and \nWildlife Service. Our legislation will also make legal a multi-state \nconservation grant program to allow streamlined funding for projects \nthat involve multiple states. Additionally, the bill will increase \nfunding for firearm and bow hunter safety programs.\n  This bill seeks to re-establish a trust between the hunters and \nanglers who pay the excise taxes and the federal government. It is an \nopportunity to repair a system that has been lauded as one of the \nnation's most successful conservation efforts. I hope my colleagues \nwill join with us in a bipartisan effort to restore accountability and \nresponsibility to the Federal Aid programs and the Fish and Wildlife \nService.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 2610. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of items and services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the medicare fairness in reimbursement act of 2000\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nmy colleagues, Senator Thomas, Senator Craig and Senator Feingold, to \nintroduce the ``Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act of 2000.'' This \nlegislation addresses the terrible unfairness that exists today in \nMedicare payment policy.\n  According to the latest Medicare figures, Medicare payments per \nbeneficiary by state of residence ranged from slightly more than $3000 \nto well in excess of $6500. For example, in Iowa, the average Medicare \npayment was $3456, nearly a third less than the national average of \n$5,034. In Wyoming the situation is worse, with an average payment of \napproximately $3200.\n  This payment inequity is unfair to seniors in Iowa and Wyoming, and \nit is unfair to rural beneficiaries everywhere. The citizens of my home \nstate pay the same Medicare payroll taxes required of every American \ntaxpayer. Yet they get dramatically less in return.\n  Ironically, rural citizens are not penalized by the Medicare program \nbecause they practice inefficient, high cost medicine. The opposite is \ntrue. The low payment rates received in rural areas are in large part a \nresult of their historic conservative practice of health care. In the \nearly 1980's rural states' lower-than-average costs were used to \njustify lower payment rates, and Medicare's payment policies since that \ntime have only widened the gap between low- and high-cost states.\n  Mr. President, late last year I wrote to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) and I asked them a simple question. I asked their \nactuaries to estimate for me the impact on Medicare's Trust Funds, \nwhich at that time were scheduled to go bankrupt in 2015, if average \nMedicare payments to all states were the same as Iowa's.\n  I've always thought Iowa's reimbursement level was low. But HCFA's \nanswer suprised even me. The actuaries found that if all states were \nreimbursed at the same rate as Iowa, Medicare would be solvent for at \nleast 75 years, 60 years beyond their projections.\n  I'm not suggesting that all states should be brought down to Iowa's \nlevel. But there is no question that the long-term solvency of the \nMedicare program is of serious national concern. And as Congress \nconsiders ways to strengthen and modernize the Medicare program, the \nissue of unfair payment rates needs to be on the table.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the ``Medicare Fairness in \nReimbursement Act of 2000'' sends a clear signal. These historic wrongs \nmust be righted. Before any Medicare reform bill passes Congress, I \nintend to make sure that rural beneficiaries are guaranteed access to \nthe same quality health care services of their urban counterparts.\n  Mr. President, our legislation does the following:\n  Requires HCFA to improve the fairness of payments under the original \nMedicare fee-for-services system by adjusting payments for items and \nservices so that no state is greater than 105% above the national \naverage, and no state is below 95% of the national average. An \nestimated 30 states would benefit under these adjustments, based on \n1998 data from the Ways and Means Green Book.\n  Requires improvements in the collection and use of hospital wage data \nby occupational category. Experts agree the current system of \ncollecting hospital data ``lowballs'' the payment received by rural \nhospitals. Large urban hospitals are overcompensated today because they \nhave a much higher number of highly-paid specialists and sub-\nspecialists on their staff, while small rural hospitals tend to have \nmore generalists, who aren't as highly paid.\n  Ensures that beneficiaries are held harmless in both payments and \nservices.\n  Ensures budget neutrality.\n  Automatically results in adjustment of Medicare managed care payments \nto reflect increased equity between rural and urban areas.\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\n  This legislation simply ensures basic fairness in our Medicare \npayment policy. I urge my Senate colleagues, no matter what state \nyou're from, to consider our bill and join us in supporting this common \nsense Medicare reform. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nin introducing the ``Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act of 2000,'' \nwhich specifically addresses the current payment inequities of the \nMedicare program. I am pleased to have worked with Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nCraig, and Mr. Feingold in crafting this bill for rural Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices to establish a payment system for Medicare's Part A and B fee-\nfor-service programs that guarantees each state's average per \nbeneficiary amount is within 95 percent and 105 percent of the national \naverage. The reason for this seemingly drastic action is because the \ncurrent payment disparities between states is unacceptable. According \nto 1998 data, Wyoming's per beneficiary spending is 36 percent below \nthe national average of $5,000 while some other states receive almost \n36 percent above the national average.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there are some legitimate cost \ndifferences among states in providing health care services to our \nseniors, but I do not believe there is justification for an inequity of \nthis size. Seniors in Wyoming and other rural states have paid the same \nMedicare tax over the years as beneficiaries residing in urban states. \nHowever, the current Medicare payment system does not reflect the equal \ncontributions made by all seniors.\n  The other section of this legislation requires the Secretary to make \nadjustments to the hospital wage index under the prospective payment \nsystem after developing and implementing improved methods for \ncollecting the necessary hospital employee data.\n  I believe this legislation is an important piece of the overall \nMedicare reform puzzle. I feel strongly that any final legislation \napproved by the Senate to ensure Medicare is financially stable for \ncurrent and future generations must also ensure all beneficiaries are \ntreated fairly and equitably. Mr. President, the current system is not \nonly far from long-term solvency, it is far from fair, especially to \nseniors living in rural states such as Wyoming.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 2611. A bill to provide trade adjustment assistance for certain \nworkers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will close a loop hole in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program \nfor employees of the Copper Range Company, formerly the White Pine \nCompany, a copper mine in White Pine, Michigan. My legislation will \nextend TAA benefits to those employees who were responsible for \nperforming the environmental remediation that was required to close the \nfacility.\n  My legislation is needed because these employees were unfairly \nexcluded from the TAA certification that applied to other workers at \nthe facility simply because the service they provide, environmental \nremediation, does not technically support the production of the article \nthat the mine produced: copper. My legislation simply extends TAA \ncoverage to those few workers\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nwho remained at the facility with responsibility for the environmental \nremediation necessary to close the facility.\n  The Copper Range Company received NAFTA-TAA certification in 1995 \nwhen it began closing down. The company was still in the process of \nclosing down in 1997 and received re-certification at that time. As of \nthe end of 1999, there were still workers at the plant engaged in the \nfinal stages of closing down. Their work consisted of environmental \nremediation. When the plant applied for re-certification in September \nfor purposes of covering these workers, the Department of Labor (DoL) \ndenied the request because DoL said that the remaining workers were not \nperforming a job ending because of transplant to another NAFTA country; \nthey were performing environmental remediation, not production of \ncopper.\n  Mr. President, this is an unfair catch-22 situation that must be \nrectified legislatively. The legislation I am introducing today would \nprovide those few employees involved in the final stages of closing \ndown the mine with the same TAA benefits their co-workers received. The \ntotal number of workers at issue is small and my legislative fix is \nstraightforward. I hope this legislation can be adopted quickly so that \nthese Michigan workers who have fallen through the cracks can access \nthe TAA benefits they rightfully deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in its entirety in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Certification of Eligibility for Workers Required for \n     Closure of Facility.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any decision by the Secretary of Labor denying \n     certification or eligibility for certification for adjustment \n     assistance under title II of the Trade Act of 1974, a \n     qualified worker described in paragraph (2) shall be \n     certified by the Secretary as eligible to apply for \n     adjustment assistance under such title II.\n       (2) Qualified worker.--For purposes of this subsection, a \n     ``qualified worker'' means a worker who--\n       (A) was determined to be covered under Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance Certification TA-W-31,402; and\n       (B) was necessary for the environmental remediation or \n     closure of a copper mining facility.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Biden, \n        and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 2612. A bill to combat Ecstasy trafficking, distribution, and \nabuse in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n               the ecstasy anti-proliferation act of 2000\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my \ncolleagues, to introduce the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000--\nlegislation to combat the recent rise in trafficking, distribution and \nabuse of MDMA, a drug commonly known as Ecstasy.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy's Year 2000 Annual Report \non the National Drug Control Strategy clearly states that the use of \nEcstasy is on the rise in the United States, particularly among \nteenagers and young professionals. My state of Florida has been \nparticularly hard hit by this plague. Ecstasy is customarily sold and \nconsumed at ``raves,'' which are semi-clandestine, all-night parties \nand concerts. Young Americans are lulled into a belief that Ecstasy, \nand other designer drugs are ``safe'' ways to get high, escape reality, \nand enhance intimacy in personal relationships. The drug traffickers \nmake their living off of perpetuating and exploiting this myth.\n  Mr. President, I want to be perfectly clear in stating that Ecstasy \nis an extremely dangerous drug. In my state alone, 189 deaths have been \nattributed to the use of club drugs in the last three years. In 33 of \nthose deaths, Ecstasy was the most prevalent drug, of several, in the \nindividual's system. Seven deaths were caused by Ecstasy alone. In the \nfirst four months of this year there have already been six deaths \ndirectly attributed to Ecstasy. This drug is a definite killer.\n  Numerous data also reflect the increasing availability of Ecstasy in \nmetropolitan centers and suburban communities. In a speech to the \nFederal Law Enforcement Foundation earlier this year, Customs \nCommissioner Raymond Kelly stated that in the first few months of \nfiscal year 2000, the Customs Service had already seized over four \nmillion Ecstasy tablets. He estimates that the number will grow to at \nleast eight million tablets by the end of the year which represents a \nsubstantial increase from the 500,000 tablets seized in fiscal year \n1997.\n  The lucrative nature of Ecstasy encourages its importation. \nProduction costs are as low as two to twenty-five cents per dose while \nretail prices in the U.S. range from twenty dollars to forty-five \ndollars per dose. Manufactured mostly in Europe--in nations such as The \nNetherlands, Belgium, and Spain where pill presses are not controlled \nas they are in the U.S.--Ecstasy has erased all of the old routes law \nenforcement has mapped out for the smuggling of traditional drugs.\n  Under current federal sentencing guidelines, one gram of Ecstasy is \nequivalent to only 35 grams of marijuana. In contrast, one gram of \nmethamphetamine is equivalent to two kilograms of marijuana. This \nresults in relatively short periods of incarceration for individuals \nsentenced for Ecstasy-related crimes. When the potential profitability \nof this drug is compared to the potential punishment, it is easy to see \nwhat makes Ecstasy extremely attractive to professional smugglers.\n  Mr. President, the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 addresses \nthis growing and disturbing problem. First, the bill increases the base \nlevel offense for Ecstasy-related crimes, making them equal to those of \nmethamphetamine. This provision also accomplishes the goal of \neffectively lowering the amount of Ecstasy required for prosecution \nunder the laws governing possession with the intent to distribute by \nsending a message to Federal prosecutors that this drug is a serious \nthreat.\n  Second, by addressing law enforcement and community education \nprograms, this bill will provide for an Ecstasy information campaign. \nThrough this campaign, our hope is that Ecstasy will soon go the way of \ncrack, which saw a dramatic reduction in the quantities present on our \nstreets after information of its unpredictable impurities and side \neffects were made known to a wide audience. By using this educational \neffort we hope to avoid future deaths like the one columnist Jack \nNewfield wrote about in saddening detail.\n  It involved an 18-year-old who died after taking Ecstasy in a club \nwhere the drug sold for $25 a tablet and water for $5 a bottle. \nNewfield speaks of how the boy tried to suck water from the club's \nbathroom tap that had been turned off so that those with drug induced \nthirst would be forced to buy the bottled water.\n  Mr. President, the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 can only \nhelp in our fight against drug abuse in the United States. We urge our \ncolleagues in the Senate to join us in this important effort by \ncosponsoring this bill.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleague, Senator Graham, to cosponsor the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation \nAct of 2000. This legislation is vital for the safety of our children \nand our nation. Around the country, Ecstasy use is exploding at an \nalarming rate from our big cities to our rural neighborhoods. According \nto Customs officials, Ecstasy is spreading faster than any drug since \ncrack cocaine. This explosion of Ecstasy smuggling has prompted Customs \nto create a special task force, that focuses exclusively on the \ndesigner drug.\n  Along with my colleague Senator Graham, I believe it is important \nthat we act to stop the spread of this drug. I join with Senator Graham \nin urging our colleagues to support the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act \nof 2000, and pass this measure quickly. By enacting this important \nbill, we will get drug dealers out of the lives of our young people and \nalert the public to the dangers of Ecstasy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is a new drug on the scene--Ecstasy, \na synthetic stimulant and hallucinogen. It belongs to a group of drugs \nreferred to\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nas ``club drugs'' because they are associated with all-night dance \nparties known as ``raves.''\n  There is a widespread misconception that Ecstasy is not a dangerous \ndrug--that it is ``no big deal.'' I am here to tell you that Ecstasy is \na very big deal. The drug depletes the brain of serotonin, the chemical \nresponsible for mood, thought, and memory. Studies show that Ecstasy \nuse can reduce serotonin levels by up to 90 percent for at least two \nweeks after use and can cause brain damage.\n  If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is.\n  A few months ago we got a significant warning sign that Ecstasy use \nis becoming a real problem. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the \nFuture survey, a national survey measuring drug use among students, \nreported that while overall levels of drug use had not increased, past \nmonth use of Ecstasy among high school seniors increased more than 66 \npercent.\n  The survey showed that nearly six percent of high school seniors have \nused Ecstasy in the past year. This may sound like a small number, so \nlet me put it in perspective--it is just slightly less than the \npercentage of seniors who used cocaine and it is five times the number \nof seniors who used heroin.\n  And with the supply of Ecstasy increasing as rapidly as it is, the \nnumber of kids using this drug is only likely to increase. By April of \nthis year, the Customs Service had already seized 4 million Ecstasy \npills--greater than the total amount seized in all of 1999 and more \nthan five times the amount seized in all of 1998.\n  Though New York is the East Coast hub for this drug, it is spreading \nquickly throughout the country. Last July, in my home state of \nDelaware, law enforcement officials seized 900 Ecstasy pills in \nRehoboth Beach. There are also reports of an Ecstasy problem in Newark \namong students at the University of Delaware.\n  We need to address this problem now, before it gets any worse. That \nis why I am pleased to join Senators Graham, Grassley and Thomas to \nintroduce the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000'' today. The \nlegislation takes the steps--both in terms of law enforcement and \nprevention--to address this problem in a serious way before it gets any \nworse.\n  The legislation directs the federal Sentencing Commission to increase \nthe recommended penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or \ntrafficking Ecstasy. Though Ecstasy is a Schedule I drug--and therefore \nsubject to the most stringent federal penalties--not all Schedule I \ndrugs are treated the same in our sentencing guidelines. For example, \nselling a kilogram of marijuana is not as serious an offense as selling \na kilogram of heroin. The sentencing guidelines differentiate between \nthe severity of drugs--as they should.\n  But the current sentencing guidelines do not recognize how dangerous \nEcstasy really is.\n  Under current federal sentencing guidelines, one gram of Ecstasy is \ntreated like 35 grams of marijuana. Under the ``Ecstasy Anti-\nProliferation Act'', one gram of Ecstasy would be treated like 2 \nkilograms of marijuana. This would make the penalties for Ecstasy \nsimilar to those for methamphetamine.\n  The legislation also authorizes a major prevention campaign in \nschools, communities and over the airwaves to make sure that everyone--\nkids, adults, parents, teachers, cops, clergy, etc. --know just how \ndangerous this drug really is. We need to dispel the myth that Ecstasy \nis not a dangerous drug because, as I stated earlier, this is a \nsubstance that can cause brain damage and can even result in death. We \nneed to spread the message so that kids know the risk involved with \ntaking Ecstasy, what it can do to their bodies, their brains, their \nfutures. Adults also need to be taught about this drug--what it looks \nlike, what someone high on Ecstasy looks like, and what to do if they \ndiscover that someone they know is using it.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the United States Senate \non numerous occasions to state what I view as the most effective way to \nprevent a drug epidemic. My philosophy is simple: the best time to \ncrack down on a drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before \nthe abuse of the drug has become rampant. The advantages of doing so \nare clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most \nimportant, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the \nabuse of the drug.\n  It is clear that Ecstasy use is on the rise. Now is the time to act \nbefore Ecstasy use becomes our next drug epidemic. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this legislation and passing it quickly so \nthat we can address the escalating problem of Ecstasy use before it \ngets any worse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2614. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to provide for duty-free treatment on certain manufacturing \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   TO SUSPEND THE DUTY ON CERTAN EQUIPMENT USED IN THE MANUFACTURING \n                                INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill suspend the duties imposed on certain manufacturing equipment that \nis necessary for tire production. Currently, this equipment is imported \nfor use in the United States because there are no known American \nproducers. Therefore, suspending the duties on this equipment would not \nadversely affect domestic industries.\n  This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on tire manufacturing \nequipment required to make certain large off-road tires that fall \nbetween the sizes currently fabricated in the United States. These \ntires would be used primarily in agriculture.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on this manufacturing equipment \nwill benefit the consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing \nthese products. In addition to permitting new production in this \ncountry, these duty suspensions will allow U.S. manufacturers to \nmaintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope \nthe Senate will consider this measure expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUSPENSION OF DUTY ON CERTAIN MANUFACTURING \n                   EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subheadings 9902.84.79, 9902.84.83, \n     9902.84.85, 9902.84.87, 9902.84.89, and 9902.84.91 of the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are each \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``4011.91.50'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``4011.91'';\n       (2) by striking ``4011.99.40'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``4011.99''; and\n       (3) by striking ``86 cm'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``63.5 cm''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     apply with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from \n     warehouse for consumption, on or after the date that is 15 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2615. A bill to establish a program to promote child literacy by \nmaking books available through early learning and other child care \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                           the book stamp act\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, literacy is the foundation of \nlearning, but too many Americans today are not able to read a single \nsentence. Nearly 40 percent of the nation's children are unable to read \nat grade-level by the end of the third grade. In communities with high \nconcentrations of at-risk children, the failure rate is an astonishing \n60 percent. As a result, their entire education is likely to be \nderailed.\n  In the battle against literacy, it is not enough to reach out more \neffectively to school-aged children. We must start earlier--and reach \nchildren before they reach school. Pediatricians like Dr. Barry \nZuckerman at the Boston Medical Center have been telling us for years \nthat reading to children from birth through school age is a medical \nissue that should be raised at every well child visit, since a child's \nbrain needs this kind of stimulation to grow to its full potential. \nReading to young children in the years before age 5 has a profound \neffect on their ability\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nto learn to read. But too often the problem is that young children do \nnot have access to books appropriate to their age. A recent study found \nthat 60 percent of the kindergarten children who performed poorly in \nschool did not own a single book.\n  The Book Stamp Act that Senator Hutchison and I are introducing today \nis a step to cure that problem. Our goal is to see that all children in \nthis country have books of their own before they enter school.\n  Regardless of culture or wealth, one of the most important factors in \nthe development of literacy is home access to books. Students from \nhomes with an abundance of reading materials are substantially better \nreaders than those with few or no reading materials available.\n  But it is not enough to just dump a book into a family's home. Since \nyoung children cannot read to themselves, we must make sure that an \nadult is available who interacts with the child and will read to the \nchild.\n  In this day of two-parent working families, young children spend \nsubstantial time in child care and family care facilities, which \nprovide realistic opportunities for promoting literacy. Progress is \nalready being made on this approach. Child Care READS!, for example, is \na national communications campaign aimed at raising the awareness of \nthe importance of reading in child care settings.\n  The Book Stamp Act will make books available to children and parents \nthrough these child care and early childhood education programs.\n  The act authorizes an appropriation of $50 million a year for this \npurpose. It also creates a special postage stamp, similar to the Breast \nCancer Stamp, which will feature an early learning character, and will \nsell at a slightly higher rate than the normal 33 cents, with the \nadditional revenues designated for the Book Stamp Program.\n  The resources will be distributed through the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant to the state child care agency in each state. \nThe state agency then will allocate its funds to local child care \nresearch and referral agencies throughout the state on the basis of \nlocal need.\n  There are 610 such agencies in the country, with at least one in \nevery state. These non-profit agencies, offer referral services for \nparents seeking child care, and also provide training for child care \nworkers. The agencies will work with established book distribution \nprograms such as First Book, Reading is Fundamental, and Reach Out and \nRead to coordinate the buying of discounted books and the distribution \nof the books to children.\n  Also, to help parents and child care providers become well informed \nabout the best ways to read to children and the most effective use of \nbooks with children at various stages of development, the agencies will \nprovide training and technical assistance on these issues.\n  Our goal is to work closely with parents, children, child care \nproviders and publishers to put at least one book in the hands of every \nneedy child in America. Together, we can make significant progress in \nearly childhood literacy, and I believe we can make it quickly.\n  We know what works to combat illiteracy. We owe it to the nation's \nchildren and the nation's future to do all we can to win this battle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the accompanying letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This legislation make \n     books available in early learning/child care programs for \n     young children and their parents. Reading to young children \n     on a regular basis is a first step to ensure that they become \n     strong readers. This bill gives parents access to books to \n     make it more likely for them to read to their children. Thank \n     you for recognizing how important reading is for our youngest \n     children.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Marian Wright Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      4 To 14.Com,\n\n\n                                                     Broadway,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 23, 2000.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I sincerely commend you on your sponsoring \n     the ``Book Stamp'' legislation.\n       As the CEO of a dot-com designed to help children learn, I \n     am very aware of the ``digital divide'' that separates \n     children from wealthier families from those growing up in \n     poorer households. That disparity--that difference in \n     opportunity--doesn't begin when children start using the \n     computer and exploring the Internet. Rather, it starts much \n     earlier, when very young children should have their first \n     exposure and access exposed to books.\n       Unfortunately, far too many children--particularly children \n     from lower income families--simply do not have books to call \n     their own. They need books, lots of them, for brain \n     development, to develop the basis and ``habit'' of reading, \n     and to share in one of the true joys of childhood.\n       Ensuring that all children--particularly those under five \n     years of age--have access to good books that they can call \n     their own, is an essential ingredient of a healthy childhood. \n     This legislation will help make that a reality.\n       As Susan Roman of the ALA once pointed out, ``Books are the \n     on-ramp to the information super-highway.''\n       I commend you and Senator Hutchison for being real leaders \n     in this crusade to make all children ready to meet the \n     challenges of the 21st century.\n       Please let me know how I can help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Cohen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Association of American\n\n\n                                             Publishers, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: The American publishing industry enthusiastically \n     supports the ``Book Stamp Act'' introduced by you and Senator \n     Hutchison today. This important and timely legislation \n     acknowledges the fact that young minds need as much \n     nourishing as young bodies.\n       Every September, some 40 percent of American children who \n     start school are not literacy-ready and, for most, that \n     educational gap never closes. From a growing body of \n     research, we have begun to understand how important it is for \n     very young children to have books in their lives. At BookExpo \n     America on June 3, for the first time, a distinguished group \n     of early literacy experts, pediatricians, child-development \n     professionals and children's publishers will come together to \n     explore ways of improving access to quality books for the 13 \n     million pre-school-age children in daycare and early \n     education programs. The ``Book Stamp Act'' couldn't come at a \n     better time.\n       We congratulate you on the introduction of the ``Book Stamp \n     Act,'' and look forward to working with you to ensure its \n     passage.\n       With warmest regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia S. Schroeder.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                  Education of Young Children,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2000.\n     Hon.

One of the best predictors of \n     whether a child will function competently in school and go on \n     to contribute actively in our increasingly literate society \n     is the level to which the child progresses in reading and \n     writing. Although reading and writing abilities continue to \n     develop throughout the life span, the early childhood years--\n     from birth through age eight--are the most important period \n     for literacy development. It is for this reason that the \n     International Reading Association (IRA) and NAEYC joined \n     together to formulate a position statement regarding early \n     literacy development.\n       We are pleased that this bipartisan legislation will expand \n     young children's access to books and support parent \n     involvement in early literacy. By making books more \n     affordable and accessible to young children in Head Start, in \n     child care settings, and in their homes, we can help them not \n     only learn to read and write, but also foster and sustain \n     their interest in reading for their own enjoyment, \n     information, and communication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Adele Robinson,\n     Director of Policy Development.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Reading Is Fundamental, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: Reading Is Fundamental's Board of Directors \n     and staff urge you to support the passage of the Kennedy-\n     Hutchison Book Stamp Act to help bridge the literacy gap for \n     the nation's youngest and most at-risk children.\n       Educators, researchers and practitioners in the literacy \n     arena have increasing focused on the 0-5 age range as the key \n     to helping the nation's neediest children enter school ready \n     to read and learn. We know that focus and attention will give \n     them a far better chance at succeeding in life than many of \n     their parents and older siblings had.\n       At RIF, we have increased our focus on providing books and \n     literacy enhancing programs and services in recent years and \n     we are actively pursuing working relationships and \n     partnerships with the childcare community. We have launched a \n     pilot program to create effective training system, called \n     Care to Read for childcare providers and other early \n     childhood caregivers. That program is now ready to help these \n     caregivers provide appropriate environmental and literacy \n     enhancing experiences for children. We are anxious to engage \n     with NACCRA in working out ways to link this training with \n     the Book Stamp Act initiative and share RIF's resources to \n     help make this program effective.\n       RIF now provides books and essential literacy services to \n     nearly 1,000,000 children and we know the need is critical \n     for significant infusions of books and services to help \n     reduce illiteracy among this at-risk population. We urge your \n     strong support.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                 Richard E. Sells,\n     Senior VP and Chief Operating Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 114\n\n       Whereas over 4 million Americans served in World War I, \n     however, there is no nationally recognized symbol honoring \n     the service of such Americans;\n       Whereas in 1919, citizens of Kansas City expressed an \n     outpouring of support, raising over $2,000,000 in 2 weeks, \n     which was a fundraising accomplishment unparalleled by any \n     other city in the United States irrespective of population;\n       Whereas on November 1, 1921, the monument site was \n     dedicated marking the only time in history that the 5 Allied \n     military leaders (Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of \n     Belgium, General Armando Diaz of Italy, Marshal Ferdinand \n     Foch of France, General John J. Pershing of the United \n     States, and Admiral Lord Earl Beatty of Great Britain) were \n     together at one place;\n       Whereas during a solemn ceremony on Armistice Day in 1924, \n     President Calvin Coolidge marked the beginning of a 3-year \n     construction project by the laying of the corner-stone of the \n     Liberty Memorial;\n       Whereas the 217-foot Memorial Tower topped with 4 stone \n     ``Guardian Spirits'' representing courage, honor, patriotism, \n     and sacrifice, rises above the observation deck, making the \n     Liberty Memorial a noble tribute to all who served;\n       Whereas during a rededication of the Liberty Memorial in \n     1961, former Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower recognized the memorial as a constant reminder of \n     the sacrifices during World War I and the progress that \n     followed;\n       Whereas the Liberty Memorial is the only public museum in \n     the United States specifically dedicated to the history of \n     World War I; and\n       Whereas the Liberty Memorial is internationally known as a \n     major center of World War I remembrance: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, is recognized as a national World War I symbol, \n     honoring those who defended liberty and our country through \n     service in World War I.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to submit a \nresolution recognizing the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri as \na national World War I symbol. I am pleased that Senator Ashcroft and \nSenator Roberts are joining me as original cosponsors.\n  Fighting in the trenches in Europe, America's sons and daughters \ndefended liberty and our country through service in World War One. We \nwant to ensure that the sacrifices they made are\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\nnot forgotten. The Liberty Memorial serves as a long-standing tribute \nto their accomplishments.\n  More than 4 million Americans served in World War One, however, the \nLiberty Memorial is the only major memorial and museum honoring their \ncourage and loyalty. It is important to me that these men and women \nhave an appropriate national symbol; they deserve to be recognized and \nhonored. The Liberty Memorial serves as a constant reminder of the \npatriotism and sacrifice that the War evoked, both to the people of \nKansas City, and across the country.\n  In 1919, Kansas Citians expressed an unprecedented outpouring of \nsupport, raising $2.5 million in less than two weeks. Three years later \nthe five Allied military leaders met in Kansas City, marking the only \ntime in history all five leaders came togther at one place. The leaders \nfrom Belgium, Italy, France, Great Brittan and the United States looked \non, as the site for the Liberty Memorial was dedicated. Since that \nhistoric occasion, many other great world leaders have addressed the \npublic at the Liberty Memorial including: Presidents Calvin Coolidge, \nHarry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and William Howard Taft.\n  The Liberty Memorial opened to the public in 1926. It is an amazing \nstructure; the impressive size and design puts it in a class with \nmonuments here on the National Mall. The Memorial Tower is 217-feet-\ntall. The four Guardian Spirits: Honor, Courage, Patriotism, and \nSacrifice, encircle the top of the tower. This is a great, \ninspirational work of art that serves as an outstanding tribute to \nAmerica's sons and daughters of World War I.\n  In addition to the Memorial Tower, there is a Liberty Memorial Museum \nlocated within the complex. This museum promotes and encourages a \nbetter understanding of the sacrifices and progress made during World \nWar I. While the Memorial undergoes a major renovation project, the \nmuseum is currently closed to the public. Upon its reopening, visitors \nfrom around the world can come to Kansas City to view the finest \ncollection of World War I memorabilia in the United States. These \nfascinating displays are arranged to give visitors insight into \nAmerica's role in the First World War.\n  The Memorial's history, consistent local support and its location in \nthe Heart of America, makes the Liberty Memorial an ideal national \ntribute to all Americans who fought in World War One. I am proud to \nhave such a distinguished Memorial in my home state of Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely \nfashion so that we can properly honor the veterans of World War One \nwith a national monument, and recognize the significance of the Liberty \nMemorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4324-S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 115--PROVIDING FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF A \n   STATUE OF CHIEF WASHAKIE, PRESENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF WYOMING, FOR \n      PLACEMENT IN NATIONAL STATUARY HALL, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S.

TRANSMITTAL TO GOVERNOR OF WYOMING.\n\n       The Clerk of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the Governor of Wyoming.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise along with Senator Enzi to \nsubmit a concurrent resolution allowing for the placement of Wyoming's \nsecond statue in Statuary Hall.\n  As many individuals from Wyoming know, Chief Washakie was a true \nwarrior and statesman. Chief Washakie was born in 1798 and actively \nparticipated in the cultural and historic events that shaped the West \nbefore passing away in 1900. The value of his life experiences--which \nspan three separate centuries--still resonate in my home state today.\n  Chief Washakie, a skilled orator and charismatic figure, was widely \nknown for his ability to foresee what the future held for his people. \nAs Chief of the Shoshone tribe for fifty years, Washakie was successful \nin protecting the interests of his people in the face of westward \nexpansion. In 1868, Chief Washakie was instrumental in the signing of \nthe Fort Bridger treaty--which granted the Shoshone more than three \nmillion acres of land in the Warm Valley of the Wind on the Wind River \nreservation. His legacy lives on today as many of his descendants \ncontinue to be involved in tribal matters throughout Wyoming.\n  It is fitting that Wyoming has chosen Chief Washakie to be honored in \nour Nation's Capitol. This resolution not only speaks to his \nachievements but also commemorates the very spirit on which our great \ncountry was founded.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator Thomas to \nsubmit a resolution authorizing Congress to accept Wyoming's second \nstatue for National Statuary Hall, a statue of the great Chief of the \nEastern Shoshone Tribe, Chief Washakie. The entire nation owes Chief \nWashakie a great debt of gratitude for his assistance in allowing \nsettlers to pass over his tribe's lands during the great Western \nmigration and for advancing the cause of peace between the United \nStates and Native American nations.\n  The exact birthdate of Chief Washakie is not known, but it is \nbelieved that he was born in 1804 to a Flathead father and a Shoshone \nmother who lived in a Flathead tribe village. That village was attacked \nby the Blackfeet tribe and Washakie's father was killed in the battle. \nWashakie's mother was taken in by the Lemhi tribe of the Shoshone and \nWashakie and his sister remained with the Lemhis when his mother and \nthe rest of his family rejoined the Flatheads.\n\n  Washakie made his name as a successful warrior. He devised a large \nrattle from a dried buffalo hide that was inflated and filled with \nstones that he used to frighten the horses of rival tribes in battle. \nHe also aligned his nation with the United States and served the United \nStates Army as a scout. It was that service which earned him a funeral \nwith full military honors upon his death in 1900. He was the only \nNative American leader to be accorded such an honor.\n  Washakie united the Shoshones to battle threats presented by hostile\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\ntribes, such as the Cheyenne and the Sioux tribes. This brought him to \nthe attention of the United States Government and white men as someone \nthey could do business with. He was a friend of many of the fur \ntrappers who worked in Wyoming and his assistance with the other Native \nAmerican tribes was invaluable. He also offered protection to wagon \ntrains making their way across Wyoming. Chief Washakie sent members of \nhis tribe to the Little Bighorn to reinforce Custer's troops during the \nbattle, but were too late to prevent the massacre that took place.\n  Chief Washakie recognized that the white man could be a benefit to \nthe Shoshone tribes. His forward thinking nature ensured that the \nShoshone tribe received their current home as a reservation and was not \nrequired to relocate to an unfamiliar area. The Wind River Reservation \nin Western Wyoming is still home to the Eastern Shoshone tribe.\n  Wyoming has recognized Chief Washakie as one of our state's most \nnotable citizens by granting him a very unique honor, the placement of \na statue of him in the United States Capitol. He joins Esther Hobart \nMorris, the first female Justice of Peace in the nation and the woman \nwho started the movement that led the Wyoming Territorial Legislature \nto grant women the right to vote in 1869. Chief Washakie also joins \nsuch esteemed company as patriots Samuel Adams and Ethan Allen, Senator \nJohn Calhoun and Henry Clay, and Presidents George Washington and \nAndrew Jackson to name just a few of the notable Americans with a place \nof honor in the Capitol. Congress extends its thanks to the people of \nWyoming for providing the nation with this statue of one of our most \nimportant figures, Chief Washakie of the Shoshone Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 116--COMMENDING ISRAEL'S REDEPLOYMENT FROM \n                            SOUTHERN LEBANON\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Helms, Mr. Biden, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \nMurray, and Mr. Conrad) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

These dedicated men were from Texas, Maryland, Oklahoma, \nCalifornia, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Arizona, \nWashington, Virginia, and Florida but were bound together in the \nbrotherhood of arms known as the United States Marine Corps.\n  Since it was first established through a resolution by the \nContinental Congress on November 10, 1775, the United States Marine \nCorps has been defined by the fearless and indomitable spirit of those \nwho have served. Sharing an enviable ``esprit de corps,'' marines have \nused the Marine Corps emblem of the eagle, globe, and anchor to \ntranscend race, ethnicity, gender, geographic and economic background. \nTheir tenacity, uncompromising will, and outspoken pride in being a \nmarine have endeared them to the nation, and we, as a nation, grieve \ntheir loss.\n  Nowhere is this loss felt more deeply than by the families of these \nmen. I thank them for their unrelenting support and sacrifice that they \nhave made to their marine, to the Marine Corps, and to their Nation, \nand offer my sympathy for their loss. I also recognize the Marine Corps \nfamily--specifically the 3d Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, the Marine Helicopter Squadron-1, and the Marine Wing \nCommunications Squadron 38, Marine Air Control Group 38--who served \nside by side with these marines and will continue to carry out the \nmission without them.\n  This tragic accident is a brutal reminder that there is no such thing \nas ``routine'' training for our men and women in the military. Every \nday, all around the world our armed forces risk their lives, in peace \nand in combat, to support and defend our great Nation, and they deserve \nour thanks and admiration.\n  Mr. President, this resolution recognizes the sacrifices of these \nmagnificent 19 marines and their families who embody the Marine Corps \ncredo ``Semper Fidelis'' always faithful. It is the opportunity for the \nSenate to publically thank their families and the Marine Corps for \ntheir dedication, loyalty, and sacrifice to our Nation, and to extend \nour condolences on this loss.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 311, submitted \nearlier by Senator Bond and Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 311) to express the sense of the \n     Senate regarding Federal procurement opportunities for women-\n     owned small businesses.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate Resolution I \nintroduce today which calls attention to the Federal Government's \nfailure to meet the statutory goal to award 5 percent of Federal \ncontract dollars to women-owned small businesses. I am very pleased \nthat members of the Senate Committee on Small Business have cosponsored \nthis Resolution, including the committee's ranking member, Senator \nKerry, Senator Burns, Senator Snowe, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Edwards and Senator Abraham, who authored last \nyear's initiative in the committee to help women reach the 5-percent \ngoal. In addition, Senators Bingaman and Murray have joined us as \ncosponsors of the resolution.\n  This is Small Business Week 2000. It is very appropriate that we \nrecognize the important roles played of women-owned small businesses in \nour Nation's\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\neconomy and communities. The number of small businesses owned and \ncontrolled by women is expanding at a very rapid rate, and today, they \ntotal 38 percent of all businesses in the United States. Importantly, \ntheir numbers are expanding at such a pace that it is anticipated \nwomen-owned small businesses will make up over 50 percent of all \nbusinesses by 2010. That is an astounding statistic.\n  In 1994, Congress recognized the important role women-owned small \nbusinesses play in our economy. During the consideration of the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, FASA, the Senate approved a provision \ndirecting that 5 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be awarded \neach year to women-owned small businesses. The goal includes 5 percent \nof prime contract dollars and 5 percent of subcontract dollars and was \nincluded in the final FASA Conference Report and enacted into law.\n  The Federal departments and agencies have failed to meet the 5 \npercent goal since it was enacted by Congress in 1994. After Senator \nAbraham chaired a committee field hearing in Michigan on the state of \nwomen business owners, he offered an amendment addressing the failure \nof the Federal departments and agencies to meet the 5 percent goal \nduring the Committee on Small Business markup of the ``Women's Business \nCenters Sustainability Act of 1999,'' S. 791. The amendment was adopted \nunanimously by the Committee and enacted into law, Public Law 106-165. \nIt directed the General Accounting Office to undertake an audit of the \nFederal procurement system and its impact on women-owned small \nbusinesses, which is underway at this time.\n  The statistics for Federal procurement for FY 1999 have been \nreleased. Again, the 5 percent goal for women-owned small businesses \nwas not met--and again the Federal departments and agencies fell over \n50 percent short of the goal--reaching only 2.4 percent. The failure of \nthe Administration to meet this goal, which is designed to produce \nopportunities for start-up and growing small, women-owned businesses, \nis disturbing. Over 5 years have passed since the enactment of FASA, \nand the Federal Government continues to respond by taking baby steps \ntoward meeting this Congressionally-mandated goal.\n\n  The resolution before the Senate today urges the President to adopt \nan administration policy in support of the 5-percent goal. Further, the \nresolution urges the President to go to the heart of the problem--to \nthose Federal departments and agencies that are not carrying their \nshare of the burden in meeting the goal. Specifically, the resolution \nasks the President to hold the head of each department and agency \naccountable for meeting the 5-percent goal.\n  Is it asking too much to require cabinet secretaries and agency heads \nto work harder to comply with a statutory goal? Of course not. It's all \na matter of priorities. And I think supporting women-owned business \nshould and must be a priority for each and every cabinet secretary and \nagency head. In other words, we are demanding performance not promises.\n  Were it not for the growth of the small business community over the \npast decade, our economy would not be its booming self. Women-owned \nsmall businesses have contributed significantly to our economic \nstrength and stability. We need to help stimulate this growth to \nstrengthen further the foundation of our business success. The 5 \npercent Federal procurement goal is a significant component to help \nwomen-owned business to start-up and flourish.\n  We should not lose sight of the fact that our laws are not keeping up \nwith the new realities of business, particularly for women-owned \nbusinesses, who are heating up the economy. We need to be ever vigilant \nand remain alert to changes in the business climate so that laws and \ngovernment policies are relevant and helpful. We in Congress should be \nprepared to jettison antiquated laws. And we need to recognize that \noccasionally the best government policy will be to step aside to avoid \nhindering progress and growth.\n  Future Congresses and Administrations will have a tremendous impact \non the success of women-owned businesses. That is why I am joining with \nSenators Kerry, Olympia Snowe, Mary Landrieu, Dianne Feinstein, and Kay \nBailey Hutchison to convene a National Women's Business Summit on June \n4-5, 2000, in Kansas City, Missouri. The summit will give women small \nbusiness owners the opportunity to help formulate national policies on \nwomen's small business issues by gathering input from women business \nleaders, elected officials and other experts. Results and \nrecommendations from this summit will be communicated directly to the \nCongress. More information about the summit can be found on my Senate \noffice Web site at www.senate.gov/bond.\n  As we begin Small Business Week, I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill take a moment and recognize the important role small businesses \nplay in our economy. And I urge them to reinforce their support for the \n5-percent Federal procurement goal and women-owned small businesses by \nvoting in favor of the Senate resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, women-owned businesses have scored a double \nvictory today. President Clinton and a bi-partisan coalition of \nSenators have unveiled separate but complementary national policies to \nincrease procurement opportunities for businesses owned by women.\n  Though on its face Federal procurement may not sound like an \nimportant issue to the general public, or even a term that many \nrecognize, it is one of the most lucrative, yet difficult, markets for \nsmall businesses to access, particularly those owned by women and \nunder-represented minorities. For example, in 1999, women-owned \nbusinesses made up 38 percent of all businesses but received only 2.4 \npercent of the $189 billion in Federal prime contracts. We can do \nbetter. And, before we enact new laws, we should promote and enforce \nthe ones we have.\n  First, I want to offer my strong support and sincere compliments to \nPresident Clinton for signing an executive order today that reaffirms \nand strengthens the executive branch's commitment to meeting the five-\npercent procurement goal for women-owned businesses. His staff has \nworked for months with the Small Business Administration, SBA, the \nNational Women's Business Council, the Women's Coalition for Access to \nProcurement, Women First, Women's Construction Owners and Executives, \nand the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to draft a \nfeasible plan to help Federal agencies and departments increase the \nnumber of contracts awarded to businesses owned by women. Announcing \nthat plan this afternoon is timely.\n  Today I join my colleague Senator Bond to introduce a resolution that \nencourages the President to adopt a policy that reinforces and enforces \na procurement law Congress passed in 1994. That law, the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, established a government-wide goal for \nall heads of Federal departments and agencies to award five percent of \ntheir prime and subcontracts to women-owned businesses. First, this \nresolution asks the President to adopt a policy that supports the law \nand encourages agencies and departments to meet the goal. Second, this \nresolution asks the President to reinforce the law by holding the heads \nof agencies and departments accountable for meeting the five-percent \ngoal.\n  I believe the President's executive order goes beyond the Senate's \nrequest and establishes a strong system within the Federal Government \nfor increasing the number of contracts that go to women-owned \nbusinesses. I think it is very smart to hire an Assistant Administrator \nfor Women's Procurement within the SBA's Office of Government \nContracting. Increasing opportunities for women-owned businesses is a \nfull-time job and devoting staff to this area is good use of resources.\n  I also think it is good policy for the Assistant Administrator to \nevaluate the agencies' contracting records on a semi-annual basis. This \nhas two benefits. One, it encourages the procurement offices to run \ntheir operations like good small businesses. If you ask, most business \nowners will tell you that a key to running a successful business is \nhaving a solid business plan and regularly measuring your costs against \nrevenues and projecting adequate inventory or staff to meet the demands \nof your products or services. I think it is a very good idea for \ncontracting officers to do the same. Two, this policy\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\nallows the SBA to work with an agency that is not meeting its goal \nmidway through the year rather than finding out at the end of the year \nwhen it is too late.\n  Lastly, I like the Administration's plan because it takes a holistic \napproach to procurement. Rather than just focusing on the agencies and \ndepartments, it requires the Assistant Administrator to organize \ntraining and development seminars that teach women entrepreneurs about \nthe complex world of Federal procurement and the SBA's procurement \nprograms. It will be much easier for women-owned businesses to compete \nfor Federal contracts if they understand the process and how to find \nout about opportunities.\n  I think it is important to note that while the government as a whole \nis not contracting as it should with women-owned firms, there are some \noutstanding exceptions. Some Federal agencies have taken the lead in \nworking with women owned firms, and should be congratulated. According \nto the Federal Procurement Data System, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal \nMine Safety & Health Review Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and the Small Business Administration have all not only met \nthe five percent goal, but have come in at around fifteen percent or \nbetter. That is three times the goal set by Congress.\n  These Federal agencies know that working with women-owned firms is \nnot simply an altruistic exercise. These firms are strong, dependable \nand do good work. These firms provide a solid service to their \ncustomer, and the Federal contracting officers know it. In total, 20 \nFederal agencies either met or exceeded the five percent goal.\n  Therefore, we know that it is indeed possible for Government agencies \nto meet the five percent goal. With this resolution, it is our hope \nthat agencies will work harder, following the examples of the agencies \nI discussed earlier, to contract with women-owned firms.\n  I've supported many initiatives over the years to increase resources \nand opportunities for businesses owned by women. Most recently, I \nsupported Senator Landrieu's legislation to re-authorize the National \nWomen's Business Council for 3 years, and to increase the annual \nappropriation from $600,000 to $1 million. Part of that increase will \nbe used to assist Federal agencies meet the five-percent procurement \ngoal for women-owned businesses. The Council has provided great \nleadership in this area, making increased contracting opportunities a \npriority since it was created in 1988, and earned praise from Democrats \nand Republicans for two extensive procurement studies it published in \n1998 and 1999. The first study tracked 11 years of Federal contracting \nso that we have measurable data, and the second study identified and \nanalyzed public and private sector practices that have been successful \nin increasing contracting opportunities for women business owners. The \nadditional resources will allow the Council to build on that study and \nput the information to good use, ultimately increasing competitive \ncontracting opportunities for businesses owned by women.\n  In addition to supporting reauthorization of the National Women's \nBusiness Council, last year I introduced the Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999. Now public law, that legislation is helping \nCenters address the funding constraints that have been making it \nincreasingly difficult for them to sustain the level of services they \nprovide after they graduate from the Women's Business Centers program \nand no longer receive federal matching funds. It is important to note \nthat SBA requires Women's Business Centers to provide procurement \ntraining.\n  As part of that bill, we passed an amendment addressing Federal \nprocurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The \namendment expressed the sense of the Senate that the General Accounting \nOffice should conduct an audit on the federal procurement system for \nthe preceding three years. Unlike the Council's previous studies and \nreports that focused on data and best practices, this report was to \nfocus on why the agencies haven't met the congressionally mandated \nfive-percent procurement goal for small businesses owned by women.\n  Mr. President, the Federal agencies have begun to make progress since \nCongress enacted the five-percent procurement goal, but I want the \ncontracting managers to remember that this goal is a minimum, not a \nmaximum. Out of the more than 9 million businesses owned by women in \nthis country, I believe that the Federal Government can find ones that \nare qualified and reliable, with good products and services, to fill \ntheir contracts if they make it a priority.\n  I believe that the President's Executive Order establishes a strong \nsystem within the Federal Government for increasing the number of \ncontracts that go to women-owned businesses, and I look forward to \nseeing the Federal departments and agencies meet the five-percent goal \nthis year, as the Senate resolution emphasizes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement and a copy of the \nExecutive Order be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Executive Order\n\n\n       increasing opportunities for women-owned small businesses\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, \n     including the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631, et seq., \n     section 7106 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n     1994 (Public Law 103-355), and the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy, 41 U.S.C. 403, et seq., and in order to \n     strengthen the executive branch's commitment to increased \n     opportunities for women-owned small businesses, it is hereby \n     ordered as follows:\n       Section 1. Executive Branch Policy. In order to reaffirm \n     and strengthen the statutory policy contained in the Small \n     Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1), it shall be the policy of \n     the executive branch to take the steps necessary to meet or \n     exceed the 5 percent Government-wide goal for participation \n     in procurement by women-owned small businesses (WOSBs). \n     Further, the executive branch shall implement this policy by \n     establishing a participation goal for WOSBs of not less than \n     5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for \n     each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total \n     value of all subcontract awards for each fiscal year.\n       Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Federal Departments and \n     Agencies. Each department and agency (hereafter referred to \n     collectively as ``agency'') that has procurement authority \n     shall develop a long-term comprehensive strategy to expand \n     opportunities for WOSBs. Where feasible and consistent with \n     the effective and efficient performance of its mission, each \n     agency shall establish a goal of achieving a participation \n     rate for WOSBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value \n     of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not \n     less than 5 percent of the total value of all subcontract \n     awards for each fiscal year. The agency's plans shall \n     include, where appropriate, methods and programs as set \n     forth in section 4 of this order.\n       Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the Small Business \n     Administration. The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall \n     establish an Assistant Administrator for Women's Procurement \n     within the SBA's Office of Government Contracting. This \n     officer shall be responsible for:\n       (a) working with each agency to develop and implement \n     policies to achieve the participation goals for WOSBs for the \n     executive branch and individual agencies;\n       (b) advising agencies on how to implement strategies that \n     will increase the participation of WOSBs in Federal \n     procurement;\n       (c) evaluating, on a semiannual basis, using the Federal \n     Procurement Data System (FPDS), the achievement of prime and \n     subcontract goals and actual prime and subcontract awards to \n     WOSBs for each agency;\n       (d) preparing a report, which shall be submitted by the \n     Administrator of the SBA to the President, through the \n     Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise and the \n     Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), on findings \n     based on the FPDS, regarding prime contracts and subcontracts \n     awarded to WOSBs;\n       (e) making recommendations and working with Federal \n     agencies to expand participation rates for WOSBs, with a \n     particular emphasis on agencies in which the participation \n     rate for these businesses in less than 5 percent;\n       (f) providing a program of training and development \n     seminars and conferences to instruct women on how to \n     participate in the SBA's 8(a) program, the Small \n     Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program, the HUBZone program, \n     and other small business contracting programs for which they \n     may be eligible;\n       (g) developing and implementing a single uniform Federal \n     Government-wide website, which provides links to other \n     websites within the Federal system concerning acquisition, \n     small businesses, and women-owned businesses, and which \n     provides current procurement information for WOSBs and other \n     small businesses;\n       (h) developing an interactive electronic commerce database \n     that allows small businesses to register their businesses and \n     capabilities as potential contractors for Federal agencies, \n     and enables contracting officers to\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n     identify and locate potential contractors; and\n       (i) working with existing women-owned business \n     organizations, State and local governments, and others in \n     order to promote the sharing of information and the \n     development of more uniform State and local standards for \n     WOSBs that reduce the burden on these firms in competing for \n     procurement opportunities.\n       Sec. 4. Other Responsibilities of Federal Agencies. To the \n     extent permitted by law, each Federal agency shall work with \n     the SBA to ensure maximum participation of WOSBs in the \n     procurement process by taking the following steps:\n       (a) designating a senior acquisition official who will work \n     with the SBA to identify and promote contracting \n     opportunities for WOSBs;\n       (b) requiring contracting officers, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, to include WOSBs in competitive acquisitions;\n       (c) prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition \n     planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure \n     acquisitions to facilitate competition by and among small \n     businesses, HUBZone small businesses, SDBs, and WOSBs, and \n     providing guidance on structuring acquisitions, including, \n     but not limited to, those expected to result in multiple \n     award contracts, in order to facilitate competition by and \n     among these groups;\n       (d) implementing mentor-protege programs, which include \n     women-owned small business firms; and\n       (e) offering industry-wide as well as industry-specific \n     outreach, training, and technical assistance programs for \n     WOSBs including, where appropriate, the use of Government \n     acquisitions forecasts, in order to assist WOSBs in \n     developing their products, skills, business planning \n     practices, and marketing techniques.\n       Sec. 5. Subcontracting Plans. The head of each Federal \n     agency, or designated representative, shall work closely with \n     the SBA, OFPP, and others to develop procedures to increase \n     compliance by prime contractors with subcontracting plans \n     proposed under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(d)) or section 834 of Public Law 101-189, as \n     amended (15 U.S.C. 637 note), including subcontracting plans \n     involving WOSBs.\n       Sec. 6. Action Plans. If a Federal agency fails to meet its \n     annual goals in expanding contract opportunities for WOSBs, \n     it shall work with the SBA to develop an action plan to \n     increase the likelihood that participation goals will be met \n     or exceeded in future years.\n       Sec. 7. Compliance. Independent agencies are requested to \n     comply with the provisions of this order.\n       Sec. 8. Consultation and Advice. In developing the long-\n     term comprehensive strategies required by section 2 of this \n     order, Federal agencies shall consult with, and seek \n     information and advice from, State and local governments, \n     WOSBs, other private-sector partners, and other experts.\n       Sec. 9. Judicial Review. This order is for internal \n     management purposes for the Federal Government. It does not \n     create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n     enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United \n     States, its agencies, its officers, its employees, or any \n     other person.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n                                         The White House, May 23, 2000.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from the \nSenate Small Business Committee, Chairman Kit Bond and Ranking Member \nJohn Kerry, in support of increased involvement of women-owned small \nbusinesses in the Federal procurement process.\n  I have had the opportunity to speak with many women business leaders \nin Michigan on this matter, and the general opinion is that there are \ncertain doors that are closed to women business owners. In a field \nhearing I held in Michigan last summer on issues to women in business, \nI found that many times women business owners face the same problems as \nmen in the private sector. However, when looking at the representation \nof women in terms of federal procurement dollars, the difference is \nstriking.\n  Six years after posting a modest five-percent goal of Federal \nprocurement dollars for women-owned small businesses, Federal \ndepartments and agencies have fallen far short. Last year, only 2.4 \npercent of the total dollar value of all Federal prime contracts went \nto women business owners. This shortfall is staggering when taking into \naccount that women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing \nsegment of the business community in the United States. In fact, by the \nyear 2010, women-owned small businesses are expected to make up more \nthan one-half of all businesses in the United States.\n  As a result of this striking information, I introduced an amendment \nto last year's Women Business Centers Sustainability Act that called \nfor a GAO report studying the trends, barriers and possible solutions \nto this deficiency. I am proud to report that this report stands to be \ncompleted by the end of the year. However, this alone will not provide \nFederal procurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The \nadministration must become actively involved in demanding Federal \ndepartments and agencies accomplish the five-percent procurement goal.\n  Mr. President, I have been advocating this issues for quite some time \nnow. My colleagues and I in the Senate Small Business Committee have \nconsistently supported efforts empowering the spirit of \nentrepreneurship in American women. In my view, these actions must be \nadopted and enforced on all levels of government.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in encouraging the \nPresident to hold the heads of the Federal departments and agencies \naccountable to ensure that the five percent goal is achieved during \nthis fiscal year.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bond, Senator Kerry, \nand others in support of a Senate resolution urging the President to \nadopt a policy to ensure that the 5-percent Federal procurement goal \nfor women-owned small businesses is met.\n  In 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, \nestablishing a Government-wide goal for small businesses owned and \ncontrolled by women. This act allows for no less than five percent of \nthe total dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards \nfor each year.\n  Over the past few years, we have witnessed the growth of women-owned \nbusinesses, including federal contracts. Over the past ten we've seen \nthousands of women entrepreneurs start or expand their own businesses. \nIt is important we realize that women-owned businesses are the fastest \ngrowing segment of the business community in the United States. In \nfact, in the next ten years, it is expected that women-owned businesses \nwill make up more than one-half of all businesses in the United States.\n  This week has been designated as Small Business Week, therefore it is \nonly fitting that the Senate should pass this resolution to symbolize \nthe Senate's concern that the Federal departments and agencies have not \nmade adequate effort in meeting the five percent goal established in \n1994 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. I fully \nsupport this Senate resolution and urge Federal agencies to make a \nconcerted effort to meet this 5-percent goal.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 311) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas women-owned small businesses are the fastest \n     growing segment of the business community in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas women-owned small businesses will make up more than \n     one-half of all business in the United States by the year \n     2010;\n       Whereas in 1994, the Congress enacted the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, establishing a \n     Government-wide goal for small businesses owned and \n     controlled by women of not less than 5 percent of the total \n     dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards \n     for each fiscal year;\n       Whereas the Congress intended that the departments and \n     agencies of the Federal Government make a concerted effort to \n     move toward that goal;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 1999, the departments and agencies \n     of the Federal Government awarded prime contracts totaling \n     2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all prime contracts; \n     and\n       Whereas in each fiscal year since enactment of the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Federal departments \n     and agencies have failed to reach the 5 percent procurement \n     goal for women-owned small businesses: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate strongly urges the President to adopt a \n     policy in support of the 5 percent procurement goal for \n     women-owned small businesses, and to encourage the heads of \n     the Federal departments and agencies to undertake a concerted \n     effort to meet the 5 percent goal before the end of fiscal \n     year 2000; and\n       (2) the President should hold the heads of the Federal \n     departments and agencies accountable to ensure that the 5 \n     percent goal is achieved during fiscal year 2000.\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4330-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4330-S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FEDERAL PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 311, submitted \nearlier by Senator Bond and Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 311) to express the sense of the \n     Senate regarding Federal procurement opportunities for women-\n     owned small businesses.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate Resolution I \nintroduce today which calls attention to the Federal Government's \nfailure to meet the statutory goal to award 5 percent of Federal \ncontract dollars to women-owned small businesses. I am very pleased \nthat members of the Senate Committee on Small Business have cosponsored \nthis Resolution, including the committee's ranking member, Senator \nKerry, Senator Burns, Senator Snowe, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Edwards and Senator Abraham, who authored last \nyear's initiative in the committee to help women reach the 5-percent \ngoal. In addition, Senators Bingaman and Murray have joined us as \ncosponsors of the resolution.\n  This is Small Business Week 2000. It is very appropriate that we \nrecognize the important roles played of women-owned small businesses in \nour Nation's\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\neconomy and communities. The number of small businesses owned and \ncontrolled by women is expanding at a very rapid rate, and today, they \ntotal 38 percent of all businesses in the United States. Importantly, \ntheir numbers are expanding at such a pace that it is anticipated \nwomen-owned small businesses will make up over 50 percent of all \nbusinesses by 2010. That is an astounding statistic.\n  In 1994, Congress recognized the important role women-owned small \nbusinesses play in our economy. During the consideration of the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, FASA, the Senate approved a provision \ndirecting that 5 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be awarded \neach year to women-owned small businesses. The goal includes 5 percent \nof prime contract dollars and 5 percent of subcontract dollars and was \nincluded in the final FASA Conference Report and enacted into law.\n  The Federal departments and agencies have failed to meet the 5 \npercent goal since it was enacted by Congress in 1994. After Senator \nAbraham chaired a committee field hearing in Michigan on the state of \nwomen business owners, he offered an amendment addressing the failure \nof the Federal departments and agencies to meet the 5 percent goal \nduring the Committee on Small Business markup of the ``Women's Business \nCenters Sustainability Act of 1999,'' S. 791. The amendment was adopted \nunanimously by the Committee and enacted into law, Public Law 106-165. \nIt directed the General Accounting Office to undertake an audit of the \nFederal procurement system and its impact on women-owned small \nbusinesses, which is underway at this time.\n  The statistics for Federal procurement for FY 1999 have been \nreleased. Again, the 5 percent goal for women-owned small businesses \nwas not met--and again the Federal departments and agencies fell over \n50 percent short of the goal--reaching only 2.4 percent. The failure of \nthe Administration to meet this goal, which is designed to produce \nopportunities for start-up and growing small, women-owned businesses, \nis disturbing. Over 5 years have passed since the enactment of FASA, \nand the Federal Government continues to respond by taking baby steps \ntoward meeting this Congressionally-mandated goal.\n\n  The resolution before the Senate today urges the President to adopt \nan administration policy in support of the 5-percent goal. Further, the \nresolution urges the President to go to the heart of the problem--to \nthose Federal departments and agencies that are not carrying their \nshare of the burden in meeting the goal. Specifically, the resolution \nasks the President to hold the head of each department and agency \naccountable for meeting the 5-percent goal.\n  Is it asking too much to require cabinet secretaries and agency heads \nto work harder to comply with a statutory goal? Of course not. It's all \na matter of priorities. And I think supporting women-owned business \nshould and must be a priority for each and every cabinet secretary and \nagency head. In other words, we are demanding performance not promises.\n  Were it not for the growth of the small business community over the \npast decade, our economy would not be its booming self. Women-owned \nsmall businesses have contributed significantly to our economic \nstrength and stability. We need to help stimulate this growth to \nstrengthen further the foundation of our business success. The 5 \npercent Federal procurement goal is a significant component to help \nwomen-owned business to start-up and flourish.\n  We should not lose sight of the fact that our laws are not keeping up \nwith the new realities of business, particularly for women-owned \nbusinesses, who are heating up the economy. We need to be ever vigilant \nand remain alert to changes in the business climate so that laws and \ngovernment policies are relevant and helpful. We in Congress should be \nprepared to jettison antiquated laws. And we need to recognize that \noccasionally the best government policy will be to step aside to avoid \nhindering progress and growth.\n  Future Congresses and Administrations will have a tremendous impact \non the success of women-owned businesses. That is why I am joining with \nSenators Kerry, Olympia Snowe, Mary Landrieu, Dianne Feinstein, and Kay \nBailey Hutchison to convene a National Women's Business Summit on June \n4-5, 2000, in Kansas City, Missouri. The summit will give women small \nbusiness owners the opportunity to help formulate national policies on \nwomen's small business issues by gathering input from women business \nleaders, elected officials and other experts. Results and \nrecommendations from this summit will be communicated directly to the \nCongress. More information about the summit can be found on my Senate \noffice Web site at www.senate.gov/bond.\n  As we begin Small Business Week, I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill take a moment and recognize the important role small businesses \nplay in our economy. And I urge them to reinforce their support for the \n5-percent Federal procurement goal and women-owned small businesses by \nvoting in favor of the Senate resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, women-owned businesses have scored a double \nvictory today. President Clinton and a bi-partisan coalition of \nSenators have unveiled separate but complementary national policies to \nincrease procurement opportunities for businesses owned by women.\n  Though on its face Federal procurement may not sound like an \nimportant issue to the general public, or even a term that many \nrecognize, it is one of the most lucrative, yet difficult, markets for \nsmall businesses to access, particularly those owned by women and \nunder-represented minorities. For example, in 1999, women-owned \nbusinesses made up 38 percent of all businesses but received only 2.4 \npercent of the $189 billion in Federal prime contracts. We can do \nbetter. And, before we enact new laws, we should promote and enforce \nthe ones we have.\n  First, I want to offer my strong support and sincere compliments to \nPresident Clinton for signing an executive order today that reaffirms \nand strengthens the executive branch's commitment to meeting the five-\npercent procurement goal for women-owned businesses. His staff has \nworked for months with the Small Business Administration, SBA, the \nNational Women's Business Council, the Women's Coalition for Access to \nProcurement, Women First, Women's Construction Owners and Executives, \nand the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to draft a \nfeasible plan to help Federal agencies and departments increase the \nnumber of contracts awarded to businesses owned by women. Announcing \nthat plan this afternoon is timely.\n  Today I join my colleague Senator Bond to introduce a resolution that \nencourages the President to adopt a policy that reinforces and enforces \na procurement law Congress passed in 1994. That law, the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, established a government-wide goal for \nall heads of Federal departments and agencies to award five percent of \ntheir prime and subcontracts to women-owned businesses. First, this \nresolution asks the President to adopt a policy that supports the law \nand encourages agencies and departments to meet the goal. Second, this \nresolution asks the President to reinforce the law by holding the heads \nof agencies and departments accountable for meeting the five-percent \ngoal.\n  I believe the President's executive order goes beyond the Senate's \nrequest and establishes a strong system within the Federal Government \nfor increasing the number of contracts that go to women-owned \nbusinesses. I think it is very smart to hire an Assistant Administrator \nfor Women's Procurement within the SBA's Office of Government \nContracting. Increasing opportunities for women-owned businesses is a \nfull-time job and devoting staff to this area is good use of resources.\n  I also think it is good policy for the Assistant Administrator to \nevaluate the agencies' contracting records on a semi-annual basis. This \nhas two benefits. One, it encourages the procurement offices to run \ntheir operations like good small businesses. If you ask, most business \nowners will tell you that a key to running a successful business is \nhaving a solid business plan and regularly measuring your costs against \nrevenues and projecting adequate inventory or staff to meet the demands \nof your products or services. I think it is a very good idea for \ncontracting officers to do the same. Two, this policy\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\nallows the SBA to work with an agency that is not meeting its goal \nmidway through the year rather than finding out at the end of the year \nwhen it is too late.\n  Lastly, I like the Administration's plan because it takes a holistic \napproach to procurement. Rather than just focusing on the agencies and \ndepartments, it requires the Assistant Administrator to organize \ntraining and development seminars that teach women entrepreneurs about \nthe complex world of Federal procurement and the SBA's procurement \nprograms. It will be much easier for women-owned businesses to compete \nfor Federal contracts if they understand the process and how to find \nout about opportunities.\n  I think it is important to note that while the government as a whole \nis not contracting as it should with women-owned firms, there are some \noutstanding exceptions. Some Federal agencies have taken the lead in \nworking with women owned firms, and should be congratulated. According \nto the Federal Procurement Data System, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal \nMine Safety & Health Review Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and the Small Business Administration have all not only met \nthe five percent goal, but have come in at around fifteen percent or \nbetter. That is three times the goal set by Congress.\n  These Federal agencies know that working with women-owned firms is \nnot simply an altruistic exercise. These firms are strong, dependable \nand do good work. These firms provide a solid service to their \ncustomer, and the Federal contracting officers know it. In total, 20 \nFederal agencies either met or exceeded the five percent goal.\n  Therefore, we know that it is indeed possible for Government agencies \nto meet the five percent goal. With this resolution, it is our hope \nthat agencies will work harder, following the examples of the agencies \nI discussed earlier, to contract with women-owned firms.\n  I've supported many initiatives over the years to increase resources \nand opportunities for businesses owned by women. Most recently, I \nsupported Senator Landrieu's legislation to re-authorize the National \nWomen's Business Council for 3 years, and to increase the annual \nappropriation from $600,000 to $1 million. Part of that increase will \nbe used to assist Federal agencies meet the five-percent procurement \ngoal for women-owned businesses. The Council has provided great \nleadership in this area, making increased contracting opportunities a \npriority since it was created in 1988, and earned praise from Democrats \nand Republicans for two extensive procurement studies it published in \n1998 and 1999. The first study tracked 11 years of Federal contracting \nso that we have measurable data, and the second study identified and \nanalyzed public and private sector practices that have been successful \nin increasing contracting opportunities for women business owners. The \nadditional resources will allow the Council to build on that study and \nput the information to good use, ultimately increasing competitive \ncontracting opportunities for businesses owned by women.\n  In addition to supporting reauthorization of the National Women's \nBusiness Council, last year I introduced the Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999. Now public law, that legislation is helping \nCenters address the funding constraints that have been making it \nincreasingly difficult for them to sustain the level of services they \nprovide after they graduate from the Women's Business Centers program \nand no longer receive federal matching funds. It is important to note \nthat SBA requires Women's Business Centers to provide procurement \ntraining.\n  As part of that bill, we passed an amendment addressing Federal \nprocurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The \namendment expressed the sense of the Senate that the General Accounting \nOffice should conduct an audit on the federal procurement system for \nthe preceding three years. Unlike the Council's previous studies and \nreports that focused on data and best practices, this report was to \nfocus on why the agencies haven't met the congressionally mandated \nfive-percent procurement goal for small businesses owned by women.\n  Mr. President, the Federal agencies have begun to make progress since \nCongress enacted the five-percent procurement goal, but I want the \ncontracting managers to remember that this goal is a minimum, not a \nmaximum. Out of the more than 9 million businesses owned by women in \nthis country, I believe that the Federal Government can find ones that \nare qualified and reliable, with good products and services, to fill \ntheir contracts if they make it a priority.\n  I believe that the President's Executive Order establishes a strong \nsystem within the Federal Government for increasing the number of \ncontracts that go to women-owned businesses, and I look forward to \nseeing the Federal departments and agencies meet the five-percent goal \nthis year, as the Senate resolution emphasizes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement and a copy of the \nExecutive Order be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Executive Order\n\n\n       increasing opportunities for women-owned small businesses\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, \n     including the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631, et seq., \n     section 7106 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n     1994 (Public Law 103-355), and the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy, 41 U.S.C. 403, et seq., and in order to \n     strengthen the executive branch's commitment to increased \n     opportunities for women-owned small businesses, it is hereby \n     ordered as follows:\n       Section 1.

In order to reaffirm \n     and strengthen the statutory policy contained in the Small \n     Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1), it shall be the policy of \n     the executive branch to take the steps necessary to meet or \n     exceed the 5 percent Government-wide goal for participation \n     in procurement by women-owned small businesses (WOSBs). \n     Further, the executive branch shall implement this policy by \n     establishing a participation goal for WOSBs of not less than \n     5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for \n     each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total \n     value of all subcontract awards for each fiscal year.\n       Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Federal Departments and \n     Agencies. Each department and agency (hereafter referred to \n     collectively as ``agency'') that has procurement authority \n     shall develop a long-term comprehensive strategy to expand \n     opportunities for WOSBs. Where feasible and consistent with \n     the effective and efficient performance of its mission, each \n     agency shall establish a goal of achieving a participation \n     rate for WOSBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value \n     of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not \n     less than 5 percent of the total value of all subcontract \n     awards for each fiscal year. The agency's plans shall \n     include, where appropriate, methods and programs as set \n     forth in section 4 of this order.\n       Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the Small Business \n     Administration. The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall \n     establish an Assistant Administrator for Women's Procurement \n     within the SBA's Office of Government Contracting. This \n     officer shall be responsible for:\n       (a) working with each agency to develop and implement \n     policies to achieve the participation goals for WOSBs for the \n     executive branch and individual agencies;\n       (b) advising agencies on how to implement strategies that \n     will increase the participation of WOSBs in Federal \n     procurement;\n       (c) evaluating, on a semiannual basis, using the Federal \n     Procurement Data System (FPDS), the achievement of prime and \n     subcontract goals and actual prime and subcontract awards to \n     WOSBs for each agency;\n       (d) preparing a report, which shall be submitted by the \n     Administrator of the SBA to the President, through the \n     Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise and the \n     Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), on findings \n     based on the FPDS, regarding prime contracts and subcontracts \n     awarded to WOSBs;\n       (e) making recommendations and working with Federal \n     agencies to expand participation rates for WOSBs, with a \n     particular emphasis on agencies in which the participation \n     rate for these businesses in less than 5 percent;\n       (f) providing a program of training and development \n     seminars and conferences to instruct women on how to \n     participate in the SBA's 8(a) program, the Small \n     Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program, the HUBZone program, \n     and other small business contracting programs for which they \n     may be eligible;\n       (g) developing and implementing a single uniform Federal \n     Government-wide website, which provides links to other \n     websites within the Federal system concerning acquisition, \n     small businesses, and women-owned businesses, and which \n     provides current procurement information for WOSBs and other \n     small businesses;\n       (h) developing an interactive electronic commerce database \n     that allows small businesses to register their businesses and \n     capabilities as potential contractors for Federal agencies, \n     and enables contracting officers to\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n     identify and locate potential contractors; and\n       (i) working with existing women-owned business \n     organizations, State and local governments, and others in \n     order to promote the sharing of information and the \n     development of more uniform State and local standards for \n     WOSBs that reduce the burden on these firms in competing for \n     procurement opportunities.\n       Sec. 4. Other Responsibilities of Federal Agencies. To the \n     extent permitted by law, each Federal agency shall work with \n     the SBA to ensure maximum participation of WOSBs in the \n     procurement process by taking the following steps:\n       (a) designating a senior acquisition official who will work \n     with the SBA to identify and promote contracting \n     opportunities for WOSBs;\n       (b) requiring contracting officers, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, to include WOSBs in competitive acquisitions;\n       (c) prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition \n     planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure \n     acquisitions to facilitate competition by and among small \n     businesses, HUBZone small businesses, SDBs, and WOSBs, and \n     providing guidance on structuring acquisitions, including, \n     but not limited to, those expected to result in multiple \n     award contracts, in order to facilitate competition by and \n     among these groups;\n       (d) implementing mentor-protege programs, which include \n     women-owned small business firms; and\n       (e) offering industry-wide as well as industry-specific \n     outreach, training, and technical assistance programs for \n     WOSBs including, where appropriate, the use of Government \n     acquisitions forecasts, in order to assist WOSBs in \n     developing their products, skills, business planning \n     practices, and marketing techniques.\n       Sec. 5. Subcontracting Plans. The head of each Federal \n     agency, or designated representative, shall work closely with \n     the SBA, OFPP, and others to develop procedures to increase \n     compliance by prime contractors with subcontracting plans \n     proposed under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(d)) or section 834 of Public Law 101-189, as \n     amended (15 U.S.C. 637 note), including subcontracting plans \n     involving WOSBs.\n       Sec. 6. Action Plans. If a Federal agency fails to meet its \n     annual goals in expanding contract opportunities for WOSBs, \n     it shall work with the SBA to develop an action plan to \n     increase the likelihood that participation goals will be met \n     or exceeded in future years.\n       Sec. 7.

Clinton.  \n                                         The White House, May 23, 2000.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from the \nSenate Small Business Committee, Chairman Kit Bond and Ranking Member \nJohn Kerry, in support of increased involvement of women-owned small \nbusinesses in the Federal procurement process.\n  I have had the opportunity to speak with many women business leaders \nin Michigan on this matter, and the general opinion is that there are \ncertain doors that are closed to women business owners. In a field \nhearing I held in Michigan last summer on issues to women in business, \nI found that many times women business owners face the same problems as \nmen in the private sector. However, when looking at the representation \nof women in terms of federal procurement dollars, the difference is \nstriking.\n  Six years after posting a modest five-percent goal of Federal \nprocurement dollars for women-owned small businesses, Federal \ndepartments and agencies have fallen far short. Last year, only 2.4 \npercent of the total dollar value of all Federal prime contracts went \nto women business owners. This shortfall is staggering when taking into \naccount that women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing \nsegment of the business community in the United States. In fact, by the \nyear 2010, women-owned small businesses are expected to make up more \nthan one-half of all businesses in the United States.\n  As a result of this striking information, I introduced an amendment \nto last year's Women Business Centers Sustainability Act that called \nfor a GAO report studying the trends, barriers and possible solutions \nto this deficiency. I am proud to report that this report stands to be \ncompleted by the end of the year. However, this alone will not provide \nFederal procurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The \nadministration must become actively involved in demanding Federal \ndepartments and agencies accomplish the five-percent procurement goal.\n  Mr. President, I have been advocating this issues for quite some time \nnow. My colleagues and I in the Senate Small Business Committee have \nconsistently supported efforts empowering the spirit of \nentrepreneurship in American women. In my view, these actions must be \nadopted and enforced on all levels of government.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in encouraging the \nPresident to hold the heads of the Federal departments and agencies \naccountable to ensure that the five percent goal is achieved during \nthis fiscal year.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bond, Senator Kerry, \nand others in support of a Senate resolution urging the President to \nadopt a policy to ensure that the 5-percent Federal procurement goal \nfor women-owned small businesses is met.\n  In 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, \nestablishing a Government-wide goal for small businesses owned and \ncontrolled by women. This act allows for no less than five percent of \nthe total dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards \nfor each year.\n  Over the past few years, we have witnessed the growth of women-owned \nbusinesses, including federal contracts. Over the past ten we've seen \nthousands of women entrepreneurs start or expand their own businesses. \nIt is important we realize that women-owned businesses are the fastest \ngrowing segment of the business community in the United States. In \nfact, in the next ten years, it is expected that women-owned businesses \nwill make up more than one-half of all businesses in the United States.\n  This week has been designated as Small Business Week, therefore it is \nonly fitting that the Senate should pass this resolution to symbolize \nthe Senate's concern that the Federal departments and agencies have not \nmade adequate effort in meeting the five percent goal established in \n1994 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. I fully \nsupport this Senate resolution and urge Federal agencies to make a \nconcerted effort to meet this 5-percent goal.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 311) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas women-owned small businesses are the fastest \n     growing segment of the business community in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas women-owned small businesses will make up more than \n     one-half of all business in the United States by the year \n     2010;\n       Whereas in 1994, the Congress enacted the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, establishing a \n     Government-wide goal for small businesses owned and \n     controlled by women of not less than 5 percent of the total \n     dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards \n     for each fiscal year;\n       Whereas the Congress intended that the departments and \n     agencies of the Federal Government make a concerted effort to \n     move toward that goal;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 1999, the departments and agencies \n     of the Federal Government awarded prime contracts totaling \n     2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all prime contracts; \n     and\n       Whereas in each fiscal year since enactment of the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Federal departments \n     and agencies have failed to reach the 5 percent procurement \n     goal for women-owned small businesses: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate strongly urges the President to adopt a \n     policy in support of the 5 percent procurement goal for \n     women-owned small businesses, and to encourage the heads of \n     the Federal departments and agencies to undertake a concerted \n     effort to meet the 5 percent goal before the end of fiscal \n     year 2000; and\n       (2) the President should hold the heads of the Federal \n     departments and agencies accountable to ensure that the 5 \n     percent goal is achieved during fiscal year 2000.\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4334-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Having lost his first challenge against the State Board of \nElections, the plaintiff now is bringing an identical challenge to the \nGeorgia election laws through the use of the ancient writ of quo \nwarranto.\n  Senator Cleland, who was elected to the Senate almost four years ago, \nin 1996, in an election that was not the subject of any election \ncontest brought before the Senate, is sued solely because of his \nofficial capacity as a sitting Senator. This quo warranto action in \nessence challenges his taking of the oath of office, as well as the \nSenate's action in seating him. As such, it falls appropriately within \nthe Senate Legal Counsel's statutory responsibility to represent \nMembers of the Senate in civil actions in which they are sued in their \nofficial capacity.\n  The writ of quo warranto can have no applicability to United States \nSenators or Representatives, as Article I, section 5 of the United \nStates Constitution commits to each House of Congress the sole power to \nseat and remove its Members. This action is also barred by the speech \nor debate clause.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent \nSenator Cleland to seek his dismissal from this matter.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and a statement of explanation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 313) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 313\n\n       Whereas, Senator Max Cleland has been named as a defendant \n     in the case of Harold A. Johnson v. Max Cleland, et al., Case \n     No. 2000CV22443, now pending in the Superior Court of Fulton \n     County, Georgia;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(1), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent Members of the Senate in civil actions with respect \n     to their official responsibilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent Senator Max Cleland in the case of Harold A. \n     Johnson v. Max Cleland, et al.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/23/senate-section/article/S4334-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4334-S4335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL CHILD'S DAY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Res. 296) designating the first Sunday in \n     June of each calendar year as ``National Child's Day''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on the \nJudiciary, with an amendment, as follows:\n  (The part of the bill intended to be stricken is shown in boldface \nbrackets and the part of the bill intended to be inserted is shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                              S.
