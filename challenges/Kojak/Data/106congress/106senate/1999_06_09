Mr. President, a funny thing happened before the Memorial \nDay recess. We finally did something around here. I say ``a funny \nthing'' because we haven't done that much to write home about. What \nhappened was we had the juvenile justice bill come before this body. It \nwas debated. Amendments were offered. Votes were taken. The Senate \npassed the bill by a large bipartisan majority.\n  I think that is the way we ought to be doing our business rather than \nhaving a bill brought up and having the so-called amendment tree filled \nto prevent those of us on this side of the aisle from bringing up \namendments. I think the way the juvenile justice bill was handled was \ngood. I hope we see more of that openness on the floor of the Senate.\n  When we had the juvenile justice bill before us, we did some good \nthings. One of the good things we did was to pass some commonsense gun \nlaws.\n  Now, after a 2-week break, the House is going to be taking up the \njuvenile justice bill and looking at these gun laws and deciding on \nwhich of them they are going to move forward. From the reports I read \nin the paper today--I haven't read the House bill yet, although we are \ngoing over it now--those gun laws are significantly weakened.\n  I say to my friends in the House, where I proudly served for 10 \nyears, if anything, you should strengthen those laws, not weaken those \nlaws. We had the Lautenberg amendment that passed. As I understand it, \nit has been weakened over on the House side, opening up new loopholes \nso that people at gun shows can call themselves exhibitors and not have \nto pay attention to all the important background checks that should \ntake place before a gun is purchased at a gun show. So we will be \nwatching.\n\n  As the people were very happy to see us do sensible gun laws, they \nalso are waiting for us to do something else. That has to do with their \nhealth care. That has to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights. That has \nto do with the fact that many HMOs are not treating patients in the \nright fashion.\n  I know we are taking up the Y2K bill to protect businesses from \nlawsuits. It is an important bill. I am glad we are taking it up. I \nhave my opinions on it. I will be offering an amendment on it. I hope I \ncan support it.\n  But what about the vast majority of Americans who need us to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Somehow this keeps going to the back of the \nlist. More and more Americans need us to look at their problems: Women \nwho can't get access to their OB/GYNs or, if they do, it is very \nrestrictive; people who get taken to an emergency room far away from \nthe closest one and are told that this really wasn't an emergency, \nbecause, guess why, they didn't die, so then their HMO doesn't cover \nthe visit; a child needs to see a specialist and can't see one or has a \nchronic condition and must always see a specialist and go through \nbureaucratic hoops to see that specialist.\n  I thought we honored our children. That is not the way to treat a \nsick child. We should be making the lives of our children easier, not \nharder, especially when they are very sick.\n  Worst of all, HMOs cannot be held accountable in court. You cannot \nsue your HMO, even if the HMO made a medical decision that resulted in \na patient's death or put someone in a coma permanently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator from California \nhave expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to complete in 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the practices of too many HMOs are \noutrageous. It is equally outrageous that we haven't had a chance to \nbring that bill to the floor for debate. We on this side of the aisle \nspent all last year pleading to bring it up, but we were met with delay \nand obstruction, just as we did on the minimum wage.\n  We fought hard to finally get a minimum wage bill brought up a couple \nof Congresses ago. We are going to fight hard again to get a new \nminimum wage bill brought up, to get a Patients' Bill of Rights brought \nup. We are not going to stop until it happens. We want to make this \nSenate relevant to the lives of our people, just as we did when we took \nup the juvenile justice bill. I look forward to working with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle on a Patients' Bill of Rights, raising the \nminimum wage, and other issues we need to take up.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6730-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month for the first time in a \ngeneration, the Senate voted for some reasonable additions to the \nnational gun control legislation.\n  We principally did three things of value to our country: We voted to \nban the possession of assault weapons by minors; we voted to require \nbackground checks on the purchase of firearms at the 4,000 gun shows \nheld nationally in our country; and to require that firearms come \nequipped with a child safety lock.\n  They were hard-won victories. Each in their own right was an \nimportant statement about our commitment to the safety of our citizens. \nEach represents America coming to terms with the level of gun violence \nin America. But it is important that they be held in some perspective, \nbecause none was particularly bold. While they make a contribution to \ndealing with the problem, they do not begin to end the problem.\n  Now the House of Representatives has another chance to build on the \nwork of the Senate and respond to the needs of the American people, the \ndesperate need to have some reasonable\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nlevels of gun control to protect our citizens. The simple truth is that \nwe have a great deal more to do. Every year, 34,000 Americans are \nvictims of gun violence. Firearms are now the second leading cause of \ndeath, after car accidents, and gaining quickly. The lethal mix of guns \nand children is particularly disturbing. Fourteen children are dying \nevery day from gunfire. Teenage boys are more likely to die from \ngunshots than all natural causes combined. It is not simply a problem. \nIt is not enough to call it a crisis. There is an epidemic of gun \nviolence that is consuming our citizens generally and our children in \nparticular.\n  In truth, there are many causes. No one measure in either gun control \nlegislation or in addressing this problem generally is going to solve \nthe problem. Those who wait for a single answer to solve a complex \nsocietal problem will never be part of a solution. Our schools will \nplay different roles. Our parents are learning the difficulties of \nraising children in a changing and complex society. The media will \nlearn new levels of individual voluntary responsibility. But, as \ncertainly as each of those elements is a part of dealing with gun \nviolence in America, and particularly the new problems of youth and \nschool violence, so, too, this Congress and gun control is an element.\n\n  In the last 2 months the shootings in Littleton, CO, and Conyers, GA, \nhave represented a potential historic turning point on this issue. \nAlmost certainly, when the history of our generation is written, the \nevents in Conyers and Littleton will be seen in the same light as the \npublishing of Rachel Carlson's ``Silent Spring'' is seen as the \nbeginning of the environmental movement or the 1960s march on \nWashington is for civil rights.\n  It may be possible we have now reached a critical mass in this \ncountry where, as a majority of the American people have otherwise been \nrelatively silent on this issue while a small minority seemed to \ncontrol and monopolize both the national debate and the political \njudgments, now the balance may be changing. If, indeed, we have reached \nthis point of change, then this Congress will respond by doing several \nthings that are meaningful in ending gun violence:\n  First, restrict the sales of handguns to one per month. It is not \nunreasonable that Americans limit their consumption of handguns to one \nevery 30 days, and it is a real contribution to dealing with this \nproblem, because States such as my own, New Jersey, which have had \nreasonable gun control for 30 years, are being frustrated. Mr. \nPresident, 80 percent of the guns used to commit felonies in New Jersey \nare coming from five States that do not have similar gun control. Guns \nare being purchased wholesale in other States and taken to my State for \nuse in the commission of a crime. Limiting purchases to one a month \nwill prohibit it from becoming profitable for people to engage in this \nunseemly business.\n  Second, reinstitute the Brady waiting period. Even if we perfect the \ntechnology of an instant background check to assure that people with \nmental illness or felony convictions do not buy guns, a cooling off \nperiod is still valuable. In this nation, the most likely person to \nshoot another citizen is a member of his or her own family in a crime \nof passion or rage. A cooling off period to separate the rage from the \npurchase of the gun and the act could save thousands of lives.\n  Third, require that handguns be made with smart gun technology. We \nhave the technology to assure that the person who fires a gun owns the \ngun--a thumbprint or another means of electronic identification. That \ntechnology is in hand. It can be perfected. If it is not available \ntoday, it can be available soon. It can separate criminals from guns \nthat are being stolen out of our own houses, our own stores, and \nkilling our own people.\n  Fourth and finally, to regulate firearms, as every other consumer \nproduct, to ensure that firearms are safely designed, built, and \ndistributed, not only for the general public but specifically and, more \nimportantly, for the people who are actually buying the guns.\n  Together, these four measures represent a comprehensive national \npolicy of responding to the growing spiral of gun violence in our \nsociety. Individually, none of them will meaningfully solve the \nproblem, but together they represent an important statement and a \ncritical beginning, using our technology, our common sense, and our \nlaws to protect our citizens. Ironically, they principally benefit the \npeople who own and buy guns, who are most likely to be hurt by a \ngun improperly made or distributed or stolen from their own home.\n\n  In recent months, we are recognizing that what the Federal Government \nis failing to do in dealing with gun violence other levels of \ngovernment are doing, particularly the mayors of our cities--New \nOrleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Camden County in my home State, Philadelphia \nthrough Mayor Rendell--who are beginning lawsuits to hold gun \nmanufacturers responsible for how they manufacture these guns and how \nthey distribute them. I am proud they are doing so but not proud that \nthe Federal Government is not part of this effort. The simple truth is, \nin a society in which the Federal Government regulates the content of \nour air, the quality of our water, virtually every measure of consumer \nproduct for its safety, its design and its content, the single \nexception is guns manufactured in the United States. By statute, the \nATF is prohibited from engaging in the regulation of the design and \ndistribution of firearms.\n  A toy gun is regulated for its design: The size of its parts, to \nprotect an infant child, the contents of the materials. A toy gun is \ncompletely regulated by the Federal Government. But the actual gun, \nincluding the TEC-9 used in Columbine High School, is not. No one could \nrationally explain that contradiction, but it is the truth. Indeed, as \nI have demonstrated on this chart, a child's teddy bear is regulated \nfor its edges, its points, small parts, hazardous materials, its \nflammability, but a gun--which 14 times a day takes a life--that may be \nin the same home, in proximity to that child is not.\n  I want to point out that in the Firearms Safety Consumer Protection \nAct we deal with each of these issues. I urge my colleagues to consider \nit and lend their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am here today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Torricelli and Senator Boxer and others, who are pointing out \nthat America has recently been both shocked and, we hope, awakened to \nthe danger of gun violence throughout our land and particularly the gun \nviolence that envelops our children.\n  A few weeks ago, last month, we in this Senate began to recognize \nthat the people of the United States want reasonable gun control \npolicies. They want these policies to protect themselves and \nparticularly to protect their children. During consideration of the \njuvenile justice bill, we made some progress by passing a ban on the \njuvenile possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and a ban on the \nimportation of high-capacity ammunition clips. We saw Republicans join \nall Democrats in voting to require that child safety devices be sold \nwith all handguns. Finally, with a historic, tie-breaking vote by the \nVice President, we passed the Lautenberg amendment to firmly close the \ngun show and pawnshop loophole by requiring background checks on all \nsales and allowing law enforcement up to 72 hours to conduct these \nbackground checks, as currently permitted by the Brady law.\n  These are the kinds of measures that Democrats in Congress have been \nadvocating for years. It is unfortunate that it took the Littleton \ntragedy to bring our colleagues in the majority around to our way of \nthinking. We welcome even these small steps in the right direction. But \nthese are, indeed, small steps, and we need to do much more. We should \nreinstate the Brady waiting period, which expired last November, to \nprovide a cooling off period before the purchase of a handgun. My \ncolleague from New Jersey said it so well: Too often crimes with \nhandguns are crimes of rage and passion. A cooling off period might \ninsulate the acquisition of the gun from the crime of passion or rage. \nEven if we do perfect the instant check, this waiting period will still \nplay a very valuable role in ensuring that handguns are not the source \nof violence and death in our society. We should also pass a child \naccess prevention law to hold adults responsible if they allow a child \nto gain access to a firearm and that child uses the firearm to harm \nanother.\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n  These are the types of protections that are, indeed, necessary.\n  In addition, we should completely close the Internet gun sales \nloophole, something the Senate failed to do last month when we were \nconsidering the juvenile justice bill. We all know the increasing power \nof the Internet to sell goods and services. Whatever is happening now \nin the distribution of firearms through the Internet is merely a \nglimpse and a foreshadowing of what will happen in the months and years \nahead. We should act now, promptly, so we can establish sensible rules \nwith respect to the Internet sale of firearms.\n  I also believe that we should apply to guns the same consumer product \nregulations which we apply to virtually every other product in this \ncountry. Again, the Senator from New Jersey was very eloquent when he \ndescribed the paradox, the unexplainable paradox, the situation in \nwhich we regulate toy guns but we cannot by law, in any way, shape or \nform, regulate real guns. If toy guns, teddy bears, lawn mowers, and \nhair dryers are all subject to regulation to ensure they include \nfeatures to minimize the dangers to children, why not firearms?\n  I have introduced legislation to allow the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to regulate firearms to protect children and adults against \nunreasonable risk of injury. I know my friend and colleague from New \nJersey has introduced a bill to allow the Treasury Department to \nregulate firearms. Whichever agency ultimately has oversight, the \nimportant thing is that guns should no longer be the only consumer \nproduct exempt from even the most basic safety regulations.\n  Finally, I believe that gun dealers should be held responsible if \nthey violate Federal law by selling a firearm to a minor, a convicted \nfelon, or others prohibited from buying firearms.\n  Currently, there are over 104,000 federally licensed firearms dealers \nin the United States. While most of these dealers are responsible small \nbusiness people, recent tracing of crime guns by the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms has found substantial evidence that some dealers \nare selling guns to juveniles and convicted felons. This direct \ndiversion of weapons from retail to illegal markets is taking place \nboth through off-the-book sales by corrupt dealers and through so-\ncalled straw purchases, when an ineligible buyer has a friend or \nrelative buy a firearm for him or her.\n\n  Indeed, just this week, my colleague, Senator Schumer, from New York \nreleased a study of Federal firearms data that reveals a stunning \nnumber of crime guns being sold by a very, very small proportion of the \nNation's gun dealers. According to data supplied by the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, just 1 percent of this country's gun \ndealers sold nearly half of the guns used in crime last year. The \nstatistics suggest we must move aggressively against these dealers who \nare flouting the laws and who are disregarding public safety.\n  To remedy this situation, I have introduced S. 1101, the Gun Dealer \nResponsibility Act, which would provide a statutory cause of action for \nvictims of gun violence against dealers whose illegal sale of a gun \ndirectly contributes to the victim's injury. I believe this legislation \nwill make unscrupulous gun dealers think twice about to whom they will \nsell a weapon, particularly if they intend to sell it to minors, \nconvicted felons or any other ineligible buyer, either directly or \nthrough straw purchases.\n  Anyone who honestly considers the tragic events in Littleton 1 month \nago and the 13 children who die from gun violence each day in this \ncountry must concede that our young people have far too easy and \nunlimited access to guns. It is a shameful commentary that in this \ncountry today, in 1999, for too many children it is easier to get a gun \nthan it is to get counseling. We have to work on both fronts--improving \nour schools and access to mental health services and counseling and \nsupport--but we also have to close the loopholes which make it easy for \nyoungsters to get guns. Last year, 6,000 American students were \nexpelled from elementary or high school for bringing a gun into the \nschool building. That, too, is an indication that we have to work to \nensure that children do not have access to firearms.\n  We must do more than just keeping the guns away, but that is \nsomething we have to do right now in a comprehensive and coherent way.\n  The measures I have suggested and the measures that my colleague from \nNew Jersey suggested are sensible parts of a comprehensive strategy to \ndo what every American wants done: to keep weapons out of the hands of \nyoung children who may use them to harm themselves or harm others.\n  I hope that having been awakened by the tragedy in Littleton, we are \nready to move progressively and aggressively to remedy this situation \nin the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, when I first got into this business of \nbeing involved in Congress many years ago and also involved in \nfundraising activities, I remember trying to compose a fundraising \nletter. I sat down at my desk and drafted one. I thought I put out a \npretty good fundraising letter to constituents saying why I thought I \nwas the best person running for a particular office and would they \nplease consider sending a contribution to me because I was obviously \nthe best person for the job.\n  I shared the draft of my fundraising letter with one of the \nprofessional people who does this for a living. He looked at it, read \nit and said: This will never do.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: It is not outrageous enough.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: In order to get people to extend money to you in your \nelection, you have to be outrageous in the letter, be as outrageous as \nyou possibly can; don't worry about whether it is totally accurate. \nJust make sure it gets the people's attention and really scares the you \nknow what out of them in order for them to feel like it is absolutely \nessential that to save their future, they need to send you a political \ncontribution.\n  I said: I am not going to do that. It doesn't fit how I operate, and \nI think it is a wrong thing to try and scare people.\n  Apparently, there are organizations in this city that think \notherwise. I call to my colleagues' attention one of them called the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. It is a \nvery noble-sounding organization. They sent out this letter, a bright \nyellow thing, and it came in an envelope that is enough to look like it \nis from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  It says: ``Urgent Express. Please expedite. Dated material \nenclosed.''\n  It would really get your attention if you walked out to the mailbox \nand received this. But also, if you are a senior, you would be scared \nto death if you thought what they were telling you was true.\n  It starts off by saying the Breaux-Thomas effort to fix Medicare is \ngoing to basically destroy Medicare by giving you a voucher instead of \na guaranteed contribution for your Medicare benefits. No. 1, that is \nabsolutely, totally inaccurate, incorrect, misleading, false and \nanything else you want to call it.\n  What we do is give seniors the same type of system that every one of \nus as Federal employees, including Members of the Senate, has. Under \nour plan, it is guaranteed in law that the Federal Government will \ncontribute 88 percent of the cost of whatever plan the seniors take. \nThe seniors would pay about 12 percent. That is what they pay now. That \nis not a voucher. For them to say it is a voucher is misleading, false, \nand intended to simply scare people into giving more money.\n  If you look at the rest of their letter, they say you do not get \nguaranteed benefits. That is not true. The statute clearly says that \nyou will have the same guaranteed benefits that you get under Medicare \ntoday. That is in statute. That is guaranteed. What they have to say is \nfalse.\n  What they are really trying to do, in addition to scaring seniors, is \nthey are trying to raise money from them; tell\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\nthem anything to scare them to death and hope they send money.\n  I was underlining all the times they said, ``please send money'' in \nthis letter. It is one after another.\n  It says on page 3: ``. . . we need your signature . . . and your \ngenerous special donation . . . .''\n  Then they go on to say: ``We also need as generous a donation as you \ncan afford. . . .''\n  They then talk about sending a special donation to help us with our \neffort, and by making a special donation today, we can help save \nMedicare; endorsing this with as generous, and then they call it an \n``emergency donation''--they go from ``special donation'' to send us an \n``emergency donation'' to stop what Breaux and Thomas are trying to do \nby fixing Medicare.\n  Then they say:\n\n       [Please] boost our grassroots efforts by including an \n     emergency contribution with your Petition. Your contribution \n     of [$10] or $25, will be used to reinforce [our] message. . . \n     . I've suggested [some] contribution amounts, but anything \n     you can give will help more than you know. Please decide the \n     most you can afford and enclose your check with your signed . \n     . . Petition in the enclosed envelope . . . .\n\n  Your emergency donation is needed ``along with your contribution of \n[blank] or [blank] in the envelope provided.''\n  Mr. President, this is a fundraising letter intended to scare seniors \ninto digging into their pockets, into their retirement funds and \nfunding this operation so they can continue to put out false, \nerroneous, inaccurate information, information which is simply not \ntrue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. I would \nlike for him to go on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana be allowed as much additional time as he needs.\n  Mr. BREAUX. This is not the way to fix Medicare, by scaring seniors. \nThey do not mention that under the current Medicare program the \npremiums are going to double by the year 2007 if we do not do anything \nto fix it. That should really scare seniors into saying we need to do \nsomething to fix the program for our children and our grandchildren. \nBut to send out false information calling the program a voucher, which \nit clearly is not, and to say it does not have the defined benefits, \nwhich it clearly does, all under the guise of scaring seniors into \ndigging into their pockets and sending money that they need for food \nand groceries and extra Medicare benefits that they do not get now is \nsomething they should be ashamed of.\n  I think all of us know what they are trying to do. We just have to \nstand up and say it like it is and call it what it is. This is \nshameful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6733-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 96\n\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, I am pleased to start out by offering a \nsubstitute amendment to S. 96, the Y2K Act. This substitute amendment \nis truly a bipartisan effort. It represents spirited discussion, hard \nfought compromise, and agreement with a number of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, led by Senators Dodd, Wyden, Hatch, Feinstein, \nBennett, Lieberman, Gorton, Lott, Abraham, Santorum, and Smith of \nOregon.\n  The substitute is at the desk, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Lott, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Frist, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 608.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wyden for being one of the \ntrue leaders on this bill. Senator Wyden said at our committee markup \nthat he wanted to get to ``yes.'' He has worked tirelessly with me and \nothers to get there. Having not only the necessary majority vote but \nthe 60 votes necessary to move forward is directly related to his \nefforts.\n  I also thank Senator Dodd of Connecticut. He has offered an important \nperspective and has provided excellent suggestions and comments which I \nthink make this substitute we offer today a better piece of \nlegislation.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues, especially the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, for their unflinching dedication to dialogue, to working \nthrough our differences and remaining focused on the common goal of \nenacting this critical piece of legislation. Without the leadership of \nSenators Dodd and Wyden, this bipartisan effort would not have been \npossible.\n  Before I talk about the legislation and the language of the \nsubstitute itself, I would like to note that there was a unanimous \nconsent agreement that 12 amendments would be in order on both sides. \nWe are now in the process of working with the sponsors of those \namendments, some of which we can agree to, some of which may require \nvotes. But I hope my colleagues will also come over here ready to offer \nthose amendments so that in a very short period of time we can begin to \ndispense with them.\n  We all know the very heavy schedule of legislation that lies before \nus between now and the next recess on the Fourth of July. So I am \nhopeful we can take up and dispense with these amendments in a timely \nfashion.\n  The first effort, obviously, will be to get time agreements on those \namendments that we are unable to get agreement on, although I believe, \nfrom a first look at many of these amendments, we will be able to work \nout language so that we can accept a number of them. In fact, I think \nsome of them will improve the legislation.\n\n  I want to walk through the details of this substitute amendment and \nthe background and history of this bill.\n  First, let me summarize what this substitute contains.\n  Specifically, the substitute amendment:\n  Provides time for plaintiffs and defendants to resolve Y2K problems \nwithout litigation.\n  It reiterates the plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages and highlights \nthe defendant's opportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing that by \nproviding information and resources.\n  It provides for proportional liability in most cases, with exceptions \nfor fraudulent or intentional conduct or where the plaintiff has \nlimited assets.\n  It protects governmental entities, including municipalities, school, \nfire, water, and sanitation districts, from punitive damages.\n  It eliminates punitive damage limits for egregious conduct while \nproviding small businesses some protection against runaway punitive \ndamage awards.\n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\n  And it provides protection for those not directly involved in a Y2K \nfailure.\n  The substitute, as the original bill, does not--I emphasize, does \nnot--cover personal injury and wrongful death cases.\n  The specific changes the substitute makes from the version of the \nbill which Senator Wyden and I offered in April are those proposed by \nSenator Dodd. It eliminates the director and officer liability caps, it \neliminates the punitive damages caps for businesses with more than 50 \nemployees, it provides that State evidentiary standards will be used in \nspecific situations, and it preserves the protections provided in the \nYear 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.\n  Let me be quite blunt. These revisions represent significant \ncompromise. They move this bill a considerable distance from the Y2K \nbill passed by the House. Even with these compromises, I believe the \nbill will accomplish the goals for the legislation--to encourage \nremediation and prevention of Y2K problems and eliminate frivolous and \nopportunistic litigation which can only serve to damage our economy. \nHowever, I do not believe any additional compromises are necessary or \nwarranted.\n  I want to reemphasize that point. There have been additional efforts \nmade to have us accept or work on additional changes to the bill. We \nrun the risk right now of compromising to the degree where it makes \nthese protections, if not meaningless, so reduced that we are not able \nto achieve the goal we seek. So I do not intend--nor do, I believe, the \nmajority of my colleagues, including those on the other side of the \naisle--to continue to work behind the scenes towards a compromise. If \nthere is a change that Members believe needs to be made to this \nlegislation, then let's go through the amending process, let's have a \ntime limit on debate, and vigorously debate and educate our colleagues, \nand then have votes.\n  We have, thanks to Senator Wyden, moved a significant way, and also \nthanks to Senator Dodd; we have done that. We cannot move from our \nposition further. Yet we do obviously have 12 amendments in order on \nthat side, 12 amendments on this side, which is ample opportunity for \ndebate and discussion about this issue and further amending, obviously, \nwith majority rule.\n\n  So I point out again, these are significant compromises that have \nalready been made, some of them to the dissatisfaction of some of our \nconstituents. It has not made everybody happy. But having been around \nhere now for some years, it is my firm belief that we have to make \ncompromises, because that is the essence of legislation. But we have \nmade enough compromises that we can no longer make any further changes \nwithout compromising the fundamental principles behind this \nlegislation.\n  Let me make one other point. Time is of the essence here. We cannot \ndally. We cannot wait until the end of the year when Y2K is upon us.\n  Already lawsuits have been filed, some of them pretty interesting, \nand emphasize, at least to my mind, the necessity of this legislation.\n  But we need to move. I fully intend, once we pass this legislation, \nto move to conference as quickly as possible. There are differences \nbetween the House-passed legislation and this legislation. I am \nabsolutely convinced we will be able to reach agreement in conference \nand come back here before the recess with a final conference report and \nbill to be approved by both Houses.\n  I am committed to passing legislation which is effective. I am not \ninterested in passing a meaningless facade. We will do the public a \ngreat disservice to claim victory in passing legislation which leaves \nloopholes for spurious litigation. If we aren't going to legitimately \nfix the problem, then we must be forthright with the public and tell \nthem it could not be done. I think that would be a disastrous result, \nbut it would be more honest than to pretend to provide a solution and \nnot.\n  This bill deserves the support of every Member of the Senate. It is \nfair, practical, and legally justifiable. It is important not only to \nthe high-tech industry or only to big businesses but carries the strong \nsupport of small businesses, retailers, and wholesalers.\n  The coalition of support for this bill is compelling. Yesterday a \npress conference was held to reiterate the support of the overwhelming \nmajority of the Nation's gross national product: the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; the National Association of Manufacturers; the National \nRetail Federation; virtually every high-tech industrial association, \nincluding the ITAA, the Business Software Alliance, and others who \nparticipated, to emphasize the need for the bill and their support for \nthe compromises which have been made.\n\n  Many of those supporting this legislation will find themselves as \nboth plaintiffs and defendants. They have weighed the benefits and \ndrawbacks of the provisions of this legislation and have overwhelmingly \nconcluded that their chief priority is to prevent and fix Y2K problems \nand make our technology work, not to divert their resources into time-\nconsuming and costly litigation.\n  The estimated cost of litigation associated with fixing the Y2K \nproblem is really quite enormous. In the view of some, it is as high as \n$1 trillion. I do not know if it is that high, but already major \ncorporations in America have spent millions and millions, in some cases \ntens of millions, of dollars in fixing existing problems. If we throw \ninto the mix the litigation we have already seen the beginnings of, it \ncould really have an effect, not only on the ability of our businesses \nto do business, not only on the ability of our high-tech corporations \nto continue investing in research and development and improvements in \ntechnology, but it really would have a significant effect on our \noverall economy. You take that much money out of our economy in the \nform of litigation, you are going to feel the economic impacts of it.\n  Let me remind my colleagues how this legislation came to be, its \ngenesis and rationale. The origin, as we all know, of the Y2K problem \nwas in the 1950s and 1960s, when computer memory was oppressively \nexpensive. According to the February 24, 1999, report of the Senate \nSpecial Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, headed by \nSenators Bennett and Dodd, in the IBM 7094 of the early 1960s, core \nmemory cost around $1 per byte. By comparison, today's semiconductor \nmemory costs around $1 per million bytes. Thus, there was a strong \nincentive to minimize the storage required for a program and data.\n  A two-digit data code became the industry standard in order to \neconomize on storage space. It was presumed that sometime during the 40 \nor 50 years before the end of the millennium, the coding would be \nchanged as computer memory became more accessible. Unfortunately, \nalthough memory costs fell dramatically, the interface requirements of \nold software with new discouraged and slowed the changeover process. \nThe computer equipment and software that was expected to become \nobsolete survived many layers and programming updates. The result is \nthat the two-digit programs are not designed to recognize dates beyond \n1999 and may not be able to process data-related operations beyond \nDecember 31 of this year.\n  Although some who oppose this litigation charge that the solutions \nare simple and should have been completed long ago, the reality is not \nthat simple. First, there are over 500 programming languages in use \ntoday. A universally compatible Y2K solution would have to be \ncompatible with most or many of these languages. Embedded processors in \nembedded chips have to be found and replaced. There are also several \nways to reprogram causing additional interfacing issues.\n  Technical approaches to solving the problem include reprogramming all \ntwo-digit date codes with a four-digit date code; windowing the date \ncodes to make programs think that the two-digit codes are applicable to \nthe year 2000 and beyond; and encapsulation which, like the windowing \nmethod, tricks the computer program into thinking that the two-digit \ndate code is applicable beyond 1999. Unless the same approach is taken \nin all computers, additional programming is required to allow interface \nof four-digit codes with two-digit codes which have been windowed or \nencapsulated.\n\n  Let me read from a recent publication of the National Legal Center \nfor the Public Interest, the Year 2000 Challenge, Legal Problems and \nSolutions, which summarizes why the year 2000 problem is so difficult \nto solve.\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n  I quote from the article from the National Legal Center for the \nPublic Interest:\n\n       One of the most insidious characteristics of the Year 2000 \n     problem is that the difficulty of solving it in any \n     particular organization often is so underestimated. Since \n     both the nature of the problem and the actions needed to fix \n     it are relatively easy to explain, people who are not \n     familiar with IT projects in general and the peculiar \n     difficulties of Year 2000 projects in particular tend to \n     think of Year 2000 projects as less difficult and risky than \n     they really are.\n       The unfortunate fact is that there is no ``silver bullet'' \n     solution to the Year 2000 problem in any organization, and \n     the risks and difficulties in any Year 2000 project of even \n     moderate size and complexity can be enormous. None of the \n     remediation techniques described above is without \n     disadvantage, and for many IT users the time and resources \n     required to accomplish Year 2000 remediation far exceed what \n     is available. Most major remediation programs involve finding \n     and correcting date fields in millions of lines of poorly \n     documented or undocumented code. There is no single foolproof \n     method of finding date fields, no assurance that all date \n     fields will be found, corrected, or corrected accurately, and \n     no assurance that corrections will not produce unintended and \n     undesirable consequences elsewhere in the program. In many \n     cases it will be necessary to rely on information or \n     assurances from third-party vendors regarding the Year 2000 \n     compliance of their products, even though experience teaches \n     that many such representations are inaccurate or misleading. \n     Comprehensive end-to-end system testing of remediated systems \n     in a simulated Year 2000 ``production'' environment is often \n     impractical or impossible, and less intensive testing may \n     fail to detect uncorrected problems. And even when an IT user \n     has succeeded in making its own system Year 2000 ready, Year \n     2000 date handling programs of external programs or systems \n     (such as the systems of customers or suppliers) can often \n     have a devastating effect on internal operations.\n\n  In addition to the technical problems with solving the problems, we \nmust consider the cost dimension of the Y2K problems. From the ITAA, \nInformation Technology Association of America, Year 2000 website, I \nhave the following information:\n\n       At $450 to $600 per affected computer program, the Gartner \n     Group has estimated that a medium-sized company will spend \n     between $3.6-$4.2 million to convert its software. The cost-\n     per-line-of-code has been estimated between $1.00-$1.50. \n     Viasoft estimates cost-per-impacted-programs between $572-\n     $1,204.\n       Estimates place correcting the problem for businesses and \n     the public sector in the United States alone between $100-\n     $200 billion. If you accept the premise that the total \n     information technology services marketplace in America \n     approaches $150 billion annually; that means Year 2000 \n     Software Conversion could represent anywhere from 33%-50% of \n     dollars spent for information systems in one year. Some ITAA \n     Year 2000 Task Group members report estimates placing the \n     worldwide total to correct the problem between $300 to $600 \n     billion.\n\n  In addition, the Senate Year 2000 Committee in its report cites \nfigures for several specific companies, as well as total costs which \ninclude estimated litigation costs.\n\n       There is no generally agreed upon answer to this question. \n     The Gartner Group's estimate of $600 billion worldwide is a \n     frequently cited number. Another number from a reputable \n     source is that of Capers Jones, Software Productivity \n     Research, Inc. of Burlington, MA. Jones' worldwide estimate \n     is over $1.6 trillion.\\5\\ Part of the difference is that \n     Jones' estimate includes over $300 billion for litigation and \n     damages but Gartner's does not. A sense of the scale of the \n     cost can be gained from looking at the Y2K costs of six \n     multinational financial services institutions; Citicorp, \n     General Motors, Bank America, Credit Suisse Group, Chase \n     Manhattan and J.P. Morgan. These six institutions have \n     collectively estimated their Y2K costs to be over $2.4 \n     billion.\n\n  Mr. President, the point here is that this is a complex technical \nproblem with no easy, cheap solution. Although the opponents of this \nlegislation would have us believe that Y2K failures can only result \nfrom negligence or dereliction on the part of the technology industry, \nand all those who use computer hardware and software, in truth, massive \nefforts are underway, and have been for some time, to prevent the Y2K \nproblem from occurring. Even with the nearly incomprehensible amounts \nof money being devoted to reprogramming date codes in virtually every \nbusiness and industry in our country, there are going to be failures. \nWell-intentioned companies, acting in good faith, are nevertheless \ngoing to encounter problems in their systems, or in the interface of \ntheir systems with other systems, or as a result of some other \ncompany's system.\n  But what experts are also concluding is that the real problems and \ncosts associated with Y2K may not be the January 1 failures, but the \nlawsuits filed to create problems where none exist. An article in USA \nToday on April 28 by Kevin Maney sums it up:\n\n       Experts have increasingly been saying that the Y2K problem \n     won't be so bad, at least relative to the catastrophe once \n     predicted. Companies and governments have worked hard to fix \n     the bug. Y2K-related breakdowns expected by now have been low \n     to nonexistent. For the lawyers, this could be like training \n     for the Olympics, then having the games called off.\n       The concern, though, is that this species of Y2K lawyer has \n     proliferated, and now it's got to eat something. If there \n     aren't enough legitimate cases to go around, they may dig \n     their teeth into anything. . . . In other words, lawyers \n     might make sure Y2K is really bad, even if it's not.\n\n  Mr. President, the sad truth in our country today is that litigation \nhas become an industry. While there are many fine, scrupulous attorneys \nrepresenting their clients in ethical fashion, there are also many \nopportunistic lawyers looking for new ``inventories'' of cases. The Y2K \nproblems provide these attorneys with a lottery jackpot.\n  Let me read from an article published in March of this year, by the \nPublic Policy Institute of the Democratic Leadership Council, written \nby Robert D. Atkinson and Joseph M. Ward:\n\n       As the millennium nears, the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer \n     problem poses a critical challenge to our economy. Tremendous \n     investments are being made of fix Y2K problems, with U.S. \n     companies expected to spend more than $50 billion. However, \n     these efforts could be hampered by a barrage of potential \n     litigation, as fear of liability may keep some businesses \n     from effectively engaging in Y2K remediation efforts. Trail \n     attorneys across the country are actually preparing for the \n     potential windfall. For those who doubt the emergences of \n     such a litigation leviathan, one only needs to listen to what \n     is coming out of certain quarters of the legal community. At \n     the American Bar Association annual convention in Toronto \n     last August, a panel of experts predicted that the legal \n     costs associated with Y2K will exceed that of asbestos, \n     breast implants, tobacco, and Superfund litigation \n     combined.\\1\\ That is more than three times the total annual \n     estimated cost of all civil litigation in the United \n     States.\\2\\ Seminars on how to try Y2K cases are well underway \n     and approximately 500 law firms across the country have put \n     together Y2K litigation teams to capitalize on the event.\\3\\ \n     Also, several law suits have already been filed, making trail \n     attorneys confident that a large number of businesses, big \n     and small, will end up in court as both a plaintiff and \n     defendant. Such overwhelming litigation would reduce \n     investment and slow income growth for American workers. \n     Indeed, innovation and economic growth would be stifled by \n     the rapacity of strident litigators.\n\n  I want to point out that is from the Public Policy Institute of the \nDemocratic Leadership Council.\n  Mr. President, already at least 65 lawsuits--some report as many as \n80--have been filed, and we are still 6 months away from January 1. \nMost of these lawsuits involve potential problems that have not even \noccurred yet. Our nation's legal system is not designed to handle the \ntidal wave of litigation which will undoubtedly occur if we do not act \nto prevent it. We must reserve the courts for the cases with real harm, \nreal factual support, and which cannot be otherwise resolved through \nmediation and resolution.\n  Probably the classic example of opportunistic litigation is a class \naction suit filed in California by Tom Johnson against six major \nretailers. Tom Johnson, acting as a ``private attorney general'' under \nCalifornia consumer protection laws, has brought an action against a \ngroup of retailers, including Circuit City, Office Depot, Office Max, \nCompUSA, Staples, Fryes, and the good guys, inc. for failing to warn \nconsumers about products that are not Y2K compliant.\n  He has not alleged any injury or economic damage to himself, but, \npursuant to state statute, has requested relief in the amount of all of \nthe defendants' profits from 1995 to date from selling these products, \nand restitution to ``all members of the California general public.'' \nAlthough he claims that ``numerous'' products are involved, he has not \nspecified which products are covered by his allegations, but has \ngenerally named products by Toshiba, IBM, Compaq, Intuit, Hewlett \nPackard, and Microsoft.\n  It is crystal clear that the real reason for this lawsuit is not to \nfix a problem that Mr. Johnson has with any of his computer hardware or \nsoftware, but to see whether he can convince the\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\ncompanies involved that it's cheaper to buy him off in a settlement \nthan to litigate--even if the case is eventually dismissed or decided \nin their favor.\n  And, even more interesting, is the history of how this case came to \nbe filed. The Wall Street Journal carried a story on Friday, May 14, \n1999 in its Politics and Policy column by Robert S. Grernberger.\n  It says:\n\n       Michael Verna, a California lawyer, is warning a group of \n     technicians about the dangers ahead if they don't get the \n     gliches out of their companies' computers by the end of the \n     year.\n       Here in Seattle, Mr. Verna is explaining how writing \n     internal memos or careless e-mail could hurt a firm in a Y2K \n     lawsuit. Loretta Pirozzi of Data Dimensions Inc., a \n     consulting firm, complain that most bosses aren't budgeting \n     enough money to fix the problems. A knowing chuckle sweeps \n     the room. Mr. Verna warns that memos on such budget disputes \n     become smoking guns in court.\n       ``What can we do?'' asks another woman.\n       ``Have lawyers show you how to protect your documents, for \n     one thing,'' he says. ``By the way,'' he adds, ``that isn't a \n     sales pitch.''\n       But, of course, it is. Bowles & Verna, a 21-member firm in \n     Walnut Creek, Calif., has a Y2K game plan. It starts with \n     semimars that help develop new clients. The millennium itself \n     will usher in the ``failure litigation phase'' of court \n     fights. And in about five years, just when it seems like \n     everyone has sued everyone else, comes the ``insurance-\n     coverage phase,'' when companies go after their insurers to \n     pay some of their Y2K losses.\n       ``You want to be on the leading edge of the tort of the \n     millennium,'' Mr. Verna says.\n       Bowles & Verna's journey to 2000 began almost by chance, in \n     1997, while Kenneth Jones, then a third-year law student, was \n     playing a computer football game. It is wife, Sandy, was \n     telling him that people were stocking up on canned goods and \n     bottled water for the expected chaos of Y2K. At that moment, \n     Mr. Jones recalls, he had an epiphany.\n       A new area of law, involving future failures due to Y2K \n     bugs, was being born, and Mr. Jones, a law student \n     comfortable with technology, was perfectly positioned for it. \n     He also was headed for a job at Bowles & Verna, where he had \n     been a summer law clerk. ``I decided the firm could be the \n     experts.\n       With Mr. Verna's strong encouragement, the 28-year-old Mr. \n     Jones proded his colleagues, giving some of the firm's \n     techno-challenged lawyers a book, ``Year 2000 Solutions for \n     Dummies.'' Gradually, the firm formed a Y2K team. All it \n     lacked was a client. Then, late last year. Mr. Jones's friend \n     Torn Johnson, a Walnut Creek swimming coach, went shopping \n     for a laptop computer--and Bowles & Verna found its first Y2K \n     lawsuit.\n       But with no apparent injury to Mr. Johnson, the firm needed \n     a legal theory. California's Unfair Business Practices Act \n     came to the rescue. The statute permits citizen lawsuits on \n     behalf of the people of the state to stop unfair or deceptive \n     business practices. And so Mr. Johnson is suing about half a \n     dozen retailers for injunctive relief to require disclosure \n     for Y2K compliance, but not for damages. And, under the state \n     law, Bowles & Verna would collect attorney's fees.\n\n  This is precisely the type of frivolous and opportunistic lawsuit \nwhich would be avoided by S. 96. Rather than have all of these named \ncompanies wasting their time and resources preparing a defense for this \ncase, S. 96 would direct the focus to fixing real problems. In this \ninstance, Mr. Johnson does not have an actual problem, but if he did, \nhe would need to articulate what is not working due to a Y2K failure. \nThe company or companies responsible would then have an opportunity to \naddress and fix the specific problem. If the problem isn't fixed, then \nMr. Johnson would be free to bring his suit.\n  This case is the tip of the iceberg--if thousands of similar suits \nare brought after January 1, the judicial system will be overrun--and \nthe nation's economy will be thrown into turmoil. This is a senseless \nand needless abuse that we can avoid by passing S. 96.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the substance of the substitute \namendment offered today. Without going through every paragraph of the \nbill, let me highlight the most important provisions.\n  Certainly the centerpiece of the bill are the provisions of Section 7 \nregarding notice. This section requires plaintiffs to give defendants \n30 days notice before commencing a lawsuit. This provides an \nopportunity for someone who has been harmed by a Y2K failure to make \nthe person responsible aware of the problem and to fix it. If the \ndefendant doesn't agree to fix the problem, then the plaintiff can sue \non the 31st day. If the defendant does agree to fix the problem, 60 \ndays are permitted to accomplish the remediation before a lawsuit can \nbe filed. This offers a reasonable time and opportunity for people to \nwork out legitimate problems with sincere solutions, without cost of \nlitigation. It focuses on the fact that most people want things to \nwork--they don't want to sue.\n  A corresponding critical element of this legislation is the \nrequirement for specificity in pleadings found in Section 8. Not \nwritten nor intended to cause loopholes for lawyers, the thrust of this \nrequirement is that there must be a real problem in order to sue. Our \njudicial system should not be clogged with possible Y2K failures, nor \nnovel complaints to ensure the payment of lottery style settlements and \nattorneys fees. We must reserve our judicial resources for real \nproblems which have caused real injury which can be redressed by the \ncourt.\n  The Duty to Mitigate in Section 9 is also important. While it is in \nsome respects merely a statement of current law, it highlights the \nemphasis to be placed on preventing problems and injury to the maximum \nextent possible, and articulates the role that prevention information \nmade available by the affected industries can play in limiting injury \nto product users.\n  The economic loss rule found in Section 12 is also a restatement of \nlaw in the majority of states. It is critical, however, because it \nconfirms that damages not available under contract theories of law \ncannot be obtained through tort theories. This is particularly \nimportant here where personal injury claims have been excluded.\n  Punitive damages caps have been retained for small businesses, \ndefined as those with 50 fewer than 50 employees. Punitive damages are \npermitted under some state laws in certain egregious situations \nprimarily as a deterrent from a repetition of the conduct.\n  Punitive damages are awarded primarily as punishment to a defendant. \nThey are intended to deter a repeat of the offensive conduct.\n  Punitive damages are not awarded to compensate losses/damage suffered \nby a plaintiff.\n  The Y2K cases are unusual in that the conduct is not likely to occur \nagain, thus there is little deterrent value in awarding punitive \ndamages.\n  Without a deterrent effect, punitive damages serve only as a windfall \nto plaintiffs and attorneys.\n  Additionally, since we have eliminated personal injuries from \ncoverage of the bill, the only harm caused by defendants will be \neconomic damage, which can be appropriately compensated without the \nneed for punitive awards.\n  Further, excessive punitive damage awards will simply compound the \neconomic impact of Y2K litigation and the costs will be passed along to \nthe public/consumers through higher prices.\n  In this situation, punitive damages truly become a ``lottery'' for \nthe plaintiff, thus they should be limited.\n  S. 96 provides an exception to the caps for intentional injury to the \nplaintiff, which is most likely to be conduct worthy of additional \npunishment.\n  S. 96 protects all governmental entities so that taxpayers are asked \nto provide compensation for actual damages, but not provide windfalls \nto plaintiffs. This is especially important to municipalities and \nspecial districts (school, fire, water and sanitation). This is \nstrongly supported by National League of Cities.\n  Let me speak to some of the points raised by the proposal of Senators \nKerry, Robb, Daschle, Reid, Breaux, and Akaka. While it is encouraging \nthat they agree the Y2K problem is one which must be addressed, it is \nunfortunate that they continue to reject some of the most important \ngoals of the legislation.\n  First, their proposal applies only to ``commercial losses.'' It \nexcludes consumer actions from the scope of the bill. I think this \nexclusion is misguided and merely strengthens the hand of the \nopportunistic lawyers.\n  It denies the consumer the protections afforded by S. 96, including \nthe ability to have problems fixed quickly and without the need for \nexpensive litigation. It places a burden on those least able to afford \nlegal counsel.\n  Notwithstanding the purported attempt to cover consumer claims \nbrought as class actions, in fact it provides a ``lawyers' loophole'' \nby permitting individual claims to be brought\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\nand consolidated or aggregated to avoid the notice and pleading \nrequirements of the class action section.\n  There are no punitive damage limitations or protections, either for \nbusiness (large or small) or for governmental entities. Punitive \ndamages are intended to punish poor behavior and deter a repeat of it \nin the future. Punitive damages do not have such an effect in Y2K \nlitigation because of the uniqueness of the problem. Thus, in Y2K \nlitigation, punitive damages become an incentive for ``jackpot \njustice'' and abusive litigation.\n  The proportionate liability provisions are ineffective in preventing \n``deep pocket'' companies from being targeted by mass litigation.\n  The approach of requiring a defendant to prove itself innocent in \norder to be assured proportionate liability is misguided and ignores \nthe vast array of potential defendants and the myriad of factual \nsituations which may be encompassed in a Y2K action. In particular, \ndefendants who are in the middle of the supply chain may be sued for a \nbreach of a contract caused not by the failure of the defendant's \ncomputers but by those elsewhere in the supply chain.\n\n  Requirements in the Kerry proposal would result in that defendant \nbeing jointly and severally liable--an injustice. The result is, the \ndeep-pocketed defendants will face needless and abusive litigation and \nwill be subjected to either defending or settling such cases, \nregardless of their share of responsibility for causing the plaintiff's \nproblems.\n  The Kerry proposal also fails to encourage settlement of cases before \ntrial. Defendants who do settle with the plaintiff should not be \nsubjected to continued liability or responsibility for other \ndefendants. This defeats the purpose of incentive for early settlement \nin mediation.\n  The Kerry proposal rejects the protections for settling defendants \ncontained in S. 96. The fair rule in this situation is that each \ndefendant pays for the portion of the problem which that defendant \ncauses. S. 96 provides that clear rule, with exceptions patterned after \nthe Securities Act, as proposed by Senator Dodd.\n  There are important differences as well. The Kerry proposal does not \nprotect contracts as negotiated but permits them to be revised and \noverturned by uncertain common law. This results in the parties being \nuncertain of their duties and obligations under their contracts and \nwill increase the likelihood of litigation. The proposal also too \nnarrowly applies the economic loss rule, subjecting defendants to \nbroader damages available under current law in most States.\n  Taken as a whole, the Kerry proposal simply does not provide the \nsolutions which are needed to the Y2K problem. It is a meager attempt \nto provide lip service to the business community while protecting the \ntrial lawyers' income stream. I urge my colleagues to carefully review \nthe details of the proposal and reject this form-over-substance \namendment.\n  I have taken a long time on this legislation. This is a very \nimportant issue, to say the least. It has a profound impact on our \neconomy, on our country, and the lives of men and women who are engaged \nin small, medium, and large business throughout America.\n  This substitute amendment is a good piece of legislation that \ndeserves the support of the Senate. It is not perfect. It certainly \ndoes not provide a wish list of product liability or tort reform. The \nbusiness community certainly would like more than what is in this \ncompromise. The House passed a bill that contained many of the \nprovisions we have eliminated to reach this bipartisan compromise.\n  As in any negotiation process, there must be give and take. We have \ngiven a great deal. I remain convinced that the Y2K problem is real and \nmust be addressed now. I believe that this substitute offered will \nachieve a just and reasonable approach to Y2K: Fair prevention, \nremediation, and litigation. This bill should not be further \nemasculated. It has the support of the broadest possible cross section \nof our Nation's economy. It is a bill which is good for our country. It \nwill ensure that our economy is not derailed with opportunistic \nlitigation.\n  It is critical that it pass without further delay. I ask each of my \ncolleagues for their support in bringing this bill to its final \nsuccessful conclusion and enacting it into law.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina, who I know has the very \nstrongest views on this issue. He is a fierce fighter for the \nprinciples he believes in, which are obviously in opposition to this \nlegislation. However, the Senator from South Carolina has allowed this \nbill to come to the floor. He could easily have blocked it further. I \nappreciate his cooperation in doing so.\n\n  We have 12 amendments that are in order on each side. We would like \nto see those amendments, and we would like to start work on them so we \ncan resolve those and perhaps get time agreements or accept those \namendments on both sides.\n  I thank my two dear friends who are on the floor today, Senator Wyden \nand Senator Dodd, without whose cooperation and effort we would never \nhave reached this stage nor would we reach enactment of this \nlegislation. The essence of doing business in this body on these kinds \nof issues is a bipartisan coalition. That is why we have a 60-vote \nrule, which many times I decry when I am pushing issues which have no \nmore than 50 votes, such as campaign finance reform.\n  I think it also compels Members to work in a bipartisan fashion so we \ncan work together. I argue that at the end of the day the legislation \nis probably much better for it.\n  If it is agreeable with the Senator from South Carolina, I will begin \nwith colleagues on our side and then the other side of the aisle to \nbegin addressing the amendments, so we can get agreement and time \nagreements so we can dispatch this legislation as soon as possible, \nalthough I know that the Senator from South Carolina will have a great \ndeal to say on this issue, as he has in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman is correct, \nthe Senator has had sufficient time now during the negotiations over \nthe past 4 weeks to consider, after hearings before our committee, all \nthe different ramifications and contentions by the parties. It is the \nintent of Members on this side of the aisle to expedite the vote on \nthis particular measure whereby we will have only amendments that are \ngermane to the particular issue, and that they be limited and there be \nno delaying conduct and action.\n  I must address immediately some of the comments made by my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona with respect to trial lawyers, \nwith respect to punitive damages, the lottery, and various other things \nthat go without contest up here in Washington because they look good on \na poll.\n  If we were to poll the States' attorneys general or the Governors, \nthey wouldn't be here at all. The State tort law has taken care of \nproduct liability, according to the American Bar Association, in a very \nefficient manner over the many years. In fact, we have the safest of \nall societies in America as a result of product liability. That is the \nsubject at hand, of course--product liability--namely, the \ncomputerization, the software, the glitch or the Y2K problem that could \noccur January 1, 2000.\n  Everybody is on notice for January 1, 2000. All of these measures \nbefore the Senate--the McCain-Wyden-Dodd amendment--say January 1, if \nwe have a glitch, we should first talk about it for 2 or 3 months. We \nhave 6 months right now. We have had 30 years.\n  The computer industry, the software industry, has appeared before the \ncommittee. They have known about this problem for the past 30 years. \nRoss Perot says it is easy to fix; just take the year 1972; everything \nconforms in the year 2000 with the year 1972, and we have a fix.\n\n  There are other sinister drives, motives, and intents behind this \nparticular measure that must be surfaced at the very outset. This is \nnot a product liability problem for the computer industry. They know \nand have warned everybody, and everybody is making tests. For example, \nthe best of the best, some 2,000 leading industries, are named in March \nin Business Week. The market, of course, has taken care of the problem. \nIt is a nonproblem, as far as Y2K, as far as computerization, as far as \nthe product itself.\n  There is another problem with respect to the Chamber of Commerce, the\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\nBusiness Roundtable, and that crowd coming in here and trying to \ndiminish the rights of consumers, the protection for consumers, of all \nAmericans.\n  March 1 in Business Week, an article tells a story about Lloyd Davis, \nin his Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Colby, KS, business.\n  He needs $71,000 to get his particular system Y2K-compliant. He has a \nproblem. He can borrow up to $39,000, but he has not been able to \nborrow the rest of it.\n  We are not talking about an injured party in an auto collision who \nhas a bad back and brings a frivolous suit--nobody can tell whether the \nback is bad or not until after the verdict--and then walks away. That \nhas happened in America several times. But these are substantial small \nbusinesses. I am quoting now from the article:\n\n       Multinationals such as General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, \n     and Deere, are making the first quarter--or the second at the \n     latest--the deadline for partners and vendors to prove \n     they're bug free. A recent survey says that 69 percent of the \n     2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with \n     companies that can't pass muster.\n\n  Mr. President, 2,000 companies of the blue chip corporations in \nAmerica here are coming forward and saying--already, 2 months ago, 3 \nmonths ago--if you are not compliant by the end of this month, June at \nthe latest, we are going to have to find another supplier. We cannot \nplay around. We have to do business. We are going to others:\n\n       Cutting thousands of companies out of the supply chain \n     might strain supply lines and could even crimp output. But \n     most CEOs figure it will be cheaper in the long run to avoid \n     bugs in the first place.\n       Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the \n     past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers \n     from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, \n     and it continues to look for weak links, says Irene Deck, \n     Vice President for Information Systems at the company. And \n     Citibank Vice President, Ray Apte, ``cuts have already \n     been made.''\n\n  Mr. President, you are talking about frivolous lawsuits. Not with all \nthis warning, with all the record made and public hearings here in the \nGovernment itself and the Congress, with all the chances to cure all \nthe glitches. We have had chance upon chance upon chance and effort \nupon effort. The most recent one here, of course, was just a couple of \nweeks ago in the Washington Post:\n\n       Banking regulators worried about the year 2000 readiness of \n     a big ATM service company in the west have just ordered it to \n     get in shape by June 30 or face possible contract \n     cancellations by its 750 bank customers.\n\n  The point is, business is not telling business let's work it out in \n90 days, like the law that they propose. Business is telling business: \nBlam, you either get with it, business is business, or we are going to \ncut you off.\n  As an old-time trial lawyer, the punitive damages they are talking \nabout is only for willful neglect. By January 1, 6 months from now, we \nhave this big debate, we have the best of minds, we have the best of \nwitnesses, we have the best of software experts coming, everything \nelse--we have the best of business leadership saying: Get with it or we \nare going to cut you off. If they have not gotten with it by January 1, \nthat is willful neglect. All cases after January 1, under the record \nbeing made here in 1999 in the National Government, ought to indicate \nif there ever were an indication of willful neglect, willful \nmisconduct, it would be now on Y2K.\n  No, this is not really about business because business cannot wait \naround. Incidentally, the claimants are not frivolous--which is a \nremarkable thing, how they can tie people in. The National Federation \nof Independent Business ought to be standing here with me in this well, \nbecause the average computer for these small businesses, I would say, \nis around $20,000. These are not people willy-nilly looking for a \nlawsuit. They are not looking for a punitive damage lottery and all of \nthat kind of nonsense that they make fun of here and try to stir up the \nemotions and say we have those old trial lawyers.\n  The truth of the matter is, these small business people have to get \non and do business. They have no time to get a lawyer and wait the 90 \ndays and come back around after 90 days, then file a pleading, and then \non and on. Then under their particular bill, on joint and several--I \ncannot tell where the parts are made, but I guarantee the majority of \nthe parts of the computers are made outside of the United States. If I \ncannot get joint and several, where am I going? To India, where a lot \nof the parts in computerization are made? Am I going to Malaysia to \nbring my suit? I am a small businessman.\n  Oh, no, they have to get joint and several out of here. Why? On \naccount of product liability, the Chamber of Commerce on account of Tom \nDonahue and Victor Schwartz. I have been here for 20 some years in the \nFederal Government proudly standing on the side of the American Bar \nAssociation, the Association of State Supreme Court Justices, the State \nlegislators. They met and they back us up every time, because this is a \nproblem at the local level that has long since been solved in tort law, \nin verdicts made there. But otherwise, long since, here, there is \nevidence upon evidence of businesses saying we cannot wait around for \nlawsuits and lawyers and punitive damages and everything else of that \nkind. We have to get on with it.\n  But Silicon Valley has the money. People are falling over pell-mell. \nI wish we could have passed campaign financing reform because we are \ngoing to talk money out here on the floor, which is when this \nlegislation really gets any kind of impetus or attention. Everybody \nwants Silicon Valley contributions. I do, too. But I cannot see \nchanging 200 years of tort law in order to get it.\n  Most advisedly, if General Motors came up here to the National \nGovernment and said: Look, we are going to put out a new model come the \nfirst of the year, and it might have some glitches. So, if we find any \nglitches in our 2000 year's model, what we need to do is get together \nwith anybody who has a glitch, and let's talk to them for 2 or 3 \nmonths. I don't know what they are supposed to do with the car during \nthat time because it will not work.\n  But that is the law they want to pass: let's talk about it for 90 \ndays. How fanciful and nonsensical this whole move is. Thereafter, \nbring your lawsuit. By the way, everybody has known about this \nparticular problem for years on end, every business magazine and \neverything else. But let's not have any punitive damages or willful \nmisconduct. Let's not have any joint and several liability.\n  General Motors would say: Senator, how about changing 200 years of \nthe State tort law for me because I am going to put out a new model?\n  You would run General Motors out of town. You would not listen to \nthem at all. But General Motors is not up here making those kinds of \ncontributions. Silicon valley is. Oh, boy, we can bring the records \nhere and show just exactly what the issue is. Everybody wants to show I \nam a friend of technology.\n  They do not have to talk to this Senator about technology. I authored \nthe Advanced Technology Program. I authored the Advanced Technology \nBusiness Partnership Act. I have been working with the young \ncomputerization people and technology people for 20-some years at \nleast. So don't tell me about technology and being a friend of \ntechnology. What they are is a friend of campaign contributions.\n  So, you have the money marrying up with the manifest intent of the \nChamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of \nIndependent Business. The reason I can correlate them so easily is I \nhad to face them last year in the campaign. Of course the Chamber of \nCommerce endorsed my opponent because I was such a sorry Senator. Then \nin February they gave me the Enterprise Award for the year 1998, since \nI had done such a good job. They do not have any shame. That is the \nbunch with the most gall I ever met to come around, take the fellow \nthey opposed, and then give him an award for doing such an outstanding \njob; the very reason, such a sorry job, why they opposed him. But that \nis the kind of shenanigans we have going on and giving it an official \nrecognition here.\n  Do not let me leave out the insurance companies. The insurance \ncompanies out there right now are at a hearing, Mr. President, before \nyour subcommittee and mine: ``No fault.'' But they have a different \nname for it.\n  It has not worked. They have tried it in Connecticut, they have tried \nit in Georgia, they have tried it in Nevada, but it has not worked, and \nthey canceled it out. We do not need a hearing.\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\nWe have the actual experience in the States. But the insurance \ncompanies, at every turn, are in here driving to change the laws here, \nthere and yonder for money, to increase their profits.\n  I have been at the State level and have been a sort of States rights \nSenator. I have been defending insurance at the State level, saying it \nhas been regulated.\n  They have come with Y2K; they have come with product liability; they \nhave come with auto choice. They call it no fault. They want a little \ntidbit here and a little tidbit there. Let's federalize interstate \ncommerce--if any business is an interstate commerce--and let's \nfederalize the insurance industry in the United States and set the \nrules for all 50 States, and then they will not have to qualify it.\n  I bring these things out because they are most important, for the \nsimple reason that the trial lawyers, for example, and punitive \ndamages--both--do a wonderful job for America.\n  Let's go back to the leading case: the Pinto case back in 1978. There \nis an outstanding attorney in California named Mark Robinson. He got a \nverdict for $3.5 million actual damages and $125 million punitive \ndamages. He never collected a red cent of the punitive damages.\n  When the Senator from Arizona gets up here and talks about the \npunitive damages lottery, the American Bar Association said less than 4 \npercent of all tort cases result in a punitive damage verdict, and half \nof those are reversed again on appeals. So we are talking about less \nthan 2 percent. He is up here describing it as ``just roll the dice and \nwe can get a lot of money and we have a lottery coming.''\n  What has that punitive damage verdict done? Go over, as I have done, \nto the National Safety Transportation Board and you will find out that \nin the last 4 years--Mr. President, I want you to listen to this \nstatistic--they have had 73,854,669 vehicle recalls. There were some \nlast week. Chrysler was recalling some cars. Another one had something \nto do with the ignition; it was causing fires. Another one had \nsomething else wrong with it. We are constantly getting the recalls. \nWhy? Not because they love safety, but because of the punitive damage \nlottery and the trial lawyers; they are going to get them.\n  On a cost-benefit basis, in the Pinto case, they said do not worry \nabout it, we can kill a few, let the gas tank explode and let them die; \nbut the cost of those deaths is not near as much as the profit we make \non selling the car.\n  On cost-benefit, as a result of trial lawyers, we have had, just in \nthe last 4 years, 73 million recalls. That has promoted tremendous \nsafety in America, has saved thousands of lives, millions of injuries, \nI can tell you that. If they want to give a good Government award to \nanybody with respect to bringing about safety in America, find Mark \nRobinson in San Diego and give him the award, because I am proud of him \nand America is proud of him.\n  The trouble is, they are being derided and rebuked and defamed in the \nNational Congress because we have a bunch of Congressmen and Senators \nwho have never been in a courtroom, never tried a case, do not \nunderstand that people do not have time for frivolous lawsuits. Trial \nlawyers know they take on all the expenses, they take on all the time \nand effort for the discovery, for the interrogatories, for all the \nmotions, all the appearances, thereupon the trial and thereupon--this \nis what they call a lottery--get all 12 jurors by the greater weight of \nthe preponderance of evidence, take the case on appeal and get a \nverdict from the Supreme Court, and then they get that fee they all \ntalk about now in the tobacco cases.\n\n  The trial lawyers have done more than Koop and Kessler. I have been \nup here working with them on cancer. I have received national awards, I \ncan say immodestly. I helped and worked and got a center for this \nparticular disease, but I can tell you advisedly, after 32-some years, \nthese trial lawyers on smoking, on lung cancer, on heart attacks, \nsaving lives, preventing cancer deaths, have done way more than Koop \nand Kessler, because we used to meet out here and nobody would pay \nattention to Koop and nobody would pay attention to Kessler. When the \ntrial lawyers then started bringing the cases and getting these \nsettlements, it was not the fees that they got but, more or less, the \ngood that they brought to our society. Let's give them the good \nGovernment award this morning.\n  I want to clear the air here because we have just run into all of \nthis lottery stuff and spurious suits and frivolous suits. This case \ninvolves small business folks who have put $20,000 or more into a \ncomputer, and they are trying, like the doctor who appeared before the \ncommittee, their dead-level best to get some results because they are \nnot waiting, of course, until January 1, 2000.\n  We had the testimony of Dr. Robert Courtney on February 9, 1999, \nbefore the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The good \ndoctor was from Atlantic County, NJ. I had never met him before, but he \ngave an outstanding recount.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of Dr. Robert Courtney at the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Hearing on S. 96, the Y2K Act, February 9, \n                                  1999\n\n       Good morning, my name is Bob Courtney, and I am a doctor \n     from Atlantic County, New Jersey. It is an honor for me to be \n     here this morning, and I thank you for inviting me to offer \n     testimony on the Y2K issue.\n       As a way of background, I am an ob/gyn and a solo \n     practitioner. I do not have an office manager. It's just my \n     Registered Nurse, Diane Hurff, and me, taking care of my 2000 \n     patients.\n       These days, it is getting tougher and tougher for those of \n     us who provide traditional, personalized medical services. \n     The paperwork required by the government on one hand, and by \n     insurance companies on the other is forcing me to spend fewer \n     hours doing what I do best--taking care of patients and \n     delivering their babies.\n       But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious \n     threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this \n     morning.\n       As a matter of clarification, although I am a doctor, I am \n     not here to speak on behalf of the American Medical \n     Association. Although I am also a small businessman, I am not \n     here to speak on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot \n     tell you how these organizations feel about the legislation \n     before the Committee. But I can tell you how it would have \n     affected my practice and my business.\n       I am one of the lucky ones. While a potential Y2K failure \n     impacted my practice, the computer vendor that sold me the \n     software system and I were able to reach an out-of-court \n     settlement which was fair and expedient. From what my \n     attorney, Harris Pogust, who is here with me today tells me,\n       I doubt I would have been so lucky had this legislation \n     been in effect.\n       In 1987, I purchased a computer system from Medical \n     Manager, one of the leading medical systems providers in the \n     country. I used the Medical Manager system for tracking \n     surgery, scheduling due dates and billing. The system worked \n     well for me for ten years, until the computer finally crashed \n     from lack of sufficient memory.\n       In 1996, I replaced my old system with a new, state of the \n     art pentium system from Medical Manager for $13,000. This was \n     a huge investment for a practice of my size.\n       I remember joking with the computer salesman at the time \n     that this was a big purchase for me, and that I was counting \n     on this system to last as long as the last one did.\n       I remember the salesman telling me that he was sure that I \n     would get at least ten years out of it. He showed me a list \n     of how many of his local customers had used the Medical \n     Manager for longer than ten years.\n       And, the salesman pointed me to this advertising brochure \n     put out by Medical Manager. It states that their product \n     would provide doctors with ``the ability to manage [their] \n     future.''\n       In truth, I never asked the salesman about whether the new \n     system that I was buying was Y2K compliant. I honestly did \n     not know even to ask the question. After all, I deliver \n     babies. I don't program computers. Based on the salesman's \n     statements and the brochure, I assumed the system would work \n     long into the future. After all, he had promised me over ten \n     years' use, which would take me to 2006.\n       But just one year later, I received a form letter from \n     Medical Manager telling me that the system I had just \n     purchased had a Y2K problem. It was a problem that would make \n     it impossible for me to schedule due dates or handle my \n     administrative tasks--as early as 1999.\n       Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem that they \n     had created--but for $25,000.\n       I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this \n     table would be. The original system had cost me $15,000 when \n     I purchased it in 1986. The upgraded system cost me $13,000 \n     in 1996. Now, a year later, they wanted another $25,000. They \n     knew when they sold me the $13,000 system that it would need \n     this upgrade--but of course, they didn't tell me.\n       I wrote back to the company that I fully expected them to \n     fix the problem for free, since I had just bought the system \n     from them and I had been promised that it would work long \n     into the future.\n\n[[Page S6740]]\n\n       The company ignored my request, however, and several months \n     later, sent me an estimate for fixing the problem--again, for \n     over $25,000.\n       At this point, I was faced with a truly difficult dilemma. \n     My practice depends on the use of a computer system to track \n     my patients' due dates, surgeries and billings--but I did not \n     have $25,000 to pay for an upgrade. Additionally, I was \n     appalled at the thought of having to pay Medical Manager for \n     a problem that they had created and should have anticipated.\n       If I had to pay that $25,000, that would force me to drop \n     many of my indigent patients that I now treat for free. Since \n     Medical Manager insisted upon charging me for the new system, \n     and because my one year-old system was no longer dependable, \n     I retained an attorney and sued Medical Manager to fix or \n     replace my computer system at their cost.\n       Within two months of filing our action, Medical Manager \n     offered to settle by providing all customers who bought a \n     non-Y2K compliant system from them after 1990 with a free \n     upgrade that makes their systems Y2K compliant by utilizing a \n     software ``patch.''\n       This settlement gave me what I wanted from Medical \n     Manager--the ability to use my computer system as it was \n     meant to be used. To my great satisfaction, the legal system \n     worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought \n     Medical Manager's products since 1990. In fact, since I \n     brought my claim against Medical Manager, I have received \n     numerous telephone calls and letters from doctors across the \n     country who had similar experiences.\n       Additionally, even Medical Manager has stated that it was \n     pleased with the settlement. According to the Medical Manager \n     president who was quoted in the American Medical News, \n     ``[f]or both our users and our shareholders, the best thing \n     was to provide a Y2K solution. This is a win for our users \n     and a win for us.'' [pick up article and display to Senators] \n     I simply do not see why the rights of doctors and other small \n     businesses to recover from a company such as Medical Manager \n     should be limited--which is what I understand this bill would \n     do. Indeed, my attorney tells me that if this legislation had \n     been in effect when I bought my system, Medical Manager would \n     not have settled. I would still be in litigation, and might \n     have lost my practice.\n       As an aside, at roughly the same time I bought the non-\n     compliant system from Medical Manager, I purchased a sonogram \n     machine from ADR. That equipment was Y2K compliant. The \n     Salesman never told me it was compliant. It was simply built \n     to last. Why should we be protecting the vendors or \n     manufacturers of defective products rather than rewarding the \n     responsible ones?\n       Also, as a doctor, I also hope the Committee will look into \n     the implications of this legislation for both patient health \n     and potential medical malpractice suits. This is an issue \n     that many doctors have asked me about, and that generates \n     considerable concern in the medical community.\n       In sum, I do appreciate this opportunity to share my \n     experiences with the Committee. I guess the main message I \n     would like to leave you with is that Y2K problems affect the \n     lives of everyday people like myself, but the current legal \n     system works. Changing the equation now could give companies \n     like Medical Manager an incentive to undertake prolonged \n     litigation strategies rather than agree to speedy and fair \n     out-of-court settlements.\n       I became a doctor, and a sole practitioner, because I love \n     delivering babies. I give each of my patients my home phone \n     number. I am part of their lives. This Y2K problem could have \n     forced me to give all that up. It is only because of my \n     lawyer, and the court system, that I can continue to be the \n     doctor that I have been. This bill, and others like it, would \n     take that away from me. Please don't do that. Leave the \n     system as it is. The court worked for me--and it will work \n     for others.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  I will run right down, trying to save time. It says:\n\n       But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious \n     threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this \n     morning.\n       As a matter of clarification, although I am a doctor, I am \n     not here to speak on behalf of the American Medical \n     Association.

This is the practice of the business that is \ngoing on here now in June of 1999, 6 months ahead of January 1, 2000. \nThe computer people are moving in and they are saying: Wait a minute, \nyou have got a Y2K problem.\n  I quote again:\n\n       It was a problem that would make it impossible for me to \n     schedule due dates or handle my administrative tasks--as \n     early as 1999.\n       Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem that they \n     had created--but for $25,000.\n       I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this \n     table would be.

Whoopee \nfor the Internet. And once he got his case on the Internet, some 20,000 \npurchasers in a similar situation started calling on the phone and \nfiling in. Then on a cost/benefit--business is business--they knew what \nthe law was. They knew they intentionally misled. The salesman had \nsaid: Man, this thing will last you more than 10 years, like your last \nsystem. In a year it was already on the blink. They wanted to charge \n$25,000--more than he paid for the first system and the upgrade \ncombined.\n  They got a free upgrade. They paid the lawyers, too. They were \ntickled to death to get out of this one after it got on the Internet.\n  Let me quote:\n\n       This settlement gave me what I wanted from Medical \n     Manager--the ability to use my computer system as it was \n     meant to be used. To my great satisfaction, the legal system \n     worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought \n     Medical Manager's products since 1990. In fact, since I \n     brought my claim against Medical Manager, I have received \n     numerous telephone calls and letters from doctors across the \n     country who had similar experiences.\n\n  Reading on and skipping a good part, to conclude:\n\n       I became a doctor, and a sole practitioner, because I love \n     delivering babies. I give each of my patients my home phone \n     number. I am part of their lives. This Y2K problem could have \n     forced me to give all of that up. It is only because of my \n     lawyer, and the court system, that I can continue to be the \n     doctor that I have been. This bill, and others like it, would \n     take that away from me. Please don't do that. Leave the \n     system as it is. The court worked for me--and it will work \n     for others.\n\n  It is working all over the country, and, frankly, at a very minimal \ncost. The consummate sum total of all products--this is product \nliability matters--of all product liability verdicts does not exceed \nthe $12.1 billion that\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\nPennzoil received in a verdict against Texaco. When business sues \nbusiness, oh, boy, as Senator Dirksen stood here at this chair and \nsaid: Then it gets into money. He said: A billion here and a billion \nthere, and before long it runs into money.\n  This is something to protect the consumers of America. It is very \nmuch needed. They are working on it at the State level, and they have \nplenty of notice. They do not need a bill to say, come January 1st, \ngive them another 90 days. We are going to give them 90 days beginning \nright now with the debate. And we are going to give them another 60. \nHappy day. We are giving them more days right now.\n  Just use the law, use your sense, do what business practices are \ndoing all over the country. But there is no question that this thing \nhere is just the footprint of a political exercise by those entities \ndowntown at the Chamber, which I am embarrassed for because I used to \nbe a champion of the Chamber of Commerce.\n  Talk about a businessman's politician, I challenge anybody to meet \nthe record we made bringing business, and continue to bring, to the \nState of South Carolina. Incidentally, none of them have said anything \nabout Y2K; none of them have said anything about product liability.\n  I remember taking another prospect the other day to Bosch. They make \nnot only all the fuel injectors but all of the antilock brakes for \nToyota and Mercedes and a 10-year contract for General Motors. Just \ngoing along down the line, I said: By the way, what do you have on \nproduct liability?\n  The fellow got insulted. He said: Product liability? He ran over and \nsaid: Look here. He showed me a serial number on every one of the \nantilock brakes. He said: We would know immediately what went wrong.\n  You see, substantive basic tort law brings about due care, brings \nabout safety, brings about sound products. It is working in America. \nAnd here comes a bunch of pollster politicians and a downtown group, \ngreedy as they are, trying to ruin small business, that is going to \nhave a problem.\n  Here is what the Washington Post, which is usually on the other side \nof trial lawyers and everything else of that kind, said:\n\n       The Senate is considering a bill to limit litigation \n     stemming from the Year 2000 computer problem. The current \n     version, a compromise reached by Sens. John McCain and Ron \n     Wyden, would cap punitive damages for Y2K-related lawsuits \n     and require that they be preceded by a period during which \n     defendants could fix the problems that otherwise would give \n     rise to the litigation. Cutting down on frivolous lawsuits is \n     certainly a worthy goal, and we are sympathetic to litigation \n     reform proposals. But this bill, though better than earlier \n     versions, still has fundamental flaws. Specifically, it \n     removes a key incentive for companies to fix problems \n     before the turn of the year, and it also responds to a \n     problem whose scope is at this stage unknown. Nobody knows \n     just how bad the Y2K problem is going to be or how many \n     suits it will provide. Also unclear is to what extent \n     these suits will be merely high-tech ambulance chasing or, \n     conversely, how many will respond to serious failures by \n     businesses to ensure their own readiness.\n       In light of all this uncertainty, it seems premature to \n     give relief to potential defendants. The bill is partly \n     intended to prevent resources that should be used to cure Y2K \n     problems from being diverted to litigation, but giving \n     companies prospective relief could end up discouraging them \n     from fixing those same problems. The fear of significant \n     liability is a powerful incentive for companies to make sure \n     that their products are Y2K compliant and that they can meet \n     the terms of the contracts they have entered. To cap damages \n     in this one area would encourage risk taking rather than \n     costly remedial work by companies that might or might not be \n     vulnerable to suits. The better approach would be to wait \n     until the implications of the problem for the legal system \n     are better understood. Liability legislation for the Y2K \n     problem can await the Y2K.\n\n  That is the message of Business Week. It was very interesting that \nthey reached the same conclusion. I quote from that March 1 article:\n\n       Other industries are following suit.\n\n  It went on to talk about the 2000.\n\n       Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, General \n     Motors and other carmakers have set Mar. 31 deadlines for \n     vendors to become Y2K-compliant.\n\n  There is the Pinto case. They know what is coming down the road. They \nrun good business. If I was on the board of General Motors, I would say \nright on. We are not waiting for political fixes of tort law by \npoliticians looking for silicon contributions.\n\n       In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America \n     will meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing \n     Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are \n     sending a warning to laggards and shifting business to the \n     tech-savvy. ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and \n     modernize the supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., \n     chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, \n     Arkansas.\n\n  There you go. They look upon it as a wonderful business opportunity, \nthe Y2K problem.\n  They, in essence, are saying, come on. Let's have the problem. Let's \nfind out who is efficient, who can really supply us. Let's find out who \ncan become compliant in time. You still have 6 more months. But \npoliticians are coming up here, we have to get there and identify. We \nhave to get those contributions. We have to get with the Chamber of \nCommerce and Victor Swartz at the NAM and that crowd and show them that \nwe are good boys, and we are going to be on their voting charts that \nthey will publish when I run for reelection and everything else. They \nhave a political problem. It is not a Y2K problem. Business says, right \non with the Y2K problem. We can clean up the supply chain, find out who \nis not really compliant and everything else early on here in 1999. We \nare not waiting for January 1, 2000.\n  Right to the point, this particular legislation changes 200 years of \ntried and true tort law, all for a special group that has the \nunmitigated gall to come in and say all this about punitive damages, \nlotteries, trial lawyers, frivolous lawsuits, and everything else.\n\n  Nothing is going to be frivolous after January. We have talked it to \ndeath already this year. They have published the business articles \nabout it. Everybody has known about it. Every case, come January 1, \nought to be punitive, I can tell you that, because they ought to know \nabout it.\n  My particular power company group has already met and they have \ntested to make sure it works. My State of South Carolina was just \ncited, by July 1 the entire State system will be ready and going. So \neverybody is doing it.\n  What we see and hear at the Washington level with the McCain-Wyden \namendment is, sit back, rest on your fanny, don't do anything. We are \ngoing to take care of you, because on the one hand we are going to \nprovide a time that will put you out of business waiting the 90 days, \nbecause you are a small businessman and you have to do business. And \nthen after the 90 days, we are going to say, by the way, the part was \nmade in Malaysia, so you have the wrong party.\n  Now, that is the game in this particular McCain-Wyden-Dodd amendment. \nIt should be defeated outright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be brief this morning. I know my \ncolleague from Colorado has been waiting. The Democratic leader of the \nY2K effort, Senator Dodd, has also been waiting. I will be brief to \nbegin.\n  It is just a couple of hundred days to the new millennium. It seems \nto this Member of the Senate that how this body handles this \nlegislation will say a great deal about our Nation's ability to keep \nour strong technology-oriented economy prospering in the next century.\n  I believe that failure to pass this responsible legislation would be \nlike sticking a monkey wrench in the high-tech engine that is driving \nour economic prosperity. There is no question that there are going to \nbe problems early next year stemming from the Y2K matter. What is going \nto happen, however, is that the frivolous lawsuits will compound those \nproblems.\n  The sponsors of this legislation--the chairman of the committee, the \nDemocratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator Dodd, and myself and \nothers who have been intensively involved--believe that with this bill \nour Nation will be in a better position to be on line rather than \nwaiting in line for a courtroom date when the problems occur.\n  We have heard my chairman, Senator Hollings, and others talk about \nthe matter of changing jurisprudence in our country. Senator Hollings \nspecifically, who I respect so much, talked about how 200 years of case \nlaw and jurisprudence is being changed.\n  This is a very narrow bill. Senator Dodd and I insisted that there be \na sunset date on this legislation. We believe,\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\nand all the evidence points to the fact, that we are going to see the \nproblems stemming from Y2K trailing off 1 to 3 years into the new \ncentury. We have put a tight 36-month sunset date on this legislation.\n\n  This is not changing Anglo-American jurisprudence for all time. This \nis a narrow bill that will apply for 36 months so that we do not have \nto have, for example, a special session of the Senate early next year \nto deal with this problem.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have been waiting about an hour. I will be happy to \nyield to my friend, who I know has also been doing a lot of work.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if he might yield during \nthe course of his statement so that we may have a good dialogue with \nrespect to some of the issues he raises as he raises them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be anxious to yield to my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts after I have had a chance for just a few minutes of \ndiscussion of this issue.\n  I will take a minute and outline an example of the kind of issue that \nwe are going to see early next century and how this legislation \nspecifically responds to it.\n  Let's say that Mabel's restaurant buys $10,000 worth of computers \nfrom the Jones Company and they crash on January 3 of next year. \nMabel's restaurant loses a million dollars' worth of business as a \nresult. Mabel writes to Jones Computer Company telling them that the \ncrash was as a result of a Y2K failure; they want the computers fixed, \nshe wants compensation for the million dollars.\n  Here is what happens: The Jones Computer Company has to respond \nwithin 30 days of hearing from Mabel's restaurant. They can say: Yes, \nY2K failure; we are going to fix the computer the way Mabel wants, and \nwe are going to pay the million dollars as well. Or they can say: We \nwill fix the Y2K problem, but we don't think we ought to be responsible \nfor the entire million dollars' loss. Mabel and Jones Computer agree \nJones ought to fix them, they negotiate and come up with what Jones is \nliable for, and if Mabel doesn't think she is getting everything she \nought to, she can go out and sue Jones immediately. Or she can say the \nsituation isn't fixed the way she wants it and she can go out and again \nfile a lawsuit immediately.\n  Now, some have said, well, what happens if the Jones Computer Company \nis bankrupt and insolvent? Well, Mabel can name in her lawsuit anybody \nshe thinks is a responsible party. The jury will then decide what \nportion of the blame each potential defendant ought to bear. Virtually \nall of these cases are going to be decided on the basis of existing \nState contract and tort law. We lock into this legislation protection \nfor existing contracts, and in virtually all of the cases State \ncontract and tort law is going to be protected.\n  So what you are going to have is a situation where Mabel's \nrestaurant, if it isn't fixed to her satisfaction, can go to court \nessentially immediately and recover all of her economic damages. She is \nin a position, by the way, to recover up to a quarter of a million \ndollars in punitive damages. I made my career with the Gray Panthers, \nthe senior citizens group, before I came to Congress and now for 18 \nyears in Congress, around consumer advocacy. It seems to me that is a \npretty good deal, what I have outlined in this hypothetical case for \nthis restaurant, for just about any consumer in our country.\n\n  I want to talk specifically about whether Americans are losing any \nlegal rights in this particular legislation. I guess we could say they \nare losing the right to sue for a few days. As I said, they can sue \nimmediately if they choose to. But the reason we are trying to have \nthat 30-day period for defendants is to make sure they fix people's \nproblems. It is better to be on line than waiting in line for that \ncourt date.\n  Second, I guess you can say the cap on punitive damages as it relates \nto small business means we are not going to stick it to small business. \nWell, I happen to think those small businesses are making an \nextraordinary contribution to our economy. So let's have a \nphilosophical debate. The Senator from Massachusetts, who has worked \nhard on this issue, and I have a difference of opinion on that. We \ndon't disagree on a whole lot of issues. I think we do disagree on that \none. But I think we ought to protect the small businesses from these \nunlimited punitive damages.\n  Third, I guess you can say our legislation does make some changes \nwith respect to joint and several liability. What we are saying, \nhowever, is that anytime you have a corporate defendant who engages in \negregious conduct, rips off consumers, is guilty of fraud, joint and \nseveral liability applies in those kinds of instances. It also applies \nwhen we have individuals with a low net worth as well.\n  I would like the Senate to also reflect on the fact that essentially \nwhat we are doing here is what we did in the Securities Litigation \nReform Act. It parallels most of the key issues in that area.\n  I want to wrap up by just mentioning briefly all of the major changes \nthat were made in this legislation after it left the Senate Commerce \nCommittee where Democrats, in a united fashion, opposed the bill.\n  I mentioned the 3-year sunset provision. I want it understood by all \nMembers of this body that I will be against any bill that comes out of \nthe conference committee that doesn't have a sufficient sunset \nprovision. This is not changing Anglo-American jurisprudence for all \ntime; this is a 3-year bill. We insisted on it after it came out of the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Second, the business community originally talked about a vague \nFederal defense that would essentially give them protection if they \nengage in reasonable efforts. On the basis of what we heard from the \nconsumer groups, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator Dodd, \nand I thought that was too vague, to give corporate defendants that \nkind of break. So we cut that out.\n  Third, we dropped the new preemptive Federal standard for \nestablishing punitive damages. The only people we are protecting are \nthe small business people. We may have a philosophical difference of \nopinion on that. We think those folks deserve protection.\n  On the question of joint and several liability, when it came out of \ncommittee, even if you engaged in fraud, even if you had a low-net-\nworth defendant, there wasn't protection for the plaintiff. We insisted \non those kinds of changes. We said if a corporate defendant engages in \noutrageous conduct, if they are trying to rip somebody off, you bet \njoint and several applies. Senator Dodd and I insisted on that \nprovision as well.\n\n  Also, a provision which is certainly not popular in the business \ncommunity: There is liability for directors and officers if they make \nmisleading statements or they withhold information regarding any actual \nor potential Y2K problems.\n  So at the end of the day, I believe we have a balanced bill. The \ndefendants have an obligation under this legislation to go out and cure \nproblems, to get their businesses online and make sure they are in a \nposition so that this technology-driven economy can continue to hum as \nit has. The plaintiffs have equal obligations. They have a duty to \nmitigate. So there are obligations on the part of the defendants and \nobligations on the part of the plaintiffs.\n  But this is a narrow bill. It is going to discourage frivolous \nclaims, but it is also going to make sure that those who have a \nlegitimate, honest concern, as in that example of a small business I \noutlined here this morning, that that small business is going to be \nable to go after all of the parties, all of the parties responsible, \nand hold them liable for the portion of the problem to which they \nactually contribute. So I am very hopeful the Senate will pass this \nlegislation.\n  We heard mention of the trial lawyers on the floor of the Senate \nearlier. Probably, prior to my involvement in this legislation, I was \nconsidered one of the better friends of those folks. Mention was made \nof the tobacco issue. I was the Member of Congress who got the tobacco \nexecutives under oath to say nicotine was addictive, which I think has \nhad a little bit to do with helping to protect kids and consumers in \nthis country. So I don't take a back seat to anybody in terms of \nstanding up for consumer rights.\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\n  I say to the Senate today that as a result of months of difficult \nnegotiations, led by the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nMcCain, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator Dodd, myself, \nSenator Feinstein, and others, we have brought a balanced bill to the \nfloor of the Senate. It is going to ensure that we do not throw a \nmonkey wrench into this technology engine that is doing so much to \nensure our prosperity.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tania Calhoun, \na fellow with the Select Committee on Y2K, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor during consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to again turn to the Y2K liability \nbill and the very real importance of this issue. As you know, I have \nserved for the past year with Senator Bennett on the Senate Special \nCommittee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. For over a year, we have \nexamined the coming millennium changeover and the possible problems \nassociated with it. We have held hearings to examine the effects of the \nyear 2000, including hearings on industry, finance, energy, \ntelecommunications, international trade, community safety, health, and \nlitigation. Throughout these hearings, the committee has become \nincreasingly alarmed at both the perception and the reality of a \ngathering storm of potential liability and consequent litigation that \ncould swamp our court system and impact our Nation's businesses.\n  Mr. President, I would dare say that many Americans, have in one way \nor another felt the direct effect of our Nation's burgeoning wave of \nlitigation that has been growing steadily over the past half century. \nWhether it be the increasing cost of health care, insurance premiums or \nconsumer products, we have all experienced the results of litigation \ncosts. Americans have become accustomed to living in a litigious \nsociety. Occasional abuses of the legal system generally arise from \nproblems that are generally limited in scope. An example of this can be \nfound within the securities industry where the legal system was no \nlonger an avenue for aggrieved investors but rather had become a \npathway for a few enterprising attorneys to manipulate legal procedures \nfor their own profit. So-called strike suits were generated whenever \nstocks went down and sometimes when they went up. These costly suits \nwere frequently settled by companies seeking to avoid the expense of \nprotracted litigation. I authored litigation reform legislation, which \npassed despite a veto by the White House. In other words, I have \nstrongly supported litigation reform efforts in the past. As with \nsecurities litigation reform, the need for Y2K litigation reform arises \nfrom a national problem yet it should be addressed with a narrowly \ntailored solution.\n  Mr. President, only a narrowly tailored solution could effectively \nmanage the demands of such a pervasive problem. Potentially, any \nbusiness in the country might be swept into the Y2K problem, either \nbecause it is itself not prepared or because a firm it depends upon is \nnot prepared. The Special Committee on Year 2000 has heard testimony \nthat as many as 15 percent of the businesses in this country will \nsuffer Y2K-related failures of some kind. Even now we read that small \nand medium-sized businesses across the globe are not taking the \nnecessary steps to become Y2K-compliant, and many think they don't have \na Y2K problem. Since businesses are interconnected these days, just one \nfailure in one business may generate cascading failures that may then \ngenerate numerous lawsuits.\n  The mere fact that this is such a pervasive problem is in itself the \nprimary reason why litigation on this matter could cost in the hundreds \nof billions. It has been suggested that as a result of Y2K, the United \nStates could easily find itself witnessing not only a huge surge in \nlitigation, this potential litigious bloodletting could have long-term \nconsequences on the economic well-being of our country. By now we have \nall heard that the cost of Y2K litigation could reach the astronomical \nfigures. Various experts, including the Gartner Group from my own state \nof Connecticut, have estimated that the costs of litigation may rise to \n$1 trillion. Such estimates, and I must stress that these are only \nestimates, underscore the need for serious review and a bipartisan \napproach to this issue. Massive amounts of litigation has the potential \nto overwhelm the court system, disrupting already-crowded dockets for \nyears into the next millennium. We must be careful that an avalanche of \nlawsuits does not smother American corporations and bury their \ncompetitive edge. A maelstrom of class action lawsuits could have long-\nterm consequences on the American economy and the American people.\n\n  There are several things that should be absolutely understood about \nthis bill, first and foremost, the provisions in this bill will sunset \nin 2003. Secondly, this bill will not affect the rights of plaintiffs \nand defendants in personal injury actions in any way. Most importantly, \nthis bill seeks to encourage individuals and businesses to do all that \nthey can do to make themselves Y2K compliant and to encourage efforts \nto mitigate Y2K related damages.\n  This is a complex bill with many complex legal issues. Some of my \ncolleagues are opposed to the section of the bill that provides for \nproportionate liability, which generally means that a defendant can be \nheld liable only for the damages for which he is responsible. Some of \nmy colleagues argue that it is unfair for an innocent plaintiff to run \nthe risk that it might not recover 100 percent of its damages if it \ncan't hold the defendant liable for that amount, even if that defendant \nwas only responsible for 20 percent of those damages. I would respond \nby saying that not only is it equally unfair to demand that businesses \nwith little complicity in a dispute be required to pay for most of the \ndamages just because it has deep pockets. Moreover without some form of \nproportionate liability, plaintiffs' lawyers will always name a deep-\npocketed defendant in a suit because they know the deep-pocket will \nhave to pay for all the damages even if that defendant is only \nmarginally responsible. I would remind my colleagues that the bill \nretains joint and several liability in cases where the defendant acted \nwith specific intent to injure the plaintiff or knowingly committed \nfraud and does not affect personal injury cases. As a result, the \nproportionate liability provision in this bill finds a reasoned balance \nbetween the rights of plaintiffs and the rights of defendants.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions that a Y2K liability bill should \nnot be a vehicle for broad tort reform. And efforts to impose broad \ncaps on punitive damages are just that. The provisions that I propose \naren't tort reform, but merely protect small businesses and the mom and \npop enterprises by capping punitive damages only for small businesses \nthat have 50 or less employees and caps damages at $250,000 or three \ntimes the compensatory damages, whichever is smaller. The White House \nhas expressed concern about the bill's provisions for capping punitive \ndamages, however as my esteemed colleague Senator Wyden pointed out the \nlast time the Senate considered this issue during last year's products \nliability bill, it included a cap on punitive damages lower than this, \nand the White House agreed to this proposal. It is unclear then why \nthey are opposing the cap in this bill which provides for more punitive \ndamages.\n\n  Other voices have suggested that this bill relieves businesses and \ncorporations from accountability or responsibility. The bill does not \ndo this, but does try to ensure that those who do sue will do so \nresponsibly and specifically and that there will be ample opportunity \nfor parties to solve the Y2K problem before litigating their Y2K \nproblems. To ensure responsibility on the plaintiff's side, for \nexample, the bill requires the plaintiff to provide specific details \nabout the injuries they've suffered when they file a complaint. \nPlaintiffs who can articulate the nature of their injuries are less \nlikely to be filing frivolous complaints. To ensure accountability on \nthe defendants side, companies are given a narrow window of opportunity \nto solve any Y2K problems they've created before a lawsuit is filed. \nThis window of opportunity gives them the chance to maintain a business \nrelationship by providing professional and responsible\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nservice to their customers before the business relationship is soured \nby a lawsuit.\n  There are those who say that state courts have been addressing issues \nlike the Y2K problem for years and can continue to do so. They also say \nthe state legislatures are fully capable of addressing the Y2K problem \nand that there is no need for the Federal Government to become \ninvolved. My colleagues should know, however, that nearly every state \nto date has either passed Y2K liability legislation or is considering \nsuch legislation, so Y2K actions in the future will probably not be set \non long-standing state precedents. Instead, they may be decided under \nnew untested and untried state laws. The bill provides in most cases, \nfor uniform provisions to be applied to Y2K cases, enabling both \nplaintiffs and defendants to predict the law that applies to them. \nFurthermore, since all of these laws are different, firms engaged in \ninterstate commerce--nearly every firm these days--will be at a \ndisadvantage. It is difficult to do business where potentially 50 \ndifferent and changing sets of laws might apply. The bill's provision \nof generally uniform guidance for Y2K cases levels the playing field \nand reduces the cost of doing business for potential plaintiffs and \npotential defendants. Multiple sets of laws also raise the problem of \nforum shopping, which occurs when plaintiffs try to bring their \nlawsuits in states where the laws are most advantageous to them. This \nleads to imbalances in our state courts, and high costs for defendants. \nSince the bill provides for generally uniform standards across the \ncountry, forum shopping in Y2K cases will not be a problem. State \ncourts can maintain balanced caseloads: and the cost of defending Y2K \nlawsuits will not be unreasonably high due to forum shopping.\n  Some are of the view that the Y2K problem has been around for 40 \nyears and should already have been solved, and that the Senate has no \nbusiness stepping in to protect the high-technology industry. And we \nshould be clear, we are not trying to protect the high-technology \nindustry, but instead we are trying to manage a problem for all \nbusiness and individuals, the mom and pop grocery and the major \nenterprise. We are all plugged in today, and the bill speaks to the \nmassive litigation boom that has the potential to bankrupt all kinds of \nbusinesses, costing individual Americans their livelihoods.\n  While we are rushing to solve the Y2K problem and the policy issues \ntherein, we should above all strive to enter the next century with a \nsense of vision, and this vision should include a prudent analysis of \nthe looming challenges of potential Y2K litigation. As I have said \nbefore, no one wants to begin the next millennium by trading a vision \nof the future for a subpoena.\n  I commend my colleagues from Arizona, Oregon and others who have \nworked so hard on this. I thank my colleague from South Carolina, the \nranking Democrat of this committee. He feels very strongly about this \nlegislation. It could have--as Members have the right to do--delayed \naction a long time on this. In fact, to be able to get to the \nconsideration of it today is something that I deeply appreciate. We \ndisagree on this matter. It is one of those rare occasions when we do. \nBut, when we do, that is a normal way of conducting business.\n  I happen to think this is a good bill. It is a practical bill. It is \na 36-month bill--3 years. That is it. It is narrow in scope and narrow \nin time. It is a practical way to try to deal with a serious problem \nthat looms on the horizon.\n  We have to have balance. It incorporates the ideas that are fair to \nthe plaintiffs and that are fair to the defendants. It allows \nresolution of these potential difficulties without having to get to \ncourt. We are a very litigious society. Every person in the country \nknows that. I think every effort that we can make to avoid going to \ncourt instead of rushing to fix the problem we ought to do. This bill \ntries to achieve that goal without denying people the right to get to \ncourt.\n  I commend my colleagues in this effort. I hope that we can pass this \nbill today or tomorrow after covering a variety of amendments, and go \nto conference.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a moment.\n  First, I thank the Democratic leader for the Y2K effort, and Senator \nDodd for all of his counsel and help. He, of course, is the principal \nauthor on securities litigation legislation which, to a great extent, \nthis bill is modeled after.\n  Just before I yield the floor, I, too, want to say to Senator \nHollings, the Democratic leader of the Commerce Committee, that I agree \nwith so much of what he has done--whether it is a matter of Social \nSecurity surplus or campaign finance. I regret that on this one we have \na difference of opinion.\n  I think that we have brought a balanced bill to the floor of the \nSenate. But I look forward to the many other issues on which Senator \nHollings and I are going to be in agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 609 To Amendment No. 608\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n  affect the applicability of any State law [in effect on the date of \n  enactment of this Act] that provides greater limits on damages and \n               liabilities than are provided in this Act)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 609 to amendment No. 608.\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . APPLICABILITY OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the \n     applicability of any State law that provides greater limits \n     on damages and liabilities than are provided in this Act.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say that I support \nthe piece of legislation that has been brought forward by Senator \nMcCain, working with the Senator from Oregon, and also the efforts of \nthe Senator from Connecticut in that regard.\n  I believe that we need to address a very important issue that is in \nthis amendment. I appreciate the work that Senator McCain and the \nCommerce Committee have done to craft this important and vital piece of \nlegislation, especially in our high-technology society.\n  I support this effort to encourage prompt resolution of Y2K problems, \nminimize business disruptions, and discourage unnecessary and costly \nlawsuits. However, I am concerned about one aspect of this proposal: \nState laws addressing year 2000 liability issues will be preempted by \nSenate bill 96 unless we specifically provide for protection of \nstronger State statutes. I am proposing an amendment to do just this.\n  The Colorado State Legislature passed a strong statute which \nspecifically addresses the Year 2000 liability issue.\n  Our Governor signed the legislation on April 5, 1999, and it will be \neffective July 1, 1999.\n  Colorado's law provides certain protections from damages for \nbusinesses that experience a year 2000 problem. While the intent of \nthis state law is similar to that of S. 96, the state's protections are \nstronger than those proposed in S. 96.\n  Colorado's statute will be overridden by the Federal legislation we \nare considering today.\n  My State is not the only one in this situation; Texas, North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Virginia, Florida, and Arizona have also passed Year 2000 \nliability legislation that is stronger than this Federal law would be \nin one way or another.\n  The State laws are consistent with the intent of S. 96 and were \nsupported by a broad cross-section of concerned groups.\n  In addition, 17 other States have pending Y2K legislation that is \nnear passage.\n  We should not be working to nullify the States' efforts. I am \noffering this amendment in order to allow the greater State limits on \ndamages and liabilities to stand.\n  The intent of S. 96 as it relates to State law is confusing, and most \ntroublesome is the provision stating that the Federal law will \nsupersede State law to the extent that it is inconsistent with the \nFederal law.\n  I am sure that several of my colleagues will be interested in \nprotecting their States' Year 2000 liability laws.\n  I encourage those Senators to support my amendment, and I encourage\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nothers to consider the justification for preempting State laws \noutright, especially those laws that establish stronger limits than \nproposed at the Federal level.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from Colorado to yield to me?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will tell my friend from Colorado that I believe we are \ngoing to accept the amendment. So the yeas and nays will not be \nnecessary. So I request that he retract his request.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado. This was exactly the intent when we reported this bill \nout by 11 to 9. Of the nine that was the main concern--that if there \nwere a problem, we have laws to take care of these problems. We have \nhad laws on the books for years. Business was moving.\n  What the Senator is saying here in this particular amendment is that \nthis shouldn't preempt any greater provisions of State law, that the \nState law would apply.\n  I think it is an excellent amendment. I am glad to accept it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank both the manager for the minority \nand the manager for the majority for their favorable comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't believe there is any further \ndebate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 609) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. I think \nit is an important amendment. I appreciate not only his concern for the \nentire bill but for the State of Colorado, since this obviously would \nhave an effect on the hard work of the State legislature and the \nGovernor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at an appropriate time I may send an \namendment to the desk. But I want to begin at least talking about where \nwe are, where this bill currently puts us, and I have a number of \npoints I would like to make in the effort to do that.\n  I am struck by one thing that has just happened, which is why I am a \nlittle less hesitant.\n  A few moments ago, the Senator from Colorado put in an amendment that \npreserved the State law; but at the same time the Senator from Oregon \npreviously had made it very clear that their bill leaves in place the \nexisting State law protections for consumers in both tort law and \ncontract, but, in fact, what has happened is by virtue of the amendment \njust passed by the Senator from Colorado, they have actually changed \nthat so that we have a different law for both contract and for tort.\n  It seems to me the bill has already, suddenly, by acceptance, moved \nto a significantly different place from what they had intended. Maybe \nthis will be worked out later. I think it certainly makes this bill \nmore complicated in many regards and will probably give yet another \nreason for the White House to veto this.\n  Let me state where I think we are with respect to this legislation. I \nsupported willfully, happily, and with a sense of pride the securities \nreform legislation. Senator Dodd was a leader on that, and I voted for \nit and voted to override the veto of the President because I thought it \nwas important to address what was an egregious overreach within the \nlegal community where we saw a pattern of abuse. We took action as a \nresult of that. I think it was the right action.\n  In addition, I also voted for tort reform with respect to the \naircraft industry, because Senator Kassebaum appropriately brought \nlegislation to the Senate that made it clear that liability issues with \nrespect to manufacturers--and she represented a State which is the home \nbase for Cessna, among other aircraft manufacturers--and we made an \nappropriate change in liability law in the capacity of lawyers to bring \nthese so-called dreaded lawsuits that we hear a lot about on the Senate \nfloor. I voted for that and we changed it. It was for the better.\n\n  I say that because I want to make it as clear as I can in an \natmosphere where people are quick to try to paint Members into a corner \nor sweep Members into one position of ideology or another. I am \napproaching this from a perspective of what I hope is common sense and \nfairness.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Arizona--who is a great \npersonal friend of mine and a man for whom I have enormous respect and \na great relationship--say a few minutes ago, and I will certainly pass \nit off merely as rhetoric, that the amendment I will offer is ``form \nover substance'' and it is designed to ``protect the income stream of \nthe trial lawyers.'' It is exactly that kind of polarization in the \nrhetoric that is preventing Members from looking at what the Senate may \nor may not do here, what the Congress may or may not do, and what may \nhappen to the American citizens that we represent.\n  I challenge my colleagues to show me one piece of language in the \namendment that I will submit that makes it easier for a lawyer to bring \na lawsuit. There is not one. In point of fact, every point raised by \nthe high-technology community that they wanted Members to address is \naddressed in their favor--in favor of the high-tech community. They \nwanted a period to cure; we provide a period to cure. They wanted \nmitigation; we put a responsibility on plaintiffs to mitigate. They \nwanted economic loss and contract preserved; we preserve contract law. \nFinally, they wanted proportionality; all we require for them to \nqualify for proportionality is that they act as a good citizen and do \ntwo things: We ask they identify the potential in the product they make \nfor a Y2K failure, and having done so, we ask that they let their \npurchasers, their clients, know of that potential.\n  That is all we ask. We don't ask that they fix it. They have a duty; \nthey have a period of cure within which they can fix it. If they fix it \nwithin the duty, a period of cure, as the McCain bill, they would be \nfree from any lawsuit.\n  That doesn't help plaintiffs. That is not a plaintiff's bill. That is \nnot an effort to maintain the revenue stream for lawyers.\n  Let's talk about the reality of what is happening here. The reality \nis that an industry is coming to the Congress for the first time in \nAmerican history and asking for prospective anticipatory relief from \nliability for something they make--the first time ever.\n  What would happen if Ford Motor Company came in here and said: Gee, \nwe produced a car that instead of turning right while turning the wheel \nright, turns left. Forgive us. We will fix it. Don't worry.\n  There are similar ways in which companies could come to a Senator and \nsay they don't want to be held liable because they ``kind of overlooked \nsomething.''\n  As the Senator from South Carolina said a little while ago, 20 years \nago people knew about this. The founder and executive director of RX \n2000 Solutions Institute said:\n\n       I am a former computer programmer who used two digits \n     instead of four to delineate the year. Granted, this was more \n     than 20 years ago, but even then I was aware of the anomaly \n     posed by the year 2000. When I expressed concern to my \n     supervisor, he laughed and told me not to worry.\n\n  The Y2K bug is not something that just fell out of the sky. The Y2K \nbug is not a freak occurrence that happened as a God-given act. The Y2K \nproblem is a result of conscious choices that people made or didn't \nmake, deliberate decisions made to delay fixing a problem. They have \nled us to where we are now.\n\n  I represent high-technology companies, and I am very proud of them. I \nhave had the support of high-technology CEOs, workers, and employees. I \ntruly have a respect for the entrepreneurial capacity and the \nextraordinary path they are leading us on that is second to nobody in \nthe Senate, and I understand the nature and complexity of this Y2K \nproblem that suggests we don't want to have a wholesale slug of \nlawsuits that clog the courts, that create the capacity for small \ncompanies to tie up their capital, to diminish further entrepreneurial \neffort, to reduce creativity.\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\n  I understand all of those arguments. Together with Senator Robb, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Akaka, I \nam offering a compromise. It is not everything that the Chamber of \nCommerce wants, and it sure isn't everything the lawyers want. However, \nit is common sense, and it will be signed by the President of the \nUnited States into law. The bill that is being offered by Senator \nMcCain and others will not in its current form be signed into law.\n  If Members are really concerned about the Y2K problem and want to do \nsomething about it, we have an opportunity to legislate on the floor of \nthe Senate in a way that is fair, that makes sense, and that will help \nthe companies deal with Y2K, and at the same time, it doesn't turn \naround and ignore common sense about how to leverage good behavior \nwithin the community.\n  People ask, What are the real differences between this bill and \nSenator McCain's bill? I will get to that. I will explain that. Two of \nthe most important are on the issue of proportionality. That takes a \nlittle bit of explanation. Not everybody in the Senate is a lawyer. \nThere are 55 Members who are, but even among lawyers there has always \nbeen a great tension on this issue of joint and several liability \nversus proportional damages.\n  Under the bill that Senator McCain, Senator Dodd, and Senator Wyden \nare offering the Senate, a company will automatically get proportional \nliability. They don't have to be a good citizen. They don't have to go \nout and remediate, even though they say that remediation is the purpose \nof their legislation. There is no leverage in getting out of joint and \nseveral liability that encourages them to remediate. They automatically \nget proportional damages. The bill gives it to them right up front--\nautomatic. So they could display the most negligent, the most reckless \nbehavior, and still they get it. Is that possible? Some people will sit \nhere and say no, that is not going to happen.\n  Look at the instance the Senator from South Carolina talked about. \nFord Motor Company is historically recorded as having made a conscious \nbusiness decision to measure how much it cost them to move the gas \ntanks and fix the gas tank problem versus the potential of damages. \nThey chose not to move it and ultimately it caught up to them in a \nfamous, famous case and they paid the price. That is why we have had \nsomething called punitive damages.\n  Punitive damages are not, as the Senator from Arizona said, simply to \ndeter. Punitive damages are punitive. They are to punish in addition to \ndeter. The deterrence is not just as to the behavior of the entity that \nis creating the problems. The deterrent is as to other potential \nentities, in the future. The reason we have the potential of punitives \nwithin the legal system is not just to deter behavior among a \nparticular set of actors engaged in a particular behavior at a \nparticular time. It is to say to other actors at a future time: If you \ndo not heed the warning that the products you make could subject you to \nparticular kinds of damages, then you, too, may be subject to them in \nthe future. That is why, today, young kids have pajamas that don't \ncatch on fire. That is why, today, people have all kinds of products in \ntheir homes where people are sensitive to what the impact of that \nproduct may be on a user.\n\n  My colleagues come in here and say we don't want punitives. These \noutrageous lawyers are going to come in and maybe get a punitive damage \nverdict. Let me tell you what my colleagues, either inadvertently or \nwillfully, are doing. They are protecting companies from a requirement \nthat the behavior they engage in has to be--let me make this very \nclear. Punitive damages are only awarded if a plaintiff can show the \ndefendant acted in the worst activity possible, worse than mere \nnegligence. We are talking about a defendant who has to commit either \nan intentional tort or otherwise here, because in their bill they have \na very narrow limitation as to who will qualify for joint and several, \nvery narrow. The fact is, they will exempt anybody who acts willfully, \nwantonly, maliciously, recklessly or outrageously.\n  I ask a simple question: What is the public policy rationale for \ncoming in here and saying that a company that acted maliciously, \nwillfully, recklessly, outrageously should somehow be completely \nexempted from the potential of joint and several liability and have a \nblanket exemption even before the fact? I do not understand that. I do \nnot understand the public policy. Just because we do not like lawyers, \njust because on a few occasions there have been a couple of bad jury \nverdicts of punitive damages--which in every occasion, I say to my \nfriends, have been reduced by the court on appeal. Those never get \npaid. They are great for headlines. They are wonderful for bad \nreputations for lawyers. But they don't get paid because the courts \nreduce them.\n  So I do not want to come here to the floor of the Senate and battle \nphantoms. I don't want to battle dragons that do not exist. I want to \ndeal with the real problem of Y2K, and we deal with the real problem of \nY2K because we make it tougher for lawyers to bring cases. I agree with \nwhat my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, said a few minutes \nago. He said we, in a litigious society, do not want a lot of frivolous \nlawsuits. We do not want to be caught up in court with a whole lot of \nlawsuits that are inappropriate.\n  I agree with that. I was outraged when I heard about lawyers \nautomatically triggering lawsuits by computer when stocks changed and \nso forth. That is an abuse of the system. We ought to do everything in \nour power to require that the Federal courts, through the rules that \nare available to them, hold lawyers accountable so that frivolous \nlawsuits are denied and so forth. But we go farther than that. In my \namendment, on Y2K we in fact lay out a series of requirements that make \nit much tougher for any lawyer to bring a case. Just like the \nlegislation of Senator McCain, ours is a 3-year bill. But ours is a 3-\nyear bill that does not harm consumers. Ours is a 3-year bill that has \na fair balance between this interest for remediation or mitigation and \nwhat we are prepared to contribute to the well-being of the whole \nindustry, to blanket the whole industry.\n  Let me be specific about what I mean by that. The Y2K bill of Senator \nMcCain and company provides you automatically get proportionality, \nproportional damages. Ours says you have to do two things. You have to \nmake the effort to identify the potential for a Y2K failure and then \nput out the information to the people you have dealt with about that \npotential.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to get companies to fix the \nproblem ahead of time. In order to get a company to fix the problem \nahead of time, you want to have the maximum incentive to the company. \nSo if you say to the company: Look, you can have the lower standard. \nYou can have what you want--which is you can get out from under joint \nand several; you can have proportional liability--but we want you to do \nsomething so you will encourage the very remediation and mitigation we \nare looking for. We want you to look at your products and see what the \npotential is for one of them to have a Y2K failure. When you find the \npotential, we want you to be a good citizen and tell the people who \nbought the things from you about it.\n  Why is that better than Senator McCain's bill? It is better because \nof the Pinto principle. Some companies may look at the situation and \nsay: Hey, the Senate just gave us proportional liability and we don't \neven have to worry about paying the full 80 percent if we think we have \nonly 20 percent liability because we don't have to do anything. They \ngave it to us. It is cheaper for us not to fix it and wait and see if \nanybody comes after us. And when they do come after us, all we are \ngoing to have to do is do the 20 percent, not the 80 percent. I ask my \ncolleagues, how is that an incentive for the good fixing of the problem \nbeforehand that we are seeking?\n  The answer is, it is not. It will have exonerated people before the \nfact from the very thing we are trying to encourage, which is the \nincentive to fix it.\n  I find it very hard to believe that my colleagues in the Senate want \nto vote against asking companies to be good citizens. I find it hard to \nbelieve that my colleagues are unwilling to say a company ought to just \nlook for the potential of failure. We do not require that they \nabsolutely find it. We do not\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nrequire that they identify it. They have to make a good-faith effort to \nlook for it.\n  Every company with whom I have talked tells me they have already done \nthat. Most companies tell me they qualify today and they would accept \nthat standard. I am proud to say that a company--I have a letter \nreceived today from Brian Keane who is co-president of the Keane \nCompany headquartered in Boston, MA. It is a $1.1 billion information \ntechnology corporation and has over 12,000 employees located in 26 \nStates. I quote from part of the letter, which I ask unanimous consent \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Keane, Inc.,\n\n                                         Boston, MA, June 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Senator John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: Keane, Inc. is a publicly traded, $1.1 \n     billion information technology corporation with over 12,000 \n     employees located in 26 states. As you know, Keane is \n     headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.\n       We are encouraged by your leadership role in the ongoing \n     debate over the Y2K liability legislation. Keane is concerned \n     that this important legislation is being used as a \n     ``political football'' and would encourage all parties \n     engaged in the debate to work together to craft legislation \n     that will not only pass the Senate and the House, but also be \n     signed by the President. Y2K liability legislation is a \n     matter of great importance to Keane because, over the past \n     three years, Keane has worked with literally hundreds of \n     American companies to help them solve the Y2K problem.\n       Keane believes the most recent draft of the Kerry language \n     is a politically viable solution, because it serves the \n     purpose of protecting against frivolous Y2K litigation and \n     would be signed by the President.\n       Opponents of the Kerry bill argue that it does not \n     adequately address the distribution of damages to responsible \n     parties. However, Keane believes that the proportional \n     liability language in the Kerry bill addresses this issue. \n     Specifically, your staff has assured us that your language \n     would protect defendants who demonstrate that the plaintiff \n     restricted access to or failed to notify the defendant about \n     any function(s) that could corrupt other Y2K vulnerable \n     systems and defendant's who (1) performed a reasonable \n     assessment with a defined methodology for resolution of the \n     plaintiff's Y2K vulnerability prior to implementing a \n     solution; or (2) implemented the Y2K solution with \n     coordinated-comprehensive testing and quality assurance \n     processes; or (3) secured, after completion of the \n     remediation or testing, a formal acceptance agreement from \n     the plaintiff. With such protections, Keane can endorse the \n     Kerry language without reservation.\n       We appreciate your attention and leadership on this very \n     serious matter and look forward to working with your office \n     in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brian Keane,\n                                                     Co-President.\n\n  (Mr. BUNNING assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KERRY. It says:\n\n       Keane believes the most recent draft of the Kerry language \n     is a politically viable solution, because it serves the \n     purpose of protecting against frivolous Y2K litigation and \n     would be signed by the President.\n       Opponents of the Kerry bill argue that it does not \n     adequately address the distribution of damages to the \n     responsible parties. However, Keane believes that the \n     proportional liability language in the Kerry bill addresses \n     this issue. Specifically, your staff has assured us that your \n     language would protect defendants who demonstrate that the \n     plaintiff restricted access to or failed to notify the \n     defendant about any function that could corrupt other Y2K \n     vulnerable systems and defendants who (1) performed a \n     reasonable assessment with a defined methodology for \n     resolution of the plaintiff's Y2K vulnerability prior to \n     implementing the solution, or, (2) implemented the Y2K \n     solution with coordinated comprehensive testing and quality \n     assurance processes. . . . Keane can endorse the Kerry \n     language without reservation.\n\n  I believe that is reasonable, and I believe it is reasonable because \nthey have looked at the reality of the language we have put forward. I \nwant to go through a little bit of this now.\n  The McCain bill does not protect the individual consumer. They are \nrequiring the individual person to go through the same hoops and the \nsame requirements as a corporation. Again one has to ask: What is the \npublic policy rationale for asking one--let's say one of these people \nsitting up in the gallery is assured, when they buy an alarm system for \ntheir house, that the alarm system is Y2K compatible. But they leave to \ngo on vacation, the alarm system fails in the year 2000, their house is \nrobbed, and they want recoupment.\n  They have to go through every hoop of a large corporation. They \ncannot go right in, file their suit, and get redress. They are going to \nhave to be treated like the other corporate entities, and they cannot \neven get the discovery. They are left as powerless as, unfortunately, \nthe average consumer is in our society today.\n  Again, when one looks at public policy rationale, it is hard to \ndiscern, and this is the main reason: Most of the Y2K problems that \npeople are envisioning are corporation to corporation. We are talking \nabout contract law. Most of this is contract law, and what we are \ntalking about are companies that are going to have an interest \nconceivably in suing another company because the product they bought \nfrom that company does not do what the company that sold it to them \nsaid it would do.\n  Maybe under their warranties, just under the contract, it will be \ntaken care of. But what the McCain bill wants to do is say to every \nAmerican consumer: You are going to have to wait 3 months; you are \ngoing to have to wait the 30 days for the filing; you are going to have \nto refile if you were not filing with pleadings that were specific \nenough, according to what the corporation had to go through.\n  It is a remarkable thing, in my judgment, to thrust that kind of \nburden on a lot of situations that would be very difficult. Let me give \nyou an example. This is very specific, and I apologize, it will take a \nminute, but I want to go through it.\n  Let's take a Mrs. Barnes who owns a home several streets away from \nthe Acme Chemical Company. There are 85 million Americans who live or \nwork within a 5-mile radius of one or more of the 66,000 facilities \nthat handle or store high-hazard chemicals. Let me repeat that: 85 \nmillion of our fellow citizens live in homes near a chemical company.\n  On January 1, 2000, let's assume Acme's safety system fails and \nhazardous chemicals are released into the air and on to the land in the \nneighborhood. It forces Mrs. Barnes and others to evacuate their homes. \nPeople are allowed back into their homes after 2 days, but Mrs. Barnes' \nproperty is contaminated, including her well. She retains an attorney \nand she files a tort claim for recovery.\n  Acme Chemical claims that a Y2K computer failure was partially at \nfault for the safety system malfunctioning. Mrs. Barnes did not know \nthat Y2K was a defense, of course, because most average citizens will \nnot know this.\n  Under the new law, the Acme Company will treat the complaint as the \nnotice. She has to wait 30 days for Acme to respond. In 30 days, they \nrespond by saying: We can't pay for the cleanup and lost value. But she \nhas to wait another 60 days to refile her lawsuit, notwithstanding that \nthey tell her that.\n  Now the average American consumer is out 90 days and does not know \nwhere they are going, because we have protected the entity. All \ndiscovery is stayed during this period. There is not anybody in our \nsystem of justice who does not know what happens when you stay \ndiscovery for 90 days.\n  In 2 months, Mrs. Barnes refiles her suit. She refiles it against the \ncompany that installed the safety system. Under the McCain bill, she \nhas to plead her case with a particularity in the complaint. She can \nstate her damages as required, but she is going to have a lot of \ntrouble specifying the materiality effect because she will not know \nwhat that is because there has been no discovery. The case is dismissed \nbecause the complaint failed to meet the pleadings requirements.\n  Assume somehow she can meet the pleadings requirement. She comes \nback, she finds other information to survive another motion to dismiss, \nand finally gets her day in court.\n  After hearing the case, the jury finds both defendants acted \nrecklessly and outrageously for not identifying and fixing the problem, \nand it awards her $300,000 compensation for the property and the need \nto replace her water supply. They may find that Acme is 70 percent \nresponsible and the safety system 30 percent liable under the \nproportionality. The total amount of her award might be $1.3 million, \nwith the compensatory and punitive adjusted and reduced by the number \nof people according to the cap, because they only have 40 people who \nwork for them. Under the cap in S. 96, that would be an adjusted award \nof $550,000.\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\n  We find that Acme cannot pay for all of the damage and files for \nbankruptcy. The safety system pays Mrs. Barnes $90,000 under their \npercentage, but that is not enough to clean up her property. She cannot \nget a new water supply, especially after she pays the legal bills. She \ntries to collect from Acme but without success. In the end, under the \nState law she would have received her $1.3 million, but because we are \ngoing to take that away, at the end, because of the Senate bill that is \ncontemplated being passed here that does not protect this individual \nconsumer, she will be left with only $135,000--not nearly enough to \ncompensate for her loss, pay her legal fees, replenish her well and \nmake her whole.\n\n  What is the public policy here? That is literally how this bill would \nwork. That is taking us step by step through the requirements that are \nbeing put on the average American here, even though what we are really \ntalking about doing here is protecting companies from lawsuits by \ncompanies.\n  To the degree that my colleagues say: Wait a minute, Senator. We know \nabout those naughty things called class actions, and we don't want to \nhave a class action brought against us, I say to my colleagues, I \nagree. We want to have a tough standard for the potential of any class \naction.\n  So we have put in our bill something lawyers do not like; we have put \nin our bill a materiality requirement that means they have to show that \nvery specificity of defect, and it has to be specifically material to \nthe impact on that particular damage that took place for that person. \nThe majority of the people who make up the class have to have the same \nlinkage to the materiality. That makes it very hard to go out and just \nconstruct a class. So I think class actions would, in fact, be \nseriously reduced and impacted in an appropriate way, I might add. So \nwe are raising the bar. We are raising the standard.\n  Our bill, therefore, in my judgment, protects consumers. The McCain \nbill would apply all of its procedural burdens and damage limitations \nto individual consumers. I know that this is one of the things that the \nWhite House, the President, is particularly concerned about. We need to \ntry to find some kind of reasonable compromise. We have not. And that \nbegs a veto.\n  In addition, I have talked about the proportionality issue. It is \nhard to believe that colleagues would not be willing to vote that a \ncompany ought to engage in good citizen behavior of a two-step effort \nto identify mere potential--I underscore that mere potential; the \ncompany does not have to find the problem; the company does not have to \ncure the problem--they have to find the mere potential that something \nthat they have created may have done it; and, two, let people know that \nthey have done that. It is hard to believe that we would not vote to do \nthat.\n  In addition to that, we impose an additional duty on the plaintiff. \nMy colleague from Arizona said this is to keep the revenue stream \ngoing. We impose an additional duty on the plaintiff because existing \nState law generally requires plaintiffs to mitigate their losses in the \ncase of a breach of contract. S. 96 puts on the plaintiff an additional \nburden to mitigate that isn't part of additional contract law, which \nallows a defendant to argue that the plaintiff should have avoided the \ndamages based on information that was in the public domain.\n  So what we have done, to encourage information sharing and in order \nto encourage the remediation that we want, we leave the existing State \nlaw duties in place, supplementing them with an additional mitigation \nrequirement if the defendant itself made the information available.\n  Why is that good policy? Because, again, it encourages the good \nbehavior that our colleagues are saying everybody is going to engage in \nbut for which there is no certainty and there is no leverage.\n\n  Here you have an additional burden on the plaintiff if the company \nundertook to share the information. What does that do? That means that \nthe company is going to say: Oh, boy, if we go out and get the \ninformation and we put it out to the people we have sold it to, they \nare going to have the burden of showing that we somehow did not do what \nwe were supposed to. We have shifted the burden to the people who then \nwould be the plaintiffs. It makes it harder to bring a case. It also \ndoes more to encourage the mitigation that we want to get in this \nparticular effort.\n  I want to make it very clear, I think it was back in April the \nSenator from Arizona, the chairman, put a letter in the Record from \nAndy Grove of Intel. The letter that was part of Mr. Grove's \ncommunication to the chairman. I will read the relevant portion of it:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain . . . The consensus text that has \n     evolved from continuing bipartisan discussions would \n     substantially encourage [bipartisan] action and discourage \n     frivolous lawsuits.\n\n  He cited several key measures that are essential to ensure fair \ntreatment of all parties under the law.\n  One was procedural incentives, the requirement of notice and an \nopportunity to cure defects before a suit is filed.\n  Senator McCain has that in his bill. We have that in our bill: The \nsame procedural requirement to cure, the same procedural effort to have \nalternative dispute resolution. We both encourage alternative dispute \nresolution and mitigation.\n  Second point: A requirement that courts respect the agreements of the \nparties on such matters as warranty obligations and definition of \nrecoverable damages.\n  Senator McCain does that; we do that. We provide the exact provision \nof contract protection except where there is an intentional--\nintentional--injury to a party. I ask my colleagues, what is the public \npolicy rationale for exempting a company from an intentional wrongdoing \nto an individual that is not a specific intent to that individual but \nnevertheless fits under the concept of a reckless, willful, or wanton \nact?\n  Third, Mr. Grove said he wanted threshold pleading provisions \nrequiring particularity as to the nature, amount, and factual basis for \ndamages and materiality of defects. We do the same thing. Senator \nMcCain does that; we do that.\n  Finally, appointment of liability according to fault, on principles \napproved by the Senate in two previous measures. That is the securities \nreform bill. I have already spoken to that.\n  Senator McCain gives it to them no matter what, forget it. You just \nget it because you are who you are. We give it to them if they take two \nsteps: Identify the potential for a Y2K problem, which is what this \nbill is all about, and let the people they have dealt with know about \nthat potential.\n  Again, we do not require that they fix it. We do not require with a \ncertainty that they find it. We require that they just say there is a \npotential. That is what they have to go out and fix.\n  The fact is that is a minimalist standard that most companies ought \nto be prepared to live by. Every company I have talked to tells me they \nare doing that. Of course, they are going to do that. They would have \nno reason to be concerned about that.\n  So the real fight here, I suppose, is over punitive damages and over \nthe breadth of reach that some people are making with respect to some \nother efforts which I can go into later as they arise in the course of \nthe debate.\n  We have a consumer carveout. We have a duty to mitigate. We have \nproportionate liability.\n  The McCain bill also creates jurisdiction for almost all Y2K class \nactions in Federal court. We do not do that. First of all, the Federal \nbar has told us they cannot handle it. They do not have room for \nwhatever that might mean. Secondly, I cannot think of anything less \nrespectful of States rights, of the States' abilities to manage their \nown affairs with respect to how they want to proceed. There is no \nshowing that that is, in fact, necessary. So the reach of the bill, in \nfact, goes further than that which is necessary to fix Y2K.\n  I want to emphasize that I still hope maybe we can find some medium \nwhere people will come together. It may be that the Senate isn't in the \nmood to do that right now, so it will just go ahead and pass S. 96--it \nwill go to conference, come back, and then go to the President, and he \nwill veto it, and we will come back. Or maybe when the President gets \ninto the negotiations in the conference committee, the very things I am \ntalking about will be resolved, and it will come back to us in a way \nthat people of good conscience can say: This is good public policy \nbecause it protects consumers even as it creates a\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\nfair process for the avoidance of frivolous suits and the avoidance of \nthe burdening of an industry that we all respect and care about.\n  I think our bill does that. I think our bill justifiably protects the \ncapacity of companies to be free from frivolous lawsuits. It increases \nthe pleading requirements. It provides a cure period. It provides a \nduty to mitigate. It shifts a greater duty to the plaintiffs, and it \ndoes so, I think, in a reasonable and fair-minded way.\n  I regret that, unfortunately, this debate has been so caught up in a \nlarger agenda of entities that are very forceful outside of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I continue to respect the views of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. He makes some very persuasive arguments.\n  I strongly recommend to the Senator from Massachusetts that he put \nhis objections in the form of an amendment or amendments and we vote. \nWe have been through, I think the Senator from Massachusetts would \nagree, literally weeks, if not months, of negotiations with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. At no time have we been able to agree. I strongly \nrecommend that he just propose an amendment, and we have a vote on it. \nThe Senate will be on record. We will be then able to move forward, as \nis the legislative process.\n  I will make a parliamentary point. I have asked the Democratic side \nto try to get an agreement within about an hour or so on remaining \namendments that will be proposed of the 12. We now have about 6 or 7. I \nthink the same is true on the other side. We want to give everybody \nample opportunity to propose their amendments. Then I will also ask \nthat we get those amendments in so we can start negotiating time \nagreements. I see no reason why we can't finish this bill by tomorrow \nevening.\n  I urge my colleagues, again, if you have an amendment on either side \nof the aisle, tell Senator Hollings or me so we can get those 12 nailed \ndown on either side so we can start negotiating.\n  I think it is very important to recognize that there has been amazing \nsolidarity shown on the part of big, medium, and small business on this \nlegislation, including the parts of it that were just addressed by the \nSenator from Massachusetts. They do not accept his remedy. I strongly \nadmire the knowledge, the information, and the incredible tenacity \nthat Senator Kerry has shown on this issue.\n\n  The reality is--and every once in awhile we have to face reality, I \nsay to my friend from Massachusetts--we are going no further. However, \nif we are going no further in the process of negotiation, that does not \nchange in the slightest the fact that the Senator from Massachusetts \ncan propose 1 of these 12 amendments, or 2 or 3 or 4 of them, I think \nthere is room, and we can debate and vote on them.\n  I yield for the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the chairman yielding. I will be brief.\n  I think what the chairman of the Commerce Committee is suggesting is \na practical way to get at it. This Member of the Senate believes, with \nall due respect to my friend from Massachusetts, that the Kerry \namendment would be a lightning rod for additional frivolous lawsuits \nwith respect to Y2K. I think, for example, some of the language is so \nvague--this question of identifying the potential for Y2K failure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. As soon as I have made this point, because it is the \nchairman's time.\n  I think that is so vague that it is going to ignite a litigation \nderby. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we have had a kind of mixing of the concept of punitive \ndamages and proportionality by the Senator from Massachusetts that I \nthink is just not borne out by the bipartisan bill. Our punitive damage \nlimitation applies only to small business. It has nothing to do with \nreckless behavior or careless behavior.\n  On proportionality, we are saying that you can hold everybody liable \nfor exactly what they contribute, whether they are a small business or \nanything else.\n  Finally, on the example of the person, I believe it was Mrs. Barnes, \nand the chemical plant, she has all her existing remedies with respect \nto personal injury and wrongful conduct under negligence law. That is \nall outlined on page 10.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the Commerce Committee yielding me the \ntime to briefly make a response to the Kerry amendment. As I say, I am \na Senator who agrees with the Senator from Massachusetts on so many \nthings. I do share his view that I hope by the time we are done with \nthis legislation, we can have something that gets upwards of 70 votes. \nBut suffice it to say, this Senator believes, with all due respect, the \nproposal of the Senator from Massachusetts will be a lightning rod for \na variety of frivolous lawsuits.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I intend to send my amendment to the desk. \nIt is more inadvertence than anything else, and enthusiasm. I am not \ngoing to delay it whatsoever. I agree with him. We want to get on with \nthis and make an effort.\n  Let me just make a couple of comments and address this. First of all, \nwith respect to what the Senator from Oregon just said, the woman in \nthe hypothetical I used would be precluded from the very kind of \ndamages, because your bill limits it to physical injury. She is not \nphysically injured. The fact is, the property damage and other damage \nwould, in fact, not be subject to it.\n  Secondly, under the economic losses in the bill from the Senator from \nArizona--and I think this is important for the Senator from Arizona to \nunderstand--data processing would not be included in the definition \nthat you have with respect to economic loss. You speak to the question \nof property and you allow certain kinds of property, but you don't \ninclude in the definition of ``property'' intellectual property.\n  What happens if a company has a loss as a consequence of an entire \nsoftware system that went down and their data being lost and, \ntherefore, they do not provide a service to somebody? You could have a \nhuge economic interruption as a result of that, and you don't include \nthat as an economic loss. I will give you the precise language. There \nare serious, real consequences here.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Oregon just said that we are just \nprecluding small businesses from punitive damages. Again, I just spoke \nat a graduation of a law school. I hate to say it, I had to stand up \nand say in front of the graduates of the law school, welcome to the \nmost hated profession in America. They understood what I was saying.\n  You can't come to the floor of the Senate and quote me defending \nlawyers. That is not what I am doing. I am defending a principle. I am \ndefending a cherished notion within America about how we redress \nproblems.\n  I know people do not like being hauled into court. I almost laughed \nwhen I heard the Senator from Arizona say that all the big businesses \nand all the business community are united behind this bill. Of course, \nthey are. Big surprise. They are about to get out from under an \naccountability system that suggests to them that they ought to behave \nsome way.\n  The Senator from Oregon has just said to me, small businesses will \nonly be held accountable for the proportion that they are liable. OK. \nWhat happens in this example? The small businesses in Oregon and the \npeople served are in Oregon, but they are only 20 percent of the \nproblem. The people who sold them the hardware and the rest of the \nequipment are in Japan. You cannot reach them, because you are a small \nlawyer and you don't have the long reach. You don't have jurisdiction, \nand you cannot get them conceivably. There are a lot of companies out \nthere right now operating like that. So all you have is 20 percent of \nthe person being made whole.\n  The theory of law for years, under joint and several, has been that \nin America we care first about the victim, and we are going to make the \nvictim whole. Then the companies that have the power and the clout will \nsort out between each other who gets what. That has been a very \nefficient and effective distribution system. It is efficient.\n  What we are now saying is, sorry, average American, sorry, we are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\ngive the power back to the corporate entities and you, the little \naverage person, you are going to have to go to Japan and chase them, or \nyou are going to have to just stomach your loss.\n  Small businesses are most of the business in the country. I am also \npretty sensitive to that, because I am the ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee. I take great pride in the things that I have done \nto try to further small business efforts. I believe in it. I am the \nonly Senator I know who has a zero capital gains tax bill here for \ntargeted investments in the high, critical technologies. I would love \nto empower small business to do better. But all that punitives apply to \nare willful, wanton, reckless, destructive, irresponsible, unacceptable \nbehavior. And what my colleagues are doing is coming to the floor, as a \nmatter of public policy, and saying the Senate ought to go on record \nsaying that we don't care how you behave. We are going to take away the \ncapacity to make the average citizen whole, and we are going to give it \nto the corporate entity.\n\n  Now, I love these corporations. Look, I represent them and I respect \nthe leaders of them. They are doing great work for America. We have \ncreated 18 million jobs in the last 10 years or so because of their \nvirtues and capacities. I will come back here and labor on their behalf \non encryption and a host of other things. But, fair is fair. Fair is \nfair. Are you telling me we should not have these companies do two \nsimple things?\n  My colleague said the language is too vague on those two simple \nthings. Well, let's talk about that for a minute. The bill says \n``identify the potential.'' What does that mean, ``identify the \npotential''? Does anybody have trouble with that? It means to identify \nwhether the product the defendant made or sold had the potential for \nY2K failure. How would you know that? You know you have an embedded \nchip in it. You know whether or not in the digitalization process you \nuse two or four digits. I am not technically competent enough to tell \nyou all of them, but there are people who are; they are running around \nthe country fixing these things.\n  The IRS has invested $1.3 billion and several years of effort in \norder to be Y2K compliant, and they are today. How did they get there? \nThey got there because they asked this very question. Do we have the \npotential for failure? And if we do, what are we going to do to fix it?\n  My colleagues come to the floor and they are trying to tell us that \nthis bill is to encourage people to fix it. But what do they do? They \nlet them right out from underneath it, give them an upfront, blanket \nexemption saying: We are not going to require that you be subject to \njoint and several; you don't have to do anything; you just walk. And \nthat is wrong as a matter of policy.\n  All we ought to ask them to do is the very thing this bill's purpose \nis about: Look and see if you have the potential for failure and tell \nthe people you sold it to. If we can't ask them to do that, then we are \nnot standing up for the average citizen in this country. It is that \nsimple.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 610 to Amendment No. 608\n\n   (Purpose: To regulate interstate commerce by making provision for \n  dealing with losses arising from Year 2000 Problem-related failures \n that may disrupt communications, intermodal transportation, and other \n                 matters affecting interstate commerce)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Robb, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Akaka, and \n     Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 610 to Amendment \n     No. 608.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I find the logic of my friend from \nMassachusetts somewhat tortured. He maintains that these ``two simple \nthings'' will meet the approval of the high-tech community. Yet, it \ndoesn't. So in his mind, of course, clearly it should. But the fact is, \nit doesn't.\n  So we are in a very interesting kind of hyperbole here that the \nSenator from Massachusetts keeps saying the high-tech community \nsupports this and this is perfectly acceptable to them. Yet, they don't \nsupport it or agree with it--and for good reason--because these ``two \nsimple things'' are directed at the high-tech defendants, not the rest \nof the business community that will be defendants. When a wholesaler \nfixes their systems within their company, yet it leases a trucking \ngroup to deliver whatever that product is, and then they are subject to \njoint and several liability, then, of course, it opens the floodgates.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts seems surprised that, or somehow casts \ndoubt about the motivation of business in supporting this legislation. \nOf course they are supporting it, because they don't want to be subject \nto a flood of litigation. That is the whole purpose of the legislation. \nThe whole purpose, I tell my friend from Massachusetts, is to stop a \nflood of litigation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In a second. The Progressive Policy Institute of the \nDemocratic Leadership Counsel says:\n\n       Despite the number of lawsuits avoided during a 90-day cure \n     period, or the number of disputes settled through ADR, the \n     cost of Y2K litigation will remain exorbitantly high as long \n     as opportunities remain for people to abuse our legal system. \n     However, there are a number of Y2K-specific reforms that can \n     be enacted to curb that abuse and the subsequent costs. To \n     begin with, responsibly strengthening pleading standards \n     would keep many baseless suits out of the systems. Plaintiffs \n     seeking money awards for damages should be required to state \n     the particular nature and effects of material Y2K defects and \n     how they figured into calculating those damages. In addition, \n     to insure fairness, rejected plaintiffs should be allowed to \n     refile their suits with the required specifics in order to \n     protect legitimate claims that are not initially apparent. \n     Furthermore, legislation should deny awards for damages that \n     could reasonably have been avoided.\n       Class action suits are normally the most expensive and \n     wasteful of product liability lawsuits and often contain \n     enormous numbers of groundless complaints. Legislation should \n     insure that the majority of members in class action suits \n     have truly experienced Y2K-related failures and deserve \n     redress. By reducing the number of invalid claims, waste and \n     fraud could be significantly eliminated from the adjudication \n     of class action suits.\n       The effects of abusive litigation could be further curbed \n     by restricting the award of punitive damages.\n\n  That is what this legislation does. That is where the Senator's \namendment will open a loophole wide enough to drive a truck through.\n  Punitive damages are meant to punish poor behavior and discourage it \nin the future. However, because this is a one-time event, the only \nthing deterred by excessive punitive damages in Y2K cases would be \nremediation efforts by businesses.\n\n  I say again to the Senator from Massachusetts--and we have had this \ndialog for hours on the floor, and for hours in the committee, and I \nwill continue because of the enormous affection I have for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. We will continue this dialog. We are in fundamental \ndisagreement on the interpretation of the Senator's proposed amendment. \nIt is as simple as that. So I would be----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the chairman yield briefly?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts has asked me to yield \nfirst.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to let my colleague go first, and I will come \nback.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Oregon for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman.\n  It seems to me that on the basis of everything we have gone through \nin terms of the committee, there is a reason that the high-tech \ncommunity is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry amendment. As far as I \ncan tell, there is this company the Senator from Massachusetts has \ntalked about, and I will acknowledge that. But the high-tech community, \nas far as I can tell, is overwhelmingly opposed to this Kerry \namendment. As far as I can tell, the reason they are is that the Kerry \namendment introduces vague, ill-defined terms that are going to trigger\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nmore litigation. On the basis of everything we went through in the \ncommittee, is it the chairman's judgment that that is the reason the \nhigh-tech community is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry proposal now \nbefore the Senate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding.\n  Obviously, I would like to include the Senator from Massachusetts in \nthis dialog. Under his amendment--and I will be glad to respond to his \nquestion--isn't it true that defendants who are in the middle of the \nsupply chain may be sued for a breach of contract caused not by the \nfailure of the defendant's computers but by those elsewhere in the \nsupply chain? That is the fundamental problem we have with Senator \nKerry's amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me respond to that because it is very \nimportant. May I also respond by saying this, and, again, I say this \nwith great respect and affection for both of my colleagues. But to be \non the floor of the Senate using as a justification the passage of \nsomething that does somebody a lot of good, the fact that they like \nthat it does them a lot of good, is kind of a strange argument. If the \nfox is there to guard the chicken coop and you are going to put a big \nfence around the chickens, and you ask the fox, ``Do you like it?'' and \nhe says, ``No,'' that is no surprise. It is the same thing here. Who is \ngoing to be surprised that the companies are going to say: Of course, \nwe support your bill, because it gives us more than we really properly \nought to get.\n  Having said that, let me say to my friend that our bill does \neverything the Senator from Arizona just said.\n  We could do all of the things the Senator listed. The only difference \nis, we asked them to identify the potential for the failure and provide \ninformation that is calculated to reach the people. We don't even \nrequire that it reach the people.\n  My colleague just said this is going to open up a whole lot of \nlitigation.\n  I ask my colleague, has he asked companies? Does he know of a company \nthat isn't trying to identify their Y2K failure? Does he know of a \ncompany that, having done that, would not tell the people to whom they \nsold it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, my response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts is that these companies and corporations that are in \nfavor of this legislation--did the Senator from Massachusetts forget \nthat half of them could be plaintiffs? Why is it that so many of them \nwho could be plaintiffs are in support of this legislation? They are \nnot just the defendants, they are the plaintiffs.\n  The fact is that we are helping business all over America. I have to \ntell my friend from Massachusetts that I came here to help business all \nover America. I came here to help entrepreneurs. I came here to stop \nthe flood of litigation that has so distorted the business system in \nAmerica. I came here with a clear campaign to say, look, we have too \nmany frivolous lawsuits in America; we have too many class action \nsuits; we have too many lawyers and not enough business people.\n  I am unashamed and unembarrassed to tell the Senator from \nMassachusetts that I am here in behalf of defendants who, if I took a \npoll tomorrow, would number 90 percent. I don't know the percentage \nthat are lawyers, but I know it grows bigger by the day. But all of \nthose who are lawyers would say: Yes, please, Senator McCain, help \nbusiness get off this terrible burden where we are paying so much, \nwhere we have become a litigious society in America and so many \nterrible things have happened as a result.\n  As I pointed out, Mr. Tom Johnson--a man who is becoming famous here \non the floor of the Senate, I might add--is bringing these lawsuits \nagainst honest, hard-working people, especially small and medium-sized \nbusinesses.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts is astonished--and I include the \nSenator from Oregon in the category--at trying to help businesses, \nsmall, medium, and large, from the incredible burden of litigation \nwhich has flooded the United States of America--guilty as charged. \nGuilty as charged.\n  The second aspect of this issue is clearly what I, as a business \nowner, would tell people. It is that I, as a business owner who \ndistributes my product, would not be able to vouch for other people and \nother businesses that are also part of this distribution chain of my \nproduct.\n  That is again where I get back to the point that I do not know of any \nbusiness in America that doesn't want to fix the Y2K problem. I know \nlots of business people who don't know, because of the distribution \nsystem--both through distributors and retailers--that they can vouch \nfor those persons' willingness or ability to fix the Y2K problem, which \nthen opens up that flood.\n  I hope I answered the Senator's question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I hate to say this. I say it again with \naffection and respect. But the Senator didn't actually completely \nanswer the question, because he didn't tell me of any company in the \ncountry that wouldn't do what I have said or that hasn't done what I \nhave said.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My answer is, I know of no company or corporation in \nAmerica that would not want to have the problem fixed.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is precisely the point. The Senator has just \nacknowledged precisely the point I am making. I come back to it.\n  I am not serving on the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee \nand the Small Business Committee because I don't care about business. I \nhave the same desires as the Senator from Arizona to see business \nsucceed. He came here for the same purpose--to create jobs and to make \nthe country better for all of our citizens.\n  But this bill is not going to make lives better for all of our \ncitizens in its current structure. Yes, it is wonderful for those \ncorporate entities to be singled out to get the benefits of it. I agree \nwith the Senator. Everything in the amendment I have offered does the \nexact same thing--to protect those companies, as his does, with one \nexception. We are fighting here over one big exception right now. This \nis the exception. The very thing the Senator from Arizona just \nacknowledged--he said yes, every company ought to want to find that, \nand I don't know of any company that isn't trying to.\n  That is the precise standard that we are trying to be sure companies \nembrace--to have a guarantee that we are doing the most to encourage \nmitigation, to fix the problem, inadvertently or otherwise.\n  The Senator's bill gives them automatic entry into the \nproportionality of damages, without the guarantee that they tried to \nmake that effort. Why is that important? It goes to the Senator's \nquestion to me. It is important because some companies may conceivably \nchoose the cheaper road, which is to not necessarily pay for the fix up \nfront but wait and see what the damage might be and not engage in the \nvery mitigation we have encouraged.\n\n  If that company is the midline company that the Senator just referred \nto, under his proposal they would automatically be subject to get the \nproportional level of their damage. But they could have weighed on an \neconomic basis whether the bottom line of that proportional damage was \nsuch that they would rather wait and see, or weigh that rather than fix \nthe problem and avoid whatever the consequences may be to consumers \ngenerally.\n  I don't think that is good public policy. Maybe we differ on that. I \nthink there is a fair way to provide all of these companies with the \nprotection that we want them to have, and we want them to have an \nappropriate level of protection.\n  But, again, my colleagues can't show me why it is unreasonable to \nsuggest that a company can't identify the potential for a Y2K failure. \nHow can you not do that? All you have to do is sit down with your \ndesign people, have a meeting, document the meeting, and ask a couple \nof questions: Do we have a Y2K problem? Do we have any invented \nprocessors? What products do we have them in? Whom did we sell them to? \nWhoops. Let's send a letter to those people and tell them.\n  Is that asking too much?\n  The purpose of this bill is to encourage people to fix the problem. \nIf you do not ask people to do that, how can you say you are really \nexhausting all of the possibilities of how you are going to fix the \nproblem? I don't understand that. I\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nsay to my colleagues that that is one thing we are fighting about.\n  The other thing is the question of dealing with damages. I know I \nhave said it before. Some people do not like dealing with damages. But \nthe standard you have to get over to have punitive damages apply--I \ndon't know of anyone in the high-tech industry, I can't imagine a \ncompany in the high-tech industry, that would be subject to that. Any \nCEO I have met has as much public conscience as anybody in the Senate \nand is engaged in a bona fide effort to make their company work. I \ndon't know anybody who is not.\n  But if there is some junk artist out there who is just hungry for the \nbottom line, trying to gamble on all of the Internet success and \neverything that has happened with high-tech stocks, who started out \nfly-by-night, who wanted to go out there and make a quick hit, if that \nperson did it, and willfully, wantonly, recklessly, outrageously \nimpacted the life of an American citizen, I want that American citizen \nto be able to have redress for that. I don't think it is right to deny \nthem that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could respond very quickly about one aspect of this, \nI have confessed with great pride and sometimes with pleasure that I am \nnot a member of the legal profession. But I am afraid the Senator from \nMassachusetts does not quite comprehend what we are dealing with here.\n  This is a book, ``Year 2000 Challenge, Legal Problems and \nSolutions,'' from the National Legal Center for the Public Interest. \nLet me quote for the Senator what we are facing so we can really put \nthis in the proper perspective.\n\n       The unfortunate fact is there is no ``silver bullet'' \n     solution to the year 2000 problem in any organization, and \n     the risks and difficulties in any Year 2000 project of even \n     moderate size and complexity can be enormous. None of the \n     remediation techniques described above is without \n     disadvantages, and for many IT users the time and resources \n     required to accomplish Year 2000 remediation far exceed what \n     is available. Most major remediation programs involve finding \n     and correcting date fields in millions of lines of poorly \n     documented or undocumented code. There is no single foolproof \n     method of finding date fields, no assurance that all date \n     fields will be found, corrected, or corrected accurately, and \n     no assurance that corrections will not produce unintended and \n     undesirable consequences elsewhere in the program. In many \n     cases it will be necessary to rely on information or \n     assurances from third party vendors regarding the Year 2000 \n     compliance of their products, even though experience teaches \n     that many such representations are inaccurate or \n     misleading. Comprehensive end-to-end system testing of \n     remediated systems in a simulated Year 2000 ``production'' \n     environment is often impractical or impossible, and less \n     intensive testing may fail to detect uncorrected problems. \n     And even where an IT user succeeded in making its own \n     systems Year 2000 ready. Year 2000 date handling problems \n     in external systems (such as the systems of customers or \n     suppliers) can have a devastating effect on internal \n     operations.\n\n  With all due respect to my friend from Massachusetts, this is what we \nare trying to get in our legislation and this is what the Senator's \namendment basically prevents us from doing.\n  Here is the problem. I don't claim to have the expertise that the \nSenator does on punitive damage or on joint and several liability. I \nknow the problem pretty well. We have had extensive hearings in the \nCommerce Committee, and we have talked to all the experts. This is \nreally what we are trying to take care of--not as the Senator from \nMassachusetts asked me, in good faith, do I believe there is any \ncompany or corporation that is not trying to fix a problem. I don't \nknow of any.\n  I think what I read to the Senator from Massachusetts explains how \ndifficult and enormously complex solving this problem is. This is why, \nalthough I respect and admire the Director of the FAA who will fly all \nday long on January 1, the year 2000, I intend to remain at home that \nday. However, I encourage others, as the Senator from Massachusetts, to \nfly around the country.\n  I say seriously to my friend from Massachusetts, I hope this explains \nto him the complexity of the problem. We not only can take care of the \nindividual manufacturer, but all the systems and subsystems that are \nconnected with it are not addressed, in my view, adequately, in the \nSenator's amendment.\n  Before I yield to both Senators, could we agree to some time on this \namendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to cooperate. I cannot agree at this \nparticular instant, because I need to canvas the cosponsors to figure \nout who desires to speak. We have no intention of prolonging this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Massachusetts and his staff will work \non that, I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me come back to the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona, because I appreciate everything he just read. I \nwould like to be associated with putting it into the Record. However, I \ndon't associate myself with the notion that the consequences of what he \njust read ought to be automatically given a bye, a pass, if you will, \nwithout some duty to make the determination of what he just read.\n  Any company that is going to be subject to what the Senator from \nArizona just read would answer the standard I have put forth about a \npotential for failure in the affirmative in 10 seconds. The Senator \nfrom Arizona has acknowledged that. We are almost fighting about a \ndifference that is not a huge distinction here, but it is significant \nenough because of what we want to do to achieve the mitigation we want \nto get out of this bill.\n  There isn't a company in good standing in this country that cannot \nanswer affirmatively the two-step qualification for proportional \ndamages. To suggest that we will give every company an automatic bye \nwithout requiring them to do that is to actually adopt a bill that \ndoesn't go as far as it can to achieve the purpose that the Senator \nfrom Arizona states we are trying to achieve.\n\n  That is why there is a fundamental difference here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to respond to \nthe point the Senator from Massachusetts made with respect to the \nstandard that he would apply in identifying the potential for Y2K \nfailure.\n  I believe that using language that vague virtually ensures that a \nsignificant number of frivolous cases are going to end up going to \njuries--exactly what we fear. What will happen, companies will attempt \nto defend themselves, the judge will be offered a motion to dismiss, \nand the company will say: It is frivolous; we move to dismiss the case. \nThe judge will look, and if this were the standard that were actually \nadopted, he would say: I don't know whether they identified the \npotential for Y2K failure. And we would, in fact, be igniting an \nadditional round of frivolous lawsuits.\n  A motion to dismiss under this standard will get by because it is so \nvague.\n  With respect to the economic losses the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas talked about and believes are inadequately addressed under our \nbipartisan legislation, in this bill we keep State contract and tort \nlaw in effect. We keep State contract and tort law in effect. The \nproblem is that there are some who disagree, some who would essentially \nlike to create torts out of these contractual rights where no torts \nexist.\n  Finally, with respect to punitive damages, the Senator from \nMassachusetts said again that our bipartisan bill would hollow out, for \nexample, protections that are needed for consumers. We ensure our \nstandard of evidence with respect to this is in line with State \nrequirements. Again, we are trying to take a balanced approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose the Kerry amendment. I think it \nensures we will see a significant number of frivolous suits not being \ndismissed where they ought to be but essentially ending up going to \njuries and causing great economic duress early in the next century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the purpose of proposing some \namendments, I ask that the pending Kerry amendment be set aside for \nthat purpose, with the proviso of returning immediately to the Kerry \namendment.\n  I send to the desk two amendments by Senator Murkowski, an amendment \nby Senator Gregg, an amendment by Senator Inhofe, and two amendments by \nSenator Sessions, and I ask for them to be numbered.\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nnumbered and laid aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent we return to the \npending Kerry amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One of the irate staff just came over here. I saw no harm \nassociated with that process. If there were an objection, I would be \nglad to remove those amendments. They were simply amendments to be \nnumbered in case when we get an agreement on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw those amendments, and we will \nleave everything as it was before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regarding the Kerry amendment, I want to mention that a \ncompany that has made no effort to prevent failure or fix its systems \nwill undoubtedly be found more responsible for a plaintiff's injuries \nunder the terms of S. 96 in liability already proposed, without the \nhazard of making a company that can't control the entire chain of \ndistribution liable for the entire damage awarded the plaintiff. Our \nopposition to the pending Kerry amendment is almost that simple.\n  I note that the Senator from California is waiting to speak. I hope \nby the time the Senator is finished, perhaps we could have some \nagreement for a vote on this amendment so we could move forward, as \nwell as agreement on the other side for resolving the remaining 12 \namendments on both sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying \nMcCain-Dodd-Wyden-Lieberman-Feinstein bill, because I believe this bill \nis a once in a millennium, 3-year law. Without it, I believe we could \nsee the destruction or dismemberment of America's cutting-edge lead in \ntechnology. We all know that the year 2000 is rapidly approaching and \nwith it there comes a wide variety of possible disruptions relating to \nthe so-called Y2K problem.\n  It is true, though, that no one really knows how big the problem will \nbe or how small it will be, so government organizations, businesses \nlarge and small, and private individuals are all scrutinizing the area \nfrom their own particular perspective. The area that has received the \nmost attention is concern over a possible flood of lawsuits that could \nclog courts and distract businesses from solving these problems early \nin the next millennium. Several well-known consultants and firms, \nincluding the Gartner Group, have established that Y2K litigation could \nquickly reach as high as $1 trillion. So concerned Members of Congress, \nincluding Senators McCain, Hatch, Dodd, and others, have been working \nfor many months in an attempt to craft a solution to what has recently \nbeen described as this trillion-dollar headache.\n  The genesis of the bill now pending on the floor was a request by \nliterally dozens of companies and more than 80 industry groups--\nincluding the Semiconductor Industry Association, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, the Information \nTechnology Association--to develop legislation to prevent frivolous and \nbaseless lawsuits that could jeopardize companies moving to quickly \nsolve Y2K problems. The trick was not at the same time to prevent the \nsuit with merit.\n  I began working on a similar bill with Senator Hatch almost 6 months \nago, because I became convinced that the Congress did need to intervene \nin order to ensure that Y2K problems are quickly and efficiently \nsolved. Now, after several months of negotiating and a combined effort \namong a number of different Senators, I believe we have reached a fair \ncompromise. This bill is especially important to California where over \n20 percent of the Nation's high-tech jobs are located. The problem \nactually extends even beyond high-tech companies to the lives of \nemployees, stockholders, and customers in a wide range of American \nbusinesses.\n  One of the first indications I had of the depth of the concern was \nwhen groups of consultants began to come to us saying they refused to \nbecome involved in helping companies solve Y2K problems for fear that \nthey would open themselves up to being sued later on. Instead, they \nwould rather just not get involved. One such group was the American \nAssociation of Computer Consulting Businesses that represent 400 \ncompanies and more than 15,000 consultants. They told me personally \nthat they were going to refuse to enter into any Y2K consulting \ncontract until they had some kind of additional protection. So it \nbecame very clear to me that, indeed, we do have a real problem. I \nbelieve the underlying bill crafts a real solution.\n  I think it is important to say, and say again and again, that nothing \nin this bill is permanent. It is simply a 3-year bill, limited to \nspecific cases. The bill applies only to Y2K failures and only to those \nfailures that occur before January 1, 2003. Let me quickly go over the \nprovisions as I see them.\n\n  The 90-day cooling off period during which time no suit may be filed \nenables businesses to concentrate on solving Y2K problems rather than \non fending off lawsuits.\n  The bill provides for proportionate liability in many cases, so that \ndefendants are punished according to their fault and not according to \ntheir deep pockets. I am not an attorney and I have always felt this \nwas the most fair way to go, except in certain situations, and the bill \ndoes provide for those certain situations. I would like to go into this \nin greater detail.\n  The bill also encourages parties to request and use alternative \ndispute resolution at any time during this 90-day cooling off period. \nFor Y2K class actions, the bill requires, in order to qualify, that a \nmajority of plaintiffs must have suffered some minimal injury. That \nwould avoid cases in which thousands of unknowing plaintiffs are lumped \ntogether in an attempt to force a quick settlement.\n  For small businesses, the bill limits punitive damages to $250,000, \nor three times compensatory damages, so as to deter frivolous suits. It \nprevents the ``tortification'' of contracts with several provisions \nthat require businesses to live up to their agreements rather than \nturning to the courts in the hopes of avoiding their responsibilities.\n  These are not the only provisions in the legislation, but these \nprovisions represent the basic premise of a bill that does not seek to \nprevent the truly injured from recovering damages, but will hopefully \nprevent the frivolous lawsuit and keep companies from solving problems \nwithout delay.\n  There is much that is not in this bill, and there have been many \nchanges made in the bill, certainly since I became involved in it. I \nwould like to just indicate a few of them.\n  All caps on attorney's fees have been removed. Punitive damage caps \nfor large businesses have been eliminated. Punitive damage caps for \nsmall businesses have been increased from three times actual damages to \nthree times compensatory damages. All government regulatory or \nenforcement actions have been exempted from the bill, and three \nexceptions to the elimination of joint and several liability are \nprovided in order to protect smaller plaintiffs and those who cannot \nrecover from every defendant. The caps on liability for officers and \ndirectors have been removed, and the bill has been changed to provide \nthat per suit there is only one 90-day cooling off period.\n  I think the cooling off period is probably very well known and \nprobably very well accepted, so let me dispense with any further \nexplanation on that point. But let's go to one of the more \ncontroversial parts, proportionate liability.\n  One of the reasons this bill is important to the affected companies \nis that it prevents plaintiffs from forcing quick settlements from \ninnocent defendants who should be trying to solve Y2K problems. \nAdditionally, under the system of joint and several liability, a \ndefendant found to be only 20, 10, or even 1 percent at fault can \nnonetheless be forced to pay 100 percent of the damages. This system, \nas we all know, encourages plaintiffs to go after deep-pocket \ndefendants first in order to force that quick settlement. It is my \nbasic belief that this is fundamentally unfair, and the bill eliminates \njoint and several liability in some Y2K cases.\n  Under the new system, for this brief 3-year period, defendants will \nbe responsible only for that portion of damage that can be attributed \nto them. The bill does have, as I have said, three specific exceptions \nto the elimination of joint and several liability, and those\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nwere taken from the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act recently \npassed overwhelmingly by the Congress and signed into the law by the \nPresident.\n  First, any plaintiff worth less than $200,000 and suffering harm of \nmore than 10 percent of that net worth may recover against all \ndefendants jointly and severally. This exception in the bill protects \nthose plaintiffs with a low net worth but will not unduly injure \ndefendants, because the damages recovered will not be that great.\n  Second, any defendant who acts with an intent to injure or defraud a \nplaintiff loses the protections under this bill and is again subject to \njoint and several liability. The bill does not protect those acting \nwith an intent to harm.\n  Finally, the bill provides a compromise for those cases in which \ndefendants are judgment-proof. In cases where a plaintiff cannot \nrecover from certain defendants, the other defendants in the case are \neach liable for an additional portion of the damages. However, in no \ncase can a defendant be forced to pay more than 150 percent of its \nlevel of fault.\n  These proportionate liability provisions offer a more fair and, I \ntruly believe, rational approach to the system of damages in Y2K cases. \nWithout this more balanced system, a few large companies will soon be \nforced to bear the entire brunt of Y2K litigation regardless of fault, \nand that is the problem. That is what will destroy the cutting edge of \nAmerican prominence in this area, and that will result in jobs being \nlost.\n  Under the system of proportionate liability, this bill holds \ndefendants responsible for the extent of their fault and no more, with \nthe exceptions I have just mentioned.\n  Another area that I think deserves a little bit of clarification is \nthe class action area. Under the class action section of this bill, a \nyear 2000 class action suit cannot proceed unless the defect upon which \nthe action is based is material to a majority of class members. This \nsection is very important. Essentially, this clause prevents the type \nof ``strike suits'' we saw in the securities litigation area.\n  In the Y2K context, this provision will stop overly aggressive \nplaintiffs from searching out small defects in computer programs, \ngathering together thousands of software users who do not even know \nthey have been injured, and trying to force a quick settlement out of \nthe software manufacturer.\n  Once this bill passes, if a class action suit alleges that software \ndoes not function properly, the action can proceed only if the alleged \ndefect affects a majority of the class members in some significant way. \nTrivial defects that would not even be noticed by most class members \nwould not be cause for a class action. Again, plaintiffs with good \ncause may still proceed, but frivolous suits would be stopped. That is \nthe purpose of the provision and the purpose of the bill.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in this Chamber about punitive \ndamage caps. The Dodd-McCain compromise caps punitive damages, for \nsmall businesses only, at the lesser of $250,000 or three times \ncompensatory damages.\n  The idea of capping punitive damages is one of the most controversial \nissues in this or any other bill dealing with changes to our system of \ncivil justice. In this case, I believe reasonable and carefully drafted \ncaps on punitive damages can deter frivolous suits. Additionally, \ncapping punitive damages reduces the incentive to settle meritless \nsuits because companies will not be at risk for huge, unwarranted \nverdicts.\n  I recognize that this is a controversial issue and that intelligent, \nwell-meaning people may disagree over whether this is the time or the \nplace to address punitive damages. But I have continually emphasized \nthat this bill is not about punitive damages, and the compromise \ndramatically limits the punitive damage caps compared to earlier \nversions.\n\n  In summary, this $1 trillion litigation headache is approaching. This \nCongress can provide thoughtful, preventive medicine and some \nanticipatory pain relief in the form of reasoned, fair, and thoughtful \ncompromise. I think the bill sets forward clear rules to be followed in \nall Y2K cases. I believe it levels the playing field for all parties \nwho will be involved in these suits. Companies and individuals alike \nwill know the rules and will know what they have to do. Most important, \nthere is an element of stability that can come from this bill which \nwill allow companies to prevent Y2K problems when possible, fix Y2K \ndefects when necessary, and proceed to remediate damages in an orderly \nand fair manner.\n  It is true that some plaintiffs may have to wait a little bit longer \nto file a suit for damages, but their rights will not be curtailed and \nrecovery will not be prevented. In fact, the waiting period in the bill \nwill make it far more likely that problems will be solved quickly, \nallowing potential plaintiffs to get on with the activities that were \ndisrupted by the Y2K problem at issue.\n  This bill has been through a tortuous legislative drafting process \nwith criticisms, suggestions, and changes made from every side and by \nevery sector of our society. I hope we can pass this bill and send it \nto the President, and let us show the Nation that the Y2K crisis will \nnot cripple our courts, will not disrupt our economy, and will not slow \nour progress toward a 21st century world.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts for offering his amendment, which allows us now to have a \nfull debate on what is a comprehensive amendment. It covers a whole \nseries of provisions which are included in the pending bill before the \nSenate.\n  Let me try, if I can, to take each of the critical provisions in the \namendment, address them, and explain why I believe, despite the good \nintentions of its author, it would do significant damage to the \nunderlying purpose of the bill that Senator McCain and Senator Wyden \nand myself and others have offered to the Senate for its consideration.\n  I said at the outset of my remarks earlier today that this bill is \nvery narrow in scope, very narrow in duration, and limited to a fact \nsituation which most Americans, I think, have a growing awareness of \ntoday.\n  In 204 days the millennium clock will turn, and there is a very \nserious set of issues that could affect many Americans and many people \noutside of our shores: that is the so-called Y2K glitch or bug in \ncomputers based on information that is included in embedded chips and \nother items within these computers which would read the date of the \nyear 2000 incorrectly.\n  I am, of course, simplifying the situation. I think the Senate is \nwell are aware of the danger inherent in the Y2K problem. That problem \ncould, of course, create serious disruptions in a variety of mission-\ncritical functions in telecommunications, transportation, medical care, \nFederal services, and the like.\n  Over the last year and a half the Senator from Utah and I, as \nchairman and vice chairman of the Y2K Special Committee, have conducted \nsome 21 hearings to examine where we were with the Y2K problem, what \nthe Federal Government was doing, what State governments were doing, \nwhat local municipal governments were doing, and what the private \nsector and nonprofits were doing in order to remediate the problem; to \nfix the problem as soon as possible; and, where that may not be \npossible, to have contingency planning to avoid the kind of potential \ndisruptions that those who are most knowledgeable about this issue \nsuggest could occur.\n  Over that period of time we have seen significant improvement in the \nremediation done by the private and public sector, State and local \ngovernments, all across this country. In fact, we are at the point \nwhere we believe, as of this date, in June, with some 204 days to go, \nthe country is by and large in good shape. We should not anticipate or \nbe worried about any major disruptions here in the United States. There \ncould be exceptions to that but, by and large, we think that is the \nsituation today.\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\n  One of the things we are trying to do is see to it that when January \n1 arrives, the best effort of a business--small, medium, or large--does \nnot go for naught as a result of its inability to detect problems with \nembedded chips that ultimately result in Y2K-related failures.\n  Last year we passed a bill on disclosure to encourage the various \nsectors of our society to share as much information as possible with \neach other so that we could contribute to the remediation effort and \navoid the kinds of problems some are anticipating will occur after \nJanuary 1. That bill created a safe harbor provision, which allowed for \nthe sharing of information--not sharing of lies and knowingly false \ninformation, but sharing as much knowledgeable information that \nbusinesses had--without worrying that someone would come around later \nand say, ``what you said in June of the year 1999 was not exactly \nright,'' and, therefore, you would be subject to litigation.\n  That bill was passed overwhelmingly by this body and the other body \nand signed into law. It is making, we think, a significant contribution \nto avoiding the kinds of problems that we could have had after January \n1 of the year 2000. But it does not eliminate all the problems. In \nfact, no one can pass a piece of legislation that will eliminate all \nthe difficulties.\n\n  We realize with those problems that may emerge that you could have \ndisruptions as a result of the failure to detect such things as faulty \nembedded chips. So this legislation before us is designed to be a \ncomplementary piece of legislation to the disclosure act of last year, \na complementary piece of legislation to the efforts of Senator Bennett, \nmyself, and others who have worked on that committee, who strived to \nencourage, jawbone, do whatever we could, to minimize the kind of \ndifficulties Americans could face.\n  We do not claim we have achieved all of that yet. But with the \nadoption of this bill, a 3-year bill, a 36-month bill, we say to \npotential plaintiffs and defendants: If, in fact, a problem arises that \nunder any other circumstances might give rise to a lawsuit, we want you \nto try to avoid that lawsuit, if you can. We want you to try to work \nout the problem. We want you to spend your time, your money, and your \nefforts to fix the Y2K problem, not to run to the nearest courthouse \nand then spend weeks and months, potentially years, at the cost of \nmillions of dollars, litigating an issue and not solving the underlying \nproblem which is causing the kind of disruptions this issue can \npotentially cause.\n  That is the purpose of this bill. That is the rationale behind it: to \ntry to avoid rushing to the courthouse.\n  We are a litigious society. We love lawsuits. Most Americans are \npainfully aware of this. There is nothing wrong with going to court to \ntry to solve your problems. But I think most would agree that if you \ncan avoid going to the courtroom to solve your problems, you can get \nbetter results in many instances.\n  So this legislation is designed specifically to avoid rushing to the \ncourthouse for 36 months--not for a lifetime, not for eternity, but for \n36 months--during the critical period where this issue is upon us, to \nsee if we can't work out these difficulties. We only do that for 36 \nmonths with issues directly related to the Y2K issue, not any matter \nthat comes up, but specifically the Y2K issue. We do so in a very \nlimited way.\n  Specifically, we do not prohibit lawsuits. We merely are trying to \nsee if we cannot come up with an alternative vehicle to solve the \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, what Senator Kerry of Massachusetts has done is \noffered a series of ideas that he and those who have joined him believe \nwill enhance the underlying legislation. They state --and I believe \nthem--that they are desirous of making this a better bill, of making it \nless likely that we are going to have a race to the courthouse.\n  As you analyze what they have proposed, despite their good intentions \nit would appear they are doing just the opposite of their intentions. I \ncan accept, although I do not entirely understand, those who are just \nfundamentally opposed to what we are trying to do, and then offering a \nseries of provisions which would gut our very underlying intent. I do \nnot support it. I vehemently oppose it. But I can't understand how a \nrationale could be made for you to oppose the idea of trying to avoid \nlitigation for 36 months, if you can, on this Y2K issue.\n  Let me take, if I can, some of the provisions included specifically \nin the Kerry proposal and explain why I think those provisions directly \nundercut the underlying intent of the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal.\n  One deals with the bill's proportionate liability provisions. As I \nread the legislation, the Kerry bill, on page 13 of this proposal, \nstates that notwithstanding the proportionate liability sections, the \nliability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several if the \ndefendant fails to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that \nprior to December 31, 1999, the defendant identified the potential for \nY2K failure, and then, in paragraph two, provided information \ncalculated to reach persons likely to experience Y2K failures. Consider \nwhat those two provisions would do. Those are findings of fact, not \nfindings of law. So even if a defendant has made some effort to \nidentify potential Y2K failures, and made efforts to provide \ninformation calculated to reach the likely persons, you know very well \nthat those are questions of fact, not of law. I would be hard pressed \nto identify a judge that was not going to say that questions of fact go \nto a jury.\n\n  As a result, there will be litigation on the very issue upon which my \ncolleague from Massachusetts is trying to avoid litigation. Again, I \ncan understand why some may disagree with the proportional liability \nprovisions of the bill. They do not like the idea of having \nproportional liability. But I think it is only fair and just, under \nthese fact situations. Otherwise what you get, very clearly, is \nattorneys who will go shop around for some company that is \ninfinitesimally involved but simultaneously has deep pockets, and that \nbecomes your defendant. They will then try to get that fractionally \ninvolved defendant as becoming totally responsible and culpable for the \nY2K failure.\n  That is directly contrary to what we are trying to do here in this \nbill, directly contrary to what we are trying to do with the 90-day \ncooling off period, directly contrary to our saying that you have to go \nafter the people responsible for the injury. By suggesting here that if \nthey would just identify the potential Y2K problems and provide \ninformation to reach the persons likely to experience these failures, \nit seems to me that you have undercut entirely the desired goal in the \nunderlying bill by avoiding the proportional liability provisions of \nthe legislation. It is these provisions that we think will do a great \ndeal to minimize the rush to the courthouse.\n  These matters just do not end up in court miraculously. It takes an \nenergetic and aggressive bar that wants to pursue them. That would be \nthe case, in my view, if this amendment were adopted.\n  Again, these are findings of fact, not of law. No judge that I know \nof would dismiss a case where there are findings of fact to be \ndetermined. Those should go to a jury. Therefore, your motion to \ndismiss fails. Therefore, you are in court. Therefore, you have \ndestroyed what we are trying to accomplish with this 36-month bill, \njust to deal with a Y2K issue, where the issue ought to be to try to \nresolve the problems the American public faces.\n  As a practical matter, we have 204 days left before the millennium \nclock turns. If you adopt these provisions here over the next 204 days, \ninstead of remediating the problem, setting up your contingency \nplanning, which is what you ought to be doing at this point, we will \nhave people running around here trying to figure out ways to meet some \nstandard here so they can avoid the joint and several liability \nprovisions.\n  I can see them suggesting that we ought to be spending resources here \nto identify potential Y2K failures and provide information to persons \nlikely to be subjected to those failures. With 204 days to go--if my \ncolleague from Utah were here, I think he would echo these comments--we \nneed everyone in this country involved in this issue spending every \navailable moment of time and every bit of resources fixing these \nproblems instead of trying to avoid the kind of legal hurdles placed in \nthe way that the Kerry amendment would require, if his amendment were \nto be adopted.\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\n  An excellent point that should be made is that this proportional \nliability section would also encourage results where U.S. companies \ncould end up paying for the wrongs of foreign companies, non-U.S. \ncompanies. It has been stated over and over again, and I can tell you \nthat it is true based on our information, that Y2K remediation efforts \nabroad are lagging. If a U.S. plaintiff can't recover against a non-\nU.S. company, he is going to try to recover against the closest deep \npocket in this country. So you end up having U.S. companies that have \nmade a significant remediation effort having to bear all the burden \nbecause a foreign manufacturer has not done the job as well. The \nplaintiff has a hard time reaching that potential defendant, so he \nraces to the most fractionally involved U.S. company in order to get \ntheir full compensation. That is just not fair.\n  The amendment's contracts preservation section does not preserve \ncontracts. Although it is essential that Y2K contract rights be fully \nenforceable, the bill's formulation allows contractual provisions to be \nset aside, even by vague State common law rules. This approach would \ngive State court judges the power to throw out contract provisions they \ndon't like.\n  One thing that has been sacrosanct is, when there is a contractual \nrelationship, that is what prevails. If the parties enter into a \ncontract, then the contract rules. If you are going to allow, as you \nwould if the Kerry amendment is adopted, State court judges to undo \ncontracts, because you don't like contract law but you want tort law, \nthen you are expanding an area of the law that we have never done. \nWhere there is a contract in place, the contract rules. If you are \ngoing to allow State courts to undo that and then allow attorneys to \nshop around the country until they find a State jurisdiction where they \nhave avoided these contracts, you have just gutted this bill.\n  If you want to gut the bill, gut the bill. If you want to destroy \nthis effort, destroy the effort. But do not stand up simultaneously and \ntell me you are trying to enhance what we are trying to do and then \nallow State courts to gut contract law in this country.\n  The Kerry amendment also makes liability for economic losses more \nexpansive than current law. Under current law in most jurisdictions, \nplaintiffs who are in a contractual relationship with the defendant \ncannot circumvent the contract by trying out the tort idea.\n  I understand lawyers want to do this. We don't like the contract my \nclient entered into, so let's try going to the tort idea here. Not \nterribly clever, not terribly unique, pretty commonplace. But we are \nnot going to all of a sudden say that contracts are no longer valid \nhere.\n  In essence, if you adopt this amendment, at least this part of it, \nthat is what you are doing. If there is a good contract, then the \ncontract rules. The idea you can circumvent that contract by seeking to \nbring a tort suit to recover your economic losses permits all \nintentional torts to go forward, whether or not the parties have a \npreexisting relationship. Whatever else you may like about this \namendment, that provision alone ought to cause it to be overwhelmingly \ndefeated.\n  The amendment's carveout for noncommercial suits, in my view, will \npermit a huge range of abusive actions. The Kerry proposal carves out \nsuits by individuals from most of the provisions of this bill. I \nbelieve that abusive class actions on behalf of consumers are one of \nthe greatest dangers in the Y2K area, because such suits are easily \ncreated and controlled by plaintiffs' lawyers. That also was the case \nin the securities area prior to the enactment of the securities \nlegislation, a bill that we adopted several years ago.\n  Again, in this area, the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill does protect class \naction lawsuits. They are not done away with here. We simply try to \ntighten up the rules under which class actions can be brought, and I \nthink wisely so. We don't want to be going back and saying basically \nthat in these areas you can file vague complaints where no one can \ndetermine what the charges are against you. Remember, in this area of \nY2K--unlike securities litigation where clearly the defendants are \ngoing to be securities firms and the like--a small business can be a \nplaintiff and a defendant very quickly. It is not going to be as clear \nas to who the consumers are here.\n  Is one going to suggest to me that a small business where there is a \ncomputer glitch that all of a sudden gets sued is a nonconsumer, in a \nsense? I think we are trying to draw lines here that don't apply in the \narea of law that we have crafted with the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill.\n  So by suggesting that all the other provisions of law are OK here is \nto basically just say this bill has been defeated. If that amendment is \noffered as a single freestanding amendment, we may as well not take the \ntime of the Senate to go further. I will recommend that you pull the \nbill down because, frankly, then you have said this proposal here has \nno merit.\n  So I am not suggesting these are all the provisions of the Kerry \namendment, but they are the ones I think are most egregious and which I \nthink would do the most damage to the underlying effort that the \nSenators from Oregon and Arizona, and others, have tried to craft here.\n  Again, this is a bill for 36 months, that is it. We have 204 days \nleft to do something to minimize a serious problem. I hope we have no \nproblems come January 1 and February, and that all of the talk about a \nserious Y2K problem turns out to be wrong. Then we can look back and \nsay maybe we didn't need this bill. But I would rather be standing here \nand have that happen than to be sitting around in January and all of a \nsudden watch serious problems occur, people racing to courtrooms all \nover the country because this body didn't think 36 months set aside in \nthis area was a worthy exercise to defend against a potential problem \nthat could cause Americans a lot of difficulty.\n  For once, this body, the Congress, is taking action in anticipation \nof a problem. What we normally do is wait for the problems to happen \nand then scurry around trying to fix them. Here in June we are trying \nto do something to avoid potential catastrophes in January. I commend \nmy colleagues again--those who have been involved in this--for having \nthe wisdom to step up and try to take meaningful action here.\n  Do we have a perfect bill? No, I can't tell you that. We realize we \nare sailing in uncharted waters here. But we think we are on the right \nside of this and our footing is strong--36 months, narrow in scope and \ntime--to try to avoid the millions, if not billions, of dollars that \nultimately taxpayers and consumers may end up paying for a lot of \nworthless lawsuits to satisfy the appetites of a few narrow members of \nthe bar. I think it is a risk worth taking. I think in the long run the \nAmerican public will support our efforts. With all due respect to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, for whom I have a great deal of \nadmiration, we fundamentally disagree. Were his proposal to be adopted, \nI believe it would do significant, if not irreparable, damage to the \nMcCain-Wyden-Dodd approach we have drafted and submitted for our \ncolleagues' consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments on this side be in order and these amendments only:\n  Senator Murkowski, two amendments; Senator Inhofe, one amendment; \nSenator Gregg, one amendment; Senator Lott, one amendment; Senator \nSessions, two amendments.\n  Although it may be redundant, I add to that the amendments that were \nalready agreed to in yesterday's Congressional Record: Senator \nHollings, three amendments; Senator Kerry, one amendment; Senator \nBoxer, one amendment; Senator Feinstein, one amendment; Senator \nFeingold, one amendment; Senator Graham of Florida, one amendment; \nSenator Leahy, one amendment; Senator Dodd, one amendment; Senator \nEdwards, two amendments; Senator Daschle, one amendment.\n  Would it be agreeable to Senator Hollings if that is included in the \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. I thank the distinguished Senator. The Feinstein \nand Dodd amendments are now cared for. As listed in the calendar for \ntoday, it is correct. We agree.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that those amendments be the\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\nonly ones in order in consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, has switched with \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment under Senator Graham will now be listed \nunder Senator Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also want to mention that I think the \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to discuss this amendment again. We \nare prepared to enter into a time agreement with the Senator from \nMassachusetts when he returns to the floor for his further discussion \nof the amendment. Perhaps we can enter into an agreement at that time. \nI will also be contacting Members whose amendments are still listed as \nrelevant to reach time agreements with them so that perhaps by the \nclose of business this evening we could have time agreements allocated, \nif possible. If not, we will just proceed with the amending process \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Y2K \nAct. I commend Senator McCain for the leadership he has provided the \nSenate on an issue that is of critical importance to small businesses \nacross this country. I do not know if we have highlighted enough the \ncost of the Y2K problem on small business. That is what I would like to \nbriefly address. I also thank the Chamber of Commerce for the effort \nthey have made to bring this problem to the attention of the Congress \nand to the public.\n  I support protecting businesses from unnecessary and frivolous \nlitigation that will arise from the Y2K problem. While businesses are \nhard at work trying to fix potential problems arising from the Year \n2000, others are trying to exploit it through excessive and expensive \nlitigation. It has been reported in that the cost of litigation in the \nU.S. arising from this problem will range from $200 billion to $1 \ntrillion. It is just incredible. The Senate Commerce Committee has \nreported that up to 48 lawsuits relating to the Y2K problem have \nalready been filed. What has been described as a ``tremendous new \nbusiness opportunity'' for lawyers is done at the expense of the \nprivate business sector, in particularly small businesses. Small \nbusinesses are most at risk from Y2K failures because many have not \nbegun to realize the potential problem and they do not have the capital \nto remedy any Y2K difficulties.\n  This bill goes a long way toward preventing litigation from the Y2K \nproblem by establishing punitive damage caps, alternative dispute \nresolution, and proportional liability. While this bill will limit the \namount of frivolous litigation, it will not prevent those who are \nblatantly negligible in becoming Y2K compliant or have caused personal \ninjuries as a result of their noncompliance from escaping their \nresponsibilities. They will still be held responsible.\n  Although I believe S. 96 will prevent and limit any litigation \narising from the Y2K problem, I am still concerned that the greatest \nbeneficiaries of the Year 2000 computer problem will be the trial \nlawyers. I am disheartened that there is no provision in this bill that \nplaces a reasonable cap on attorneys' fees. An attorney fees' cap will \nhelp prevent excessive litigation against small businesses by creating \na financial disincentive for trial lawyers. Unlike the big corporations \nwho have millions to spend on solving the Y2K problem and defending \nthemselves in any Y2K civil action, the small businesses do not have \nthe financial resources and are therefore the primary targets of any \npotential Y2K litigation. A reasonable and fair attorney fees' cap will \ndecrease the amount of excessive and frivolous litigation arising from \nthe Y2K problem. But without a reasonable cap, I am concerned that the \nY2K problem could become a boondoggle for the trial lawyers at the \nexpense of small businesses. However, in the interest of passing this \nlegislation, I will not be offering an attorney's fee amendment at this \ntime. I do hope that the Senate will be able to consider and debate \nthis issue in the future.\n  That having been said, I ask that the Senate move quickly to pass \nthis legislation and protect small businesses from potential Y2K \nlitigation.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as one of the original cosponsors of both \nS. 96 and the bipartisan amendment that now constitutes the base bill \nbefore the Senate, I am, of course, strongly in support of that \nproposal and opposed to the Kerry amendment, even including all of the \nchanges, almost all of which are constructive, that have been added to \nit during the course of its development.\n  But in reflecting on both my support of the base bill and my \nopposition to the Kerry amendment, I wish to reflect on the fact that \nmost, though not all, of the major actors in this bill have been \nMembers of the Senate for a decade or so. Each of them can remember \nthat it is a decade or less ago that one of the constant refrains on \nthe floor of the Senate--and for that matter, throughout our society--\nwas our deep concern about American competitiveness.\n  Volumes of the Congressional Record are filled with speeches about \nthe fact we were losing ground to many of our competitors, most \nparticularly the Japanese, because of their work ethic, because of \ntheir educational system, or for a half dozen other reasons. Probably \nthe last such speech was made on the floor of this Senate more than \nhalf a decade ago.\n  It is obvious that the United States, whatever its problems then, has \nhad a magnificent recovery and dominates the economic and technical \nworld by as great a margin as it ever has had during the course of the \n20th century.\n  While all kinds of American geniuses are responsible for this change, \nI think it is safe to say that the extraordinary, imaginative, \nentrepreneurial work of the men and women whose companies make up the \nYear 2000 Coalition supporting this legislation have the greatest \nresponsibility and deserve the greatest amount of credit for changes in \nthe nature of our economy and of our society and the way in which we \nlive, the way in which we communicate with one another and the way in \nwhich we preserve and enhance knowledge. These factors have changed as \nmuch in this last decade as in the previous century.\n  It is, therefore, the very people and the very companies that have \ndone more to enhance the quality of life in the United States and the \nquality of life around the world who have done more to break down \nbarriers between people and regions and nations. It is these people who \nseek the modest relief proposed in this bill, these people who are so \nresponsible for our economic success.\n  I have been handed a letter to the distinguished junior Senator from \nMassachusetts from the Year 2000 Coalition. I ask unanimous consent \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Year 2000 Coalition,\n\n                                                     June 8, 1999.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The Year 2000 Coalition, a broad-based \n     multi-industry business group, is committed to working with \n     the Senate to enact meaningful Y2K liability legislation. We \n     fully support S. 96 sponsored by Senators McCain and Wyden, \n     with amendments to be offered by Senator Dodd. This is also \n     supported by Senators Hatch, Bennett, Gorton, Feinstein and \n     others. S. 96 is the most reasonable approach to curtail \n     unwarranted and frivolous litigation that might occur as a \n     result of the century date change.\n       While we appreciate any effort that further demonstrates \n     the bipartisan recognition of the need for legislation, the \n     Coalition does not support the amendment to S. 96 that is \n     being circulated in your name. We urge you to support S. 96 \n     and to not introduce an amendment to it. Your vote in favor \n     of cloture is important to bring the bill to the floor and \n     allow the Senate to address the challenge of Y2K confronting \n     all Americans. A vote in favor of S. 96 is a vote in favor of \n     Y2K remediation, instead of litigation.\n       This letter was also sent to the following Senators: Robb, \n     Daschle, Reid, Breaux, and Akaka.\n           Sincerely,\n         Aerospace Industries Association, Airconditioning & \n           Refrigeration Institute, Alaska High-Tech Business \n           Council, Alliance of American

This letter was signed by companies or groups too \nnumerous for me either to name or to count. They explicitly state \nsupport of the Year 2000 Coalition for S. 96 in the form in which it \nfinds itself now, explicitly opposing the Kerry amendment to that bill.\n  Personally, I think that letter deserves great weight and our most \nsolemn consideration without regard to any of the details of the debate \non the differences between S. 96 with its bipartisan amendment and the \nKerry amendment. When one goes into the details of those differences, \nthe justification for this letter becomes even more apparent.\n  My long-time friend and distinguished rival in this matter, the \nSenator from South Carolina, and I have differed on a substantial \nnumber of legal concepts that go far beyond Y2K legislation. He knows, \nas does the distinguished occupant of the Chair, that my own personal \npreference--and I suspect the preference of the Year 2000 Coalition--\nwould be to abolish the concept of joint liability in its entirety. The \nconcept of joint liability is one pursuant to which a person, a group, \na defendant, only partially or even marginally responsible for a given \nlegal wrong, nonetheless can be held responsible for all of the damages \ncaused by all of the defendants against whom a judgment is entered.\n  On its surface and beneath its surface, such a concept is \nextraordinarily difficult to justify.\n  In the case of potential Y2K litigation, it is even more difficult to \njustify, as in any typical Y2K lawsuit there may well be dozens of \ndefendants--the manufacturers of all of the elements of what can be an \nextremely complicated software and hardware production, its \ndistributors, both wholesale and retail, and perhaps many others. The \nrisks to companies, whether sophisticated or unsophisticated in the \nnuances of the law, the panic created in them, the disruption of their \npriorities, both in the development of new technology and dealing with \npotential Y2K litigation, is impossible to overestimate.\n  At first, this bill, or any bill that has seriously been considered \nhere on subjects like this, abolishes in its entirety the concept of \njoint liability. Even though I prefer the original S. 96 to this \nproposal, it is a matter that has been worked out very carefully by a \ngroup of Republicans and Democrats--one of the most important of whom \nis the Senator from Connecticut who is present on the floor--to be a \nresult that has broad support not only in this Chamber but around the \ncountry as a whole.\n  Just as the Senator from Connecticut and many of his colleagues have \ncompromised on some elements they wish like to have in the bill, so \nhave we on our side, and we have with respect to joint liability. There \nare some very real limits on it and S. 96, as it appears before the \nSenate now, and there are a few in the Kerry substitute, but they are \nlargely illusionary.\n  A second field in which there are differences in this bill has to do \nwith punitive damages. How anyone even in this isolated Chamber could \ncome up with a proposition that software companies, members of this \nYear 2000 Coalition, are so indifferent to the problems of Y2K that \nsomehow or another they deserve to be punished--not in a criminal court \nbut by the potential loss of unlimited punitive damages--is difficult \nfor me to imagine. It is clear by the vehement opposition to limits on \npunitive damages that there are those in the legal profession who at \nleast hope for the bonanza of huge punitive damage awards, however \ndifficult it is to imagine the justification for such awards as we \ndebate this matter. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say they \nhope they can force settlements, even on the part of companies they \nbelieve have not been negligent at all, because of the threat, the mere \npossibility of a very large punitive damage award.\n\n  I represent one of the handful of States in the United States of \nAmerica that does not permit punitive damages in civil litigation, that \nbelieves that punishment should be a part of the criminal law and not \nthe civil law. I have not noticed, in a long career, that justice is \nunavailable to plaintiffs in the courts of the State of Washington on \nthat account. I believe we would have a more responsible legal system, \na more fair and more just legal system, if the concept of punitive \ndamages in civil litigation was abolished across the country. It is not \ngoing to be. It was not even in the product liability legislation of \nwhich I have been a sponsor in the past. It was not in the original \nform of this bill, and it is not in the form that appears before us \nnow.\n  But there are some distinct limitations on punitive damages for \nrelatively small companies, companies that could obviously be \nbankrupted by punitive damage awards--a bankruptcy that, I submit, in \nalmost every case\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nwould not benefit the economy or the people of the United States. Yet, \nfor all practical purposes, even those minor limitations are removed \nfrom this bill in the Kerry amendment.\n  Finally, the Kerry amendment allows for the single form of litigation \nthat may most disturb the members of the Year 2000 Coalition, class \nactions on the part of consumers, actions in which almost invariably \nthe plaintiffs are nominal plaintiffs, actions in which many of the \nplaintiffs often do not even know they are plaintiffs, actions that \nvery frequently have been far more on behalf of the lawyers who bring \nthem than on the nominal class of plaintiffs themselves. To allow such \nactions seems to me to be a serious mistake and seriously to undermine \nthe entire goal of Y2K relief.\n  In summary, I do not think S. 896, as modified, is a terribly strong \nbill. I think it provides a degree of appropriate relief to a \nfundamentally vital element of the American economy and the advancement \nof our own standard of living in a fashion which is important to that \nindustry and in a fashion that is beneficial to that industry. But I do \nnot think it goes far enough. Others think it goes too far. I do \nbelieve, however, we have now reached a conclusion that will be \nsupported by a significant majority of the Members of the Senate, \nmembers of both parties.\n  I can no longer say, with the changes that have been made in it, that \nthe Kerry amendment is useless, that it provides no relief at all. It \ndoes include in it some constructive elements, some which may be \nappropriate for consideration during a conference subcommittee meeting \nbetween the House and the Senate as we put this bill in final form. But \nin comparison with the base bill before us, it does not provide \nappropriate relief. It does not meet the minimum needs of the year 2000 \nCoalition. It does not meet the minimum needs of a standard of \nreasonable justice with respect to a single problem that will go away \nshortly after the beginning of the new millennium in a piece of \nlegislation that will not become a part of the permanent law of the \nUnited States, because it will not be needed.\n  So, I return to the remarks with which I began. The members of this \ncoalition, the signatories to this letter, have done an extraordinary \nservice, not only to themselves, not only to the American people and \nthe American economy, but to the entire world and to the task of \nbuilding bridges among people in the entire world. They have asked for \nhelp for a single specific problem that faces them and that faces us \nand will for a few short months and for a relatively short period of \ntime thereafter. They deserve that relief. They deserve it as promptly \nas we can possibly pass it. And they deserve it with our enthusiastic \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as a Senator from Virginia, with one of the \nmost vibrant high-tech communities anywhere in the country, I am \nacutely aware of the problems the Y2K bug presents. And I want a bill. \nI have worked with the high-tech community in Virginia, particularly \nNorthern Virginia, but throughout the State since my days as Lieutenant \nGovernor and as Governor.\n  During the time I was Governor, I created a task force on high \ntechnology and they came up with 44 recommendations, the most prominent \nof which was to create a Center for Innovative Technology, which, for \nthe benefit of our colleagues, is housed in that funny-shaped building \nvery close to Dulles International Airport. Colocated with it was the \nSoftware Productivity Consortium, because we wanted to be able to \nprovide a central point for consideration of all the issues and \nconcerns of the technology industry and a way to broker the release of \nthe scientific work on technology-related projects.\n  So, I come with a lengthy background of working with the high-\ntechnology community and a specific interest in getting legislation \nthat will address the Y2K problem.\n  The potential wave of litigation which could accompany the turn of \nthe century could, in fact, be crushing, and many businesses have \nindicated that the threat of litigation could keep them from devoting \nthe necessary resources to addressing their own Y2K problems. A \nreasonable bill, which would weed out frivolous lawsuits and encourage \nparties to remediate their Y2K disputes outside the courtroom, would be \nto everyone's benefit. But while there is general agreement that some \nsort of bill should pass, regrettably, we do not yet have consensus on \nexactly what language should be in this bill.\n  Passage of almost any legislation requires some elements of \ncompromise. We have seen that process ongoing. Indeed, I entered this \ndebate several weeks ago--actually, now months ago--to help find the \nnecessary consensus on this issue. Given the rapidly approaching new \nyear, as well as the dwindling number of legislative days left in the \nSenate, it is important for us to act on this legislation now. Further \ndelay will only make it more difficult to reach the consensus most of \nus are looking for.\n  With the tight timeline we are facing, I am concerned with the \ndirection the debate still seems to be taking. Notwithstanding my own \nmisgivings about certain provisions in S. 96, the administration \nstrongly objects to the bill in its current form, and the President has \npromised that if Congress sends S. 96 to the White House without \nsignificant modifications, he will veto it. Thus, we are presented with \na dilemma. If we want a bill that will solve a legitimate problem, we \nneed a bill that the President will sign or at the very least will not \nveto, or we need 67 hard votes in order to override a veto. Otherwise, \nwe are just playing with politics. I regret to say I am afraid that is \nwhere we are now. We do not at this point, on this language, have the \nnecessary 67 hard votes.\n  The President has promised to veto this bill if it comes to him in \nits current form. So we are going through an exercise to polarize and \npoliticize an issue instead of providing a solution to an issue.\n  I appreciate the very hard work that my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts has put in trying to find the necessary language that \nwould provide the relief that is legitimate and on which virtually \neveryone in the Chamber can agree and still get the President to sign.\n  If we continue to approach this legislation with a vehicle we know \nthe President has already promised to veto, we are not giving the \nindustry the relief they so critically need. All we are doing is \nscoring political and debating points, but we are not coming up with a \nsolution. We have that dilemma.\n  I am, therefore, a cosponsor of the legislation offered by my \ndistinguished friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, because the White \nHouse has indicated they will sign that particular legislation if these \nchanges are made. It has line-by-line changes to certain provisions, \nand they are relatively limited at this point.\n  I applaud the good will that has prevailed on both sides to this \npoint in reaching this particular position, but we are still not there. \nFor this reason, I hope that our colleagues will support the amendment \nthat has been drafted and negotiated by my distinguished partner from \nMassachusetts because, at that point, we will have a bill. It will not \nbe a perfect bill, but it also will not be a vetoed bill.\n  It is inconceivable to me, given the many demands that have come to \nthis Chamber from all of the interests that are involved, that we could \never come up with a perfect bill, but at least we will have protection \nfrom the kinds of lawsuits that the industry is most concerned about, \nand we will have it in time to make decisions to remediate some of the \nproblems they could otherwise deal with if they were free from the \nthreat of litigation in this particular area.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his patience in working \nout the amendment which is now before us, and I urge my colleagues to \npass this particular amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know my colleagues on the other side are \nanxious to know how we will proceed. Senator Daschle intends to speak, \nand I suspect that may be it on our side. I am sure our colleagues on \nthe other side will be thrilled to hear that, and we can move forward.\n  I want to say a couple of things about what has been said in the last \nhour of debate. Some of my colleagues have mentioned the ``vagueness'' \nof the standard that is being applied to ask whether or not a company \nought to determine if they have a potential for Y2K liability. First of \nall, there is no vagueness whatsoever in any company's capacity to \ndetermine on its own, through its technological knowledge, whether or \nnot it has a potential of liability, and that is because of the nature \nof the problem.\n  We are talking about inventing chips with time-sensitive \ndigitalization on ``00'' and its capacity for interpretation. People \ncan run through their programs and run through the demand list, so to \nspeak, on that program and pretty thoroughly test it to make the kind \nof determination about potentiality. Anybody who has sufficiently done \nthat is going to qualify automatically for proportionality.\n  To the degree that my colleagues complain and say, well, gee, they \nare coming in here with this standard that might have to go to jury--\nthe Senator from Connecticut is worried about a standard that goes to \nthe jury--turn to their bill, page 28, Section 9: Duty to Mitigate.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers. . . .\n\n  So there is an issue for the jury. There is an issue. They have no \nproblem putting the responsibility on the plaintiff. They have no \nproblem at all finding a vague standard, so to speak, using their \nterminology. I do not believe our standard is vague, but they have no \nproblem at all requiring the jury to determine the reasonableness of \nwhat the defendants have done. And the plaintiff is going to have to \nprove it.\n  So that is part of the imbalance of this bill. Every step of the way, \nthere is a shifting, a change in tort law, a requirement for a higher \nstandard that goes beyond the original purpose.\n  I have heard my colleagues say the purpose of this bill is to help \ntechnology companies that are an important part of the American \nmainstream, economic bloodline, if you will, for all of our country. I \nagree with that. I absolutely agree with that. I do not want frivolous \nlawsuits. I do not want lawyers lining up for some kind of constructed \nsettlement process that is based on a fiction.\n  But our bill does not provide for that. Our bill is very clear in the \nway in which it requires a period of cure, just as S. 96 does, a period \nof mitigation, just as S. 96 does. It requires the same underlying \nrelationship with contract law, with one exception--where you have an \nintentional, willful, reckless action by a company. No one for the \nother side has been able to answer the public policy question of why \nany entity that acts recklessly, with wanton, willful purpose, ought to \nbe exonerated from a standard that holds them accountable. I do not \nthink any American, average citizen, who is subjected to the \nconsequences of those kinds of actions would believe that is true.\n  Finally, on proportionality, the argument was just made by the \nSenator from Washington that you ought to have this proportionality \navailable to a company. I agree with him. But it ought to be available \nto a company that has at least made a de minimis effort, a de minimis \neffort to determine whether its own product might have the potential to \nhave a Y2K problem.\n  I think our colleagues are going to have a hard time explaining why a \ncompany should not have to at least show that it inventoried its own \nproducts to determine that. It would be irresponsible, in the context \nof a bill that is supposed to encourage mitigation and encourage remedy \nand cure, to suggest that companies should not be encouraged to go out \nand determine what they may have done wrong. It is just inconsistent.\n  So I believe our effort is a bona fide effort to do precisely what \nthe sponsors of S. 96 want to do. I believe it achieves it in a more \nfair and evenhanded way. I believe that, as a consequence of the White \nHouse agreement with our position, ultimately we are going to have to \nadjust.\n  I say to my friends in the high-technology industry, I hope they will \ncarefully read the language in our proposed amendment. If one of them \nwants to come to me and suggest language that is clearer, to suggest \nhow they could conform in a reasonable way that they are not afraid of, \nI will adopt that language.\n  If any one of them wants to show me a reasonable way to have a \nstandard here that makes them a good citizen or qualifies them as such, \nI am all for it. I have not yet found a CEO of a company who has been \nable to suggest to me anything except wanting to not be sued as a \nrationale for why, from a public policy perspective, we should change \nthe law of this country prospectively in an anticipatory fashion to \nchange a longstanding relationship. And I do not think that case will \nbe made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes, as we wait for the minority \nleader to address some of the concerns that have been raised by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, to describe why I and the Democratic leader \nof the Y2K efforts, Senator Dodd, believe that the Kerry amendment, \nthough certainly sincere, is really a glidepath, an invitation, to \nfrivolous lawsuits with respect to this Y2K matter.\n  I come today to say we know we are going to have problems early in \nthe next century. That has been documented on a bipartisan basis by the \nY2K committee. What we are concerned about is not compounding the \nproblem with frivolous lawsuits. Regrettably, the Kerry proposal is \ngoing to do just that.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut and I have tried to do is to talk \nfirst about the vagueness of the language in the Kerry proposal. This \nnotion that you would simply have to identify ``potential'' with \nrespect to the Y2K issue and Y2K problems is just going to be a \nlawyers' full employment program. What is going to happen is, you are \ngoing to have frivolous cases brought; you will very quickly have \ncompanies, particularly small business defendants, move to dismiss \nthose cases because they are patently frivolous.\n  Because the Kerry standard is so vague, a judge is going to have \nreally no alternative other than to send that to a jury. So I think \nthat provision, identifying ``potential,'' is a real lightning rod for \nfrivolous lawsuits. That would be our first concern.\n  The second, it seems to me, is that the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas, to a great extent, mixed together, commingled, the principles of \npunitive damages and proportionality. I would like to try to step back \nfor a minute and see if I can clarify that.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has spoken repeatedly, he has come to \nthe floor repeatedly, and said that under the bipartisan legislation, \nif defendants are engaged in reckless, irresponsible, wanton conduct, \nthere is going to be no remedy for the plaintiff in those situations.\n  The fact of the matter is, under proportionality--clearly laid out in \nour legislation--you are liable to the extent that you contributed to \nthe problem. That is true if you are a small business, if you are one \nof the Fortune 500 businesses--it is true no matter who you are. Under \nour language, with respect to proportionality, you are liable for what \nyou contribute. It is just that simple.\n  With respect to punitive damages, besides keeping in place the State \nevidentiary standards on punitive damages, what we in fact say is the \nonly\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\npeople we are really going to try to protect are those who are such a \nkey part of the technology engine for our country, and that is the \nNation's small businesses.\n  Finally, colleagues, I think there is some confusion with respect to \nthis issue of economic losses as well. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas said that in some way the bipartisan proposal we bring has narrowed \nthe availability of coverage for economic losses. We very specifically, \nin our legislation, make clear that existing State contract and tort \nlaw is kept in place.\n  What the dispute is all about is that the Senator from Massachusetts, \nand perhaps others, is in effect trying to tortify existing contract \nlaw. They would like to try to create some torts for 36 months in the \nY2K area where those torts do not exist today in existing law.\n\n  My reputation, my background is as a consumer advocate. That is what \nI was doing with the Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected to \nthe Congress, what I have tried to do for 18 years in both the House \nand the Senate. I feel very strongly about protecting consumers, and \nthere are areas where it is appropriate to create new torts. Certainly, \nI have created a few causes of action during my years of service in the \nCongress.\n  If I can just finish, then I will be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. I think it would be a mistake, given the \nextraordinary potential for economic calamity in the next century, to \nchange the law with respect to economic loss. We are neither broadening \nit nor narrowing it. We are keeping it in place. I know that those \nState laws with respect to economic loss do not do a lot of the things \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts thinks are important, but that is, \nin fact, what we do in our legislation.\n  I want to be clear, our legislation does nothing, absolutely nothing, \nto limit remedies that are available to plaintiffs when, in fact, they \nare victims of a personal injury or wrongful death. So if an \nindividual, early in January of the next century, is in an elevator, \nfor example, and the computer in the elevator breaks, and the \nindividual tragically falls to his or her death or suffers a grievous \nbodily injury, all existing tort law remedies apply in that kind of \ninstance.\n  The bill that is before the Senate now is a very different one than \nthe one that was voted on on a partisan basis by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. In fact, in the Senate Commerce Committee, I joined the \nSenator from Massachusetts in saying that it was wholly inadequate in \nterms of protecting the rights of consumers. I happen to think the bill \nthe House of Representatives passed is wholly inadequate.\n  The legislation that we have now is a balanced bill. The defendants \nhave strong obligations to cure defects. The plaintiffs have an \nobligation to mitigate damages. I think our failure to pass this bill, \nwhich has now included 10 major changes to favor consumers and \nplaintiffs since the time it left the Commerce Committee, our failure \nto pass this bill, I think, is a failure to meet our responsibilities \nas it relates to this technology engine that is driving so much of our \nNation's prosperity.\n  I think when we look at the potential for calamity early in the next \ncentury, I don't think there is any dispute that we are going to have a \nsignificant number of problems. The question is, does the Senate want \nto compound those problems by triggering a round of unnecessary and \nfrivolous litigation?\n  I hope we won't do that. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerry \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the comments of the Senator from Oregon now \nhave highlighted the sort of difference between what they say they do \nand the reality of what is done here.\n  I am not going to ask the reporter to read back the comments, but let \nme just quote the Senator. He can tell me if I have said differently. \nThe Senator just said on the floor of the Senate that the Kerry bill \nseeks to create new torts. Am I correct? Am I stating what the Senator \nsaid?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to \nengage him.\n  I am saying that our proposal protects State contract law with \nrespect to economic losses. It seems to me that the gentleman's \nproposal, in wanting to change existing State contract law, is clearly \nmoving us in a different area which legal experts have come to \ndescribe, pretty arcanely, as the notion of tortifying contract law \ndoctrine, yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my colleague, he has just confirmed what I \nsaid. He is insinuating that we are creating a new tort.\n  I want to make it very clear, what the Senator and Senator McCain and \nothers are doing is taking away the right of State law, with respect to \nexisting contract law, to be applied. They are saying that if a State \nallows a particular tort with respect to economic loss, they can't do \nit.\n  I will be very specific about it. My provision with respect to \neconomic loss does exactly what the provision of the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from Arizona does. We are both trying to hold on \nto contracts, to avoid contract limitations on liability, and not to \nhave people move into tort. Neither of us want contract law to become \ntort. So we both prevent that.\n  Here is the distinguishing feature. What we do that Senator McCain \nand company do not do is, we say the following: If the defendant \ncommitted an intentional tort, you are not going to void the contract \nlaw, except--and this is the only exception--where the tort involves \nmisrepresentation or fraud regarding the attributes or capabilities of \nthe product that is the basis of the underlying claim.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield on one point?\n  Mr. KERRY. In a moment I will yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Is that available under current law?\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to make this clear, Mr. President. Under the McCain \nbill, if a party is induced by fraud to enter into a contract, they \ncan't recover damages for that. So what if in a conversation they say \nto the salesperson of the company: Is your product Y2K compliant? And \nthe person says: Oh, absolutely, our product has been Y2K compliant. We \nare terrific, blah, blah, blah.\n  If they intentionally were to induce them into the contract on \nmisrepresentation and they lose business as a result of that, they are \nbeing denied the ability to sue for that by S. 96.\n  I think that is wrong. I don't know, again, what public policy \ninterest is served by suggesting that fraud and misrepresentation ought \nto be protected. Why should they be protected?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield for an answer to the question. Why should \nfraud or misrepresentation be protected?\n  Mr. WYDEN. We apply State contract law to these economic losses. What \nwe say is, you get your economic loss under current law if your State \nlaw lets you. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. There \nis a sincere difference of opinion here. We are saying economic losses \nshould be governed by State contract law. The Senator from \nMassachusetts says that he would like to go with a different concept. \nThat is the difference of opinion here.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let my say to my colleague, with all due respect, that he \nis dead wrong. He is even more so dead wrong, because moments ago they \nadopted an amendment by the Senator from Colorado, the Allard \namendment, which makes it very clear that State law is superseded. That \nis the amendment they adopted. So State law takes precedence, period, \nend of issue. You cannot protect people from misrepresentation or \nfraud, and there is no public policy rationale for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with consent across the aisle, I believe, \nI ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour equally divided on the \nKerry amendment No. 610, followed by a vote on or in relation to the \namendment, with no amendments to the amendment being in order prior to \nthe vote, but that the vote will take place at a time to be determined \nby the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if my friend from \nWashington could hold that unanimous consent request for a few minutes. \nWe have to make a couple calls.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will withdraw the request for the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am here to speak as one of those who is a \ncosponsor of the amendment now pending, the Kerry amendment. People \nhave spent a tremendous amount of time coming up with the various \nproposals that are now before the Senate. I commend and applaud those \nwho have worked so hard on this issue. I see on the floor my friend \nfrom Oregon. He has spent not hours and days, but weeks on this \nlegislation. I commend him for the efforts he has made.\n  I do, however, say that in addition to the work he has done as a \nprincipal author of the bill, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has \nalso spent a tremendous amount of time on this issue--as much if not \nmore than my friend from the State of Oregon. The problem we have with \nthis legislation--and we all recognize that it is extremely important--\nis that we have 204 days left until Y2K. We don't have time to play \npartisan politics and wait until the next session to produce a bill.\n  With 204 days left, we have to get to some serious legislation here \nand get something that is not perfect, but doable. I suggest that the \namendment I am cosponsoring, which the chief author, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, has spoken at some length on, is legislation that the \nPresident will sign. We have to take that into consideration.\n  In the last several months I have traveled around the country meeting \nwith high-tech companies, small businessmen and women, and individuals \nwho have done so much to help this robust economy in which we are now \ninvolved. These individuals who run these companies want a bill. They \ndon't want or expect a perfect bill, but they want a bill. They want a \nbill that would become legislation. They want a bill that would meet \nthe demands they have. These small business men and women are \nsuccessful enough, and certainly smart enough, to realize that with 204 \ndays left there is a lot that has to be done. They would much rather \nhave something signed into law than nothing at all.\n  We have to make sure that whatever we do is reasonable. The Kerry \namendment is reasonable. The amendment now pending before this body is \nreasonable. We reward people for making an effort to address the Y2K \nproblem. We also discourage frivolous lawsuits. I hope this amendment \nwill receive a resounding vote.\n  I submit to this body that what we are doing is offering an amendment \nto the underlying bill that would make the legislation something the \nPresident would sign. We hope that when this bill, with this amendment, \ngets out of here, it will go to conference, and at the conference the \ndifferences will be worked out.\n  As it now stands, the underlying bill simply will not be signed by \nthe President. I submit to my friend from the State of Oregon, who has \nworked so hard on this, that his legislation will not be signed. They \nhave amended the McCain legislation, but the President of the United \nStates will not sign this legislation. He has said this orally and he \nhas said it in writing.\n  So I think, we have to push something through, in good faith, to help \nthis problem that we have, something that would be signed by the \nPresident. I hope that people of good will on both sides of the aisle \nwill join together and offer support for the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nhour equally divided on the Kerry amendment No. 610, followed by a vote \non or in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in order prior \nto the vote, with the vote to take place at a time to be determined by \nthe managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object. I actually didn't hear it.\n  Mr. GORTON. It provides for 1 hour equally divided, with no more \namendments while that hour is going on, and that the time for the vote \nwill be determined by the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. The managers, plural?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to talk as in morning business for up to 10 minutes, and that \nit not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1193 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thought our colleagues might find it \nworthwhile to know that there are literally dozens of organizations, \nrepresenting a significant percentage of the gross domestic product of \nthis country, that endorse the McCain-Wyden-Dodd legislation, the Y2K \nbill. Beginning with the aerospace industry organizations, running \nthrough to the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Association, the \nWest Virginia Manufacturers Association, Valve Manufacturers, Service \nMasters--all of the high-tech organizations, many of the State \norganizations--the North Carolina Electronic and Information Technology \nAssociation, Technology of New Jersey--it just goes on down this long \nlist. My colleagues may want to have some idea and sense of the people \nwe have worked with mostly now for many months to try to craft this \nlegislation in a timely fashion.\n  This list represents almost 70 percent of the gross domestic product \nof the United States and thousands and thousands of working men and \nwomen in this country who would like to see Congress come up with some \nanswer of how to solve the Y2K problem and yet not create a cost and an \naction that doesn't solve the problem but ends up with more costs and \nwithout resolving the very serious issue that Y2K poses. I ask \nunanimous consent that list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Year 2000 Coalition,\n\n                                                     June 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The Year 2000 Coalition hand-delivered the \n     attached letter to Senators Kerry, Robb, Daschle, Reid, \n     Breaux, and Akaka, who have prepared a staff working draft of \n     a proposed amendment to S. 96, The Y2K Act.

Mr. President, again, I listened to the debate on the Kerry \namendment. Again, as I stated earlier, I went down the various points \nof the proposal. The amendment basically is designed to open up the \nMcCain legislation to the kinds of unbridled litigation that can occur \nin this area.\n  As I said earlier, we have not argued that we have crafted a perfect \nbill. It is our fervent hope that this legislation will become \nunnecessary, because the problems that many anticipate we hope will not \noccur. But if they do occur, if, as some claim, we are going to face \nserious problems in this country, then we think it is the wiser course \nof action for Congress to enact legislation that would encourage the \nresolution of the Y2K problem.\n  That is what we have attempted to do with this bill. We have had to \ncompromise it, because it asks for compromise. Senator Wyden, our \ndistinguished colleague from Oregon, is responsible for at least 11 or \n12 changes, that I know of, in this bill from its original crafting. I \nworked on three or four of the ones dealing with the punitive damages \nand directors' and officers' liability in the States in this bill. We \nhave compromised slightly. But every day you have to move the goal post \nto serve yet another constituency.\n  We would like to have a bill that everyone would support. It would be \nwonderful to have a piece of legislation that 100 Senators would get \nbehind. But candidly, you have a handful--really just a handful--of law \nfirms that are opposed to this, it is a total misstatement to suggest \nthat the trial bar in general is opposed to this bill. It is a couple \nof law firms in this country that are opposed to this bill. That is the \nfact of the matter. Because of a couple of law firms, we have an \namendment that I am confident these law firms are very attracted to, \nlike, and support for the obvious reasons. It basically makes this bill \nmeaningless or worse; it actually expands an area of the law that \ndidn't exist prior to the consideration of this bill. It is one thing \nif you want to change the bill. It is another matter to take existing \nlaw and create yet new opportunities. That is what the Kerry amendment \ndoes. When you allow State law to obviate contract law, you are not \nonly disagreeing with our bill but you are disagreeing with existing \nlaw.\n  For Members to come in and support this amendment, understand that if \nit carries and ends up being adopted, it will encourage the adoption of \nit. Then we are not only not dealing with the Y2K problem, we are \nexpanding areas of litigation that do not presently exist. Whatever \ndisagreements you have with the underlying bill, if you want to vote \nagainst that bill, fine; but don't expand areas of litigation.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Massachusetts, clearly his \namendment does that. I think it would be a tragedy, as we are trying to \nshut down and reduce the proliferation of litigation, that we find we \nare expanding those opportunities.\n  Again, a lot of compromise has been involved in this and a lot of \ntime and a lot of effort to bring it to this point.\n  Again, I have a great deal of respect for those who disagree with \nthis work product. They have a different point of view--one that I \ndisagree with, but I respect. To come in and to somehow suggest that we \nare improving this legislation and that we are in fact minimizing the \npossibility of further litigation with the adoption of the Kerry \namendment is just not the case. You are expanding the opportunities for \nlitigation.\n  For those reasons, the high-tech communities of this country feel \nstrongly about this amendment, and for good reason.\n  When the amendment comes up for a final vote, I urge my colleagues to \nreject it and to let us move along and try to pass this legislation, \nand send a message that we care about this issue and want to minimize \nthe problems the Y2K issue can present.\n  I do not know if there is any more time. I know there is some talk \nabout other Members who wish to come over. I urge them to do this. This \nhas been going on for 6 hours now. We have 21 other amendments to \nconsider. My hope is that we can get this completed fairly quickly and \nat least have one or two votes today before we adjourn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now under controlled time, are we \nnot?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. How does that stand? How much time does each side have at \nthis point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 26 minutes \n50 seconds, and the opposition has 23 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I listened to the Senator from Connecticut. I must say that I am a \nlittle disappointed, from what I heard, for a simple reason. I haven't \ncome to the floor of the Senate and talked about the Chamber of \nCommerce. I haven't come to the floor of the Senate and talked about \nspecific companies and interests that are represented or the dynamics \nthis raised. I think to suggest that somehow what I have put on the \nfloor represents the interests of just a few law firms really is an \ninsult to the legislative effort that has taken place here. There is \nnothing in here that lawyers like. There is a restraint on plaintiffs \nalmost every step of the way. This has been negotiated with many \ndifferent people. I have sat with high-tech people at great length.\n  I have tried to do the bidding of the high-tech community to the \ngreatest degree possible. I have listened to them. I have talked to \nAndy Grove three or four times. In his letter to the committee \nchairman, he stated that of his four interests, each had been met in \nthis legislation.\n  We do exactly what the McCain bill does on cure. We do exactly what \nthe McCain bill does on the mitigation. We do exactly what they do with \nrespect to contract preservation. The one distinction in the four \ningredients is a requirement that a company be a good citizen by \nlooking over its inventory and making a determination as to what it did \nor didn't put out into the marketplace that might have the potential \nfor creating a problem.\n  My colleagues come to the floor say again and again: We want \nremediation; we want to make it get better; we don't want lawsuits. I \ndon't, either. We want the same remediation.\n  But if you ask a company to investigate its inventory, in my \njudgment, you are doing a better job of encouraging them to remediate \nthan if you give them a blanket ``out'' from under one of the great \nleverages of our judicial system, which is the joint and several \nliability. They get it no matter\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\nwhat they do. How that is an invitation to fixing the system and making \nit better is beyond me.\n  I think we need to be very clear here. Moreover, we have been told we \nare changing contract law. We are not changing contract law. We are \nsuggesting contract law ought to be respected, and we are very clear \nabout that. In fact, we uphold the contract law as it is, State for \nState.\n  No one has answered this question: Why should a company be able to \nescape responsibility for an intentional, willful, wanton, reckless or \noutrageous, willfully committed fraud against an individual when it \ncreates economic loss? If you have economic loss under the provision of \nS. 96, you are not permitted to sue with respect to the intentional \nwillfulness that took place. Why you want to protect a company that so \nbehaves is beyond me. Another company may have a huge loss of \nintellectual property; they may drop their entire database; they may \nnot be able to provide their contracts to other companies for months; \nthey have economic loss; there was an intentional defrauding. And we \nare not going to hold them accountable for that.\n  We should be clear as to what we are talking about. This is a very \nmoderate, very legitimate effort, just as legitimate without any \ninsinuations of who may be directing the interests of the other side \nand just as legitimate to legislate a sound approach to Y2K liability.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am reluctant to get into this fight \nbecause, as I said before, I am unburdened with legal education. \nOccasionally when I hear these legal debates, it makes me grateful for \nthe fact that I did not go to law school.\n  However, I feel the need to stand and comment on some of the things \nthat have been heard and some of the statements that have been made \nwith respect to this particular amendment.\n  It is my understanding that anybody who commits an intentional act of \nfraud has no relief as a result of this bill. If anybody can contradict \nthat, I will be happy to hear it, because I do not want, in any way, to \nbe part of supporting a bill that protects people from intentional \nfraud. That is not my purpose.\n  I must stand, as the chairman of the Senate Special Committee On The \nYear 2000 Technology Problem, and tell my colleagues that this is a \nunique situation. This has the potential of creating a unique chain of \nevents that requires a unique solution. That is the purpose of the \nMcCain-Dodd-Wyden bill, and that is why the bill has a 3-year sunset in \nit. We are not changing the world forever. We are crafting, as \ncarefully as we can, a piece of legislation to deal with the unique \ncircumstance of the Year 2000.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the Senator's comment enormously. I want to \ncall the Senator's attention to the language of the bill. Section 121, \nDamages and Tort Claims:\n\n       A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may not recover \n     damages for economic loss involving a defective device or \n     system or service unless----\n\n  And you have two conditions under which they could.\n  No. 1, where the loss is provided in the contract; and, No. 2, if the \nloss results directly from damage to the property caused by the Y2K \nfailure.\n  I have a third, and the Senator's folks are opposed to it. Here is \nthe third. The defendant committed an intentional tort. Except where \nthe tort involves misrepresentation or fraud regarding the attributes \nor capabilities of the product. Does the Senator want to pass a bill \nwithout that, without the fraud and misrepresentation?\n  It is in the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I see my colleague from Oregon wishes to respond to this \nand perhaps has a better legal handle on it than I do.\n  My own layman's reaction would be not to sign a contract that didn't \nhave a provision for fraud in it, as a businessman.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding.\n  This goes right to the heart of the debate. We essentially say that \nState contract law will govern in these jurisdictions. The Senator from \nMassachusetts believes in a variety of instances that there should be \nother remedies. He is creating other remedies during this 36-month \nperiod where we are trying to present frivolous lawsuits.\n  The key principle here and what is now being debated is that under \nwhat Senator McCain, Senator Bennett and Senator Dodd, the leader on \nour side on the Y2K issue, have said, we are going to protect State \ncontract law with respect to economic losses. But we don't feel it is \nappropriate to try to create new remedies at this time when we are \ntrying to prevent these frivolous lawsuits.\n  I am very appreciative to the Senator from Utah for yielding to me. I \nhope our colleagues will see that on this point of economic loss, State \ncontract law is fully protected.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me give a factual example to make the case. Assume you \nhave two identical computer systems, system A and system B, sold by the \nsame manufacturer. They prove to be defective and cause economic \ndamages of $100 million and lost profits to each purchaser, A and B.\n  System A crashed because of defective wiring, while system B crashed \nbecause of the Y2K bug. If Congress enacts the proposal suggested by my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, that would allow no recovery of economic \ndamages in tort cases. Purchaser B in the example would be able to sue \nfor economic losses under the Y2K legislation while purchaser A would \nnot.\n  There is no justification for such a result. In effect, the net \nresult of the Y2K bill would be to expand liability in Y2K cases. \nIndeed, it would create an incentive for plaintiff's lawyers to look \nfor any Y2K problem and then make that the predicate for legislation, \nexactly the opposite of the policy aim of the legislation.\n  In the faulty wire case, you only get economic damages and you have \nto apply State law. Under the Y2K legislation as proposed by my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, you are expanding this. We are not trying \nto expand law here; we are trying to at least follow a similar pattern. \nSo there is a fundamental difference: the defective wire in one case, \nthe defective Y2K problem in the other. You end up with completely \ndifferent results and encourage, of course, groping around, looking for \nY2K issues, rather than defective wire which may be the cause of the \nproblem.\n  I don't think that is the intent of our colleagues who are generally \nsupportive of the very proposal we have before the Senate. That does \nexpand existing law.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I realize the \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to engage in this. I ask unanimous \nconsent that such time as is taken up by the Senator from Massachusetts \nbe charged to the time of the Senator from Massachusetts rather than \ncharged against my time.\n  With that understanding, I am happy to yield to the Senator further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is entirely fair. What I would like to do is just \nrespond and then I will sit down and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Let me say to both of my colleagues, and I am glad we are getting to \nthe nub of this, I say this gently and nicely: Both of the \npresentations that were made are incorrect with respect to what I said. \nThe Senator from Oregon made a bold defense of contract law, and the \neconomic loss argument that he made refers to the preservation of \nexisting contract law. But economic loss is a tort claim. It is a tort \nclaim. His argument is simply irrelevant when he says he is protecting \nthe capacity of the contract law, so to speak, to be preserved within \nthe framework of the economic loss argument. Here is why: My colleague \nfrom Connecticut just said we are trying to open this up to some broad, \nnew thing, and the example he cited would not be, in fact, included. It \nabsolutely would be included because our language includes both of the \nexamples that he gave.\n  If it is provided in the contract, the person would be made whole. Or \nif it is the result of a Y2K failure, the person would be made whole. \nHere is the only difference. We go one step further. We do not allow \nthem a whole lot of intentional torts except--and I read from\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\nthe language--``where the tort involves misrepresentation or fraud.'' \nThat is the only ``new thing'' here. So, if the Senator from \nConnecticut is really concerned, what he is concerned about is that a \nlawyer might be able to lay out, according to the tough standards in \nboth of our bills, sufficiently precise pleadings with a period to \ncure.\n  You may never have a lawsuit because everybody is going to have a 90-\nday period to cure, and we hope they are going to do exactly that. But \nif they do not do that and they do meet the sufficiency of the \npleadings, and there also is a sufficiency of a showing of fraud or \nmisrepresentation, they ought to get their economic losses. What we are \nsaying is that under S. 96, under the current way it is written, you \nare denying economic losses if there is fraud or misrepresentation. \nThat is the only ``new thing.''\n  The Senator from Connecticut says we are going to open up some great \nPandora's box, a whole lot of lawyers bringing cases. We have tough \npleading requirements here, really tough. Even after you send in your \nfirst notice of a lawsuit, the company is going to get 90 days to fix \nit. Any company that does not fix it in 90 days probably ought to be \nheld accountable for the fraud and misrepresentation. But your bill \nsays no to fraud and misrepresentation. Ours says yes. I ask anybody \nwhich they think is more fair.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, again I witness this clash between great \nlegal minds. Yet, I am informed by a number of other legal minds the \nKerry amendment would, in fact, destroy the effect of the bill. As a \nbusinessman, I always ended up asking my legal team whether it was \nappropriate for me to sign a particular lease or contract. I had to \nlearn to depend on good lawyers. I think we have hired good lawyers in \nthis situation and I am accepting their advice. I am moved by the \neloquence of my friend from Massachusetts, but I shall not vote with \nhim.\n  I want to once again focus on what it is we are doing here. We are \ndealing with a unique situation the likes of which we have never seen \nin international commerce and probably never will see again. That is \nwhy specific legislation is necessary.\n  Let me go back to a statement made by my friend from Massachusetts in \nthe earlier debate when he said: We want people to be driven to examine \ntheir inventory to make sure it is compliant, but if the liability is \nlimited they will not do that. This is not a question of examining your \ninventory to make sure it is compliant. We are already getting examples \nof people who have done everything prudent and possible to make sure \nthat things were compliant with Y2K, only to discover after they had \ndone everything prudent that it still didn't work. There are bugs \nhidden in this kind of problem that cannot in reasonable fashion be \ndiscovered in advance. There is a presumption on the part of the \nSenator from Massachusetts that those bugs were there because of some \nmisrepresentation or fraud. My concern is that there will be that \npresumption on the part of a lawyer bringing suit if those bugs occur \nin equipment that at one time or another has passed through the hands \nof a very wealthy corporation.\n  This is where proportionality of joint and several liability comes \nin. If a corporation with deep pockets has at one time or another had \nits hands, figuratively, on a product where such a Y2K glitch occurs, \nthere will be an obvious invitation to sue that corporation and then \nsettle out of court for a large settlement because the corporation will \ndecide, on business terms, it is cheaper to settle than proceed with \nthe suit.\n  I have had the experience as CEO of a company of settling a lawsuit \nwhere I felt the merits were firmly on our side but where the economics \nsaid you do your shareholders a better service by taking this \nsettlement than you do by going to court. I have had personal \nexperience with that. I know how those kinds of decisions are made. In \na situation where there will be unforeseen consequences and products \nthat have passed through many hands in order to finally get to where \nthey go, the temptation to sue the deep pockets will be overwhelming \nunless we pass this legislation. Every lawyer that I have spoken to who \nhas examined the legislation from that point of view has said you \ncannot adopt the Kerry amendment. It will gut the legislation. It will \nrender the whole thing moot, as far as we are concerned.\n  So I stand here not as a lawyer but as a businessman who has now, for \n3 years, immersed himself in the Y2K issue and, frankly, who feels he \nunderstands that issue fairly well. I call on my colleagues to defeat \nthe Kerry amendment, to pass this legislation, and to give to American \nfirms--not just high-tech --give to American firms that will be \ninvolved in products that will suffer from Y2K problems the ability to \nsolve those problems without the specter of huge lawsuits and huge \nsettlements hanging over them.\n  Let me go back to one thing I said and repeat it. As I have been \nimmersed in this issue for the period of time I have, I have come to \nrealize that it is not strictly a high-tech issue. Yes, the high-tech \ncommunity has been the most visible in pushing for this legislation. \nBut they are by no means the only part of the American economy that \nwill be affected by this issue. There will be municipalities that can \nbe sued. There will be cities around this country that will suddenly \ndiscover that essential services do not work, that will have done \neverything they thought reasonable to get there only to have some \nglitch that they were unaware of come out of the blue.\n  Then the lawsuits will start. The question will be who was in the \nsupply chain to produce whatever the device is that failed. Let's see \nwho has the deepest pockets. It may not be a high-tech company at all. \nStates are scrambling now to try to pass their own limited liability. I \nthink that is a mistake. I think the Federal legislation makes a lot \nmore sense. But let us understand, once again, we have a unique \nsituation here. We already have anecdotal evidence that shows us how \ncapricious it can be, in spite of the greatest effort to remediate and \nbe in control. We do not want to turn this into a playground for \nplaintiffs' lawyers who want to take advantage of the class action \ncircumstance, sue the deepest pockets, take a settlement, and walk away \nin a way that is of no advantage to anybody.\n  If we are making a mistake in this bill, if as we draft it there is \nmischief, it is not permanent mischief because the bill is gone at the \nend of 3 years. Everything is over at the end of 3 years. No one--no \none--will make any attempt to extend it. Certainly I will not. By \nvirtue of what the voters of Utah did, I will be here 3 years from now, \nif I am still alive, and I will certainly oppose any extension of this \nbill. I would think everybody would oppose any extension if somebody \nwere to bring it up.\n  We are facing a unique situation. We have a piece of intelligently \ncrafted legislation to try to deal with that situation, and we should \nnot let ourselves get convinced that we are somehow changing the basis \nof American jurisprudence for all time as we try to take a prudent step \nin this particular circumstance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself such time as I use.\n  Let me begin by paying tribute to both the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Utah. I know they have spent a huge amount of \ntime, and they have done for the entire Senate and the country a great \nservice in calling attention to and helping people understand the \nnature of this problem. I genuinely give both of them great credit for \ntheir leadership and their vision, understanding well over, what, 3 \nyears ago that it was a problem and we needed to address it.\n  Our difference is not in good faith, in purpose, or intent. It is how \nwe will or will not do something. I know my colleague from Utah is a \nvery thoughtful and diligent student of these kinds of issues, and I \nshare with him his own language with respect to the damages of \nlimitation by contract, for instance. This is section 110, page 11, of \nthe bill. It says:\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; . . . .\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield? Mr. President, I suggest the \nSenator is reading from an old version.\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n There is no section 110 in the current----\n  Mr. KERRY. I apologize, it is now section 11.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am reading from the accurate language. The point I am \nmaking is that you only allow damages according to the express terms of \nthe contract. That contract could be illegal. That contract could be \nunenforceable or enforceable under other circumstances under State law. \nThe language we have added simply says ``unless enforcement of the term \nin question would manifestly and directly contravene applicable State \nlaw in effect on January 1, 1999.'' Here is a major difference. You \nwould, in fact, allow the contract to supersede applicable State law \neven if the contract were illegal. That is the way it reads.\n  There are serious implications in the language that is in the bill \nthat would have a profound impact, and that is the kind of difference \nwe have tried to address in pulling together our amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DODD. May I address----\n  Mr. KERRY. On your time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are getting arcane. If a contract is \nillegal, it is not a contract. Just to say we have a contract, if there \nis no consent, if all the principles necessary for it to be a valid \ncontract are missing, if a contract is inherently illegal, two people \nwho engage in a contract for illegal purposes is not a contract to be \nprotected under State law.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. With all due respect to my colleague, under the language \nin this bill, you will have given it life because you have, in fact, \nmade it a contract that is binding.\n  Mr. DODD. We do not protect illegal contracts in this legislation. If \nthere is any question, let the legislative history confirm that. I do \nnot think we need confirmation. Upholding an illegal contract by \nlegislation would require herculean efforts that do not exist in this \nparticular proposal.\n  I yield the floor to others who may want to speak.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 30 seconds. If there is an illegal \nprovision in a legal contract, you have the same problem I just \ndefined. I do not want to get arcane, either. But you have, in the \nlanguage of this bill, superseded the capacity of that illegality to be \neither a defense or a problem. That is all we are saying. These ought \nto be curable issues. We are passing a bill where they have not been \ncured. I promise you, if you want to create litigation problems, there \nthey are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, with some trepidation, I am going to read \nsome legal language. As a layman, I have a hard time with this, but I \nwill do my best and I think it is fairly clear. Under section 4 of the \nact:\n\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n\n  State law is preserved. State law is not overridden in this catchall \nprovision, if you will, at this stage. At this point, I will quit \ntrying to practice law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will make one additional comment. \nMention was made of Andy Grove. The Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from Oregon and I, along with several other Senators, had \nbreakfast with Andy Grove this morning.\n  Just so the record is clear, the subject of the Kerry amendment came \nup in that discussion, and Mr. Grove, if I am quoting him correctly, \nsaid that his lawyers felt that the Kerry amendment would destroy the \nbill and leave it with no value. Indeed, my memory says he said that if \nthe Kerry amendment was adopted, they would be better off without any \nbill. I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he has the same memory or \nif I am embroidering things.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, we had a very delightful meeting for \nan hour and a half with Andy Grove. Those were, as I recall them, his \nsentiments expressed to us. He is someone who has been quoted over and \nover in the last number of weeks, and we finally got to meet the man \nquoted endlessly and found out where he stood on this legislation. Four \nor five of us had the privilege this morning of spending an hour and a \nhalf with him and discussing a wide range of issues, including \neducation policy. He was very clear, I thought, in his expression of \nconcerns about this effort and the damage that can be caused by the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from Utah has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity \nto express the views of this Senator on a very important amendment.\n  I think the biggest question facing the Senate today is not whether \nto support the Y2K liability reform. Most supporters, on both sides of \nthe aisle, agree that we need to protect the high-technology companies \nfrom frivolous lawsuits.\n  For more than a decade, this industry has been the driving force of \nour economy. Its well-being is extremely important to this country and \nto all of us.\n  In South Dakota, Gateway computers is the largest private employer in \nthe State today. I want a bill that provides Gateway--and every other \nmember of this industry--with reasonable protections from frivolous \nY2K-related lawsuits.\n  Businesses need to be able to focus on fixing the problem--not \ndefending against lawsuits.\n  But the high technology industry is not the only group that faces \npotential difficulties as a result of this problem.\n  Consumers and other businesses that use and depend on computers face \npotential risks as well.\n  We need to protect consumers who might be hurt by the Y2K bug. We \nneed to protect their right to seek justice in the courts.\n  A major problem with the underlying bill, as we consider just how we \ndo that, is an issue of great importance to many of us; that is, how we \nresolve the issue of capping punitive damages that go beyond what is \nneeded to prevent frivolous Y2K-related lawsuits.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, \nand developed by him, and a number of our colleagues, corrects these \nproblems.\n  Before I describe the differences between our approach and the \nunderlying bill, it is important to point out that--on most of the \nbasic issues--the two proposals are identical to the pending bill.\n  Both approaches encourage remediation by giving defendants 90 days to \nfix a Y2K problem before a lawsuit can be filed.\n  Both approaches would discourage frivolous lawsuits by allowing \neither party to request alternative dispute resolution at any time \nduring the 90-day waiting period.\n  Both approaches require anyone seeking damages to offer reasonable \nproof--including the nature and amount of the damages--before a class \naction suit could proceed.\n  Both approaches would permit class-action lawsuits to be brought only \nif a majority of the people in the lawsuit suffered real harm by real \ndefects.\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\n  Our approach addresses 95 percent--if not 100 percent--of what those \nin the high-technology community have asked for. It addresses all of \nthe principles they have said are essential.\n  But there are a number of important ways in which our approaches \ndiffer.\n  Our proposal carefully balances the rights and interests of the \nindustry, and consumers.\n  It limits its remedies to problems that are truly, legitimately Y2K \nrelated.\n  Our alternative offers high-tech companies more incentives than the \nunderlying bill to fix the problem--now, while there is still time.\n  We are concerned that the underlying bill may--perhaps \ninadvertantly--provide such blanket protection against all Y2K \nproblems, including those that could have and should have been avoided, \nthat companies will lose the incentive to fix problems now.\n  For example, our amendment provides a balanced and reasonable \nsolution to the issue of ``proportionality.''\n  The underlying bill preempts State laws on this issue. It would grant \ndefendants proportional liability in almost all Y2K cases--no questions \nasked.\n  Our amendment, simply says that Y2K defendants would have to pass a \nsimple test to quality for this protection.\n  It is sometimes referred to as the ``good corporate citizen'' test. \nAnd I know my colleague from Massachusetts has discussed this in some \ndetail this afternoon. All a company has to do to pass the test is to \nshow that it has identified potential problems and made a good-faith \neffort to alert potential victims.\n  This is a major concession. But we are willing to make it in this \ncase because of the extraordinary circumstances.\n  These are reasonable conditions. Every single high tech company we \nknow of has already met it.\n  If there are others that have not done so, they do not deserve \nspecial protection from Congress--plain and simple.\n  There are a number of other ways in which our amendment improves on \nthe underlying bill:\n  It does not prohibit consumers from seeking justice in the courts for \nreal and legitimate Y2K-related problems.\n  The underlying bill would require consumers to meet so many \nconditions before bringing suit that it would effectively shut the \ncourthouse door.\n  Our bill establishes strict requirements for class actions to protect \nagainst frivolous suits.\n  The underlying bill shifts virtually all Y2K suits to the Federal \ncourts. This has two effects. In many cases, it makes it harder for \nconsumers to bring a suit. It also increases the strain on an already \nbacklogged Federal court system.\n  This is strongly opposed by the Judicial Conference--not only because \nof the additional strain it would place on Federal courts, but also \nbecause it would upset the traditional division of responsibility \nbetween State and Federal courts.\n  I might say, I am continually amused by those on the other side of \nthe aisle who have expressed themselves as being advocates of States \nrights and the Constitution and the requirement that States be given \nthe prerogative in matters of jurisdiction on this and so many other \nareas; but when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle find it \nconvenient, it seems this shift to Federal responsibility comes so \neasily. This is just yet another example of that shift. There have been \nscores of those examples in recent years.\n  Our alternative would not enforce illegal contract terms.\n  The underlying bill might. It could enforce any and all contracts--\neven those that are currently illegal under State and Federal laws.\n  Our alternative does not protect defendants from liability for \nintentionally wrongful acts. It allows victims of such acts to sue for \neconomic losses.\n  The underlying bill protects companies even when they knowingly harm \nconsumers, or use fraud to pressure someone into signing a contract.\n  Finally, our bill does not include a cap on punitive damages.\n  The pending bill would limit the amount of punitive damages that \nsmaller businesses and municipalities could be assessed--regardless of \nwhether they acted responsibly.\n  The people who would benefit from a cap on punitive damages are bad \nactors who injure others.\n  Ironically, many of those who would be hurt if this passes are \nthemselves small businesses.\n  In summary, our amendment is identical to the underlying bill in \nevery important, necessary way.\n  But, it does differ in ways that are critical to consumers, to \nbusinesses, and to the functioning of our courts.\n  Perhaps the most important difference between our approach and the \nunderlying bill is that our approach is the only version the President \nwill sign. We know that. The administration has said so unequivocally \non numerous occasions. Make no mistake, unless the improvements in this \namendment are adopted, the President will veto this bill for going too \nfar.\n\n  So the choice is ours, and the year 2000 is fast approaching. Do we \nwant to engage in an exercise that would be fruitless? Do we want to \nwaste precious days debating a bill we know will be vetoed and then \nhave to start all over? Do we want to limit frivolous Y2K lawsuits? \nThis year is now more than halfway over. How much more time are we \nwilling to let go before we agree to work together on a real solution?\n  The bottom line is, we have the power to fix the Y2K problem today. \nWe have before us now an approach that targets the real problem and can \nbe signed into law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in adopting the Kerry-Robb amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will make one observation, and then I \nhave a motion.\n  We hear again on the floor the threat of a Presidential veto. We hear \nthat increasingly, as if the President should write legislation and we \nshould supinely accept whatever the President recommends, that our \nfunction is simply to listen to the President, pass legislation that he \nannounces in advance is acceptable and, thereby, abdicate our \nlegislative responsibilities.\n  I am perfectly willing to risk a Presidential veto. I think that is \nthe appropriate posture for a Member of the Senate.\n  I ask consent that following the debate in relation to amendment No. \n610, the Senate proceed to an amendment to be offered by Senator \nMurkowski or his designee and no other amendments in order prior to 6 \np.m., and that at 5:50, there be 10 minutes for explanation followed by \na vote in relation to the Kerry amendment No. 610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back all further \ntime on the Kerry amendment, if Senator Kerry is prepared to yield \nback.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I cannot do that. I think Senator Edwards \nwants to use a little time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute 13 seconds; \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto yield back my time, with the understanding that if Senator Murkowski \nis not permitted to go forward, Senator Edwards can talk until he is, \nand if he has gone forward, that Senator Edwards would then be \nrecognized to speak within the confines of the unanimous consent \nagreement just agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move to table the Kerry amendment, with \nthe vote to occur at 6, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. For the information of all Senators then, the next vote \nwill occur at 6 in relation to the Kerry substitute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 612\n\n(Purpose: To require manufacturers receiving notice of a Y2K failure to \n    give priority to notices that involve health and safety related \n                               failures)\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, earlier today Senator McCain filed an \namendment No. 612 to the bill on behalf of Senator Murkowski. It is my \nunderstanding this amendment is acceptable to both sides. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent to call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 612.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 7(c) of the bill is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       (5) Priority.--A prospective defendant receiving more than \n     1 notice under this section shall give priority to notices \n     with respect to a product or service that involves a health \n     or safety related Y2K failure.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we consider S. 96, the Y2K bill, I \nwant to point out an area of concern that will affect many northern \nstates, especially my home state of Alaska. January 1, 2000, will \narrive in the middle of winter. Unlike many states in the lower 48, \nwhere a power failure on the first of the year is a major \ninconvenience, a power failure in Alaska can have serious consequences \nif climate control systems fail.\n  Earlier this year my home town of Fairbanks saw the thermometer \nplummet below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. While I do not doubt the \nindustrious nature of my fellow Alaskans who have for so long used \ntheir ingenuity and determination to survive in Alaska's cold climate, \nany delay in resolving a health or safety related failure in Alaska \ncannot only be costly, but also deadly.\n  Therefore, I am offering an amendment that would require that \ncompanies notified of a Y2K problem must first respond to requests \nwhere the Y2K failures affect the health or safety of the public.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Alaska for offering his \namendment. I point out that his amendment does not only protect \nAlaskans. If a consumer radio fails, it's an inconvenience. If a radio \nused by the Phoenix police department fails, not only does it put the \nlife of the police officer carrying it in jeopardy, but it also \njeopardizes the safety of the public he or she protects. A company \nshould give priority in responding to the Phoenix police station's need \nfor Y2K failure assistance.\n  I am pleased to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Arizona for his attention to \nthis issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator had two amendments. Is this one related to \nthe safety and health conditions? Is that the Murkowski amendment? That \nis the one. OK. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Connecticut may have an objection.\n  Mr. DODD. I was going to urge that it be set aside for 5 minutes or \nso. There is an item that I think might make that a bit stronger.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be set aside \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, under the previous order, I understand \nnow that Senator Edwards will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will speak briefly to the McCain bill and to Senator \nKerry's amendment, which I think should be recognized as a real effort \nby Senator Kerry to cure some of the problems that exist with the \nMcCain bill.\n  From my perspective, I think what we are trying to accomplish here is \nto find a reasonable, moderate approach that both protects the rights \nand interests of consumers while at the same time ensuring that \ncomputer company manufacturers have the protection that they need and \ndeserve.\n  There has been a lot of talk today about frivolous lawsuits. The \nMcCain bill has very little, if anything, to do with frivolous \nlawsuits. The two provisions in that bill that all of the Senators have \nspent a great deal of time on and that have caused the most controversy \nare joint and several liability and economic loss. Those two provisions \nhave absolutely nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits.\n  Speaking for myself, and, I think, speaking for Senator Kerry, both \nof us are opposed to any kind of frivolous lawsuit. I would be willing \nto support any provision that would provide protection against \nfrivolous lawsuits. The two provisions that we are talking about, the \nelimination of joint and several liability and the elimination, from my \nperspective, of the right to recover economic loss, are both things \nthat occur after a defendant has been found responsible. In other \nwords, before you ever get to those two provisions, you have to first \ndetermine that there has been some irresponsible behavior on behalf of \na defendant.\n  The idea that those provisions, which are really the most \ncontroversial provisions in this bill, have anything to do with \nfrivolous lawsuits just doesn't make any sense. They have absolutely \nnothing to do with frivolous lawsuits.\n  For example, joint and several liability has to do with who you can \nrecover against and what percentage or proportion of your damages you \ncan recover, once a jury has determined that the defendant acted \nirresponsibly or in violation of a contract.\n  The economic loss provision has to do with whether the small business \nowner or the consumer is allowed to recover for lost profits, lost \noverhead, out-of-pocket costs, once it has been determined that, in \nfact, the defendant is at fault. So the idea that this has anything to \ndo with frivolous lawsuits is just misleading. The bill has very \nlittle, if anything, to do with frivolous lawsuits.\n  If what we are concerned about is getting these cases resolved, \ncreating incentives for consumers, small business people, people who \nhave purchased computers, people who have a Y2K problem, to work with \nthe computer manufacturers, with the people who manufacture the \ncomponent parts of computers, I think that makes a great deal of \nsense. But this bill doesn't do that. Instead, what this bill doesn't \ndo, in contrast to Senator Kerry's amendment, is strike a proper \nbalance between providing reasonable protections for computer \ncompanies, while at the same time making sure we protect consumers. \nThere has been an awful lot of discussion on the floor today about \nlawyers and the interests of lawyers. The reality is that lawyers and \nthe discussion about frivolous lawsuits have little or nothing to do \nwith this bill. Lawyers didn't make these computers; lawyers didn't \nhave anything to do with the manufacture of these computer chips. And \nit is not lawyers who are going to be injured as a result of this bill. \nThe people who are going to be hurt are consumers, the people who have \npurchased these computers.\n\n  I think it is really important that we as Senators focus on the \npeople who are most likely to be injured as a result of the passage of \nthis bill. Now, there are two provisions in the McCain bill that I \nthink Senator Kerry's amendment addresses that are critically \nimportant. The first, and the one I want to focus most of my attention \non, is a provision about economic losses. This is under section 12 of \nthe bill entitled ``Damages and Tort Claims.''\n  What this provision does--and this is a provision of the McCain-Dodd-\nWyden bill--is it eliminates the right to recover economic losses by a \nsmall businessman if a computer or a computer chip manufacturer \nirresponsibly creates a Y2K problem. Let me give you an example, and I \nthink this example is very important. A small businessman in \nMurfreesboro, NC, is in his business establishment one day and a \ncomputer salesman comes in the door and says: I have this great \ncomputer system I\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nwant to sell you that will make your operation more efficient. It will \nhelp you operate your cash registers. It will help with your \naccounting. It will help with your collections. The businessman heard \nabout all these Y2K problems, but he was told by the salesman this \nsystem is totally Y2K compliant.\n  This small businessman, believing what he was told, buys the computer \nsystem. Well, come the year 2000, he begins to have problems, and the \nproblems shut down his cash registers, shut down his accounting system, \nshut down his ability to collect; and this business, which he and his \nfamily have been involved in all their lives, all of a sudden has no \ncash-flow. So they lose profit and they continue to incur overhead, and \nover a period of 2 or 3 months they essentially lose everything they \nhave spent their lives working on--all as a result of a Y2K problem \nthat, in my example, the computer salesman knew existed when he sold \nthem the computer.\n  In other words, when he made the statement to this businessman that \nthis system was totally Y2K compliant, he knew full well what he was \nsaying was not true. In fact, the evidence available to him indicated \nit was not Y2K compliant. So he made a fraudulent misrepresentation, a \nmisstatement to this businessman.\n  Under that example, under the terms of the McCain bill, this is what \nthat businessman who has been put out of business for the rest of his \nlife--a family business they spent their entire lives building up--is \nentitled to recover: The cost of his computer.\n  So if he spent $3,000 on the computer as a result of this \nmisrepresentation by the computer salesman, and he has been put out of \nbusiness forever, under this bill--which will, by the way, control all \nof these cases regardless of what State law provides, and I want to \ntalk about that in just a moment--this small businessman is out of \nbusiness and what he can get back is the cost of his computer. So what \nthe bill does, in essence, is it provides absolute immunity, with the \nexception of the cost of the computer.\n  I want to be clear about one other thing. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about punitive damages on the Senate floor. Punitive damages \nare damages that are awarded to punish a defendant for highly egregious \nconduct. But punitive damages have nothing whatsoever to do with what I \nam talking about now. We are now talking about a small businessperson \nbeing able to recover lost profits, having to shut down his or her \nbusiness, having to continue to pay overhead in connection with the \noperation of that business. These are normal damages to be recovered \nwithout reference to punitive damages.\n\n  What I am saying is a very simple thing. If this bill passes, then a \nnegligent computer chip manufacturer, a computer salesman, or computer \ncompany that sells computers, that outright lies--I am talking about \nengages in a fraudulent misrepresentation in their sales--can only be \nheld responsible for the cost of the computer. That is exactly what \nthis bill provides.\n  I respectfully disagree with what my colleague, Senator Wyden, said \nearlier today, that all Federal and State remedies for economic loss \nare left in place. I think exactly the opposite is true. In fact, what \nthis bill does is eliminate, to the extent that a cause of action \nexists under State law, the ability to recover for economic losses.\n  So what we have is a huge, huge problem. We have a provision in the \nbill where, prospectively, we are going to say to small and large \nbusinessmen and women around this country that if somebody has made a \nmisrepresentation to you about the computer system you were buying, No. \n1, and No. 2, if they irresponsibly and recklessly sold you a computer \nsystem that was not Y2K compliant, i.e., they didn't act with \nreasonable care or they acted negligently, what we are going to let you \nrecover is the cost of your computer; and you cannot recover any of the \ncosts associated with the operation of your business, your lost \nprofits, and all of the costs associated with the day-to-day running of \nthe business.\n  I don't believe there is an American out there listening to this who \nwould believe that is fair. It is not fair. Now, I might add, for \nSenators Wyden, McCain and Dodd, that there are provisions in this bill \nthat I have absolutely no problem with. I think we want to create \nincentives for people to work together. We want to create incentives \nfor manufacturers to solve this problem. I think a 90-day cooling off \nperiod is a good idea. I think the idea of having an alternative \ndispute resolution so that folks have a mechanism outside having to \nfile a lawsuit and go to court is a very good idea. These are all very \npositive things.\n  The problem is that, ultimately, there are going to be people across \nthis country who, because of somebody acting irresponsibly or somebody \nmisrepresenting something to them, are going to have problems with \ntheir business that will cause lost profits, lost overhead, which could \nultimately lead to a shutdown of their business. And they will be able \nto recover absolutely nothing but the cost of their computer. I might \nadd that later I intend to offer an amendment that specifically \naddresses this problem.\n  I just don't believe that is what the American people would support. \nIt is fundamentally unfair because what you have is a small \nbusinessperson who acted in good faith, innocently, in purchasing a \ncomputer system, and as a result of a law passed in this Congress, that \nperson would be out of business, through no fault of his own. But the \nperson who is at fault and is totally responsible for what happened to \nhim is only responsible for paying for the cost of the computer. The \nbottom line is, if this guy gets hurt and they get caught, what they \nhave to pay is the money they originally got from these folks, which is \nthe cost of the computer. That is fundamentally unfair. It violates \nevery principle of fairness and equity that exists in the law of this \ncountry and has existed for over 200 years. That alone is clearly \nenough that this bill should not be supported.\n  Senator Kerry's amendment addresses that problem. It also addresses \nanother problem that exists with this bill, which is the issue of joint \nand several liability. I have talked about this once before on the \nfloor, but I think it is really important for the American people to \nunderstand what joint and several liability is. Essentially, it has \nexisted in the law of this country for a couple hundred years now. It \nsays that where you have an innocent--as in my example--small \nbusinessman and you have multiple parties on the other side who may be \nresponsible for what happened, under joint and several liability the \ninnocent party never has to pay for the loss, that the loss is shared \nin some way among the parties who are responsible for that loss. In \nthis case, it may be the computer chip manufacturers; it may be the \ncomputer company that actually sold the entire system--a whole \nmultitude of defendants. It is for them to resolve who pays what among \nthemselves. In my case, the small businessman is innocent. And, as a \nresult of the current law on joint and several liability, this innocent \nparty is relieved of having to share the loss with guilty parties.\n\n  That is the reason joint and several liability exists. It is the \nreason it has existed in law in this country for a long time.\n  Senator Kerry's amendment sets up what I consider to be a very \nmoderate, thoughtful approach--that responds to the computer industry \nand the high-tech industry's request for some protection against joint \nand several liability.\n  What Senator Kerry says is basically, if you come in and show you \nhave acted responsibly as a good citizen, you get proportionate \nliability; that is, you can never be held responsible for anything more \nthan your fair share of the damages.\n  It seems to me, although that is not the law in a great number of \nStates in this country, that is a reasonable approach. It is a \ncompromise. There is no question about that. We all recognize that, \nwhile I personally believe joint and several liability makes a great \ndeal of sense, because it essentially says as a matter of policy we are \ngoing to always make people who are responsible for the loss share that \nloss, and never the innocent small businessman pay for the loss.\n  Senator Kerry has attempted to fashion a compromise that provides \nprotection for what I believe to be the great bulk of computer \ncompanies that are out there doing business, who have acted \nresponsibly, who can show that\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\nthey have been good corporate citizens, and when they do that, then \nthey get proportionate liability, which is what they want.\n  But there is still, I have to say, the most fundamental problem in \nthe McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill, which is the provision about economic \nlosses. Ultimately what it means is, if you can't recover anything but \nthe cost of your computer, we are giving prospective absolute immunity \nto an industry, not knowing at this point what the losses are going to \nbe for anything except the cost of the computer. It is something we \nhave never done in the history of this country. It would be a \nremarkable thing to do now.\n  I have to say in response to some remarks I heard from Senator Dodd \nearlier, whom I greatly admire and respect, that he talks at great \nlength about this being a 36-month or a 3-year loss, that there is not \nsome dramatic change in the law, that it is just 3 years.\n  Here is the problem. That 3-year period is going to cover every Y2K \nloss that occurs because of the nature of this problem. These losses \nare going to come up quickly, and they are going to occur starting in \nJanuary of the year 2000, or before. By the end of that 3-year period, \nthe problems will have shown themselves, or they will be gone, or they \nwon't exist at all.\n  When Senator Dodd says it is just a 3-year provision, it is a 3-year \nprovision that covers every single Y2K loss that is going to occur. It \ncovers them all. We just have to recognize that when he talks about \nthis being just a 3-year period of time that is being covered, that is \nwhat it is. It covers every Y2K loss that may occur.\n  The bottom line is this: I think it makes great sense to have a bill \nthat provides some reasonable protection for the computer industry. I \nthink Senator Kerry's amendment works very hard at doing that.\n  I think there are at least two huge problems with the McCain bill, \nthe most dramatic of which, to me, is that no businessman, no matter \nwhat has been done to him, whether he has been lied to, whether he has \nbeen the victim of irresponsible conduct, whatever it is, all he or she \ncan ever recover is the cost of the computer, even if he or she has \nbeen put out of business. I don't believe the American people would \nthink that is fair.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on this point, Senator Edwards is such a \nmagnificent lawyer and I am always reluctant to get into this, but the \nbottom line in this matter of economic losses is, whatever the \nplaintiff is entitled to get under State contract law with respect to \neconomic losses is what our bill does. That is just the bottom line. \nWhatever the plaintiff is entitled to under State contract law is what \nthey are going to get for economic loss--no more, no less. The bill \nkeeps the status quo.\n  I want to take a minute to go to one example. I want to take a minute \nto talk about the options available to the typical small business in \nthese kinds of cases.\n  Let's say we have a company that buys $10,000 worth of computers from \nanother company, and they all crash January 3 of 2000. They lose $1 \nmillion worth of business as a result. Obviously, they are unhappy. \nThey write the computer company and they say that crash was the fault \nof the computer company, the Y2K failure, and they want it fixed, and \nthey want their money, they want their $1 million. I want to take a \nsecond and describe what happens in those situations.\n  The computer company has to get back to the small business within 30 \ndays. It has to make it clear. You have to move. They can say it was a \nY2K failure. The computer company says, ``It is our fault. We will fix \nit the way the business wants--the restaurant. We will give you $1 \nmillion.''\n  That is that. They can say they will fix the Y2K problem, but they \nshould not be responsible for the whole $1 million. They might say, \n``We will fix it, but we have to negotiate this out. We are liable for \nsome. You are liable for some.''\n  If the small business isn't satisfied with what the computer company \ndoes, they can basically go out and sue immediately in that kind of \nsituation.\n  The third kind of example would be, the computer company just stiffs \nthe small businessperson, is completely unresponsive to what the small \nbusiness needs. In that case, the plaintiff, the small businessperson, \ncan go out and file a suit immediately against the computer company.\n  Finally, we have raised the example of what happens if that computer \ncompany is bankrupt and insolvent. At that point, the small \nbusinessperson can name in their lawsuit anybody they think is a \nresponsible party. They can name Intel; they can name Microsoft; they \ncan name anybody they want. It is at that point the jury is going to \ndecide what portion of the blame each potential defendant ought to \nbear.\n  That strikes us as sensible. That is the principle of \nproportionality. We are saying that you ought to pick up the burden of \nthe problem you actually produced, but if you did something \nintentional, if you ripped somebody off, if you engaged in egregious \nconduct, then joint and several applies.\n  If we are talking about a low net worth of a defendant, it is the \nsame sort of situation. So the plaintiff isn't left hanging.\n  As we get towards the final vote, I ask my colleagues to remember \nthat is what a typical small business is entitled to--those four kinds \nof situations, so that at the end of the day they are going to have \ntheir economic losses dealt with just as they would under State \ncontract law--no more, no less.\n  Really, we have what amounts to only a handful of real protections \nfor this 36-month period. Yes, we do say that if a small business is \noperating in good faith, we would put some limits on punitive damages. \nI guess there can be a philosophical difference of opinion on that. \nReasonable people can differ. But we think that if a small business \nacts in good faith, there ought to be some limit in terms of these \npunitive damages. There are only a handful of protections.\n\n  Again, the 30-day period is a limitation on somebody's right to sue. \nThat is why we say if you really think you are stiffed, you can go out \nand sue immediately. We think it makes sense for a 30-day period to try \nto cure these problems.\n  On the proportionality issue, we are making a change to deal with a \nsituation where we think that unless somebody engages in an egregious \noffense-type of conduct with a low net worth defendant, it is \nappropriate in this situation to say you are liable for what you \nactually produced.\n  In addition to this being a bill that lasts for a short period of \ntime, it does not apply to personal injury problems at all. If somebody \nis in an elevator and the computer system falls out and the elevator \ndrops 10 floors and somebody is badly injured, all existing tort \nremedies apply.\n  I am very hopeful we will have a significant number of our \ncolleagues, particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nsupporting this. There have been 10 major changes made in this \nlegislation since it left the Senate Commerce Committee. Our senior \nDemocrat, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, was absolutely \nright--the bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee was \ncompletely unacceptable in terms of the rights of consumers and the \nrights of plaintiffs. I joined him in opposing it.\n  Since that time, we took out the items that were unfair. A lot of \nthem happened to be in the House bill--which is completely unacceptable \nto me, as well.\n  This bill is a balanced bill. It tells defendants they have to go out \nand cure problems; it tells plaintiffs they have to go out and mitigate \ndamages. I hope our colleagues recognize that failure to pass a \nresponsible bill in this area is just like hurling a monkey wrench into \nthe technology engine that is keeping our economy humming. I hope we \nwon't do that.\n  The Senator from North Carolina asked me, before I went through that \nenlightening example of small business, to yield. I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I appreciate the work of the Senator from Oregon. We \nhave talked about this matter a good deal. I appreciate the time spent \ndoing that.\n  We do have a fundamental disagreement. My reading of Section 12 says \nthat people cannot recover economic\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nlosses. I think if you can't recover economic losses as a result of the \nnegligence or intentional acts or misrepresentations by a defendant, \nthen essentially that means all you can ever get is the cost of the \ncomputer--even if you have been put out of business.\n  I don't think anybody in America would think that is right, fair, or \njust.\n  My first question is if, in fact, all the remedies for recovery of \neconomic loss--that is lost profits, et cetera--are left in place under \nFederal and State law, why do we need a section, Section 12, on that \nmatter at all in this bill?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will let me reclaim my time, I will read \nthe precedence we are citing with respect to our opinion that our bill \ncovers economic losses in line with State law and common law.\n  Let me read to the Senator the precedent:\n\n       The prevailing common law rule is that ``recovery of \n     intangible economic losses is normally determined by contract \n     law.''\n\n  That is Prosser, 1984.\n  Accordingly, the courts have essentially allowed plaintiffs to \naddress these matters in State contract law by Clark v. Int'l Harvester \nCompany, Chrysler v. Taylor, Inglis v. American Motor Company.\n  Our position is that the economic loss rule in our bill is merely an \nexplicit recognition of this sensible principle, which is in line with \nthe legal precedence I cited, and also Prosser.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator will yield, the problem I have, if it is \ntrue that all State and Federal remedies for economic loss are left in \nplace, it seems we would need to say nothing about that in this bill. \nWe could say absolutely nothing and they would remain in place as they \nare under existing law, or we could have one sentence and that sentence \nwould say ``economic losses are permitted as presently exist under \napplicable Federal or State law.''\n  Instead, I have a 2\\1/2\\ page section on economic loss, and before it \never gets to mentioning Federal or State remedies for economic loss, it \nsets forth a long description of requirements that have to be met--\nrequirements that don't exist in any State or Federal law.\n  The reality is this bill sets up requirements that are far more \ndraconian than exist across this country. Then the amendment says if \nyou can meet all of those requirements, and the recovery of these \neconomic losses are permitted under State and Federal law, then you can \nrecover economic losses.\n  The truth of the matter is, if it were true that economic losses as \nthey presently exist in the law and as they exist across this country--\nwhich means people can recover, in my example, more than the cost of \ntheir computer; they can recover for lost profits, their overhead, and \nall the costs associated with that, things that most Americans would \nconsider completely fair, reasonable, and just--if that were true, we \ndo not need a provision about this at all. We sure do not need 2\\1/2\\ \npages about it. Or we could do it in one sentence: Existing recoveries \nfor economic losses are permitted under applicable Federal or State \nlaw.\n  Instead, we have 2\\1/2\\ pages. We have a provision that essentially \neliminates the right to recover economic losses, even in the case of \nsomeone who has had a fraudulent representations made to them about the \nproduct they are purchasing.\n\n  Can the Senator show me the specific language that simply says all \nFederal and State law remains in place, without any other requirements?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate having the chance to look at any alternative \nlanguage the Senator from North Carolina wants to pursue.\n  The Senator raised the question of whether or not plaintiffs ought to \nbe able to circumvent the provisions of State contract law by \nrepackaging suits as tort claims. That has not been allowed by the \ncourts.\n  If the Senator is talking about something else, we are happy to look \nat this. What we have in our legal analysis, and I have cited the \nspecific cases that back up our particular point, is an indication that \nwe believe we are protecting plaintiffs and plaintiffs' rights to \nrecover in line with State contract law on economic losses.\n  If the Senator is not trying to ``tortify'' contracts, I am certainly \nwilling to work with him on any kind of language.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I don't have any problem at all with the \nidea of protecting existing contracts. I think Senator Kerry's \namendment does exactly that. I think the problem we are confronted \nwith--and I have asked this question a couple of times--this 2\\1/2\\ \npages on economic loss does not say that State remedies prevail.\n  I might add, I believe your home State of Oregon allows the recovery \nof economic losses under the circumstances that I am describing where \nsomeone has acted irresponsibly. So we have a bill that will change \nlaws not only in other places around the country but in your home \nState.\n  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could reclaim my time to respond to the Senator, \nfirst, we made it very clear regarding economic losses. We want to see \npeople recover in line with their State contract law.\n  If the Senator can show me something in the 2\\1/2\\ pages that he is \nso alarmed about--he has referred to the 2\\1/2\\ pages now three or four \ntimes--if the Senator can show me something in those 2\\1/2\\ pages that \nindicates that a plaintiff could not recover through their State \ncontract law economic losses, I guarantee myself, Senator Dodd, and \nSenator McCain are interested in working with the Senator on it.\n  We cannot find anything. We have precedence and we have a legal \nanalysis that backs up our point of view. If the Senator finds \nsomething in those 2\\1/2\\ pages that the Senator thinks indicates that \na plaintiff cannot recover their economic losses according to State \ncontract law, we will be very open to seeing it.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. For just a moment, if I could just give an example of \nwhat I am referring to, let's suppose a computer has been sold by a \ncomputer company that sells a system. They have sold it to a small \nbusinessman. There is a Y2K problem and the small business is put out \nof business. They have lost millions of dollars over the course of \nseveral months. What we determine, when the investigation is done, is \nthat what caused the problem is a chip, a computer chip that was sold \nby a manufacturer with whom this purchaser never had any interaction. \nOr it was some program that was loaded onto the computer. And the \nplaintiff never had any relation with the software manufacturer. Of \ncourse they would not; they bought the computer at a computer store \nfrom some computer salesman.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, the person who was actually \nresponsible, that is the manufacturer of the computer chip or software \nthat was not Y2K compliant--you cannot recover against that responsible \nperson for economic losses under the express provisions of this \nparagraph in Section 12. In fact, the Senator and I both know in \nreality that is what is most likely to happen. What most people are \ngoing to confront when they have a Y2K problem is some very isolated, \ndiscrete part of their computer system that caused the problem. It is \nnot going to be the entire system. My point being there is no contract \nbetween the purchaser and that responsible party, that party in my \nexample who is acting irresponsibly.\n  What you are doing in this bill is you are absolutely cutting off the \nright of this innocent businessman to recover anything more than what \nhe has lost, what he has lost out of his pocket, what he has lost as a \nresult of not being able to make sales. This bill is very clear about \nthat, I say to Senator Wyden. I don't think it can be interpreted in \nany other way.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Our interpretation and our legal analysis, which I am \nhappy to give, indicates the plaintiff can recover exactly what they \nare entitled to today. They are not going to get any more.\n  I recognize what the agenda is here. I respect that we have a \ndifference of opinion. But the bottom line is--I am happy to give our \nlegal analysis--they can recover exactly what they are entitled to \ntoday.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator will yield for a moment on just a point \nfurther, the language in section 2 says ``such losses result directly \nfrom damage to tangible personal or real other property.''\n  The economic losses my colleague is skillfully referring to may be \nthe much\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nlarger losses that come from, say, the intellectual property failure.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator is talking about the tort section.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, he is referring--excuse me, yes, I am, at this point. \nBut that is a similar complication here of what the Senator is \neliminating without being aware that is, in fact, being eliminated.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time, there is a \ndifference of opinion here on the matter of economic losses. In the \n2\\1/2\\ pages the Senator from North Carolina has cited, we believe \nevery plaintiff is going to be able to recover exactly what they are \nentitled to recover today. If in fact there is some evidence to the \ncontrary, we will certainly be happy to pursue that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me yield, if I can, to Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When the Senator says ``exactly what he is entitled to \nunder the contract,'' when I go buy a computer from you, under my \ncontract I am not contracting for any economic loss or loss of \ncustomers, or wasted moneys for advertising because the business has \nclosed down, or any of the other economic losses. When the Senator says \n``exactly under State contract law,'' the contract is only for the item \nitself. State contract law is not State tort law. I take it that is the \ndifference. ``Exactly what he is entitled to,'' not under State tort \nlaw but under State contract law; isn't that the Senator's position?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could refer the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina to the specific section, I have been talking about section 11, \ncontractual damages. I gather the Senator from North Carolina, who is \ngetting us into this area, was largely talking about the tort section. \nThat, of course, is the difference of opinion here. I believe it would \nbe a mistake to try to ``tortify'' these contractual rights at this \ntime when we are staring, early in the next century, at all of these \nliabilities.\n  I have three good friends with whom I agree on probably the vast \nmajority of issues that come up in this body who see it otherwise. I \nrecognize that. But I want to, again, in the name of trying to work \nthings out, make it clear if there is anything in the contract \nsection--in the contract section--that would suggest a plaintiff cannot \nget the economic losses they are entitled to under State contract law, \nI am very certain Senator McCain and Senator Dodd and I will be happy \nto look at that. We do have a difference of opinion on this matter \ninvolving torts.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How could they be entitled to anything, any economic \nlosses under State contract law when it was not contracted for? You \nsee, you just contract to buy the item. If I go into Circuit City, or \nwhatever it is, and get the computer, I don't say: Now, wait a minute, \nif something goes wrong with this computer here 60 days from now or \nsomething else like that and my business is closed down for 90 days or \nwhatever, then I want the loss of customers, the loss of good will, and \nall these economic losses. I am only contracting for the item.\n  So when you say ``exactly what he is entitled to under State contract \nlaw,'' it is saying in the same breath he is not entitled to any \neconomic loss under tort law. Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The jurisdictions differ. But what we are trying to adhere \nto, with respect to economic losses and contracts, is the status quo. \nIf there is some evidence we can be shown indicating otherwise, we will \nbe happy to take a look at it.\n  I have taken an awful lot of time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Can I ask Senator Wyden one last question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I want to make sure we are clear about this for purposes \nof our discussion. Does my colleague now concede that for any claim \nother than under contract, that economic losses are being completely \neliminated by this bill? Does he concede that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. No. Not at all. In fact, let me again read from our legal \nanalysis:\n\n       The economic loss rule is a widely recognized legal \n     principle that has been adopted by the United States Supreme \n     Court in the vast majority of States. It states a party who \n     has suffered only economic damages must generally sue to \n     recover those damages under contract law, not under tort law. \n     Tort law generally applies only where a party has suffered \n     personal injury or damages to property other than the \n     property in dispute.\n\n  So we are having, I guess, a duel of legal analyses. But we are happy \nto share ours. We believe, again, the court precedents and the specific \nanalysis I am citing make it very clear that recovery that is available \ntoday for economic losses under State contract law is not being altered \nin any way by this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, if I can respond just very briefly, there \nare two fundamental problems I respectfully disagree with Senator Wyden \nabout. The first of those problems is he talks at great length about \nState contract law. I do not have any problem with State contract law \nbeing totally enforced. I believe the law generally ought to be \nenforced and that includes State contract law. The problem is in the \nreal world, most of the time, as Senator Hollings pointed out, to the \nextent there is any written contract that contract is drafted by the \nmanufacturers. It is not drafted by a small businessman who is buying a \ncomputer. So the Senator knows as well as I do it is a farce to say \nthere is going to be a provision in the contract that provides for \neconomic losses. It is not going to be anywhere in any contract, \nbecause the contracts have been written by teams of lawyers who drafted \nthese contracts to protect the seller. They are the people who are in \nthe position of economic power.\n  So the reality is there is not going to be anything in the written \ncontract if there is a written contract. That is one problem.\n  But there is a second problem that is even larger than that, which is \nin many cases it is not going to be the contracted-with party who is \nresponsible. The contract is between a purchaser and a seller. The \nseller is selling a computer system and the negligent or irresponsible \nparty is not the seller who has included many computer chips in his \ncomputer system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Kerry amendment is now up for 5 minutes of debate \non each side, equally divided.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I can finish this thought, the bottom line is in many \ncases--in fact, in the vast majority of cases--the computer company \nthat is responsible for putting a small businessman out of business, \nfor all the losses that the small businessman incurs is not going to \nhave a contract. In fact, the only way the person who is ultimately \nresponsible can be held accountable is through a cause of action for \nbreach of warranty or breach of product warranty and negligence, and \nthis bill eliminates the right of that small businessman to recover any \nof his losses other than the cost of the computer.\n  The result of this discussion is Senator Wyden now recognizes that, \nand with all due respect, I do not believe the American people will \nfind that fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged to both sides.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this country is facing an unusual and \nvery dangerous legal situation. I understand and appreciate the details \ngiven by the Senators as they have debated the nature of contracts and \ndamages and economic loss rule and negligence as compared to contract \nlaw. It is pretty complex.\n  Historically, we have created rules under which to file. For \ncontracts, you have burden of proof. If you file under tort, you have \nanother standard you have to prove. All of those are complex, and we \nought to be openminded to make sure we are proceeding in a way so as to \ncreate a statute that is effective and will achieve what we want.\n  It is time for us to face up to the fact that we do need some change \nin this Y2K computer problem. Our Nation is facing a real challenge. We \ncould end\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nup with massive litigation in every single county in America: lawyers \non both sides filing lawsuits arguing over how much business was lost \nin this grocery store, how much this bank lost; arguing over punitive \ndamages, standards of proof; the computer companies situated in one \nState are having to defend themselves against 50 separate State laws; \nsometimes individual judges within individual States, if they do not \nhave guidance, may rule differently than one expects them to rule.\n  Under the circumstances of this situation, as a person who does \nbelieve States ought to do those things they do best, and the Federal \nGovernment ought not to take over, when we are dealing with the \ncomputer industry--which is not only interstate but international and \nis a fundamental source of our productivity increases--that industry \ncan be sued thousands of times throughout the country, and as a result, \nthey will be weakened economically, they will be substantially less \nable to fix a problem that may occur and will spend more and more time \nwith lawyers and on litigation than they need.\n  We need to create a system which focuses on fixing the problem, and \nthat does mean changing the way we have to do business for this one \nproblem for a maximum of 3 years. This is what we need to do. We do not \nneed to allow our Nation to assault from every possible venue that \nexists in this country the computer industry, which Alan Greenspan has \nindicated is one of the primary reasons for our productivity increases \nas a nation, why our Nation is doing better than other nations, and why \nwe need to keep it that way.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Arizona has arrived. There may \nbe some time remaining. I will be glad to yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 25 seconds remains.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on all sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes; \nthe Senator from Alabama has 1 minute 24 seconds. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the course of the day, there has been \na lot of argument about what we seek to do and do not seek to do. I \nwant to make it very clear. Both sides are seeking a fair and sensible \nway to address the Y2K problem. There is no argument that one side \nwants frivolous suits, the other does not. There is no argument that \none side somehow wants to keep business from flourishing. We are all on \nthe same side of the high-tech industry and of the capacity of that \nindustry to flourish.\n  The question is, what is the fairest, most balanced way to \neffectively approach the question of how we will do that.\n  Senator Edwards from North Carolina has very effectively demonstrated \none of the real flaws in the bill as presented by the Senator from \nArizona. The economic losses will be denied in a way, particularly in a \nsituation where there is fraud or misrepresentation, that no American \ndeems to be fair.\n  Equally important, when you balance the fundamental components of \nthis bill on the question of proportional damages and who gets them and \nwhen, there is a difference between us in what we assert is the \nappropriate qualification for businesses to merit the proportional \ndamages.\n  The McCain bill automatically makes available, with a few small \nexceptions, those proportional damages to businesses without any \nfundamental mitigation requirement; that is the essence of this bill. \nOn the other hand, the proposal I submit with Senator Daschle, Senator \nReid, Senator Robb, Senator Akaka, Senator Mikulski, and others, is a \nproposal that embraces 90 days for a cure period, just as the McCain \nbill does. It embraces a responsibility to mitigate, just as the McCain \nbill does. It preserves contract law, just as the McCain bill does. But \nit also requires a good citizenship standard, an effort by companies to \ndetermine the potential--not the reality--the potential, not to find to \na certainty, but to declare the potential that they may have a Y2K \nproblem, and then in good faith to make available to the people with \nwhom they have dealt the information about that potential.\n\n  It is hard to believe the Senate would not be willing to embrace the \nnotion that companies ought to embrace the full measure of the purpose \nof this bill, which is mitigation, by making that good effort in order \nto determine what their liability may be.\n  Our bill encourages remediation. It requires notice and opportunity \nto cure. It imposes additional duty on plaintiffs when the defendant \ndoes act responsibly. It requires the plaintiff to undertake certain \nmitigation efforts which is fairly unprecedented. It discourages \nfrivolous lawsuits by encouraging alternative dispute resolution. It \nincreases the pleading requirements. None of these, incidentally, are \nthings the lawyers have asked for and none of them are things the \nlawyers like.\n  It asserts an increased materiality requirement so that the complaint \nhas to identify with specificity the basis of the complaint which they \nmake. We discourage frivolous class action lawsuits with a minimum \ninjury requirement for any class action and a materiality requirement.\n  We protect business with contract preservation, with strict \nlimitations on damages awarded for economic loss, and also, unlike the \nMcCain bill, we embrace the notion that individual consumers should not \nbe cut out from their capacity to redress their problems.\n  In the end, I believe the real issue is: Do we want to accomplish \nwhat we have set out to do, which means, will the President of the \nUnited States sign the bill? The President has made it clear the McCain \nbill will not be signed into law without the kinds of changes Senator \nEdwards and I and others have articulated.\n  So we can go through the Pyrrhic exercise or we can try to fully \nlegislate. I think it is clear that we are offering an alternative that \nis fair, sensible, protects consumers, and at the same time protects \nbusinesses in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support what will be \noffered as the bipartisan amendment to S. 96, the Y2K Act. I also rise \nto oppose Senator John Kerry's alternative to the Y2K Act.\n  The Y2K Act has gone through significant and myriad changes. In the \nspirit of constructive compromise, Senators of both parties have come \ntogether to work out their differences to produce S. 1138, the \nbipartisan Dodd-McCain - Hatch - Feinstein - Wyden - Gorton-Lieberman-\nBennett amendment. Why? Because these and other Senators realize the \nimportance of resolving a potential Y2K litigation crisis. These and \nother Senators have placed the vitality of the nation over any \nexaggerated loyalty to one political party.\n  Y2K-related lawsuits pose the greatest danger to industry's efforts \nto fix the problem. All of us are aware that the computer industry is \nfeverishly working to correct--or remediate, in industry language--Y2K \nso as to minimize any disruptions that occur early next year.\n  What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to \ndefend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not \nget spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology \nconsumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money \nbetween now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--\nwill largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and \nhardship will be.\n  Many fear that if Congress does not act, the American high tech \nindustry, a leader in the world and a significant source of our \nexports, will be severely damaged. This is particularly true for the \neconomies of cutting-edge high tech states--such as my home state of \nUtah--whose private sector is a leader in the information revolution. \nWhy retard the industry that has led the recent boom of the American \neconomy? Why kill the goose that lays the golden egg?\n  Let me restate what I have said on numerous occasions. The potential \nfinancial magnitude of the Y2K litigation problem is enormous. To \nunderstand this enormity, we should consider the estimate of Capers \nJones, Chairman of Software Productivity Research, a provider of \nsoftware measurement, assessment and estimation products and services. \nMr. Jones suggests\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\nthat ``for every dollar not spent on repairing the Year 2000 problem, \nthe anticipated costs of litigation and potential damages will probably \namount to in excess of ten dollars.'' The Gartner Group estimates that \nworldwide remediation costs will range between $300 billion to $600 \nbillion. Assuming Mr. Jones is only partially accurate in his \nprediction--the litigation costs to society will prove staggering. Even \nif we accept The Giga Information Group's more conservative estimate \nthat litigation will cost just two dollars to three dollars for every \ndollar spent fixing Y2K problems, overall litigation costs may total $1 \ntrillion.\n  Even then, according to Y2K legal expert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost \nwould greatly exceed the combined estimated legal costs associated with \nSuperfund environmental litigation . . . U.S. tort litigation. . .and \nasbestos litigation.'' Perhaps the best illustration of the sheer \ndimension of the litigation monster that Y2K may create is Mr Jinnett's \nsuggestion that a $1 trillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs \n``would exceed even the estimated total annual direct and indirect \ncosts of all civil litigation in the United States,'' which he says is \n$300 billion per year.\n  These figures should give all of us pause. At this level of cost, \nY2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the already \ncrowded court system to deal with it.\n  Looking at a rash of lawsuits--there already have been 66 Y2K \nlawsuits filed nationwide and the number is growing--we must ask \nourselves, what kind of signals are we sending to computer companies \ncurrently engaged in or contemplating massive Y2K remediation? What I \nfear industry will conclude is that remediation is a losing proposition \nand that doing nothing is no worse an option for them than correcting \nthe problem. This is exactly the wrong message we want to be sending to \nthe computer industry at this critical time.\n  I believe Congress should give companies an incentive to fix Y2K \nproblems right away, knowing that if they don't make a good-faith \neffort to do so, they will shortly face costly litigation. The natural \neconomic incentive of industry is to satisfy their customers and, thus, \nprosper in the competitive environment of the free market.\n  This acts as a strong motivation for industry to fix a Y2K problem \nbefore any dispute becomes a legal one. This will be true, however, \nonly as long as businesses are given an opportunity to do so and are \nnot forced, at the outset, to divert precious resources from the urgent \ntasks of the repair shop to the often unnecessary distractions of the \ncourt room. A business and legal environment which encourages problem-\nsolving while preserving the eventual opportunity to litigate may best \ninsure that consumers and other innocent users of Y2K defective \nproducts are protected.\n  The bipartisan compromise amendment accomplishes these ends. It is \nsignificant to note that the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Senate's \nSpecial Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, my good friends \nand respected colleagues Robert Bennett and Christopher Dodd, endorse \nthe bipartisan amendment. Both these Senators have developed great \nexpertise in Y2K and related matters during their leadership of the \nspecial committee. They were instrumental in crafting the compromise \namendment.\n  The Kerry proposal, on the other hand, is partisan. As I understand \nit, it was in part drafted with the White House. It has not been \nendorsed by one Republican. While I firmly believe that Senator Kerry \nand other Democrat Senators who crafted the amendment sincerely believe \nthat they are doing good, their amendment clearly eviscerates the \nprotections established by S. 96. It reduces the incentives created in \nthe bill for reducing litigation and resolving Y2K problems outside the \ncourt room. Let me explain.\n\n  The Kerry Amendment significantly weakens the class action section of \nS. 96. Class actions are a significant source of abuse. I have seen \nthis as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Both plantiffs and \ndefendants' attorneys have all too often been successful in rigging the \nsystem. Far too often, sweetheart deals are entered into whereby the \nplaintiff's attorneys negotiate huge fees, the defendants buy \nlitigation peace through a nation-wide class action settlement that \nacts as res judiciata and bars all, even meritorious, future \nlitigation, and class members are given mere trifles, such as coupons \nfor products that hardly can be considered just compensation.\n  Far too often, Federal jurisdiction is defeated by joining just one \nnondiverse class plaintiff--even if the overwhelming number of parties \nare from differing states. This wrecks the clear purpose of Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23--to provide for a Federal forum for class \nactions where the litigation problem is national in scope. A federal \nforum ameliorates myriad state judicial decisions that are conflicting \nin scope and onerous to enforce. Now, I am a great proponent of \nfederalism and the right of our states to act as what Justice Brandeis \ntermed national laboratories of change. But it is axiomatic that a \nnational problem needs an uniform solution. That is the justification \nfor Congress' Commerce Clause power and its consequent promulgation of \nRule 23. That is the justification for the Y2K Act itself, in which the \nY2K defect is clearly a national problem in need of a Federal answer.\n  Because of the short 2 or 3 year timespan for litigation, all of \nthese problems are magnified in the Y2K context. There already have \nbeen filed 31 Y2K class action lawsuits with all the attendant problems \nassociated with class action abuse. Before all is said and done, I \nexpect many more to be filed. S. 96 deals with the problems generated \nby class actions in two ways: first, a certification requirement to \ndemonstrate a common material defect is mandated. This assures that \nclass action joinder is available only if common questions of law and \nfact exist. Second, minimal diversity is allowed. Thus, a substantial \nnumber of parties must be from different states and joinder of one or \ntwo nondiverse parties cannot defeat Federal jurisdiction. Moreover, to \nassure that Federal courts are not saturated with class actions \nindependently filed or removed from state court, the amount in \ncontroversy must be over one million dollars.\n  To its credit, the Kerry Amendment adopts the common material defects \nshowing requirement. But it is silent as to the need for minimal \ndiversity to assure that the Federal courts will have jurisdiction over \nwhat is after all a national problem. To be sure, I am aware that the \nJudicial Conference opposes this provision fearing a substantial \nincrease in Federal class actions. But I am also aware of their \ntendency to overreact. They made no study of the issue. Their concerns \nwere mere ipse dixits, statements made as true with no foundation as to \ntheir truth.\n  To the contrary, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has made \na study of both S. 96, the bill reported out of Commerce, and S. 461, \nthe Hatch-Feinstein Y2K measure, the bill reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Both bills have nearly identical provisions.\n  Concerning the class action provisions of S. 461, CBO first \nrecognized that because of the incentives found in the bill it expects \n``that parties to lawsuits would be encouraged to reach a settlement. \nThus, we anticipate that many lawsuits would not result in trial, which \ncan be [time-consuming] and expensive.'' CBO went on and noted that \n``some class action lawsuits could be shifted from state to federal \ncourt under S. 461 because the bill would ease restrictions for filing \nsuch actions in Federal court.'' What is important, however, is their \nultimate conclusion: ``On balance, CBO estimates that the savings from \neliminating trials for many lawsuits would more than offset any \nincreased costs that might be incurred from trying additional class \naction lawsuits in federal court.'' (My emphasis). In other words, in \nthe only study done of the class action issue, it is concluded that the \nY2K Act's class action provision would not result in the flooding of \nthe federal courts with unneeded and expensive litigation.\n  A provision of S. 96 that the Kerry Amendment actually strikes is the \npunitive damages limitation provision. Now both S. 96 and S. 461 \ncontained caps on punitive damage awards. The caps applied to all \nprevailing parties and limited punitive damages to the greater of three \ntimes compensatory damages or $250,000, or the lesser of that amount if \na small business was\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nthe defendant. The reason for these caps are clear. Runaway punitive \ndamages have hindered economic growth and productivity nationwide. \nBusinesses are often forced to settle spurious suits when faced with \nmillions in punitive damages. Thus, prices for goods and services are \nunnecessarily raised with consumers suffering the most. Because of the \nconcentrated time period, this problem will be magnified for Y2K \nactions.\n  The bipartisan Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein amendment modifies the \npunitive damage provision. In the spirit of compromise, the caps were \nlimited to small business and individuals with a net worth of less than \n$500,000. There were two reasons for this change. The first is that \nsmall businesses and most individuals would be ruined by immense \npunitive dmamages. The other reason is that punitive damages in this \nsituation do not serve the intended deterrent effect. In fact, \ninsolvency and bankruptcy creates a counterincentive to remediate Y2K \nglitches. Why would a small business voluntarily notify customers of \npotential Y2K defects if the business could face ruin for its good \ncitizenship?\n  But Senator Kerry even opposes this watered down provision. The \nreason for Senator Kerry's opposition for even this moderate provsion \nis that even caps for small business would allegedly reduce the \ndeterrent effect of those damages. Surely, however, the prospect of \ntreble damages provides adequate incentives for companies that need \nmonetary threats to make efforts at compliance. The current, unlimited \npunitive regime simply encourages suits by lawyers who hope to hit the \nlottery, while driving up the settlement value of insubstantial claims.\n  Let me turn to the proportionate liability section of S. 96. It is \ngood to see that Senator Kerry has moved closer to our position. Prior \ndrafts of his amendment completely weakened this provision. Senator \nKerry's latest attempt in most respects is verbatim the same as the \nbipartisan amendment.\n\n  The system of modified proportionate liability in S. 96 makes sense \nas a matter of both equity and of litigation management. Based on the \nalready existing proportionate liability provision of the Federal \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, it ensures that \ndefendants will not be forced to pay for injuries that are not their \nfault. It discourages specious lawsuits because plaintiffs' lawyers \nwill not be able to take advantage of the archaic joint and several \nliability doctrine whereby a deep-pocket defendant will inevitably have \nto pay the entire judgment so long as a jury can be persuaded to find \nit is even one percent responsible. And the proportionate lability \nsection will avoid coercive settlements prevalent in a joint and \nseveral liability scheme.\n  The Kerry provision essentially adopts the proposal in S. 96, which \nrecognizes that it is unfair to assume that defendants should be forced \nto pay for damages that are not their fault. But the Kerry draft also \neliminates proportionate liability if the defendant fails to inform the \nplaintiff of a potential Y2K problem before December 31, 1999. This is \ntrue even if the defendant business demonstrates that it was innocent, \nor had no knowledge of the defect. Suppose a retailer, having no reason \nto believe the manufactured product sold was defective, could not and \ndid not notify the purchaser of the Y2K defect. In that case the \nretailer would be subject to joint and several liability under Kerry. \nThe result is that deep-pocketed defendants who are subject to strike \nsuits will have to assume that they face limitless liability, and, \ntherefore, will have no choice but to pay a coercive settlement, even \nif the defendant was innocent of any knowledge of the defect.\n  The Kerry Amendment duty to mitigate requirement has been so limited \nthat it will not encourage remediation. The amendment provides that \nplaintiffs cannot recover damages for injuries that they could have \nreasonably avoided in light of information provided to the plaintiff by \nthe defendant. It does not impose such a limit if the plaintiff \nobtained the relevant information from third parties or other sources. \nThe provision in the Kerry Amendment is much more narrow than the \ngeneral common law of the duty to mitigate. If the plaintiff in fact \nobtained information from any source that would have allowed it to \navoid injury, it makes no sense to allow the plaintiff to ignore that \ninformation, to suffer the injury, and then to force someone else to \npay its damages.\n  There is another significant problem with the Kerry Amendment. The \namendment eliminates all intentional torts--except where the tort \ninvolves fraud or misrepresentation about the product--from the scope \nof S. 96's codification of the Economic Loss Rule, regardless of the \nrelationship between the parties. This exemption would significantly \nnarrow existing law in many states and undermine the purpose of the \nRule in cases involving two contracting parties.\n  Breach of contract, intentional or otherwise, does not generally give \nrise to a tort claim; it is simply breach of contract. The Economic \nLoss Rule thus prevents tort remedies--such as lost profits and other \neconomic losses--where the parties were in privity and could have \nnegotiated consequential damages and other economic losses. The rapidly \nemerging trend, therefore, among the States is to apply the Economic \nLoss Rule to bar fraud claims where those claims merely restate claims \nfor breach of contract. The Rule does not, however, bar fraud claims \narising independent of a contract. Additionally, the Kerry Amendment \nwould significantly override State law and allow recovery of economic \nloss in cases of intentional torts even where such recovery would be \nprohibited by State law. This seems to create a new cause of action for \nrecovery of economic loss in cases of intentional torts and is \nunacceptable. The Kerry Amendment also would apply the Economic Loss \nRule to only actual defects and not anticipated failures. Thus many \nlawsuits based on anticipated failures would not fall under the \nEconomic Loss Rule.\n  Finally, the Kerry Amendment carve-out for noncommercial suits will \npermit a huge range of abusive actions. Carving out noncommercial \nsuits--including class actions--will permit a huge range of abusive \nactions. Abusive class actions on behalf of consumers are one of the \ngreatest dangers in the Y2K area because such suits are easily created \nand controlled by plaintiffs' lawyers. While the Kerry Amendment does \napply the minimum injury certification requirement to individual class \nactions, it does not apply to the proportionate liability and other \nsubstantive provisions in such cases. Besides, why should not consumers \nget the benefit of the bill's terms, which will speed remediation and \nnegate the need for costly lawsuits, as CBO opined.\n  It is clear that the Kerry Amendment has serious flaws. I sincerely \nbelieve that Senator Kerry and the sponsors of his amendment are well-\nmeaning. Their goals are in harmony with ours. But they are mistaken if \nthey believe that their proposal would solve the Y2K problem. That is \nwhy I ask all Senators to support S. 96, as modified by S. 1138, the \nDodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the Senate considers S. 96, the Y2K Act, \nI rise to first praise the bipartisan work of Senator McCain and \nSenator Wyden. They have worked tirelessly to construct an effective, \nfair bill that will address the important issue of liability as it \nrelates to the Year 2000--or Y2K. There are enough challenges for \nAmerica's industry and governments to ensure that they are Y2K \ncompliant. We all know how vexing computer problems can be.\n  This bill is constructive, positive legislation. It allows companies \nin the information technology industry to focus their limited resources \non solving Y2K related problems in computer software by preventing \nfrivolous litigation. Litigation which would divert those limited \nresources away from solving Y2K programming deficiencies.\n  With only 205 days left until the globe turns the page on the \ncalendar to a new century and a new millennium, the Y2K problem is a \ncrucial matter and must be fixed.\n  Lawsuits are already being filed regarding the Y2K problem, and \nCongress must act now to ensure that frivolous suits are prevented. Our \nlegal system allows those who have indeed suffered because of the fault \nof another party to have their grievances adjudicated in court. This \nbill protects that process. This bill allows plaintiffs to bring suit\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nfor Y2K related problems if these problems are not addressed. This \nbill, however, prevents and places limits on opportunistic and \nunwarranted suits.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Wyden have worked closely together to \naddress this relevant matter, and I congratulate them for their \nefforts. Their approach has gained support from a substantial number of \nour colleagues--from both sides of the aisle.\n  I would also like to recognize the efforts of Senator Hatch and the \nJudiciary Committee. They too have brought additional attention and \nclarity to the issue of Y2K liability problems. Senator Bennett and the \nSpecial Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem have also been \ninvaluable in educating the Senate. Although his task force does not \nhave legislative authority, he has explored all facets of the public \npolicy dilemma. The Special Committee has continued to investigate this \nmatter and provide education on preparations for the new century.\n  Yes, there were three separate efforts from three different vantage \npoints to ensure that the Senate gets to a solution rapidly. The \nparticipating Senators have brought expertise and legitimate concerns \nfrom their various roles and responsibilities within the Senate. All of \nour colleagues will benefit from their collective efforts.\n  I am delighted that, without further delay, the full Senate can now \nbegin consideration of S. 96--the result of the diligent efforts of \nmany. I am proud to be a cosponsor and urge all Senators to support a \nsolution that ensures America's continued prosperity.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I remind my colleagues of a letter that has already been \nmade a part of the Record from the Year 2000 Coalition, which has more \norganizations and groups in it probably than I have ever seen--the \nentire high-tech community--addressed to Senator Kerry:\n  ``We urge you to support S. 96 and to not introduce an amendment to \nit.''\n  ``[T]he Coalition does not support the amendment . . . that is being \ncirculated in your name.''\n  Have no doubt about where the high-tech community is on this \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes for the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Let me just again state to my colleagues, this is a 3-year bill. We \nare not changing tort law for all time. We are not even changing tort \nlaw. This is narrow in scope. It affects just Y2K issues for a limited \nduration to try to resolve the Y2K issues.\n  Let me say to my friend from Massachusetts, again, I respect what his \nintentions may be, but the adoption of the Kerry amendment expands, \nrather than contracts, the area of law we are trying to deal with here.\n  My colleague from Oregon has stated it well. You cannot, because you \ndo not like the contract, all of a sudden decide you want to get into \ntorts. I appreciate a plaintiff's lawyer wanting to do that, but we \nought to be trying to fix these problems, not litigate these problems. \nThat is what the McCain bill is designed to do.\n  My fervent hope is my colleagues will understand the fundamental \ndifference and support the underlying legislation and not allow this \nbill to be destroyed, in effect, by adopting a measure here that would \ncreate more litigation, more problems, make it far more difficult for \nAmericans who are going to be afflicted by this problem with the Y2K \nissue. With all due respect to its authors, I urge the rejection of the \namendment and the support of the underlying McCain bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). All time has expired. \nThe question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 610. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy \nnow be recognized to offer an amendment with debate limited to 30 \nminutes equally divided, and following that debate the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Leahy amendment with no amendments in order \nprior to the vote.\n  Before I finish this unanimous consent request, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I do not intend to use the full 15 minutes on this side. I \nthink my colleagues can anticipate a time for a pretty rapid vote by \nthe time Senator Leahy is finished.\n  Finally, I ask my colleagues who have amendments on the list of 12 \namendments to agree to time agreements, so perhaps we could dispense \nwith this bill tomorrow at an early moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask my time not begin until the Senate is \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 611 To Amendment No. 608\n\n (Purpose: To exclude consumers from the Act's restrictions on seeking \n         redress for the harm caused by Y2K computer failures)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 611.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 611 to amendment No. 608.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . EXCLUSION FOR CONSUMERS.\n\n       (a) Consumer Actions.--This Act does not apply to any Y2K \n     action brought by a consumer.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Consumer.--The term ``consumer'' means an individual \n     who acquires a consumer product for purposes other than \n     resale.\n       (2) Consumer product.--The term ``consumer product'' means \n     any personal property or service which is normally used for \n     personal, family, or household purposes.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill as presently drafted would \npreempt the consumer protection laws of each of the 50 states and \nrestrict the legal rights of consumers who are harmed by Y2K computer \nfailures.\n  Why is this bill creating new protections for large corporations \nwhile taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen?\n  We all know that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge \nor bargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more \nresources. Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in \nthe products that they buy for personal, family or household purposes.\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\n  Consumers just go to the local store downtown or in the neighborhood \nmall to buy a home computer or the latest software package. They expect \ntheir new purchase to work. But what if it does not work because of a \nY2K problem?\n  Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home \nstate's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or \nother justice.\n  The liability limits in S. 96 would protect companies whose acts or \nomissions result in harm to consumers' products or services--even if \nthose companies manufactured or sold products that they knew would fail \nwhen the date changes to the Year 2000.\n  Is that fair?\n  Let me give you a real life example of how an ordinary person might \nbe harmed by this bill. In 1999, Joe Consumer buys a computer program \nand on the package is the claim: ``This software is guaranteed to serve \nyou well for years to come.'' But in the fine print in the shrink wrap \nthat comes with the software is a disclaimer of all warranties, either \nexpress or implied.\n  Joe Consumer's software package, that he brought in 1999, is not Y2K \ncompliant. He calls and writes the software company to get it fixed but \nall he gets in response is a form letter telling him to buy the latest \nupgrade.\n  Under this bill, Joe Consumer would have to wait 90 days for his day \nin court and might not have a remedy at all.\n  Joe Consumer would normally be able to pursue justice based on a \nfailure of the implied warranty of marketability of the software \nbecause it was not Y2K compliant. Or he would normally be able to \npursue justice under his state consumer protection laws. And he \nnormally would be able to pursue justice with other consumers harmed by \nthis Y2K defective software on a fairer and more efficient class-action \nbasis. But not under S. 96.\n  This bill says that the written contract prevails, even if it limits \nor excludes warranties. Enforceable written contracts under this bill \nwould include the fine-print, boiler-plate language that is standard in \nthe packaging of computer hardware or software.\n  A consumer does not have any power to negotiate this fine print, \nboiler-plate, shrink-wrap. This shrink wrap is all one sided in favor \nof the computer manufacturer. In fact, in some cases, computer \nmanufacturers even try to take away the right of a consumer to go to \ncourt in the fine print of their shrink wrap. In addition, this bill \nwould override the Uniform Commercial Code and all state laws that \nprotect consumers by making certain warranty disclaimers unenforceable. \nThe consumer protections in the U.C.C. and state law protect individual \nconsumers from having unfair terms imposed on them by manufacturers of \nproducts with far greater economic power.\n  But this bill makes all state consumer protection laws null and void \nagainst the fine print terms of any computer manufacturer's shrink \nwrap. Maybe we should rename this bill, the ``Y2K Shrink Wrap \nProtection Act.''\n  Moreover, S. 96 would severely restrict the use of class actions by \nconsumers even when common questions of fact and law predominate in \ntheir cases and the class action would be a fair and efficient method \nto resolving their dispute. The use of class actions in state courts \npermit consumers to band together to seek justice in ways that an \nindividual could not afford to take on alone. These state laws were \nenacted to protect the average consumer.\n  But these basic consumer protections would be eliminated under this \nbill's Federal peremption provisions.\n  And no new Federal rights for consumers would replace these lost \nstate consumer protections under this bill. That is not right.\n  My amendment uses the same consumer exclusion language in last year's \nHatch-Leahy Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. My \namendment contains the same definition of consumer and consumer product \nthat was in that consensus measure, which passed the full Senate by a \nunanimous vote and was signed into law about seven months ago. Our bill \nbecome law because it was balanced, in sharp contrast to S. 96 as \ncurrently drafted.\n  I would hope the full Senate could agree to this amendment since it \nuses the same language that we agreed to last year on the Y2K \ninformation sharing law.\n  Last year, when we passed Y2K legislation to encourage remediation \nefforts, we clearly let stand existing consumer protections under state \nlaw. This same policy should apply to the pending legislation, which \ncurrently proposes to limit a consumer's legal rights even in cases \ninvolving fraud or other intentional misbehavior by product \nmanufacturers or sellers.\n  In fact, the precedent for using last year's Year 2000 Information \nand Readiness Disclosure Act as a model for S. 96 have already been \nset. S. 96 includes an exclusion for governments acting in a \nregulatory, supervisory or enforcement capacity. The exact language in \nthe bill was lifted from the Y2K information disclosure law of last \nyear. I believe this government exception make sense, particularly for \nSEC enforcement actions, and improves the underlying bill.\n  Moreover, section 13(d) of S. 96 also explicitly provides that the \nprotections for sharing information in our Y2K law shall apply to this \nbill.\n  If the protections for businesses from last year's Y2K information \ndisclosure law are good enough for this bill, then the exclusion from \nlast year's Y2K law for consumers should also be good enough for this \nbill. Last year's Y2K information disclosure law was a balanced measure \nin part because it protected consumers from its provisions. Adding the \nsame consumer carve out by adopting my amendment would give balance to \nthis one-sided bill.\n  Passing this amendment would improve the chances of S. 96 actually \nbeing signed into law by the President, instead of being vetoed as a \nbill that protects special interests at the expense of the average \nconsumer. My amendment is supported by consumer rights associations \nincluding Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Consumers Federation of \nAmerica, and the United States Public Interest Research Group. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from these consumer advocates in \nsupport of the Leahy amendment be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, allowing consumers access to their home \nstate consumer protection laws is the right thing to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Consumer Federation of \n           America, U.S. PIRG,\n                                                     June 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: As the full Senate prepares to consider S. \n     96, The McCain-Wyden-Dodd legislation limiting the liability \n     of companies responsible for Y2K computer processing \n     failures, the undersigned consumer groups remain concerned \n     about the negative effects this legislation will have on \n     consumers with legitimate Y2K claims. While we would support \n     legislation to provide incentives to companies to evaluate \n     and address Y2K problems and product defects, we believe that \n     S. 96 will have the opposite consequences.\n       Insulating companies from Y2K liability will only serve to \n     protect those who have done the least to address their \n     problems and will render consumers far more vulnerable as a \n     result. We ask that you support the Leahy amendment, which \n     would exempt consumer cases from this legislation. Most \n     experts expect Y2K litigation to be brought primarily by \n     businesses against other businesses. These litigants will \n     have contracts with one another that have been drafted to \n     protect their individual interests. Consumers will not have \n     benefit of these protections in the marketplace.\n       In addition, there is federal precedent for a consumer \n     carve-out in Y2K legislation. The language of the Leahy \n     amendment is the same language that appears in the law passed \n     last year, the Y2K Readiness and disclosure Act. Among the \n     provisions of S. 96 that are most harmful to consumers:\n       Elimination of Joint and Several Liability. The sweeping \n     change in this longstanding tort concept will likely leave \n     consumers uncompensated for damages if one or more defendants \n     cannot be held liable for the full amount of loss suffered. \n     The two narrow exceptions to this provision will be of little \n     benefit to most plaintiffs, and many could be left without \n     full compensation, even for their economic losses.\n       Class Actions Removed to Federal Court. Any class action \n     with aggregated damages of $1 million or more could be \n     removed to federal court, where cases are likely to face a \n     large backlog of cases and thus long delays and additional \n     expense. S. 96 also requires notification by return mail to \n     each potential plaintiff in a class action, a provision that \n     may well make bringing these cases financially and \n     practically impossible--leaving class members without a \n     remedy.\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\n       Caps on Punitive Damages. S. 96 caps punitive damage at \n     $250,000 or three times compensatory damages, whichever is \n     less, for defendants with a net worth less than $500,000 or \n     businesses with fewer than 50 employees, unless plaintiffs \n     can prove the defendant specifically intended to injure them. \n     Caps on punitive damages send the wrong signals to the most \n     irresponsible companies, acting as a disincentive to fix \n     problems before they occur.\n       Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. In most states, products \n     are warranted to be fit for the purpose for which they are \n     sold. Under S. 96, warranty disclaimers on the packaging or \n     software--the fine print that consumers rarely read--may keep \n     consumers from recovering for defective products and the \n     losses they cause, unless they are proven to manifestly \n     contradict state law, a difficult standard to meet.\n       For these reasons, we ask you to support Senator Leahy's \n     consumer protection/consumer carve-out amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Examples of How Senate Y2K Liability Bill is Unfair to Consumers\n\n       The examples below demonstrate the ways in which S. 96 \n     would make it difficult, if not impossible, for consumers \n     with legitimate claims to get full compensation from \n     responsible parties. This legislation will have a direct \n     effect on consumers and will likely result in many consumers \n     being left without a remedy for Y2K problems.\n\n\n                 the case of the non-compliant software\n\n       In 1998, Mrs. Betty Barnes purchases a new home computer, \n     paying an extra $500 for special software that will allow her \n     to pay her bills and manage her household finances using the \n     system. One year later, Mrs. Barnes finds that the software \n     is not Y2K compliant and will not work after the Year 2000. \n     She calls the store where she bought the software to get a \n     version of the software that will work. The store tells her a \n     ``patch'' to correct the problem is available but will cost \n     an additional $250. Mrs. Barnes then writes to the software \n     manufacturer asking for a fix for the defective program. The \n     manufacturer writes back within 30 days telling her that she \n     will have to pay $250 for the Y2K compliant version of the \n     program.\n       Under the bill, Mrs. Barnes must wait an additional 60 days \n     before she can bring any legal action against the software \n     manufacturer. The manufacturer has met its obligation by \n     responding to the letter even though the company did not \n     agree to fix the problem for a reasonable price. Mrs. Barnes \n     has no right to a free fix or a reasonably priced upgrade \n     under S. 96. She must wait 60 days even if the manufacturer \n     has proposed an unfair solution to the problem. Mrs. Barnes \n     has no bargaining power to force the manufacturer to offer a \n     more fair solution.\n       S. 96 does have an exception to the 60-day waiting period: \n     Mrs. Barnes can sue for injunctive relief. She speaks to a \n     lawyer and finds out this will not help her in her case. \n     Injunctive relief is difficult to obtain; it requires proof \n     of (1) irreparable injury if the problem is not dealt with \n     immediately, (2) a strong likelihood of winning on the merits \n     and (3) no adequate remedy at law. Mrs. Barnes is unlikely to \n     be able to prove irreparable injury. Even if she could, her \n     likelihood of prevailing on the merits is diminished by the \n     federal law that makes it harder for plaintiffs in Y2K cases \n     to win. (She could show that she has no adequate remedy at \n     law because she cannot sue at this stage.)\n       Mrs. Barnes is forced to wait for two months before she can \n     file suit. During this time, she is unable to use the \n     software for which she paid $500.00--she can't balance her \n     checkbook, she can't pay her insurance or mortgage, she can't \n     do her taxes.\n       After the 60-day period expires, Mrs. Barnes lawyer files \n     suit against the software manufacturer. under S. 96, she has \n     to plead her case with specificity, even though she knows \n     little at this point about her case except that her software \n     isn't Y2K compliant and she has been barred from conducting \n     any discovery while the 60 day period ran out. The \n     manufacturer moves to dismiss the case, arguing that S. 96 \n     protects them from Mrs. Barnes' suit. The software package \n     has a disclaimer that says, in fine print, ``there are no \n     warranties, express or implied, that apply to the sale of \n     this product.'' Under S. 96, the terms of a contract--\n     including a warranty--prevail over any consumer protection \n     statutes in state law unless the language in the contract is \n     deemed to ``manifest and directly'' contradict state law. The \n     software company argues that the state law that disfavors \n     this kind of disclaimer does not ``manifestly and directly'' \n     contradict state law. Since this is an issue of first \n     impression, each side must present legal arguments on this \n     issue, adding much cost and delay to the suit. If Mrs. Barnes \n     loses, she will have no legal recourse, even if the \n     manufacturer knowingly sold her defective software.\n       Luckily, Mrs. Barnes survives the motion to dismiss. She \n     and her lawyer now have the chance to conduct discovery. They \n     learn that there are a number of companies involved \n     in manufacturing of her particular software, and they move \n     to add them as defendants. The companies based in the \n     United States claim little or no responsibility for the \n     Y2K failure. They all point to a Japanese software maker \n     as the source of the problem. Mrs. Barnes can't sue the \n     Japanese software maker since it does not do business in \n     the U.S. If the jury finds that the Japanese company is \n     the defendant most at fault, S. 96's limitations on joint \n     and several liability will mean Mrs. Barnes can never \n     recover fully for her damages.\n       Without evidence of specific intent to injure nor knowing \n     commission of fraud, as required under S. 96, Mrs. Barnes \n     cannot hold all defendants jointly and severally liable. Mrs. \n     Barnes learns that the U.S. manufacturer recklessly placed \n     this software on the market without bothering to check that \n     is was Y2K compliant. But ``reckless conduct'' isn't enough \n     under S. 96 to allow the court to hold the U.S. manufacturer \n     liable for the entire injury, even though the injury could \n     not have occurred without its participation. Since Mrs. \n     Barnes damages are not equal to 10% of her net worth as \n     required under S. 96, she is not eligible to use that \n     provision to bring the case for an ``uncollectible'' share. \n     Mrs. Barnes can get only that percentage the jury says the \n     U.S. manufacturer is responsible for causing.\n       If the Japanese company is judgment-proof, the U.S. \n     manufacturer could be responsible for up to 50% more of its \n     initial share. If the jury finds the U.S. manufacturer was \n     20% liable and the Japanese company was 80% liable, and Mrs. \n     Barnes can't collect from the Japanese company, the U.S. \n     manufacturer is responsible for 50% more than its original \n     share, a total of 30%. Mrs. Barnes can never recover the \n     other 70% damages she is owned.\n\n\n                 the case of the consumer class action\n\n       S. 96 provisions on class actions will result in \n     meritorious cases being dismissed, leaving consumers with no \n     practical means for collecting damages.\n       Assume the same facts as above, but this time Mrs. Barnes \n     learns that a number of other consumers have bought the same \n     software and are having the same problems. Together they file \n     a class action suit in Mrs. Barnes' home state against the \n     manufacturer. They are able to meet the material defect \n     requirement imposed on those filing class actions as well as \n     the heightened pleading standards. The manufacturer, noting \n     that there are plaintiffs from a number of different states, \n     under the rules of S. 96 would be entitled to file a motion \n     to remove the case to federal court. The federal court, \n     required to resolve differences between and among state laws, \n     decides there are not enough common issues of law among the \n     various state laws, and the class action is returned to the \n     state. The class is disbanded there. While individuals are \n     free to bring suit on their own, each case is for such small \n     monetary value, few consumers or lawyers are interested or \n     willing to pursue the case individually. Mrs. Barnes can't \n     find a lawyer to take her case and she is left without a \n     remedy.\n\n\n                   the case of the chemical disaster\n\n       Mrs. Jacqueline Jensen owns a home several streets away \n     from the Acme Chemical Company. Like 85 million other \n     Americans, she lives and works within 5 miles of the one or \n     more of the nation's 66,000 facilities that handle or store \n     high hazard chemicals.\n       On January 1, 2000 Acme's safety system fails and hazardous \n     chemicals are released into the air and onto the land in the \n     neighborhoods, forcing Mrs. Jensen and others to evacuate \n     their homes. People are allowed back to their homes after 2 \n     days, but Mrs. Jensen's property is contaminated, including \n     her well. Mrs. Jensen retains an attorney and files a tort \n     claim to recover for the damage to her property.\n       Acme Chemical claims that a Y2K computer failure was \n     partially at fault for the safety system malfunction. Mrs. \n     Jensen did not know Y2K was a defense, so she and her lawyer \n     did not look up the new statute or file a per-litigation \n     notice before filing suit. Under S. 96, Acme treats \n     the complaint as the notice, even though it does not \n     contain all of the required information because Mrs. \n     Jensen and her lawyer initially had no idea this was a Y2K \n     case and there was a new law to follow in addition to the \n     requirements of filing a civil suit under state law.\n       Under S. 96, even when consumers' homes and surrounding \n     properly is contaminated, they cannot file suit right away, \n     even though they aren't waiting for a computer malfunction to \n     be fixed. The waiting period applies to all cases, even those \n     where it is not relevant. Mrs. Jensen must wait 30 days for \n     Acme to respond to her notice/complaint. In 30 days Acme \n     responds by saying it cannot pay for the cleanup and lost \n     value of Mrs. Jensen's home. Nonetheless, Mrs. Jensen still \n     must wait an additional 60 days to refile her lawsuit. S. 96 \n     only requires defendants to state what steps, if any, they \n     will take within 60 days for the additional waiting period to \n     commence. All discovery is stayed during this period, so Mrs. \n     Jensen and her attorney have no way to gather additional \n     information about the events surrounding the chemical spill.\n       In two months, Mrs. Jensen refiles her suits against Acme \n     and Safety Systems, Inc., the company that installed its \n     computers. Under S. 96, she must plead her case with \n     particularity in the complaint. While she can state her \n     damages as required, she has difficulty specifying the \n     material defect that caused the accident and specific \n     evidence of the defendants' state of mind since she has still \n     not been able to do discovery in the case. The defendants \n     move to dismiss the complaint for failure to meet the \n     pleading requirements. After briefs back and forth debating \n     what the new law requires, the judge does dismiss the case \n     but without prejudice, allowing Mrs. Jensen an opportunity to \n     file an amended complaint (now her third).\n       Somehow, Mrs. Jensen finds enough information to survive \n     another motion to dismiss\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n     and finally has her day in court. After hearing the case, the \n     jury finds that both defendants acted recklessly and \n     outrageously for not identifying and fixing the Y2K problems \n     at the plant, and awards Mrs. Jensen $300,000 to compensate \n     her for her property damages and the need to replace her \n     water supply. The jury finds that Acme is 70 percent \n     responsible and Safety Systems 30% liable. The jury also \n     finds by clear and convincing evidence that Acme's conduct is \n     so outrageous as to warrant punitive damages and assesses a \n     one million-dollar punitive damage award. The jury also finds \n     substantial evidence that Safety Systems knew the system it \n     installed might not work and that it should have fixed the \n     Y2K problem, which is enough for them to be assessed punitive \n     damages under state law, but Mrs. Jensen could not make that \n     showing by clear and convincing evidence as required by S. \n     96.\n       Under S. 96, a consumer who suffers harm limited in amount \n     of punitive damages she can collect. The total amount of Mrs. \n     Jensen's award from the jury is $1.3 million dollars--\n     $1,210,000 against Acme ($210,000 compensatory and $1,000,000 \n     punitive) and $90,000 against Safety Systems. Acme employes \n     40 people, so the punitive damages awarded against them is \n     reduced by the judge according to the cap under S. 96 to \n     $250,000. The adjusted award is now $550,000 against Acme and \n     Safety Systems.\n       Acme cannot pay for all of the damage caused by the \n     accicent to Mrs. Jensen and her neighbors and files for \n     bankruptcy. Safety Systems pays Jensen $90,000, but this is \n     not nearly enough to let her clean up her property and get a \n     new water supply--especially after she pays her legal costs. \n     She tries to collect from Acme, but without success. After 3 \n     months, she applies to the court to require Safety Systems to \n     pay the rest of the compensatory damage award. Under state \n     law, they could be required to pay the full amount, but under \n     S. 96, the maximum they would have to pay is 30% of the \n     uncollectible share but no more than 50% over Safety Systems' \n     own contribution. Under this formula, Mrs. Jensen is able to \n     collect an additional $45,000 from Safety Systems, leaving \n     her with a actual unrecoverable damages to her property--i.e. \n     direct economic loss--of $165,000 exclusive of legal fees and \n     costs.\n       Although the jury found that Safety Systems acted \n     recklessly, they do not have to pay the full amount of the \n     compensatory award--even if they could afford to do so.\n       Under her state's law, Mrs. Jensen would have received \n     $1,300,000, that is, full compensation for her losses from \n     the responsible parties. Because of S. 96, Mrs. Jensen will \n     be left with only $135,000, not nearly enough to compensate \n     for her loss and pay her legal fees and costs.\n\n\n               the case of the disclosed medical records\n\n       Mrs. Sally Sargent lives in a small town. Her physician is \n     treating her for HIV. She has been seen at the local hospital \n     during bouts of pneumonia, but more recently has been on \n     drugs that have improved her overall health and enabled her \n     to work. Her biggest fear is that her employer will learn of \n     her HIV status, which will surely mean the loss of her job in \n     a rather straight-laced company and that her children will be \n     ostracized at school. She has been assured by the hospital \n     that all of her records will be kept confidential.\n       The hospital records department ignored its potential Y2K \n     problem, though they were warned by hospital administrators \n     to check the record system for Y2K bugs. As a result, the \n     hospital's computer records are mistakenly distributed to \n     abroad group of hospital personnel. One of those hospital \n     employees has a child who attends school with Mrs. Sargent's \n     daughter. This mother becomes very agitated, calls the school \n     with the information, and before long the rumor about Mrs. \n     Sargent's medical condition gets around to the whole \n     community. Mrs. Sargent's daughter is ostracized from her \n     classmates, and she herself suffers great emotional distress. \n     When her employer discovers she has HIV, she is fired from \n     her job.\n       Under S. 96, her emotional distress and mental suffering \n     claim is not exempted from the bill, as are personal injury \n     cases involving physical injuries. Failing to exempt cases \n     brought for emotional distress and mental suffering, if they \n     happen to occur unaccompanied by physical injury, is grossly \n     unfair to individuals who have suffered real harm. In this \n     case, Mrs. Sargent would have to meet all of the procedural \n     hurdles and substantive legal limitations if she tried to sue \n     the hospital for negligent or intentional infliction of \n     emotional distress and her lost wages and related damages.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment, for all intents and \npurposes, will emasculate the bill. It will deny consumers, those least \nable to pay for attorneys, to hire attorneys to solve any Y2K problems, \nthe average consumer the ability to resolve a problem quickly, within a \nmaximum of 90 days, without litigation.\n  It also allows more of the Tom Johnson-type lawsuits: No requirement \nthat there be an actual injury, no requirement that there be a real \nproblem. This would negate the attempt by S. 96 to limit frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand the distinguished Democratic leader desires \nto speak, so I will hold the floor for a moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator want an up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Please.\n  So colleagues will understand, in last year's Y2K bill which this \nSenate passed unanimously, which the President signed into law, we had \nbasic consumer protections and business protections. In this bill, we \nbring forward business protections but we don't bring forward the \nconsumer protections we passed last year.\n  Let's be consistent; let's make sure we give consumers at least as \nmuch protection as we give businesses. That is what I am asking for and \nall I am asking for in the Leahy amendment. I also say if it passes, it \nimproves the chance of this actually being signed into law.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont. I \napplaud the Senator for his amendment.\n\n\n                   12,000th Vote for Senator Stevens\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Today, I call the attention of all my colleagues to a \nvery important and historic achievement by one of the Senate's most \nremarkable Members. With this vote, Ted Stevens will cast his 12,000th \nvote in his career.\n  It is certainly fitting that Senator Stevens represents Alaska in the \nUnited States Senate. He has lived in that great state and worked for \nits residents since before it was a state. In fact, as Solicitor of the \nDepartment of the Interior, Ted was instrumental in setting the \ngroundwork for Alaska's admission to the Union in 1959.\n  In 1964, Ted was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. Two \nyears later, his colleagues elected him House Majority Leader, an honor \nthat surprises none of us who have first hand knowledge of Ted's \nlegendary tenacity, legislative acumen and dedication to his \nconstituents.\n  Senator Stevens brought that determination and skill to the Senate in \n1968. I'm sure that every Senator has his or her own anecdote to \ndocument Ted's dedication and effectiveness as a legislator.\n  Ted once declared that his constituents ``sent me here to stand up \nfor the state of Alaska.'' No one who served with Ted over the past \nthirty years can doubt his commitment to do just that.\n  In fact, some surely wonder at times if he isn't more of an \nambassador than a Senator.\n  Ted has endeavored to ensure that promises made to Alaska under the \nStatehood Act are kept. He helped pass the Native Claims Act in 1971 \nand played a pivotal role in bringing the oil pipeline to Alaska in \n1973. He joined with Senator Warren Magnuson in co-authoring the 200 \nmile fishing limit that protects all coastal states from encroachment \nby foreign fishing fleets and helps sustain America's fisheries.\n  In the late 1970s, when President Carter made the creation of \nwilderness areas in Alaska a national priority, Ted worked with his \ncharacteristic focus and tenacity to ensure that the Alaska Lands Act \nprotected his state's interests as much as possible. After the Exxon \nValdez accident in 1989, Ted managed legislation that not only financed \nthe cleanup of the despoiled coastline, but also required double-\nhulling on tankers.\n  Senator Stevens has worked tirelessly and effectively for Alaska. But \nhis accomplishments are certainly not limited to the 49th state. Ted's \ncareer documents his far reaching influence on national policy and \ndedication to the institution of the Senate as well.\n  Ted has been a leader in the defense area for his entire career, as \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and now the full \nAppropriations Committee. And he has developed recognized expertise in \nscience and technology issues through his long and distinguished \nservice on the Commerce Committee as well.\n  Ted has a deep affection for the Senate and has labored to preserve \nthe character, integrity and prerogatives of the institution. He has \nchaired the Rules Committee and served in the leadership as Majority \nWhip.\n  Ted Stevens is recognized for his no-nonsense style, limitless energy \nand\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nability to get things done--not to mention an impressive collection of \nneckties.\n  Everybody in the Senate knows that Ted's word is good, and he has \nearned the high esteem of his colleagues through his hard work and \ndevotion to his job.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed a pleasure to serve with Ted Stevens, and \nto count him as a friend. I congratulate Ted on his achievement, and \nthank him for his numerous contributions to his state, his country and \nthe United States Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Ted Stevens on reaching his 12,000th vote. He is a remarkable \ncolleague and I admire the outstanding leadership that he has shown on \nso many issues. Senator Stevens is a person of great integrity and \nenergy and works tirelessly for his state of Alaska. I have worked \nclosely with him on many occasions and it is with admiration that we \ncelebrate his 12,000th vote.\n  His accomplishments as Chair of the Appropriations Committee are too \nnumerous to list. Handling the nation's spending is a complex, \ndifficult task, yet, Senator Stevens handles this responsibility with \nfinesse and great skill.\n  Senator Stevens is active on a range of issues that are of great \nimportance nationally and to his home state of Alaska. He is a great \nadvocate for fishing families, a great protector of Native-Americans, \nand a leader on promoting quality health care and research. His \nleadership on national defense is also remarkable.\n  Senator Stevens holds a special place in his heart for children and \nhis advocacy on behalf of early education will help us achieve the \nnation's school readiness goals. He was one of the first in the Senate \nto recognize the importance of new brain research documenting the vital \nrole of early stimulation during the first three years of life, and he \nis a leading advocate for early education. Working to ensure that every \nchild reaches his or her full potential, Senator Stevens has introduced \nlegislation that will improve the quality and accessibility of early \nprograms for millions of children under the age of 6. He is committed \nto making sure that children receive the educational boost they need to \nstart school ready to read and ready to learn. With Senator Stevens \nleadership, I know we will make school readiness a reality for every \nchild in this country.\n  Senator Stevens also recognizes the importance of the family and the \ncentral role that parents play in their children's lives. While others \ntalk about putting families first, Senator Stevens acts on that \ncommitment by including funds on his appropriations bills for this \npurpose. Recently, he introduced an amendment to the Juvenile Justice \nbill that will provide essential funds to strengthen supports for \nparents.\n  Put simply, Senator Stevens is a credit to Alaska, the Senate, and \nthis country. He is a great Senator and a good friend. We are fortunate \nto be able to celebrate his 12,000th vote with him, and look forward to \nmany more votes in the future from this great Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend Senator Daschle for his comments \nabout Senator Stevens. He is about to cast his 12,000th vote.\n  Senator Daschle observed the interesting array of Ted Stevens' tie. \nMy favorite one is the Tasmanian devil. When he comes in with that tie \non, you know an appropriations bill is fixing to be moved through the \nSenate. But he has been a great Member of the Senate. He is a great \nfriend. He is a credit to his State of Alaska.\n  He has had an unbelievable career, including being a Flying Tiger, \nthe 14th Air Force, in World War II. He is a graduate of UCLA and \nHarvard Law School. He has overcome that. He was a solicitor at the \nInterior Department under the Eisenhower administration, and he \ncertainly was a powerful advocate for Alaska statehood. He served in \nthe Alaska House of Representatives. He was appointed to the Senate in \n1968, and he has been elected five times since.\n  My greatest experience with the distinguished Senator from Alaska was \nwhen he served as the whip of the majority in the Senate, and I was the \nwhip for the minority in the House. Unlike what most people think, \nwhere there is this natural difficulty between the House and the \nSenate, he was never anything but helpful to me personally. He helped \nthe two institutions work together. Because of his leadership, we \naddressed a number of important problems for the legislative activities \nand the security of the U.S. Capitol Building.\n  His wife Catherine and six children are here, a wonderful assemblage \nof people. Catherine does a great job at keeping Senator Stevens on the \nstraight and narrow. She is a wonderful lady. We thank her for the \nsacrifice she makes in allowing Senator Stevens to be here, sometimes \nthrough late nights, to allow him to accumulate these 12,000 votes.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend our appreciation and thanks to \nSenator Stevens, a great Senator from Alaska, for what he has done for \nhis State and for our Nation.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I am humbled and honored by the statements of our two \nleaders in the Senate. It is true I have a deep reverence for this \nbody. When I was in the Eisenhower administration, I sat up in the \ngallery many nights during the period when the Senate was considering \nAlaska's statehood. I gained the reverence that I have for the body now \nfrom those experiences.\n  It is truly an honor to serve in this body. Some people, I guess, \nhave taken it a little bit for granted. I still pinch myself every once \nin a while to make sure I am allowed the opportunity to be present in \nthis body, to be a U.S. Senator.\n  I value the friendships I have had on both sides of the aisle more \ndeeply than I can say.\n  I am very proud to say for other reasons many members of my family \nare here in the gallery tonight. Our daughter, Lily, graduates from \nhigh school tomorrow. Tonight the National Guard has flown my grandson, \nJohn Covich, into Washington to give me an award from the USO and the \nNational Guard. So this is a double celebration for me.\n  Just having the privilege to still be alive and be part of this body \nis more than anyone can know after the accident that I had years ago \nand the feeling I had about life then turned around. It turned around \nprimarily because of the friendship and the helping hand I got from \nevery Member of the Senate who was here then, and I continue to value \nthe friendship of every one of you tonight. Thank you very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if there is any time remaining, I yield it \nback. I am pleased to give my friend a chance to cast the 12,000th vote \non this amendment.

Mr. President, this morning's headline says it all: \n``House GOP Backs NRA's Gun Show Bill.''\n  Many of us in the Senate worry that the good work done in this \nChamber will be undone in the House. It is hard to believe that the \nHouse leadership is deaf to the pleas of the families who want \nWashington to quit playing patty-cake with the gun lobby and pass a \nreal bill that closes the gun show loophole.\n  The measure we passed in the Senate was modest--far too modest for \nmany people's taste. But we said, let us limit it so it does not hurt \nthe legitimate gun owner but at the same time will close loopholes that \nallow kids and criminals to get guns.\n  Now in the House, because the NRA is actually in the back room, pen \nin hand, drafting legislation, we fear that that legislation will be a \nsham. Anything less than an airtight Brady background check at gun \nshows is a sham. Redefining what a gun show is and making many gun \nshows exempt from the law, in effect, to not allow the FBI to make \nbackground checks in the time they need so that criminals cannot get \nguns, is all happening right now in the House.\n  The only thing I can say to my former colleagues in the House, still \nmy friends, is this: You will not get away with it. When some in this \nChamber tried to change the rules, to make it seem as if they were \ndoing something, but winking at the NRA, they were thwarted. The same \nthing will happen in the House.\n  There has been a sea change in the views of the American people. Do \nthe American people want to repeal the second amendment or confiscate \nhunting rifles? No way. But do they believe modest measures that will \nmove us along and prevent kids and criminals from getting guns are in \norder, no matter what the NRA says? You bet.\n  I urge the House leadership to come clean, to step forward, to pass \nthe same legislation we passed in the Senate on gun shows without any \nloopholes, and allow the families in Littleton and the American people \nto breathe one large sigh of relief that we finally have begun to make \nprogress in preventing kids and criminals from getting guns.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6781-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill passed this chamber with my support. It is no small feat that a \nbill encompassing the size and gravity such as our national security \ncan be addressed and passed through the U.S. Senate within the span of \ntwo days, with few amendments and little rancorous debate. The lion's \nshare of the credit for this accomplishment goes to the managers of the \nbill, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, \nand the Ranking Member, Senator Inouye. Through their efforts, they \nhave again done the work which is the first priority of our government: \nthe defense of American independence, lives, and security around the \nworld.\n  When programs have been consistently successful, it is easy to forget \nthat national security and national defense are not a given in the \npolitical equation. But, national security doesn't just ``happen.'' We \nachieve our national security and defense goals because of the men and \nwomen honorably serving in our nation's Armed Forces. That security and \ndefense is also achieved because Congress passes laws which authorize \nDefense programs and appropriate the funds to pay for them. Our \ncontribution to the debate on these bills and our vote on these bills \nis an essential contribution to our nation's defense. It is our role in \ngovernment's most solemn responsibility.\n  Given the importance of this responsibility, then, I am encouraged \nthat in this bill as well as in the Defense Authorization, the Senate \nhas responded to the increased strain on our military caused by today's \nheightened operation tempo. Kosovo adds another requirement to a long \nlist of regions in which U.S. deployment or U.S. commitment is \nstretching our military forces and supporting intelligence resources to \ntheir limit. I have often argued on this floor for allocating our \ndefense and intelligence resources on the basis of threat priorities, \nand applying the greatest effort to the most dangerous threat. In the \nsame vein, we should avoid overcommitment to places or situations which \ndo not present a direct threat to American independence, lives, or \nlivelihoods. For example, I think it is a mistake to tie up a \nsignificant percentage of our Army and Marine combat power in Yugoslav \npeacekeeping operations long term, and I hope our European allies will \ntake our places there before very long. But wherever those forces are, \nthey must be ready and fully manned, like the air elements of the Air \nForce, Navy, and Marines who performed so brilliantly over Yugoslavia \nthese last seven weeks. The Defense Appropriations bill supports them.\n  I would now like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the \nvitally important work that is being accomplished within this \nappropriations bill. These are provisions which illustrate that we are \non the right track in providing for our military and for providing \nsecurity for people back home in Nebraska, across the United States, \nand indeed, throughout the world.\n  The backbone of the United States Armed Forces is the men and women \nwho choose to serve their country in our military. From the lowest \ngrade enlisted soldier to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I salute those who \nserve out of love for their country. Earlier this year, I was proud to \nsupport S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines Bill of \nRights Act of 1999, which began to address the problems of pay levels, \nrecruitment, and retention facing our military today. S. 4 was a good \nbeginning, most markedly by increasing base pay by 4.8 percent. The \nappropriations bill is consistent with that 4.8\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\npercent pay increase outlined in S. 4, and I am pleased to have \nsupported this provision which will directly and immediately better the \nlives of the personnel of our Armed Forces.\n  Another aspect of this appropriations bill which I would like to \nmention regards an important provision relating to nuclear weapons. \nDuring consideration of the Department of Defense Authorization bill \nfor fiscal year 2000, I authored an amendment which would have lifted \nthe restriction on strategic nuclear weapons levels, allowing the U.S. \nto lower the number of warheads below the START I level. It is my \nbelief that my amendment would not only have increased U.S. security, \nbut would have freed up billions of dollars for other high priority \nitems. The Congressional Budget Office recently conducted a study in \nwhich it found we could save between $12.7 billion and $20.9 billion \nover the next ten years by reducing U.S. nuclear delivery systems \nwithin the overall limits of START II.\n  While I would like to thank the 43 of my colleagues who supported my \namendment, it unfortunately did not pass. I do not want to return to \nthat debate at this time. However, there is a related program which I \nhave previously supported which also deals with national security and \nRussian nuclear weapons--the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction \nprogram, otherwise known as Nunn-Lugar. The Nunn-Lugar program provides \nassistance to states of the former Soviet Union for safeguarding \nnuclear materials, dismantling missiles and other weapons, and other \ndemilitarization measures. The DoD Appropriations bill funds Nunn-Lugar \nin the amount of $476 million. Additionally, this bill allocates $25 \nmillion of these funds to support the Russian nuclear submarine \ndismantlement and disposal activities started in FY 1998. This is an \nimportant program that in a very concrete and discernable way, \nincreases our security, and I am happy to have supported it.\n  Along with programs of national concern, there are a number of \nprovisions in this bill that directly allow Nebraska and Nebraskans to \ncontinue their vital work in safeguarding U.S. national security.\n  Offutt Air Force Base, located in Bellevue, Nebraska, is responsible \nfor a number of missions which are particularly noteworthy. Offutt, \nwith over 10,000 military and civilian personnel, is home to the United \nStates Strategic Command, the joint command charged with deterring \nnuclear attacks on our country. There are many threats out there, but \nonly one of them, Russian nuclear weapons, is capable of ending our \nnational life. STRATCOM's mission may not be in the news that often, \nbut it the most essential of all defense missions, and it is commanded \nfrom Nebraska.\n\n  Offutt Air Force Base also hosts the U.S. Air Force's premiere \nreconnaissance and command-and-control unit, the 55th Wing, the largest \nwing within the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The Fighting 55th's \naircraft provide global situational awareness to military leaders and \ngovernment officials. It is by now commonplace to say that we live in \nthe Information Age. Information has become a precious commodity which \noften can mean the difference between success and defeat. The missions \nthat Offutt specializes in focus on gathering this kind of critical \ninformation. In a variety of ways, Offutt's missions keep us more \ninformed, more aware, and more safe. Here are some specifics on the \nvarious programs.\n  The 55th's workhorse aircraft is the RC-135, also known as Rivet \nJoint. The RC-135 mission conducts electronic reconnaissance, providing \ndirect, near real-time information and electronic warfare support to \ntheater commanders and combat forces monitoring. Rivet Joint has played \nan important role in a number of recent military missions, including \nKosovo, Bosnia, and Iraq. Information gathered by the RC-135 is made \navailable to theater commanders, the Department of Defense and National \nCommand Authorities. Data is processed, analyzed and stored by Air \nCombat Command, the Air Intelligence Agency and the National Security \nAgency. I am pleased that the bill passed yesterday appropriates $220.4 \nmillion for the refurbishing and upgrading of these important aircraft. \nReengining these aircraft is a particularly important improvement.\n  The WC-135 fulfills an air sampling mission in support of the Air \nForce Technical Applications Center at Patrick AFB, Florida, by \nverifying compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It \ngathers information on nuclear tests and conducts baseline air \nsampling. By collecting particles in the air during flight, the WC-135 \nis able to detect if and when nuclear tests are conducted or if a \nnuclear bomb is detonated, even from thousands of miles away. \nConsidering the nuclear weapons testing last year of both India and \nPakistan, it is clear that the WC-135 has not outlived its usefulness. \nThe WC-135 is the only aircraft throughout the U.S. Air Force \nconducting this vital mission, and we in Nebraska are fortunate to have \nit based at home at Offutt Air Force Base.\n  The OC-135, or Open Skies, is tasked to complete photo reconnaissance \nfly-overs. This mission supports the Defense Threat Reduction Agency by \nconducting observation flights in accord with the Open Skies Treaty. \nThis treaty will allow the OC-135 to fly over Russian air space to \nmonitor weapons reductions treaties. Although the Open Skies Treaty has \nnot yet been ratified by all parties, the OC-135 has not been dormant. \nWhile the Open Skies Treaty awaits ratification, the OC-135 is heavily \ninvolved in additional photo reconnaissance projects, including \nmissions such as weather observations of Hurricane Mitch. The Open \nSkies mission is fully funded through fiscal year 2004.\n  Additionally, E-4B aircraft also stationed at Offutt provide \ntransport and command and control for the President, the Secretary of \nDefense, and Secretary of State. Much more than simply a transport \naircraft, the E-4B allows senior officials complete access to critical \ninformation and communications in a secure fashion, keeping the \nPresident and others ``in the loop,'' even while in mid-flight.\n  Along with Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska continues to make \nimportant contributions to our national security through components of \nthe National Guard and the Reserves. Most recently, these components \nhave played important roles in Kosovo alongside their active component \ncounterparts.\n  The 155th Wing of the Nebraska Air National Guard has been very \nactive during the Kosovo mission, flying KC-135s--fuel tanker planes--\nabove and around Kosovo. These KC-135s perform the remarkable task of \nmid-air refueling for a variety of aircraft, including the B-52 \nStratofortress and the E6. Indeed, over the last several months, the \nNebraska unit led the KC-135 refueling effort, involving hundreds of \naircraft, and also was the last volunteer unit engaged in the region \nbefore the reserve call-up was instituted. This has all been done, even \nthough the 155th Wing is the smallest of all the Air Guard wings across \nthe country. I applaud their efforts and their successes.\n  As well, the Nebraska Army National Guard is currently serving in a \nnine-month deployment in Bosnia as part of the NATO peace-keeping \nforces. The 24th Medical Company is working alongside Guard units from \nacross the country to transport patients from the field to hospitals. \nAt a time when a robust economy and opportunities in the private sector \ncan pull people away from public service, I salute these men and women \nwho continue to make sacrifices so that we may be safe.\n  The examples I have given here of the hard work being done by our \nArmed Forces are not the exception, but the rule. In a time of tight \nbudgets and increased missions, I am proud to say that our Armed Forces \nare second to none around the globe. Even when we continue to ask more \nof our military men and women, they always rise to the challenge. We \nmust never forget the risks they take for our sake and the freedoms \nthey forego, and we must provide them the best support, conditions, \nequipment, and training possible in return. I am proud to have \nsupported passage of the defense appropriations bill yesterday, and I \nhope and expect that we will continue the strong support of those who \nare willing to sacrifice all for the cause of your freedom and mine, \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6783-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     DSCC AND INVASIONS OF PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Schuler,\n                                                Research Director.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in this letter, the DSCC is making a broad \nrequest under the Freedom of Information Act regarding any information \nsent from my office to HHS or received from the Department. But it just \ndoesn't include me. I have already said that. It includes a lot of \nSenators--10 of them, in fact, all Republicans, all up for reelection \nthis year.\n  The Freedom of Information Act request covers, ``all correspondence, \ninquiries and other information requested by or provided to'' my office \nover the past 10 years in the Senate, including ``all direct \ncorrespondence between the Senators or members of their staff and the \nHHS, including letters, written material, reports, constituent requests \n[very important] and other relevant materials.'' In other words, they \nwant access to our casework.\n  I have written to President Clinton demanding that he put an \nimmediate stop to this or any similar action. What we are witnessing \nhere is an unprecedented attempt to corrupt the nonpolitical casework \nsystem of Senate offices for political gain. I find these efforts \nrepugnant, and if there are any Americans alive who think politics \ncan't sink any lower, they need to look no further than right here.\n  Through the letter to the HHS, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee wants more than just to peer into private correspondence of \npolitical enemies; it wants to leer into the private lives of those who \ncontact their Senator seeking help with Federal agencies. I have made \ntens of thousands of contacts on behalf of Montanans who asked me to \nhelp them with problems they are having with the Federal Government.\n  These are problems which, if publicly revealed, could possibly ruin \ntheir lives. Many of these people are at the end of their emotional \nrope. Some of them are at the end of their financial world.\n  It is beyond belief that the DSCC would consider ruining the lives of \nordinary Americans to be all in a day's work in order to defeat this \nold Senator. This effort would put a permanent chill on the ability of \nSenators to help constituents in need. It saddens me to think that \nthose who view a Senator's help as their last resort may now believe \nthey have nowhere to turn.\n  Just today, my office received a letter from a man in Billings, MT, \nwhose wife we helped to receive treatment for breast cancer. As a \nFederal employee, she was having a hard time receiving the treatment. \nAnd she was entitled to it. After she asked for our assistance, we were \nable to resolve the matter for her and she got the care she needed. \nWhen her cancer spread, the Federal bureaucracy told her she couldn't \nget the care she needed close to home.\n  Quoting his letter to me:\n\n       After becoming totally frustrated with the whole process, \n     we just gave up. But this time we decided to fight the issue \n     again. I turned to the Senator's office again to enlist his \n     help. And again in what seemed to be a flash of light, the \n     situation has been resolved.\n\n  Our office again stepped in. We cut the redtape. We helped her \nreceive the additional radiation therapy while staying at her home in \nBillings.\n  These are the people who depend on our help--real people whose lives \nare literally on the line. But the man who sent me the letter \nspecifically asked that his name not be used in order to protect his \nprivacy and, yes, that of his wife.\n  Is it right that he should be subject to a Freedom of Information \nrequest, that some bureaucrat somewhere could decide on a whim to \nrelease this personal, sensitive information? It is hard to comprehend \nthat the DSCC would use the time and the resources of the \nadministration for political purposes in such a massive research \neffort, regardless of who ultimately pays.\n  This effort is as constitutionally breathtaking as it is politically \nsuspect. All those who value their civil rights should be outraged at \nthis attempt to invade the privacy of countless unwary citizens. If \nindeed Federal law permits it, it is an absolute shame. It is enough to \nmake me wonder whether Americans should now expect politicians to use \nany means to achieve their ends--laws, morals, and ethics be damned.\n  Our President has said he deplores the politics of personal \ndestruction. However, in this case we are not talking about the \ndestruction of one political opponent, but the lives of innocent \nAmericans. And I am sickened by it. I ask the President and all \nAmericans to stand up against this kind of invasion of privacy, all in \nthe name of gaining an electoral advantage.\n  My political opponents are welcome to engage me anytime, anywhere, on \nmy record, which I am proud to stand on. But when you try to drag the \nlives of innocent Montanans into your ugly schemes, I will fight with \nevery breath in my body. It is a sad day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6783-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6783-S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EXTENSION OF NORMAL-TRADE-RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support a joint \nresolution disapproving the extension of normal-trade-relations status \nto China.\n  This is the fourth time that I have joined with other Senators to \nsupport such a resolution because I believe that trade policy is an \neffective tool that the United States can and should use\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nwith respect to the policies of the Chinese Government. I am pleased to \njoin Senator Smith in supporting his resolution.\n  On June 3, President Clinton announced his intention to extend the \nnormal-trade-relations trading status to China. As I understand it, \nwithout actually affecting the practical application of tariff \ntreatment, legislation last year replaced the term ``most-favored-\nnation'' in seven specific statutes with the new phrase ``normal trade \nrelations.'' Regardless of which phrase you use, I find this policy \nunacceptable. Although we have expected the President to make such a \ndecision, I can only say that under the current circumstances I am once \nagain disappointed in the President's decision. In fact, I have \nobjected to the President's policy since 1994, when he first de-linked \nthe issue of human rights from our trading policy. The argument made \nthen was that trade privileges and human rights are not interrelated. \nAt the same time, it was said, through ``constructive engagement'' on \neconomic matters, and dialogue on other issues, including human rights, \nthe United States could better influence the behavior of the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  Clearly events of the last few months have shown the fallacy of that \nassumption.\n  I have yet to see persuasive evidence that closer economic ties alone \nare going to transform China's authoritarian system into a democracy. \nUnless we continue to press the case for improvement in China's human \nrights record, using the leverage of the Chinese Government's desires \nto expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see how U.S. \npolicy can help conditions in China get much better. De-linking trade \nand human rights has resulted only in the continued despair of millions \nof Chinese people, and there is no evidence that NTR or MFN or whatever \nyou want to call it, has significantly influenced Beijing to improve \nits human rights policies. Basic freedoms--of expression, of religion, \nof association--are routinely denied. The rule of law, at least as we \nunderstand it, does not exist for dissenters in China.\n  Virtually every review of the behavior of China's Government \ndemonstrates that not only has there been little improvement in the \nhuman rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has worsened--\nparticularly in the weeks preceding the tenth anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre. In fact, China has resumed its crackdown on \ndissidents who might have attempted to commemorate the anniversary of \nthe Tiananmen Square massacre. Human rights groups have documented the \ndetention of more than 50 dissidents since May 13, with a number still \nin custody. These have included two detained for helping to organize a \npetition calling on the government to overturn its verdict on Tianamen. \nThe detainees include former student leaders at Tiananmen, a member of \nthe fledgling Democracy Party, intellectuals, and journalists. Those \nnot detained have reportedly been under constant surveillance amid \ncalls by China's top prosecutor for a clampdown on ``all criminal \nactivities that endanger state security,'' including such activities as \nsignature gathering and peaceful protest.\n\n  More generally, five years after the President's decision to de-link \nMFN from human rights, the State Department's most recent Human Rights \nReport on China still describes an abysmal situation. According to the \nreport. ``The Government continued to commit widespread and well-\ndocumented human rights abuses. * * * Abuses included instances of \nextrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced \nconfessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado \ndetention, and denial of due process.'' This list does not even touch \non restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and religion or \nthe continuing abusive family planning practices.\n  In my view, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion except \nthat ``constructive engagement'' has failed to make any change in \nBeijing's human rights behavior. I would say that the evidence \njustifies the exact opposite conclusion: human rights have deteriorated \nand the regime continues to act recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. \nnational interest. We have so few levers that we can use against China. \nAnd if China is accepted by the international community as a superpower \nwithout regard to the current conditions there, it will believe it can \ncontinue to abuse human rights with impunity. The more we ignore the \nsignals and allow trade to dictate our policy, the worse we can expect \nthe human rights situation to become.\n  This year--1999--is likely to be the most important year since 1989 \nwith respect to our relations with China. We face many thorny issues \nwith China, including the accidental embassy bombing, faltering \nnegotiations regarding accession to the World Trade Organizations and \nthe recent release of the Cox report on Chinese espionage.\n  But even with all that is going on, the United States and others in \nthe international community yet again failed to pass a resolution \nregarding China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in \nGeneva earlier this spring, largely because China lobbied hard to \nprevent it. Despite China's efforts to avert a resolution, the United \nStates must also shoulder some of the blame for the failure to achieve \npassage--our early equivocation on whether we would sponsor a \nresolution and our late start in garnering support for it no doubt also \ncontributed to the lack of accomplishment in Geneva. While we would \ncertainly prefer multilateral condemnation of China's human rights \npractices, the failure to achieve that at the UN Commission on Human \nRights proves that it is even more important for the United States to \nuse the levers that we do have to pressure China's leaders. We can not \nbetray the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives in Tiananmen \nSquare by tacitly condoning through our silence the continuing abuses.\n  We know that putting pressure on the Chinese Government can have some \nimpact. China released dissident Harry Wu from prison when his case \nthreatened to disrupt the First Lady's trip to Beijing for the U.N. \nConference on Women, and its similarly released both Wei Jingsheng and \nWang Dan around the same time that China was pushing to have the 2000 \nOlympic Games in Beijing. After losing that bid, and once the spotlight \nwas off, the Chinese government rearrested both Wei and Wang. These \nexamples only affirm my belief that the United States should make it \nclear that human rights are of real--as opposed to rhetorical--concern \nto this country.\n  If moral outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is not reason \nenough for a tough stance with China--and I believe it is and that the \nAmerican people do as well--then let us do so on grounds of real \npolitical and economic self-interest. We must not forget that we \ncurrently have a substantial trade deficit with China. Over the past \nfew years, the U.S. trade deficit with China has surged. It has risen \nfrom $6.2 billion in 1989 to nearly $57 billion in 1998. Political \nconsiderations aside, a deficit of that size represents a formidable \nobstacle to ``normal'' trading relations with China at any point in the \nnear future. Other strictly commercial U.S. concerns have included \nChina's failure to provide adequate protection of U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights, the broad and pervasive use of trade and investment \nbarriers to restrict imports, illegal textile transshipments to the \nUnited States, the use of prison labor for the manufacture of products \nexported to the United States, as well as questionable economic and \npolitical policies toward Hong Kong.\n  This does not present a picture of a nation with whom we should have \nnormal trade relations. Or, if the Administration accepts these \npractices as ``normal'', perhaps we need to redefine what normal trade \nrelations are. These are certainly not practices that I wish to accept \nas normal.\n  My main objective today is to push for the United States to once \nagain make the link between human rights and trading relations with \nrespect to our policy in China. As I have said before, I believe that \ntrade--embodied by the peculiar exercise of NTR renewal--is one of the \nmost powerful levers we have, and that it was a mistake for the \nPresident to de-link this exercise from human rights considerations.\n  So, for those who care about human rights, about freedom of religion, \nand about America's moral leadership in the world, I urge support for \nS.J. Res 27\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\ndisapproving the President's decision to renew normal-trade-relations \nstatus for China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6785-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6785-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 1:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1379.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the Food \n     Quality Protection Act; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                           Resolution No. 56\n\n       Whereas, the safe and responsible use of pesticides for \n     agricultural, food safety, structural, public health, \n     environmental, and other purposes has significantly advanced \n     the overall welfare of Hawaii's citizens and the environment; \n     and\n       Whereas, the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) \n     establishes new safety standards that pesticides must meet to \n     be newly registered or remain on the market; and\n       Whereas, FQPA requires the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) to ensure that all pesticide tolerances meet \n     these new standards by reassessing one-third of the 9,700 \n     current pesticide tolerances by August 1999, and all current \n     tolerances in ten years; and\n       Whereas, risk determinations based on sound science and \n     reliable real-world data are essential for accurate \n     decisions, and the best way for EPA to obtain this data is to \n     require its development and submission by the registrants \n     through the data call-in process; and\n       Whereas, risk determination made in the absence of \n     reliable, science-based information is expected to result in \n     the needless loss of pesticides and certain uses of other \n     pesticides; and\n       Whereas, the needless loss of pesticides and certain \n     pesticide uses will result in fewer pest control options for \n     Hawaii and would be harmful to the economy of Hawaii by \n     jeopardizing agriculture, one of the few industries that has \n     shown great strength during the recent years of the State's \n     flat economy, and fewer pest control options for urban and \n     suburban uses that will result in significant loss of \n     personal property and increased human health concerns; and\n       Whereas, the needless loss of pesticides will jeopardize \n     the state and county government's ability to protect public \n     health and safety on public property and to protect our \n     natural environmental resources, for example, from aggressive \n     alien species; and\n       Whereas, the flawed implementation of FQPA is likely to \n     result in significant increases in food costs to consumers, \n     thereby putting the nutritional needs of children, the poor, \n     and the elderly at unnecessary risk; and\n       Whereas, the Clinton Administration has directed EPA and \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to jointly work \n     toward implementing FQPA in a manner that assures that \n     children will be adequately protected and that risk \n     determinations related to pesticide tolerances and \n     registrations will be based on accurate, science-based \n     information; and\n       Whereas, the cost of developing data to quantify real-world \n     risk is prohibitive and minor use data may not be financed by \n     pesticide registrants and the State, and pesticide users may \n     fund studies to support minor uses: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twentieth \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999, \n     That the U.S. Congress is hereby respectfully requested to \n     direct the Administrator of the EPA to:\n       (1) initiate rulemaking to ensure that the policies and \n     standards EPA intends to apply in evaluating pesticide \n     tolerances and making realistic risk determinations are based \n     on accurate information, real-world data available through \n     the data call-in process, and sound science, and are subject \n     to adequate public notice and comment before EPA issues final \n     pesticide tolerance determinations;\n       (2) Provide interested persons the opportunity to produce \n     data needed to evaluate pesticide tolerances so that EPA can \n     avoid making faulty final pesticide tolerance determinations \n     based upon unrealistic default assumptions;\n       (3) Implement FQPA in a manner that will not adversely \n     disrupt agricultural production nor adversely effect the \n     availability or diversity of the food supply, nor jeopardize \n     the public health or environmental quality through the \n     needless loss of pesticide tolerances for non-agricultural \n     activities;\n       (4) Delay the August 1999, deadline until 2001 or until \n     EPA, USDA, industry leaders, and manufacturers can provide \n     science-based data as to use, application, and residue of the \n     pesticides under review; and\n       (5) Implement the registration of new crop protection \n     products for minor and major crops; and be it further\n       Resolved, That pesticide registrants and EPA are requested \n     to support minor use registrations by reserving a meaningful \n     portion of the risks projected from the use of pesticides or \n     a class of pesticides for minor uses; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of the Resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the President of the U.S. Senate, members of \n     Hawaii's Congressional Delegation, the Administrator of EPA, \n     the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the \n     Governor of the State of Hawaii, and the President of the \n     American Crop Protection Association.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-174.

United States House of Representatives et \n     al., together with Clinton, President of the United States, \n     et al. v. Glavin et al., ruled on January 25, 1999, that the \n     federal Census Act prohibits the Census Bureau's proposed \n     uses of statistical sampling in calculating population for \n     purposes of apportioning seats in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives; and\n       Whereas, In reaching its findings, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     found that the use of statistical sampling to adjust census \n     numbers would result in voters suffering vote dilution in \n     state and local elections, thus violating the constitutional \n     guarantee of ``one person, one vote''; and\n       Whereas, The use of statistically adjusted census data \n     would expose the State of Colorado to protracted litigation \n     over congressional and state legislative redistricting plans \n     at great cost to the taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, Every reasonable and practical effort should be \n     made to obtain the fullest and most accurate population count \n     possible, including appropriate funding for state and local \n     census outreach and education programs, as well as post-\n     census local review: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That the Colorado General Assembly calls on the United \n     States Bureau of the Census to conduct the 2000 decennial \n     census consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the \n     Department of Commerce and Glavin cases, which requires a \n     traditional headcount of the population and bars the use of \n     statistical sampling to create or adjust the count.\n       (2) That the Colorado General Assembly opposes the use of \n     P.L. 94-171 data for congressional and state legislative \n     redistricting that have been determined in any way through \n     statistical inferences made using random sampling techniques \n     or other statistical methodologies to add or subtract persons \n     from the census counts.\n       (3) That the Colorado General Assembly demands that it \n     receive P.L. 94-171 data for congressional and state \n     legislative redistricting identical to the census tabulation \n     data used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives consistent with the Departmemt of Commerce \n     and Glavin cases, which require a traditional headcount of \n     the population and bar the use of statistical sampling to \n     create or adjust the count.\n       (4) That the Colorado General Assembly urges Congress, as \n     the branch of the federal government assigned the \n     responsibility for overseeing the decennial enumeration, to \n     take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the 2000 \n     decennial census is conducted fairly and legally; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the \n     Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, the President and Vice-\n     President of the United States, and the Director of the \n     Bureau of the Census in the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-179. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Colorado relative to the redesign study relating \n     to the Cherry Creek Dam; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                     Senate joint Resolution 99-023\n\n       Whereas, The terms ``probable maximum flood'' and \n     ``probable maximum precipitation'' as used by the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers are misleading terminology \n     because they are both improbable events with respect to the \n     Cherry Creek Basin; and\n       Whereas, The United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     assumed the Cherry Creek Dam will fail following an \n     extraordinarily improbable chain of events; and\n       Whereas, The probable maximum precipitation is a \n     theoretical maximum only and has somewhere between a one in \n     one million to a one in one billion chance of occurring in \n     any single year; and\n       Whereas, The site specific probable maximum precipitation \n     study completed for the United States Army Corps of Engineers \n     by the National Weather Service has erroneously applied \n     meteorological procedures and fails to include documented \n     historical paleo flood evidence; and\n       Whereas, This error is further compounded by the erroneous \n     assumption that the topographic effects of the Palmer Divide \n     will increase the rainfall in the Cherry Creek Basin; and\n       Whereas, The probable maximum flood used by the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers is more than twice the flood \n     estimates prepared by other dam safety officials; and\n       Whereas, Probable maximum precipitation estimates in the \n     western United States are typically about 3 times the 100-\n     year rainfall event; and\n       Whereas, The United States Army Corps of Engineers has used \n     7 times the 100-year rainfall event; and\n       Whereas, The United States Army Corps of Engineers and the \n     National Weather Service have refused an independent peer \n     review, even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     regularly requires such peer reviews as part of its licensing \n     procedures for hydro power facilities at dams, and the \n     Colorado State Engineer has a similar policy for reviews of \n     probable maximum precipitation studies and is currently in \n     phase II of a study funded by Colorado Senate Bills 94-029 \n     and 97-008 to develop an alternative model to predict extreme \n     rainfall amounts for basins above 5,000 feet mean sea level; \n     and\n       Whereas, Such an independent peer review panel should \n     consist of local experts in the fields of extreme \n     precipitation and flood hydrology that have knowledge of \n     Colorado's unique climatological conditions; and\n       Whereas, The March 5, 1999, ``peer'' review response \n     submitted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers is \n     simply another in-house review prepared by the National \n     Weather Service, is not an independent analysis, and does not \n     address the full range of issues that are typically addressed \n     in a proper independent peer review; and\n       Whereas, The proposed construction of upstream dry dams \n     will displace many Coloradans from their homes and businesses \n     and destroy hundreds of acres of active agricultural land and \n     open space; and\n       Whereas, Any government agency proposal to spend from $50 \n     to $250 million of taxpayer money must be based on data and \n     assumptions that are as accurate as possible; and\n       Whereas, Because all alternatives being considered by the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers will have substantial \n     negative impact on homes and families near the dam and \n     upstream of the dam and adversely affect property values, the \n     cost of any real estate that would properly be condemned \n     should be included in determining the cost of any \n     alternatives considered: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That no further funding of the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers should be\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\n     provided for the Cherry Creek Basin Study until the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers completes on independent peer \n     review of the National Weather Service data in order to \n     determine the appropriate design flood for the Cherry Creek \n     Basin; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this joint resolution be sent to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, each member of Colorado's Congressional \n     delegation, the Governor of the State of Colorado, the \n     Commander of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and \n     the Colorado Water Conservation Board.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-180. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Colorado relative to national missile defense; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 99-029\n\n       Whereas, Colorado is the thirty-eighth state to enter the \n     federal union of the United States of America and is entitled \n     to all the rights, privileges, the obligations that the union \n     affords and requires, including the obligation of the federal \n     government to provide for the common defense; and\n       Whereas, The federal government has not provided for the \n     common defense of the United States, including Colorado, \n     against attack by long-range ballistic missiles; and\n       Whereas, The United States currently has no defense against \n     long-range ballistic missiles despite possessing \n     sophisticated military installations, such as the NORAD \n     command center in Cheyenne Mountain; and\n       Whereas, The people of Colorado recognize the evolution and \n     proliferation of missile delivery systems and weapons of mass \n     destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological \n     weapons, in foreign states such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, \n     Libya, China, and Russia who are sharing ballistic missile \n     and nuclear weapons technology among themselves; and\n       Whereas, There is a growing threat to the United States and \n     its territories, deployed forces, and allies by aggressors in \n     foreign states and rogue nations that are seeking chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear weapons capability and a means to \n     deliver such capability using long-range ballistic missiles; \n     and\n       Whereas, On August 31, 1998, without any advance detection \n     by the U.S. intelligence community and to the surprise of the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, communist North Korea \n     tested its Taepo Dong 1 Long-Range Ballistic Missile; and\n       Whereas, With its estimated range of 3,000 to 6,000 miles, \n     this type of three-stage ballistic missile is capable of \n     reaching the United States, and, if used as a fractional \n     orbital bombardment system, the missile has an unlimited \n     range; and\n       Whereas, In 1996, communist China threatened the United \n     States with ballistic missile attack if it intervened in the \n     dispute between China and Taiwan and, in 1995 and 1996, \n     communist China launched ballistic missiles near Taiwan to \n     threaten that country; and\n       Whereas, China has conducted at least forty-five nuclear \n     tests, and in 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency reported \n     that thirteen of China's eighteen long-range missiles were \n     targeted at U.S. cities; and\n       Whereas, In addition to the long-range ballistic missiles \n     it currently possesses, China is also building new long-range \n     ballistic missiles; and\n       Whereas, In 1993, in response to its economic difficulties \n     and decline in conventional military capability, Russia's \n     leaders issued a national security policy placing greater \n     reliance on nuclear deterrence; and\n       Whereas, Russia still has over 20,000 nuclear weapons, and \n     the risk of an accident or loss of control over Russian \n     ballistic missile forces could occur with little or no \n     warning to the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, Russia poses a risk to the United States as a \n     major exporter of ballistic missile technology, enabling \n     countries hostile to the United States to threaten or attack \n     the United States with ballistic missiles; and\n       Whereas, The congressional chartered Commission to Assess \n     the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States led by \n     former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld unanimously \n     recommended that the U.S. analyses, practices, and policies \n     that depend on expectations of extended warning of deployment \n     of ballistic missiles be reviewed and, as appropriate, be \n     revised to reflect the reality of an environment in which \n     there may be little or no warning of development and launch \n     of said missiles; and\n       Whereas, In March 1999 the United States Congress passed \n     legislation declaring it the policy of the United States to \n     deploy a national missile defense, in recognition of the \n     threats we face: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein, That the President, Congress, and the \n     government of the United States are hereby strongly urged:\n       (1) To take all actions necessary to provide for the common \n     defense and protect on an equal basis all people, resources, \n     and states of the United States from the threat of missile \n     attack, regardless of the physical location of each state of \n     the union;\n       (2) To include all fifty states in every National \n     Intelligence Estimate of missile threat of the United States;\n       (3) To take all necessary measures to ensure that all fifty \n     states are protected from weapons delivered by long-range \n     ballistics missiles or by means of terrorists;\n       (4) To make the safety and common defense of all fifty \n     states a priority over any international treaty or \n     obligation;\n       (5)(a) To deploy a common defense against long-range \n     ballistic missiles capable of providing multiple \n     opportunities to intercept a ballistic missile or \n     intercepting a ballistic missile in its boost phase (its most \n     vulnerable position);\n       (b) To deploy a defense fully exploiting the advantages of \n     using defenses in space; and\n       (c) To deploy such a defense using accelerated funding and \n     streamlined acquisition procedures to minimize the time for \n     deployment; and\n       (6) To hold appropriate Congressional committee hearings \n     that include the testimony of defense experts and \n     administration officials to enable the citizens of the United \n     States to understand the nature and extent of their \n     vulnerability to ballistic missile attack and their level of \n     security against such an attack; and be if further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States; the Vice-president of the \n     United States; the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to reauthorization of the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Maine the nearly 500 dairy farms producing milk \n     valued annually at over $100,000,000; and\n       Whereas, maintaining a sufficient supply of Maine-produced \n     milk and milk products is the best interest of Maine \n     consumers and businesses; and\n       Whereas, Maine is a member of the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy compact; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will \n     terminate at the end of October 1999 unless action is taken \n     by the Congress to reauthorize it; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact's mission \n     is to ensure the continued viability of dairy farming in the \n     Northeast and to ensure consumers of an adequate, local \n     supply of pure and wholesome milk; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \n     established a minimum price to be paid to dairy farmers for \n     their milk, which has helped to stabilize their incomes; and\n       Whereas, in certain months the compact's minimum price has \n     resulted in dairy farmers receiving nearly 10% more for their \n     milk than the farmers would have otherwise received; and\n       Whereas, actions taken by the compact have directly \n     benefited Maine dairy farmers and consumers: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress reauthorize the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Memorial, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable William J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Missouri relative to tobacco \n     settlement funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, in late November, 1998, Missouri accepted the 206 \n     billion dollar settlement agreement negotiated between 46 \n     states and the tobacco industry;\n       Whereas, the states' attorneys general crafted the \n     settlement agreement to protect states' interests, consistent \n     with the lawsuits filed on behalf of the states;\n       Whereas, the settlement agreement reflects difficult policy \n     decisions and years of effort among the states which bore the \n     risk and expense of litigating their claims against a strong \n     tobacco industry;\n       Whereas, the federal government neither participated in nor \n     assisted with the litigation and negotiation of the states' \n     claims, yet now seeks to seize a substantial portion of the \n     resulting payments due to the states;\n       Whereas, the federal government bases its claim on federal \n     right to recoupment for medicaid expenses, a claim which was \n     not promoted by the federal government in any litigation \n     prior to the settlement of the states' claims;\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\n       Whereas, by the terms of the settlement, Missouri would \n     receive approximately 6.7 billion dollars by 2025, yet faces \n     an estimated potential loss of 3.9 billion dollars of this \n     amount to the federal government;\n       Whereas, Missouri rightfully should determine the best use \n     of the settlement proceeds achieved through state effort, \n     using state resources and motivated by state concerns: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Missouri Senate and the \n     Ninetieth General Assembly, the House of Representatives \n     concurring therein, That the President of the United States \n     and the members of Missouri's Congressional delegation \n     recognize the effort and resources expended by Missouri to \n     promote and protect its interests throughout the litigation \n     and negotiation of claims against the tobacco industry; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of \n     Missouri requests that the President of the United States and \n     the members of Missouri's Congressional delegation protect \n     the proceeds negotiated by Missouri in settlement of its \n     claims by refusing to divert, seize or recoup any portion of \n     the settlement proceeds for federal purposes; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be instructed to \n     provide properly inscribed copies of this resolution to \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, to \n     each member of Missouri's Congressional delegation, the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-184. A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Missouri relative to tobacco \n     settlement funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, on November 23, 1998, a historic accord was \n     reached between 46 states, U.S. territories, commonwealths \n     and the District of Columbia and tobacco industry \n     representatives that called for the distribution of tobacco \n     settlement funds to states over the next twenty-five years; \n     and\n       Whereas, these funds result from the effort put forth by \n     state attorneys general in which states solely assumed \n     enormous risks and displayed determination to initiate a \n     settlement that will lead to reduced youth smoking and \n     reduced access to tobacco products; and\n       Whereas, in the fall of 1997, states were notified by the \n     U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of its intention \n     to ``recoup'' the federal match from funds states received \n     through suits brought against tobacco manufacturers; and if \n     such recoupment takes place, the states will lose one-half or \n     more of the tobacco settlement funds; and\n       Whereas, the federal government played no role in the suits \n     brought against tobacco manufacturers or the subsequent \n     settlement agreement and the November 23rd accord makes no \n     mention of Medicaid or federal recoupment; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     has suspended recoupment activities; and\n       Whereas, we the members of the Ninetieth General Assembly \n     believe that the suspension on the federal government's \n     recoupment of tobacco settlement funds should be converted \n     into an outright prohibition against the federal government \n     recouping any of the tobacco settlement money; and\n       Whereas, we the members of the Ninetieth General Assembly \n     believe that if the federal government recoups any funds \n     received through suits brought against tobacco manufacturers, \n     such recoupment should be immediately returned to the state; \n     and\n       Whereas, to prevent the seizure of state tobacco settlement \n     funds when they become available to the states in 2000, an \n     amendment to the Medical statute must be enacted to exempt \n     tobacco settlement funds from recoupment: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives of the Ninetieth General Assembly, First \n     Regular Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby go on \n     record in support of state retention of all state tobacco \n     settlement funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives of the Ninetieth General Assembly, First \n     Regular Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby urge \n     the federal government, in the event recoupment occurs, to \n     return upon receipt any tobacco settlement funds recouped \n     from the state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives of the Ninetieth General Assembly, First \n     Regular Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby urge \n     Congress to enact an amendment to the Medicaid statute that \n     would exempt tobacco settlement funds from recoupment; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare properly inscribed \n     copies of this resolution for the President of the United \n     States, the entire Missouri Congressional delegation, the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-185.

A bill to allow Federal securities enforcement actions to be \npredicated on State securities enforcement actions, to prevent \nmigration of rogue securities brokers between and among financial \nservices industries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 microcap fraud prevention act of 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Microcap Fraud \nPrevention Act of 1999 which will equip Federal law enforcement \nauthorities with new tools to prosecute the fight against microcap \nsecurities fraud that costs unwary investors an estimated $6 billion \nannually.\n  While cold-calling families at dinnertime and high-pressure sales \nremain a favorite tactic of microcap con artists, the Internet is \nproviding a new and inviting frontier for the commission of microcap \nfrauds. I find it particularly disturbing that despite the best efforts \nof regulatory authorities, microcap scam artists often commit repeat \noffenses. Similarly, under current law, persons barred from other \nsegments of the financial industry, such as banking or insurance, can \neasily bring their deceptive practices into our securities markets.\n  I am very pleased to have the cosponsorship of two of my \ndistinguished colleagues in introducing this important legislation. \nSenator Cleland and Senator Gregg are united with me in a commitment to \nensure that security regulators have the necessary authority to crack \ndown on securities fraud. Senator Cleland has a longstanding interest \nin protecting investors from securities scams. Senator Gregg also has \nbeen a leader in this arena in his position as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over the SEC's budgets.\n  In drafting this legislation, I was also pleased to have the \ninvaluable assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association which represents \nState securities regulators. In fact, Richard H. Walker, the SEC's \nDirector of Enforcement, and Peter C. Hildreth, the President of NASAA, \nhave submitted letters endorsing my legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that these letters be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins-Cleland-Gregg legislation is \nthe product of hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nwhich I chair. We first started looking at this issue in 1997 and held \nour first hearing in September of that year. Those hearings revealed \nthat microcap securities fraud is pervasive, so much so that regulators \nestimated that it cost investors $6 billion in losses annually, \naccording to an article in the Wall Street Journal.\n  The damage from these microcap scams, however, is not confined to \ninvestor losses. They also damage the reputation of legitimate small \ncompanies and limit their ability to raise capital through the \nsecurities markets. Ironically, the strong performance of the \nsecurities markets over the past several years has provided an ideal \nbreeding ground for these microcap scams as more and more Americans \ninvest in stocks. In fact, according to the SEC, in 1980, only 1 in 18 \nindividual Americans participated in the securities markets. Today, 1 \nin 3 Americans participate in the securities markets. There has been a \ntremendous growth in more and more American households investing in \nequities.\n  In a typical microcap fraud, an unscrupulous broker, often acting \nthrough an intermediary, purchases large blocks of shares in a small \ncompany with dubious business and financial prospects. The company \nstock may be nearly worthless, but the brokers repeatedly cold call \ncustomers, promise glowing returns and drive up the stock through high-\npressure sales tactics. Inevitably, after the manipulators sell their \nshares at a profit, the artificially inflated price plummets, leaving \nthousands of unsophisticated investors with worthless stock and heavy \nlosses. The manipulators then count their ill-gotten gains and move on \nto their next target.\n  The subcommittee's investigation demonstrated that the rapid growth \nof the Internet has also provided a new frontier for the commission of \nmicrocap securities frauds. At hearings held by the subcommittee last \nMarch, expert witnesses testified that while the Internet provides \nmany, many benefits to online investors, such as lower trading costs \nand a wealth of investment information, the medium is inviting to con \nmen as well.\n\n  Specifically, the Internet makes it easier and cheaper for microcap \nscam artists to contact potential victims and to perpetrate pump-and-\ndump schemes or related securities frauds. Rather than having to cold \ncall potential victims one at a time, con men with home computers and \nInternet access can reach millions of potential investors with the \nclick of a mouse. At a very low cost, these cybercrooks can deceive \nmany more victims using professionally designed web sites, online \nfinancial newsletters or bulk e-mail. SEC officials testified that the \nagency now receives hundreds of e-mail complaints per day, an estimated \n70 percent of which involve potential Internet securities frauds.\n  For example, a constituent of mine from Ellsworth, ME, who appeared \nat the subcommittee's hearings, testified that he lost more than \n$20,000 in a sophisticated Internet securities scam. My constituent has \nan engineering degree, and he has been investing for nearly 10 years. \nThis demonstrates the potential risk that Internet fraud poses to even \nexperienced investors. Although the SEC has brought charges against the \nalleged perpetrators of this scam, it is, unfortunately, very unlikely \nthat my constituent will ever be able to recover his losses.\n  Whether they use cold calls, the Internet, or both, microcap scam \nartists rarely strike only once. The subcommittee's investigations have \nfound that when regulators close down one microcap scam, often after \nvery lengthy proceedings, it is very common\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\nfor the perpetrators to pop up in connection with yet another \nsecurities fraud.\n  Moreover, individuals who have committed consumer frauds in other \nfinancial services industries, such as insurance or banking, frequently \nmove on to work in the securities industry. Our regulatory system must \nbe able to prevent these individuals who have violated the law from \nmigrating freely from one financial sector to another.\n  I commend the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe State securities regulators in aggressively fighting microcap \nsecurities fraud, but they are simply overwhelmed with the magnitude of \nthe problem.\n  The SEC has established a special unit to monitor the Internet for \npotential microcap or similar stock securities scams and has initiated \n83 enforcement actions against approximately 250 individuals and \ncompanies who have allegedly committed Internet securities frauds.\n  Similarly, in July of 1998, the State securities regulators, \nrepresented by NASAA, announced that the State securities regulators \nhad filed 100 enforcement actions in a ``sweep'' against illegal boiler \nroom operations. Approximately 64 of these enforcement actions involved \nbrokers peddling microcap stocks. Despite these commendable efforts, \nhowever, the SEC and State regulators face significant challenges just \nto keep up with the explosive growth of microcap securities fraud, \nparticularly on the Internet.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is designed to bolster \nthe SEC's ability to protect investors from ever-increasing microcap \nfrauds while ensuring that legitimate small companies can continue to \nraise capital through securities offerings. To accomplish these \nobjectives, the bill will streamline the microcap fraud investigative \nprocess and provide the SEC with the tools it needs to suspend or ban \nrogue brokers, particularly those who have a history of committing \nfraudulent offenses.\n  Specifically, our legislation will do the following:\n  First, it will allow the SEC to bring enforcement actions against \nsecurities fraud violators on the basis of enforcement actions brought \nby State securities regulators. Currently, State regulators can rely on \nSEC-initiated enforcement actions, but the SEC does not have reciprocal \nauthority. Consequently, the SEC must often conduct duplicative \ninvestigations before the agency can bring enforcement actions against \nmicrocap securities frauds first identified at the State level but \nwhich operate on a nationwide basis. With the new authority proposed by \nour legislation, the SEC and the State regulators will be able to \nmaximize the impact of their limited enforcement resources.\n  Second, our legislation would permit the SEC to keep out of the \nsecurities business unscrupulous individuals from other sectors of the \nfinancial services industry. As I stated previously, persons with \nhistories of violations too often roam freely throughout the financial \nservices industry and commit new frauds. The bill would allow the SEC \nto prevent individuals who have ripped off consumers in insurance or \nbanking scams from similarly defrauding America's small investors.\n  Third, our legislation will broaden the current penny stock bar to \ninclude fraudulent violations in the microcap markets. Under current \nlaw, the SEC can suspend or bar individuals who commit serious penny \nstock frauds involving stocks that cost less than $5. You may be \nsurprised to learn, however, that the law permits such violators to \nparticipate in micro-cap securities offerings, because even though the \ntotal capitalization of these companies is small, each of their shares \ncosts more than $5. Our bill will close this loophole by allowing the \nSEC to suspend or bar individuals who have committed serious penny \nstock fraud from participating in both the penny stock and micro-cap \nsecurities markets either as registered brokers or in related \npositions, such as promoters.\n  Fourth, our proposal will expand the statutory officer and director \nbar to include all publicly traded companies. Current law applies only \nto companies that report to the SEC, leaving the door open for \nviolators to serve as officers or directors of all other companies. Our \nproposal would extend the bar to include all publicly traded \nbusinesses, including ``Pink Sheet'' or Over The Counter (``OTC'') \nBulletin Board companies, which are often the vehicles for micro-cap \nfraud schemes.\n\n  Finally, our bill will strengthen the SEC's ability to take \nenforcement actions against repeat violators. Currently, the SEC must \nrequest that the Justice Department initiate criminal contempt \nproceedings against individuals who violate SEC orders or court \ninjunctions, which can be a very burdensome and timely process. Our \nlegislation would allow the SEC to seek immediate civil penalties for \nrepeat violators without the need to file criminal contempt \nproceedings.\n  Our Nation is blessed with the strongest and safest security markets \nin the world. This is a tribute to both the industry and its \nregulators. Unfortunately, as our markets bring benefits to more and \nmore Americans, they also attract those who would exploit unsuspecting \ninvestors through manipulative practices.\n  By virtue of their small size and relative obscurity, microcap \nsecurities are the most susceptible to manipulation. By giving the SEC \nthe tools it needs to combat this fraud, this legislation will benefit \nnot only individual investors, but also the vast majority of legitimate \nsmall businesses who contribute so much to our Nation's growth and \nprosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Microcap Fraud \nPrevention Act of 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee \n         on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: I commend both you and your \n     Subcommittee for addressing the important issue of fraud in \n     the market for microcap securities. As I said in my March 23, \n     1999 testimony before your Subcommittee, fighting fraud in \n     this market has been one of the Commission's more significant \n     challenges this decade. The hearings you held help to focus \n     the issues and educate investors, and the principles in the \n     bill you plan to introduce will help leverage the \n     Commission's resources to combat microcap fraud.\n       As you know, Chairman Levitt testified on microcap fraud \n     before your Subcommittee in September 1997. He noted then \n     that with our resources remaining relatively constant, we \n     must ``rely increasingly on innovative and efficient ways of \n     minimizing fraud and of maximizing the deterrence achievable \n     with the Commission's limited resources.'' In my own view, \n     the concepts underlying ``The Microcap Fraud Prevention Act \n     of 1999'' would be of great assistance to us in this regard. \n     Most importantly, the bill would give us valuable new tools \n     to close off participation in the microcap market by those \n     who would prey on innocent investors.\n       In recent years, the Commission has made significant \n     inroads in the fight against microcap fraud. I appreciate \n     your efforts to address this serious problem through hearings \n     and legislation that support our enforcement efforts. I \n     believe your bill would significantly advance the cause and \n     help make our markets safer for investors. My staff and I \n     look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     Subcommittee on this legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                            Richard H. Walker,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Division of Enforcement.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        North American Securities,\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the membership of North \n     American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. \n     (``NASAA'') \\1\\, I commend you for recognizing and \n     confronting the problem of fraud in the microcap securities \n     market. At your invitation NASAA testified before you and the \n     members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and \n     took part in your fact-finding mission. We appreciate your \n     efforts to protect the investing public from frauds and for \n     introducing legislation to enhance enforcement efforts in \n     this area.\n       As you know, several years ago, state securities \n     administrators recognized the problem of fraud in the \n     microcap market. Since then the states have led enforcement \n     efforts and filed numerous actions against microcap firms. \n     There are systematic problems in this area, but they can be \n     addressed effectively if state and federal regulators and \n     policymakers work together on meaningful solutions.\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\n       NASAA wholeheartedly supports the intent of The Microcap \n     Fraud Prevention Act of 1999. It would be an important step \n     in combating abuses in the microcap market and maintaining \n     continued public confidence in our markets.\n       I pledge the support of NASAA's membership to continue to \n     work with you to secure passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Peter C.

It allows SEC enforcement \n     actions to be predicated on state enforcement actions and \n     take steps to prevent the entry into the securities industry \n     of individuals who have committed fraud in other sectors of \n     the financial services industry.\n       Explanation: Currently, state securities laws do not allow \n     state regulators to obtain civil relief having nation-wide \n     effect. Rather, state regulators only have jurisdiction to \n     prohibit defendants from doing business in their state. \n     Wrongdoers are thus free to perpetrate fraud in any other \n     state where they have not been separately barred. This \n     section amends Exchange Act section 15(b)(4)(G) to allow the \n     SEC to bring a follow-up administrative proceeding to suspend \n     or bar regulated persons who either (1) have been barred by a \n     state securities administrator from operating within that \n     state or (2) is subject to a final order for fraudulent, \n     manipulative, or deceitful conduct.\n       The SEC would not have the authority to follow-up on ex \n     parte temporary restraining orders. Such orders are imposed \n     immediately by state regulators and do not provide alleged \n     violators with a chance to present a defense until after the \n     order has already been entered. The SEC would have the \n     ability to act on these state actions if, after adjudication, \n     the defendant were ultimately found to have committed a \n     violation or reached a settlement agreement.\n       Currently, the Securities Exchange Act does not permit the \n     SEC to take administrative actions to bar or suspend from the \n     securities industry individuals who have committed serious \n     violations--i.e. fraud--in other financial industries, such \n     as the insurance or banking sectors. This section amends \n     Exchange Act 15(b)(4)(G) to authorize the SEC (1) to take \n     administrative action seeking bars or suspensions against a \n     broker-dealer or associated person based on orders issued by \n     federal regulators of other financial services industries and \n     (2) to allow the SEC to take follow-up actions when a foreign \n     financial regulatory authority has previously found \n     violations in other financial sectors. To ensure parity and \n     close off any remaining loopholes, corresponding changes have \n     also been made to Exchange Act sections 15B(c), 15C(c), and \n     17A(c) to extend this provision to those who seek to \n     associate with municipal securities dealers, government \n     securities dealers, and transfer agents.\n\n\n       sec. 3. amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940\n\n       This section amends Investment Advisers Act section 203 to \n     allow the SEC to bring a follow-up administrative proceeding \n     to suspend or bar investment advisors who are subject to \n     certain federal, state, or foreign orders. This sections also \n     amends section 203(f) of the act to permit the SEC to bar a \n     person associated with an investment adviser on the basis of \n     a felony conviction.\n       Explanation: This section makes the same changes to the \n     Investment Adviser Act that Section 2 of the bill makes to \n     the Exchange Act. Both allow SEC enforcement actions to be \n     predicated on certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement \n     actions against individuals found to have committed \n     fraudulent or similar acts in the financial services sector.\n\n\n        sec. 4. amendments to the investment company act of 1940\n\n       This section amends Investment Company Act section 9(b)(4) \n     to allow the SEC to bring a follow-up administrative \n     proceeding to suspend or bar individuals covered by the \n     Investment Company Act who are subject to certain federal, \n     state, or foreign orders.\n       Explanation: This section makes the same changes to the \n     Investment Company Act that Section 2 of the bill makes to \n     the Exchange Act. Both allow SEC enforcement actions to be \n     predicated on certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement \n     actions against individuals found to have committed \n     fraudulent or similar acts in the financial services sector.\n\n\n                     sec. 5. conforming amendments\n\n       This section amends various provisions of the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934 to authorize the SEC to take \n     administrative actions against individuals--based on the \n     findings of certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement \n     actions--who seek to associate with municipal securities \n     dealers, government securities brokers and dealers, and \n     clearing agencies. The section also amends the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934, so that actions by state securities \n     commissions and other regulators can trigger a statutory \n     disqualification. This section will focus statutory \n     disqualifications on serious violations of state law, \n     particularly fraud and similar offenses.\n       Explanation: This section seeks to prevent individuals who \n     have committed fraud in other financial services sectors from \n     entering the securities industry. The section also expands \n     the definition of violations that trigger automatic statutory \n     bars from the securities industry.\n\n\n                 Sec. 6. broadening of penny stock bar\n\n       This section amends Exchange Act section 15(b)(6) to expand \n     the penny stock bar to cover a broader category of offerings.\n       Expanation: This section would extend the penny stock bar \n     to all offerings other than those involving securities traded \n     on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, NMS, or investment company \n     securities. While there is no formal definition of ``micro-\n     cap'' security, this statutory amendment would cover what are \n     generally referred to as ``micro-cap'' securities.\n\n\nsec. 7. court authority to prohibit offerings of non-covered securities\n\n       This section amends Exchange Act section 21(d)(5) to \n     provide federal court judges the authority to impose the \n     remedy outlined in Section 9 of the bill.\n       Explanation: This section would allow the SEC to obtain all \n     necessary relief more efficiently and expeditiously by \n     requesting, in appropriate cases, a district court to issue a \n     penny stock bar order. This authority would be provided as an \n     alternative to the SEC's current ability to seek such orders \n     only through administrative proceedings.\n\n\n             sec. 8. broadening of officer and director bar\n\n       This section amends Exchange Act section 21(d)(2) in order \n     to broaden the scope of the officer and director bar.\n       Explanation: Current law allows persons barred from serving \n     as an officer or director of companies that report to the SEC \n     to serve as officers or directors of other companies. This \n     section removes the limitation to SEC reporting companies, \n     and instead covers all publicly traded companies--those \n     registered pursuant to Exchange Act section 12, those \n     required to file reports pursuant to Exchange Act section \n     15(d), and those whose securities are ``quoted in any \n     quotation medium.''\n\n\n                sec. 9. violations of court ordered bars\n\n       This section adds section 21(i) to the Exchange Act to give \n     the SEC a more direct remedy against recidivist violators of \n     prior bar orders.\n       Explanation: This section makes it a stand-alone violation \n     of the securities laws for a person to engage in conduct that \n     violated a prior order barring him from acting as an officer, \n     director or promoter. It allows the SEC to take direct \n     enforcement action (seeking per-day money penalties, among \n     other remedies) against a recidivist without the need for \n     criminal authorities to bring a contempt proceeding.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 1191. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for facilitating the importation into the United States of \ncertain drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               INTERNATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG PARITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of legislation \non behalf of myself, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Johnson. These \nthree Senators, and I hope others as well, have joined me in \nintroducing this bill, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, \ntoday.\n  This piece of legislation deals with the question of prescription \ndrugs. By consent of the Chair, I would like to show on the floor of \nthe Senate today examples of the issue that is addressed by this piece \nof legislation.\n  With your consent, I will show two bottles of the drug Claritin, a \nmedication most people are familiar with. Claritin is a popular anti-\nallergy drug. These two bottles contain the same pills, produced by the \nsame company, in the same strength, in the same quantity. One \ndifference: a big difference in price. This bottle is purchased in the \nUnited States--in North Dakota, to be exact. This bottle of 10\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\nmilligram, 100 tablets cost North Dakotans $218, wholesale price. This \nbottle--same drug, same company, same strength, same quantity--was \npurchased in Canada. They didn't pay $218 in Canada; they paid $61. Why \nthe difference for the same drug, same dosage, same quantity, same \ncompany? In Canada, it costs $61; U.S. consumers pay $218.\n  Here is another example--and I have a lot of examples. But with the \nconsent of the Chair, I will only use two today.\n  This is Cipro, a prescription drug to treat infections. Both bottles \nare made by the same company. We have the same number of pills, 500 \nmilligram, 100 tablets--same drug, same company, same pill. In North \nDakota, the wholesale price for this bottle is $399; in Canada, it is \n$171. The North Dakotan pays--or the U.S. consumer pays because this is \ntrue all over our country--$399, or 233 percent more than for the same \ndrug in Canada. The question is, Why? The question is, With a global \neconomy, why would a pharmacist simply not drive up to Canada and buy \nthe same drugs and offer them for a lower price to their customers? The \nanswer to that is, there is a law that restricts the importation of \ndrugs into this country, except by the manufacturers of the drug \nthemselves. That is kind of a sweetheart law, it seems to me. We want \nto change that.\n  If the manufacturer that produces these pills has been inspected by \nthe Food and Drug Administration and the same drugs are marketed \neverywhere, why on Earth, in a global economy, cannot our consumers \naccess a lesser price? Incidentally, this pricing inequity does not \njust exist with Canada; it is the same with Mexico, Germany, France, \nItaly, England, Germany--you name it. It is true around the world. We \npay a much higher price for most prescription drugs than consumers \nanywhere else in the world. The United States is the consumer that pays \na much higher price for the same pill, in the same bottle, produced by \nthe same manufacturer.\n  With our bill we say, let's decide that what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander. If the pharmaceutical companies can access the raw \nmaterials which they use to produce their medicine from all around the \nworld and produce a pill and put it in a bottle, it seems to me that \nthe customer here in the United States ought to also benefit from free \ntrade, as long as the drug is FDA approved and comes from a plant that \nis inspected by the FDA.\n  The drug industry will say that safety is an issue. It is no issue \nwith respect to my bill. Safety is not an issue here at all. I am \nsaying--and my colleagues are as well--if medicine approved by the FDA \nand produced in a plant inspected by the FDA is to be marketed around \nthe world, but the American is to pay the highest price--in some cases \nby multiples of four and five --let us use the global economy to let \nU.S. pharmacists and prescription drug distributors access that \nmedicine wherever it exists at a lower price, and pass along those \nsavings to American consumers.\n  Back in 1991, the General Accounting Office studied 121 drugs and \nfound that, on average, prescription drugs in the United States are \npriced 34 percent higher than the exact same products in Canada. I just \ndid a comparison of the retail prices on both sides of the border of 12 \nof the most prescribed drugs, and discovered that, on average, U.S. \nprices exceeded the Canadian prices by 205 percent.\n  I mentioned before that Claritin costs the American consumer 358 \npercent more. We American consumers pay 358 percent more than the \nconsumer does north of the border. And incidentally, the Canadian \nprices have been adjusted to U.S. dollars. Does this make sense? Of \ncourse not. Studies show that the same drug that costs $1 in our \ncountry costs 71 cents in Germany, 65 cents in the United Kingdom, 57 \ncents in France, and 51 cents in Italy. All we are saying is that if \nthis global economy is good for companies that produce the drugs, it \nought to be good for the consumer.\n  In 1997, the top 10 pharmaceutical companies had an average profit \nmargin of 28 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported that profit \nmargins in the drug industry are the ``envy of the corporate world.'' \nThe manufacturers produce wonderful medicines, and I am all for it. But \nI want them at an affordable price for the American consumer. I am flat \nsick and tired of the American consumer being the consumer of last \nresort who pays a much higher price than anybody else in the world for \nthe same drug, in the same bottle, produced by the same company. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me go for another minute, and then I will yield to my \ncolleague from Minnesota, who will have 7 minutes remaining on the 15 \nminutes.\n  As I have indicated, Senator Johnson from South Dakota and Senator \nSnowe from Maine are also cosponsors. We expect other cosponsors to \njoin us. Frankly, the reason we have introduced this legislation is \nthat there is an unfair pricing practice that exists with respect to \nprescription drugs in this country. It is fundamentally unfair for a \npharmaceutical manufacturer to say that we will produce a drug, and, by \nthe way, when we decide to sell it we will sell it all around the \nworld, but we will choose to sell it to the American consumer at a much \nhigher price than any other customer in the world.\n\n  That is unfair to the American consumer.\n  What prevents the local corner pharmacist from going elsewhere to buy \nthese prescription drugs in France or in Canada or elsewhere? A law \nthat says you can't import a drug into this country unless it is \nimported by the manufacturer. What a ridiculous piece of legislation \nthat was passed over a decade ago.\n  If this global economy works, let's make it work for the consumers \nand not just for the big companies.\n  Our legislation only pertains to this circumstance: If the drug has \nbeen approved by the FDA and the facility where that drug is bought are \ninspected by the FDA, then those drugs have a right to come into this \ncountry not just by the manufacturer but by local pharmacists and \ndistributors who want to access that drug at a less expensive price in \nother parts of the world and pass along the savings to American \nconsumers. That makes good sense to me.\n  I have a lot more to say, but I will say it at a later time. I yield \nmy remaining time to my colleague, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, \nwho is joined by Senator Johnson of South Dakota and Senator Snowe of \nMaine as cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me first of all say to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota that I am really pleased to join him in this effort, \nalong with Senator Snowe and Senator Johnson.\n  The International Prescription Drug Parity Act makes prescription \ndrugs more affordable for millions of Americans by applying the \nprinciples of free trade and competition.\n  I want to give special thanks to a wonderful grassroots citizen \norganization from Minnesota called the Minnesota Senior Federation. If \nwe had organizations such as this all around the country, we would have \nsuch effective citizen politics, and I guarantee we would be passing \nlegislation that would make an enormous positive difference in the \nlives of the people in our country.\n  This legislation provides relief from price gouging of American \nconsumers by our own pharmaceutical industry. Those who really pay the \nprice are those who are chronically ill. Many of those who are \nclinically ill are the elderly. It is not uncommon anywhere in our \ncountry to run across an elderly couple or single individual who is \npaying up to 30, 40, or 50 percent of their monthly budget just for \nprescription drug costs.\n  In my State of Minnesota, only 35 percent of senior citizens have any \nprescription drug cost coverage at all.\n  This legislation is very simple. I say to Senator Dorgan that what I \nliked the best about this legislation, and the reason I think it will \ncommand widespread support, is its eloquent simplicity.\n  We are just saying that if you have drugs which are FDA approved and \nmanufactured in our country, and now they are in Canada, for example, \nand cost half of what they cost senior citizens to pay for that drug in \nour own country, it shouldn't just be the pharmaceutical companies that \ncan bring\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nthose drugs back in. You ought to enable pharmacists or distributors to \ngo to Canada and purchase these drugs which have been FDA approved, and \nthen bring them back to our country and sell these drugs at a discount \nrate for our citizens in our country.\n  This is the best of competition. This is the best of what we mean by \nfree trade.\n  I want to be clear. This legislation will amend the Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act. The FDA Commissioner was in Minnesota 2 weeks ago and \nsenior citizens were pressing her on this question. She was cautious. \nBut what she was saying was that we would need some legislation; we \nwould need some change to be able to do what Senator Dorgan is talking \nabout. We would amend this piece of legislation to allow American \npharmacists and distributors to import prescription drugs into the \nUnited States as long as these drugs meet strict FDA standards. That is \nit. The FDA isn't directly involved, but the FDA is critically involved \nin the sense that these drugs have to meet all the FDA standards.\n  This piece of legislation is simple. It is straightforward. It is \nvery proconsumer, very pro-senior citizen, very procompetition, very \npro-free trade. As I think about the gatherings that I go to in my \nState--I bet this applies to New Jersey, I see Senator Torricelli here, \nand Senator Reed of Rhode Island--anywhere in the country. You can't go \nto a community meeting, and you can't go in into a cafe and meet with \npeople without having people talk about the price of prescription \ndrugs. It is just prohibitively expensive. This piece of legislation \nwill make an enormous difference.\n  It could be that there is some opposition to this piece of \nlegislation. I can see some vested economic interests who may figure \nout reasons to be opposed to it, but I will say that this piece of \nlegislation would go a long way in dealing with the problem of price \ngouging right now and making sure that these prescription drugs that \ncan be so important to the health of senior citizens, the people in the \ndisabilities community and other citizens as well that they will be \nable to purchase these drugs, and they will be able to afford these \ndrugs, which can make an enormous difference in improving the quality \nof their health.\n  I introduce this legislation, along with Senator Dorgan, and we are \njoined by Senator Johnson and Senator Snowe. I believe we will have \nstrong bipartisan support for this bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have a total of 9 minutes 54 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just make a comment to the \nSenator from Minnesota, all of us have the experience of going around \nour States and talking to especially senior citizens, who take a \nsubstantial amount of prescription drugs--many of them wonderful, \nlifesaving drugs but at a substantial cost. Many of them have no health \ninsurance coverage for these costs.\n  Let me say at the outset, lest anyone think I don't appreciate what \ngoes on, that the research done at the Federal level and the research \ndone by the pharmaceutical companies have produced lifesaving, \nremarkable medicines. I commend all of those folks for that, including \nthese companies. I am only debating the price issue here.\n  I ran into a woman one day. She was in her eighties. She had heart \ndisease, diabetes, and was living on somewhere around $400 a month of \ntotal income. She said to me: Mr. Senator, I can't afford to take the \ndrugs the doctor says I must take for my heart difficulties and for my \ndiabetes. What I do is buy the drugs, and then I cut the pills in half \nand take half of the dose so it lasts twice as long. It is the only \nway. Even then I can hardly afford to pay for food.\n  That is what the problem is here. The problem is that these \npharmaceutical drugs are overpriced relative to what every other \nconsumer in the rest of the world is paying for them. I am talking of \nother consumers in France, in Germany, Italy, England, Canada, and \nMexico--you name it. That doesn't make any sense to me. Why should our \nsenior citizens--all consumers for that matter--be paying 300-percent \nmore for the same drug in virtually the same bottle produced by the \nsame company inspected by the FDA than a consumer 20 miles north in \nCanada is paying?\n  I just came from a meeting near the border of North Dakota and \nCanada. I was talking to people, again, about that disparity. The \nSenator from Minnesota has exactly the same situation.\n  The pharmacists at the corner drugstore are saying: Why can't I go up \nthere and buy some of these medications? I know that it is the same \npill which comes from the same plant.\n  The reason is the law prevents him from bringing it back, and we want \nto change that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, when we talk \nabout citizens becoming frustrated and sometimes angry, either two \nthings are going on.\n  First of all, you can find people to talk to everywhere, especially \nsenior citizens who are paying 30, 40, or 50 percent of their monthly \nbudget just for these costs. They cut the pill in half and take only \nhalf of what they need, or they cut down on food. It is drugs versus \nfood, or versus something else. They should not be faced with those \nchoices.\n  But what adds insult to injury is to then know that the same drug \nmanufactured quite often in the same place with the same FDA approval \npurchased in Canada costs half the price.\n  We are simply saying let our pharmacists and let our distributors in \nour country be able to purchase those prescription drugs in Canada and \nbring them back and sell them at a discount to our consumers. That is \nwhat this legislation says.\n  If you want to talk about a piece of legislation that speaks to the \ninterests and circumstances of people's lives, I think this legislation \nwill make an enormous difference.\n  I am prepared to fight very hard to make sure that we pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Bryan):\n  S. 1192. A bill to designate national forest land managed by the \nForest Service in the Lake Tahoe Basin as the ``Lake Tahoe National \nScenic Forest and Recreation Area,'' and to promote environmental \nrestoration around the Lake Tahoe Basin; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                     THE LAKE TAHOE RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking Senator \nHarry Reid who has worked so hard with me on the Lake Tahoe Restoration \nAct. I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues Senator \nBarbara Boxer and Senator Dick Bryan for cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  This legislation really comes directly out of the Tahoe Summit. I am \none that spent her childhood at lake Tahoe, but I had not been back for \na number of years. When I went there for the Tahoe Summit in 1997 with \nthe President, I saw things I had never seen before at Lake Tahoe.\n  I saw the penetration of MTBE in the water. I saw the gasoline spread \nover the water surface. I saw that in fact 30 percent of the South Lake \nTahoe water supply has been eliminated by MTBE. I saw 25 percent of the \nmagnificent forest that surrounds the lake dead or dying. I saw land \nerosion problems on a major level that were bringing all kinds of \nsediment into the lake and which had effectively cut its clarity by \nthirty feet since the last time I had visited. And then I learned that \nthe experts believe that in ten years the clouding of the amazing \ncrystal water clarity would be impossible to reverse and in thirty \nyears it would be lost forever.\n  For me, that was a call to action, and today I am proud to introduce \nthe Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. This legislation will designate federal \nlands in the Lake Tahoe Basin as a National Scenic Forest and \nRecreation area and will authorize $300 million of Federal monies on a \nmatching basis over ten years for environmental restoration projects to \npreserve the region's water quality and forest health.\n  Lake Tahoe is the crown jewel of the Sierra Nevada and its clear, \nblue water is simply remarkable. Some people may not know that Lake \nTahoe contributes $1.6 billion dollars every year\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nto the economy from tourism alone. However, one in every seven trees in \nthe forest surrounding Emerald Bay is either dead or dying. Insect \ninfestations and drought have killed over 25 percent of the trees in \nthe forests surrounding Lake Tahoe, creating a severe risk of wildfire.\n  The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that restoring the lake \nand its surrounding forests will cost $900 million dollars over the \nnext ten years. This is not a cursory evaluation but a careful \nevaluation made by this agency over several years.\n  Local governments and businesses in Lake Tahoe have agreed to raise \n$300 million locally in the next ten years for this effort. The Tahoe \nTransportation and Water Quality Coalition, a coalition of 18 \nbusinesses and environmental groups, including Placer County, El Dorado \nCounty, the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglass County in Nevada and \nWashoe County in Nevada have all agreed. This is an extraordinary \ncommitment for a region with only 50,000 year round residents.\n  The Governors of California and Nevada have pledged to provide \nanother $300 million, but only if the Federal government will step up \nand provide $300 million of its own because we must remember that 77 \npercent of the forest is owned by the Federal Government.\n  President Clinton took an important first step in 1997 when he held \nan environmental summit at Lake Tahoe and promised $50 million over two \nyears for restoration activities around the lake. These commitments \nincluded: $4.5 million to reduce fire risk at the lake; $3.5 million \nfor public transportation; $4 million for acquisition of \nenvironmentally sensitive land; $1.3 million dollars to decommission \nold, unused logging roads that are a major source of sediment into Lake \nTahoe; $7.5 million to replace an aging waste water pipeline that \nthreatens to leak sewage into the lake; and $3 million for scientific \nresearch.\n  Unfortunately, the President's commitments lasted for only two years, \nso important areas like land acquisition and road decommissioning were \nnot funded at the levels the President tried to accomplish. So what is \nneeded is a more sustained, long-term effort, and one that will meet \nthe federal government's $300 million dollar responsibility to save the \nenvironment at Lake Tahoe.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will build upon the President's \ncommitment to Lake Tahoe and authorize full funding for a new \nenvironmental restoration program at the lake.\n  The bill designates U.S. Forest Service lands in the Lake Tahoe basin \nas the Lake Tahoe National Scenic Forest and Recreation Area. This \ndesignation, which is unique to Lake Tahoe, is strongly supported by \nlocal business, environmental, and community leaders. The designation \nwill recognize Lake Tahoe as a priceless scenic and recreational \nresource.\n  The legislation explicitly says that nothing in the bill gives the \nU.S. Forest Service regulatory authority over private or non-federal \nland. The bill also requires the Forest Service to develop an annual \npriority list of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $200 \nmillion over ten years to the forest service to implement these \nprojects on federal lands. The list must include projects that will \nimprove water quality, forest health, soil conservation, air quality, \nand fish and wildlife habitat around the lake.\n  In developing the environmental restoration priority list, the Forest \nService must rely on the best available science, and consider projects \nthat local governments, businesses, and environmental groups have \ntargeted as top priorities. The Forest Service also must consult with \nlocal community leaders.\n  The bill requires the Forest Service to give special attention on its \npriority list to four key activities: acquisition of environmentally \nsensitive land from willing sellers, erosion and sediment control, fire \nrisk reduction, and traffic and parking management, including promotion \nof public transportation.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act also requires that $100 million of the \n$300 million over ten years be in payments to local governments for \nerosion control activities on non-federal lands. These payments will \nhelp local governments conduct soil conservation and erosion mitigation \nprojects, restore wetlands and stream environmental zones, and plant \nnative vegetation to filter out sediment and debris.\n  I have been working on the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act for over a \nyear, in conjunction with Senator Reid and over a dozen community \ngroups at Lake Tahoe. The Lake Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality \nCoalition, a local consensus group of 18 businesses and environmental \ngroups, has worked extremely hard on this bill, and I am grateful for \ntheir input and support.\n  Thanks in large part to their work, the bill has strong, bi-partisan \nsupport from nearly every major group in the Tahoe Basin. The bill is \nsupported by the League to Save Lake Tahoe, the South Lake Tahoe \nChamber of Commerce, and the Lake Tahoe Gaming Alliance, to name just a \nfew. Major environmental groups also support the bill, including the \nSierra Club, Wilderness Society, and California League of Conservation \nVoters.\n  The bottom line is that time is running out for Lake Tahoe. We have \nten years to do something major or the water quality deterioration is \nirreversible.\n  We have a limited period of time, or the 25 percent of the dead and \ndying trees and the combustible masses that it produced are sure to \ncatch fire, and a major forest fire will result.\n  Mr. President, this crown jewel deserves the attention, and the fact \nthat the federal government owns 77 percent of that troubled area makes \nthe responsibility all so clear.\n  I am hopeful that the United States Senate will move quickly to \nconsider the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to join me in preserving this national treasure for generations \nto come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1193. A bill to improve the safety of animals transported on \naircraft, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  THE SAFE AIR TRAVEL FOR ANIMALS ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a piece of legislation which I \nrise to introduce. This legislation is designed to protect a segment of \nour population that can't protect itself. I am talking about pets--\ndogs, cats, and others that travel by air. I want to put this into \nperspective. Over 70 million households in America have pets--70 \nmillion. So it affects a significant portion of our population. Pets \nbecome family members and they become a source of significant affection \nand attachment. In some cases, they are the vision for those who are \nsightless. They establish precious relationships.\n  Over the last 5 years, there have been over 2,500 documented \ninstances of dogs and cats experiencing severe injury in air travel, \nand 108 cats and dogs have died just as a result of exposure to \nexcessive temperatures.\n  Pets aren't baggage. They are part of a family, in many instances, \nand they ought to be treated that way when they accompany their masters \nwhen they fly. Over 500,000 pets a year are transported by air across \nthis country. News reports have detailed stories of pets being left out \non hot days, sitting on tarmacs while flights were delayed, or stuffed \ninto cargo holds with little or no airflow, causing them to injure \nthemselves in the desperation to escape this entrapment and very \ndifficult environment.\n  Some pets have actually had heavy baggage placed directly on top of \ntheir carriers. It is unacceptable. We can and must prevent these \ninhumane practices.\n  So today I am introducing The Safe Air Travel for Animals Act. This \nbill responds to the tragic stories we have heard involving the death \nor injury of many beloved pets while traveling by airplane.\n  The legislation has three goals. First, it ensures that airlines are \nheld accountable for mistreatment of our pets, to ensure that animals \nare not treated like a set of golf clubs or other baggage. This \nlegislation will put airlines on a tight leash.\n  Second, the bill provides consumers with the right to know if an \nairline has a record of mistreatment or accidents with pets.\n  Third, the bill addresses the problems of the aircraft themselves, \nmaking sure that the cargo hold is as safe as it possibly can be for \nanimal travel.\n  Airlines need to be held accountable for the harm they permit to \nhappen to\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nour pets. Right now, airlines are only liable to owners for up to \n$1,250 for losing, injuring, or killing a pet.\n  That is no different from what they would be liable for if they lost \nyour suitcase. Under my bill, that limit for liability will be double.\n  Now, anyone who owns a pet knows how expensive veterinary bills can \nbe. If an animal is injured or dies as a result of flying, my bill \nwould require the airlines to pay for the costs of veterinary care.\n  Mr. President, my bill also provides consumers with the right to know \nabout the conditions they face when they transport their animals by \nplane. My bill requires airlines to immediately report any incidents \ninvolving loss, injury or death of animals.\n  Most importantly, the bill puts this information into the hands of \nthe flying public. Pet owners should know which airlines are doing a \ngood job, and which need to do better. Just as consumers favor airlines \nwith solid, on-time records, they will also favor the airlines that \nhave a good safety record with our pets. And, an airline that does a \ngood job will want this information in the hands of consumers.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the problem of the aircraft themselves. \nThe airline industry is undergoing a retrofitting process, as required \nby the FAA, of all ``class D'' cargo holds, to prevent fires.\n  These are special holds that have the facility to turn off the oxygen \nin the event of smoke or fire. But that also means that that is an \nexecution for the pets that are in those holds.\n  I believe that the industry should use this opportunity to see what \nimprovements can be made to allow for better oxygen flow and \ntemperature control to protect our pets.\n  Mr. President, we must do more to prevent unnecessary deaths caused \nby lack of oxygen flow or exposure to heat.\n  With this bill, travelers will feel more secure about using air \ntravel to transport their pets.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 1196. A bill to improve the quality, timeliness, and credibility \nof forensic science services for criminal justice purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE NATIONAL FORENSIC SCIENCE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Forensic \nScience Improvement Act, a bill designed to address the growing backlog \nin our nation's crime labs. Across the country, state and local crime \nlabs, Medical Examiners' and Coroners' offices face alarming shortages \nin forensic science resources. While other areas of our criminal \njustice system such as the courts and prison systems have benefitted \nfrom federal assistance, the highly technical and expensive forensic \nsciences have received little attention. Mr. President, my bill will \nhelp correct this problem.\n  There are 600 qualified state and local crime laboratories in the \nUnited States which deliver 90% of the total forensic science services \nin this country. In a 1996 national survey of 299 crime labs it was \nfound that 8 out of 10 labs have experienced a growth in the caseload \nwhich exceeds the growth in budget and/or staff. Mr. President, I need \ngo no further to demonstrate that this is a national problem. Without \nthe swift processing of evidence our criminal justice system cannot \noperate as it is intended. I believe it is time to take a step to \naddress specifically the problems our crime labs face.\n  The National Forensic Science Improvement Act has been endorsed by \norganizations such as the National Governors Association, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the Association of State Criminal \nInvestigative Agencies and the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice who see it as a flexible approach to a problem that indeed has \nfar-ranging consequences. Mr. President, it is my belief that Congress \nmust work to ensure justice in this country is neither delayed nor \ndenied. Right now across the country backlogs in crime labs are denying \nthe swift administration of justice and with this bill we have a ready \nsolution.\n  In crafting this bill I have worked closely with the Georgia Bureau \nof Investigation which is suffering heavily under a growing caseload. \nAt its headquarters in Decatur, GA the GBI has a number of cataloging \nsystems that are not yet computerized. Further, they lack the funding \nto create computer networks that would connect not only their forensic \nequipment with internal computers, but would also allow them to share \ninformation with crime labs across the country. While the Governor has \ntaken steps to provide the GBI with more funding for forensic sciences, \nit remains clear that federal assistance is needed.\n  Last year the Senate passed the Crime Identification Technology Act. \nThis important measure, which I supported, was a good step towards \nimproving the technology employed by law enforcement across the \ncountry. I believe my bill is the next logical step in this body's \neffort to improve the manner in which justice is administered in this \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Levin, \n        and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1197. A bill to prohibit the importation of products made with dog \nor cat fur, to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, \ntransportation, and distribution of products made with dog or cat fur \nin the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   DOG AND CAT PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nruns to the heart of who we are and what we hold dear and meaningful in \nour lives.\n  There is a special relationship between men, women, children, and \ntheir family pets--particularly their dogs and cats.\n  I have been profoundly affected in my life because of the animals \nthat transcended emotional boundaries to become true and meaningful \nfriends--even a part of the family. I can name every dog I've owned \nsince I was a boy.\n  I can tell you their qualities, their peculiarities, their \npreferences and dislikes. Even now, my wife Jane and I--our children \nand grandchildren--are surrounded by the most loyal St. Bernards in the \nworld. They--as all the pets we've had--speak volumes about strong and \nlasting friendship.\n  You can understand, given this background, that I am outraged to \nlearn that there are clothing articles imported into America that are \nmade from the fur of these precious animals.\n  I'm outraged to learn that dog and cat fur is being used in a wide \nvariety of products, including fur coats and jackets.\n  I'm outraged to learn from the Humane Society of the United States \nthat more than two million dogs and cats are killed annually as part of \nthe fur trade, and that many retailers in the U.S. who sell these items \nare doing so unaware of their content.\n  To respond to this growing problem, I'm introducing legislation \ntoday, the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 1999, to prohibit the domestic \nsale, manufacture, transportation, and distribution of products made \nwith cat or dog fur.\n  My legislation requires all fur products to be labelled, closing a \nloophole in the current law, and it will ban deceptive or misleading \nlabelling of these products so consumers and retailers can buy with \nconfidence, knowing that they are not supporting this tragic process.\n  With this legislation, our message will be clear: No matter where in \nthe world this merchandise is made, there will be no legitimate market \nfor it here--not in the United States.\n  This is important legislation. It will provide uniformity of \nregulations and prevent conflicts between states. It will give the \nJustice Department the ability to enforce the law and prosecute those \nwho may try to get around it.\n  And the U.S. Customs Service would be able to function as the first \nline of defense. I appreciate the work being done by the Humane Society \nof the United States and many other important organizations to heighten \nour awareness of these kinds of issues.\n  And I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this \nlegislation enacted into law. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dog and Cat Protection Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered \n     and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. \n     Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of \n     products, including fur coats and jackets, fur-trimmed \n     garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed \n     animals, and other toys.\n       (2) As demonstrated by forensic tests, dog and cat fur \n     products are being imported into the United States, in some \n     cases with deceptive labeling to conceal the use of dog or \n     cat fur.\n       (3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily \n     distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other \n     furs such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink. Dog and cat \n     fur is generally less expensive than other types of fur and \n     may be used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs.\n       (4) Foreign fur producers use dogs and cats bred for their \n     fur, and also use strays and stolen pets.\n       (5) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering \n     dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated \n     and inhumane.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, \n     transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog \n     and cat fur products;\n       (2) to require accurate labeling of fur species so that \n     consumers in the United States can make informed choices; and\n       (3) to prohibit the trade in, both imports and exports of, \n     dog and cat fur products, to ensure that the United States \n     market does not encourage the slaughter of dogs or cats for \n     their fur, and to ensure that the purposes of this Act are \n     not undermined.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Dog fur.--The term ``dog fur'' means the pelt or skin \n     of any animal of the species canis familiaris.\n       (2) Cat fur.--The term ``cat fur'' means the pelt or skin \n     of any animal of the species felis catus.\n       (3) United states.--The term ``United States'' means the \n     customs territory of the United States, as defined in general \n     note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States.\n       (4) Commerce.--The term ``commerce'' means transportation \n     for sale, trade, or use between any State, territory, or \n     possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, \n     and any place outside thereof.\n       (5) Dog or cat fur product.--The term ``dog or cat fur \n     product'' means any item of merchandise which consists, or is \n     composed in whole or in part, of any dog fur, cat fur, or \n     both.\n       (6) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any individual, \n     partnership, corporation, association, organization, business \n     trust, government entity, or other entity.\n       (7) Interested party.--The term ``interested party'' means \n     any person having a contractual, financial, humane, or other \n     interest.\n       (8) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Treasury.\n       (9) Duly authorized officer.--The term ``duly authorized \n     officer'' means any United States Customs officer, any agent \n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any agent or other \n     person authorized by law or designated by the Secretary to \n     enforce the provisions of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4.

OF THE UNITED STATES \n   BE RECITED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DAILY SESSION OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and Mr. Helms) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S. Res. 113\n\n       Whereas the Flag of the United States of America is our \n     Nation's most revered and preeminent symbol;\n       Whereas the Flag of the United States of America is \n     recognized and respected throughout the world as a symbol of \n     democracy, freedom, and human rights;\n       Whereas, in the words of the Chief Justice of the United \n     States, the Flag of the United States of America ``in times \n     of national crisis, inspires and motivates the average \n     citizen to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve \n     societal goals of overriding importance . . . and serves as a \n     reminder of the paramount importance of pursuing the ideals \n     that characterize our society'';\n       Whereas the House of Representatives of the United States \n     has opened each of its daily sessions with the Pledge of \n     Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America since \n     1988; and\n       Whereas opening each of the daily sessions of the Senate of \n     the United States with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag \n     of the United States would demonstrate reverence for the Flag \n     and serve as a daily reminder to all Senators of the ideals \n     that it represents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That paragraph 1(a) of rule IV of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate is amended by inserting after ``prayer by \n     the Chaplain'' the following: ``and after the Presiding \n     Officer leads the Senate in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance \n     to the Flag of the United States''.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the resolution that I am \nsubmitting today provides that immediately following the prayer such as \nwe just heard this morning by Chaplain Ogilvie, at the beginning of \neach daily session of the Senate, the Presiding Officer of the Senate \nwould lead the Senate in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the \nUnited States.\n  I am pleased and honored that the chairman of the Rules Committee, \nSenator McConnell, as well as Senator Feinstein, Senator Helms, an \nSenator Lott, have joined me as original cosponsors of this resolution.\n  The flag of the United States is our most revered and preeminent \nsymbol, and the flag is recognized and respected throughout the world \nas a symbol of democracy, freedom, and human rights. As you know, the \nHouse of Representatives has such a flag salute in the morning at the \nbeginning of each day. I think it is appropriate that the Senate follow \nsuit. It is probably long overdue.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, has \nwritten that the flag of the United States of America ``in times of \nnational crisis, inspires and motivates the average citizen to make \npersonal sacrifices in order to achieve societal goals of overriding \nimportance . . . and serves as a reminder of the paramount importance \nof pursuing the ideals that characterize our society.''\n  Many Americans, including my father, have given their lives to \nprotect freedom and democracy as symbolized by this flag. Our family \nwas presented with a flag at the burial, as so many other families of \nveterans have also experienced. It means a great deal, and I think it \nis appropriate that we salute the flag every morning to start our \nbusiness.\n  Since 1988, as I said, the House of Representatives has demonstrated \nits reverence and respect for the flag, and all of the ideals for which \nit stands, by opening its morning session with the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  I wish to give credit to a constituent of mine. I would like to take \ncredit for the idea--perhaps I should have thought of it--but it came \nfrom Rebecca Stewart of Enfield, NH, who recently contacted my office \nand suggested that the Senate should do what the House does--open each \nsession with the Pledge of Allegiance. I thought that was a great idea \nand contacted several members of the Senate Rules Committee to get a \nsense of the level of support on that committee for the idea, and I was \npleased and delighted by the response from Rules.\n  The result then is the resolution I am submitting today. I might also \nin conclusion point out that Monday, June 14, is Flag Day. It would be \na great tribute if we could get this resolution to the floor and pass \nit sometime on or before Monday, June 14. We do have time this week to \ndo that. It is my hope we can move this legislation out of Rules \nquickly and bring it to the floor. I understand Senator McConnell will \nbe in the Chamber to speak on this matter very shortly.\n  Mr. President, I trust that the Senate will see fit to promptly adopt \nthis resolution. I hope that it will receive the unanimous support of \nmy colleagues in the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Bob Smith, introduced a rules\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nchange which I, as chairman of the Rules Committee, am happy to \ncosponsor. I commend our colleague, Senator Bob Smith, for an excellent \nand outstanding idea.\n  Since 1892, Americans have expressed their reverence for the flag of \nthis Nation and all it represents by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThe Pledge was first recited at the 1892 World's Fair to commemorate \nthe 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Since that time, \nhundreds and thousands of civic organizations and schoolchildren have \ntaken time before turning to their work to recite these moving words:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n  Mr. President, I can remember as a schoolchild in Athens, Alabama, \nstanding at my desk, placing my hand over my heart, fixing my eyes upon \nthe flag, and reciting these eloquent words. I suspect many of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate had the same experience in school as they \nwere growing up.\n  Even at that early age, pledging allegiance to the flag encouraged me \nto think about the history and ideals of this Nation. It was an \nimportant ritual for schoolchildren then. It should be an important \nritual for the Senate now.\n  Presently, we begin each day's business here in the Senate with a \nprayer. This solemn act reminds us of certain principles and values \nthat we as a people hold dear. Similarly, daily recitation of the \npledge would serve as an inspirational start to each legislative day.\n  The pledge is a time for reflecting on the inspiring history and \nideals of liberty and freedom that the Stars and Stripes represents. \nSetting aside this time each day will serve to remind Americans of the \nvenerated place the flag holds in our country and our culture.\n  Mr. President, among my most prized possessions is the American flag \nwhich honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's service to our \nNation. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantel in my Senate \noffice.\n  A clinical assessment of that flag would conclude that it is some \nmixture of cotton fabric, dyed red, white, and blue. But for me, it \nharkens back to the selfless patriotism of a father who fought for his \nNation during World War II, a father who instilled in his son an awe \nand abiding respect for this great Nation we are all so fortunate to \ncall home.\n  Old Glory has been a beacon of hope for over 200 years, a touchstone \nfor patriotic Americans, and a source of comfort and pride for \nindividuals at home and abroad. In the words of Senator Charles Sumner, \n``In a foreign land, the flag is companionship, and country itself, \nwith all its endearments.''\n  The flag is, without question, a powerful symbol the world over. For \nnearly every American, it is the most powerful patriotic inspiration.\n  It is my distinct honor today to cosponsor this resolution as \nchairman of the Senate Rules Committee. I also want to commend my good \nfriend from New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith, for an excellent idea and \nfor his leadership on this issue.

SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE BUREAU OF THE CENSUS \n                   SHOULD INCLUDE IN THE 2000 DECENNIAL CENSUS ALL \n                   CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES RESIDING ABROAD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Bureau of the Census has announced its intention to \n     exclude more than 3,000,000 citizens of the United States \n     living and working overseas from the 2000 decennial census \n     because such citizens are not affiliated with the Federal \n     Government.\n       (2) The Bureau of the Census has stated its desire to make \n     the 2000 decennial census ``the most accurate ever''.\n       (3) Exports by the United States of goods, services, and \n     expertise play a vital role in strengthening the economy of \n     the United States--\n       (A) by creating jobs based in the United States; and\n       (B) by extending the influence of the United States around \n     the globe.\n       (4) Citizens of the United States living and working \n     overseas strengthen the economy of the United States--\n       (A) by purchasing and selling United States exports; and\n       (B) by creating business opportunities for United States \n     companies and workers.\n       (5) Citizens of the United States living and working \n     overseas play a key role in advancing the interests of the \n     United States around the world as highly visible economic, \n     political, and cultural ambassadors.\n       (6) In 1990, as a result of widespread bipartisan support \n     in Congress, the Bureau of the Census enumerated all United \n     States Government officials and other citizens of the United \n     States affiliated with the Federal Government living and \n     working overseas for the apportionment of representatives \n     among the several States and for other purposes.\n       (7) In the 2000 decennial census, the Bureau of the Census \n     again intends to so enumerate all such officials and other \n     citizens of the United States.\n       (8) The Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act of 1975 gave \n     citizens of the United States residing abroad the right to \n     vote by absentee ballot in any Federal election in the State \n     in which the citizen was last domiciled over 2 decades ago.\n       (9) Citizens of the United States who live and work \n     overseas, but who are not affiliated with the Federal \n     Government, vote in elections and pay taxes.\n       (10) Organizations that represent individuals and companies \n     overseas, including both Republicans Abroad and Democrats \n     Abroad, support the inclusion of all citizens of the United \n     States residing abroad in the 2000 decennial census.\n       (11) The Internet facilitates easy maintenance of close \n     contact with all citizens of the United States throughout the \n     world.\n       (12) All citizens of the United States living and working \n     overseas should be included in the 2000 decennial census.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Bureau of the Census should enumerate all citizens \n     of the United States residing overseas in the 2000 decennial \n     census; and\n       (2) legislation authorizing and appropriating the funds \n     necessary to carry out such an enumeration should be enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6801-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6801-S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 114--DESIGNATING JUNE 22, 1999, AS ``NATIONAL \n                     PEDIATRIC AIDS AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bond, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Biden, Mr. Warner, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Hollings, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nFitzgerald, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Robb, Mr. Mack, Mr. Torricelli, \nMr. Abraham, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Burns, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Specter, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Frist, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lott, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nKerrey, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Resolution \nrecognizing June 22, 1999, as ``National Pediatrics AIDS Awareness \nDay.'' I am sponsoring this resolution today with my colleague Senator \nBoxer from California and 52 of our other colleagues of the Senate.\n  Senator Boxer and I are cochairs for the 10th anniversary of the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which promises to be a \nwonderful event. But, more importantly, through the generosity of many \nindividuals and organizations, substantial funds will be raised to \nfurther the research necessary to defeat this disease which threatens \nso many lives--including children.\n  Infection of children with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is \nvery different than infection in adults. Infected children get sick \nfaster; their immune systems may deteriorate more quickly; treatment \nprotocols are very different; and they often involve more \ncomplications. Almost all children with HIV infection have acquired the \nvirus from their mothers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, before \npreventive treatments were available, an estimated 1,000-2,000 babies \nwere born with HIV infection each year in the United States.\n  Today, because of scientific and medical breakthroughs in \npharmaceutical therapies, the mother-to-infant transmission rate has \ndropped from 43% in 1992 to 8% in 1997. The investment in prevention \nalone has resulted in avoiding an estimated 656 HIV infections and \nsaves $105.6 million in medical care costs. Thus we are indeed seeing \nresults from the time, energy, and resources being expended to fight \nthis dreaded disease. My hat is off to those front line researchers and \nclinicians who have devoted themselves to this task.\n  While significant advances have been made in decreasing pediatric HIV \ninfection, we must continue to work tirelessly to develop an HIV \nvaccine that will enable the safe and effective immunization of \nchildren and adults. We must better understand why HIV/AIDS \ndisproportionately affects children of color and find cures to \neradicate this epidemic. For our children living with HIV, we must \nprovide them with the best possible therapeutic and social support to \nensure their long, high quality life. I urge all senators to join me on \nJune 22 at the National Building Museum to celebrate the successes \nwhich have been achieved in fighting HIV and AIDS among our youth and \nto renew our pledge to fight this disease until it disappears from the \nface of this earth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very honored to rise today with my \ngood friend, Senator Hatch, to submit a resolution designating June 22 \nas National Pediatric AIDS Awareness Day.\n  I am proud that we have the cosponsorship of 52 of our colleagues, \nwhich demonstrates a broad interest in the issue of children and AIDS.\n  Incredibly, AIDS is the seventh leading cause of death for children \nin the United States. We have lost 2.7 million precious children to \nthis epidemic--a staggering and sobering statistic.\n  Our resolution recognizes and commemorates the children, families, \nand countless others in the health and education communities who have \ndedicated their substantial time and efforts to prevention and \neradication of AIDS.\n  It also recognizes the 10th anniversary of the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation, an outstanding charitable organization which \nhas devoted years of effort to the education, research, and prevention \nof HIV transmission and disease.\n  I hope the Senate will act quickly on this resolution to recognize \nthe devastating effects of this terrible disease on millions of \nAmerican children and their families, and to honor the contributions of \nthousands of others who are working to end the epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6802-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6802-S6810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 608\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lott, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Frist, \nMr. Burns, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Lieberman) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between \nand among the several States by providing for the orderly resolution of \ndisputes arising out of computer-based problems related to processing \ndata that includes a 2-digit expression of that year's date; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\n     many businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, particularly small businesses and \n     individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, \n     because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with  the Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Y2K action.--The term ``Y2K action''--\n       (A) means a civil action commenced in any Federal or State \n     court, or an agency board of contract appeal proceeding, in \n     which the plaintiff's alleged harm or injury resulted from a \n     Y2K failure;\n       (B) includes a civil action commenced in any Federal or \n     State court by a governmental entity when acting in a \n     commercial or contracting capacity; but\n       (C) does not include an action brought by a governmental \n     entity acting in a regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement \n     capacity.\n       (2) Y2K failure.--The term ``Y2K failure'' means failure by \n     any device or system (including any computer system and any \n     microchip or integrated circuit embedded in another device or \n     product), or any software, firmware, or other set or \n     collection of processing instructions to process, to \n     calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, to store, to \n     transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related data, \n     including failures--\n       (A) to deal with or account for transitions or comparisons \n     from, into, and between the years 1999 and 2000 accurately;\n       (B) to recognize or accurately to process any specific date \n     in 1999, 2000, or 2001; or\n       (C) accurately to account for the year 2000's status as a \n     leap year, including recognition and processing of the \n     correct date on February 29, 2000.\n       (3) Government entity.--The term ``government entity'' \n     means an agency, instrumentality, or other entity of Federal, \n     State, or local government (including multijurisdictional \n     agencies, instrumentalities, and entities).\n       (4) Material defect.--The term ``material defect'' means a \n     defect in any item, whether tangible or intangible, or in the \n     provision of a service, that substantially prevents the item \n     or service from operating or functioning as designed or \n     according to its specifications.

APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after January 1, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n       (f) Application with Year 2000 Information and Readiness \n     Disclosure Act.--Nothing in this Act supersedes any provision \n     of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant described in \n     paragraph (2) in a Y2K action may not exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Defendant described.--A defendant described in this \n     paragraph is a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, or organization with fewer than 50 \n     full-time employees.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Paragraph (1) \n     does not apply if the plaintiff establishes by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific \n     intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant \n     (other than a defendant who has entered into a settlement \n     agreement with the plaintiff)--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each such person and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Norwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge arising \n     out of the action. The order shall bar all future claims for \n     contribution arising out to the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contributions.--An action \n     for contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be \n     brought not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.-- Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7.

If any \n     defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling \n     over the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and \n     (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise pre-empts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8.

DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contracts; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or \n     State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c) whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal and State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     element of the claim by the standard of evidence under \n     applicable State law in effect before January 1, 1999.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves, by the standard of evidence under applicable \n     State law in effect before January 1, 1999, that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do not include claims such \n     as fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n     contract for such a failure is governed by the terms of the \n     contract.\n       (d) Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness \n     Disclosure Act Apply.--The protections for the exchanges of \n     information provided by section 4 of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act (Public Law 105-271) \n     shall apply to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 14. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATE JUDGES \n                   FOR Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate judge to hear the matter and to make findings of \n     fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 15. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Material Defect Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     an estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A)(i) a substantial majority of the members of the \n     proposed plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (ii) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (iii) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State; or\n       (B) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or \n     other government entities against whom the United States \n     District Court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n       (d) Effect on Rules of Civil Procedure.--Except as \n     otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section \n     supersedes any rule of Federal or State civil procedure \n     applicable to class actions.\n       Amend the title so as to read: An Act to regulate commerce \n     between and among the several States by providing for the \n     orderly resolution of disputes arising out of computer-based \n     problems related to processing data that includes a 2-digit \n     expression of the year's date through fostering an incentive \n     for businesses to continue fixing and testing their systems, \n     to communicate with other businesses, resolve year-2000 \n     business disputes without litigation, and to settle year 2000 \n     lawsuits that may disrupt significant sectors of the American \n     economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        ALLARD AMENDMENT NO. 609\n\n  Mr. ALLARD proposed an amendment to amendment No. 608 proposed by Mr. \nMcCain to the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\n     to encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Y2K action.--The term ``Y2K action''--\n       (A) means a civil action commenced in any Federal or State \n     court, or an agency board of contract appeal proceeding, in \n     which the plaintiff's alleged harm or injury resulted from a \n     Y2K failure, or a claim or defense is related to a Y2K \n     failure;\n       (B) includes a civil action commenced in any Federal or \n     State court by a governmental entity when acting in a \n     commercial or contracting capacity; but\n       (C) does not include an action brought by a governmental \n     entity acting in a regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement \n     capacity.\n       (2)  Y2K failure.--The term ``Y2K failure'' means failure \n     by any device or system (including any computer system and \n     any microchip or integrated circuit embedded in another \n     device or product), or any software, firmware, or other set \n     or collection of processing instructions to process, to \n     calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, to store, to \n     transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related data, \n     including failures--\n       (A) to deal with or account for transitions or comparisons \n     from, into, and between the years 1999 and 2000 accurately;\n       (B) to recognize or accurately to process any specific date \n     in 1999, 2000, or 2001; or\n       (C) accurately to account for the year 2000's status as a \n     leap year, including recognition and processing of the \n     correct date on February 29, 2000.\n       (3) Government entity.--The term ``government entity'' \n     means an agency, instrumentality, or other entity of Federal, \n     State, or local government (including multijurisdictional \n     agencies, instrumentalities, and entities).\n       (4) Material defect.--The term ``material defect'' means a \n     defect in any item, whether tangible or intangible, or in the \n     provision of a service, that substantially prevents the item \n     or service from operating or functioning as designed or \n     according to its specifications. The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (6) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (7) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Application of Act Limited.--Except as otherwise \n     indicated, this Act applies only to claims for commercial \n     loss between incorporated or unincorporated businesses, \n     associations, organizations, and enterprises, including any \n     sole proprietorship, corporation, company (including any \n     joint stock company), association, partnership, trust, or \n     governmental entity.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law in effect on January 1, 1999, specifically \n     addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n       (f) Securities Actions Excluded.--This Act does not apply \n     to a securities claim brought under the securities laws (as \n     defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47)).\n\n     SEC. 5. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     noncontractual Y2K action shall be liable solely for the \n     portion of the judgment that corresponds to the relative and \n     proportional responsibility of that person. In determining \n     the percentage of responsibility of any defendant, the trier \n     of fact shall determine that percentage as a percentage of \n     the total fault of all persons, including the plaintiff, who \n     caused or contributed to the total loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs concerning the percentage of \n     responsibility, if any, of each defendant, measured as a \n     percentage of the total fault of all persons who caused or \n     contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Intentional Tort or Failure to \n     Remediate.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and \n     several--\n       (A) if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant committed an intentional tort; or\n       (B) unless the defendant demonstrates by a preponderance of \n     the evidence both that the defendant--\n       (i) identified the potential for Y2K failure of the device \n     or system used or sold by the defendant that experienced the \n     Y2K failure alleged to have caused the plaintiff's harm; and\n       (ii) provided information calculated to reach persons \n     likely to experience Y2K failures of that device or system \n     concerning reasonable steps to avert or mitigate the \n     potential Y2K failure.\n       (2) Intentional Tort.--For purposes of paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, reckless conduct by the defendant does not \n     constitute commission of an intentional tort by the \n     defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection to be \n     jointly and severally liable.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage \n     of responsibility of that defendant.\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that over defendant's proportionate share of that payment; or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge and General Right of \n     Contribution.--With the exception of contribution in the case \n     of an uncollectible share, nothing in this section\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\n     shall be construed to preempt or modify any State law or rule \n     governing discharge of defendants who enter into settlements \n     or the right of any jointly and severally liable defendant to \n     seek contribution from any other person.\n       (f) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 6. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a verifiable written \n     notice by certified mail to each prospective defendant in \n     that action. The notice shall provide specific and detailed \n     information about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy; and\n       (5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any \n     individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the \n     dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.\n       (b) Person to Whom Notice To Be Sent.--The notice required \n     by subsection (a) shall be sent--\n       (1) to the registered agent of the prospective defendant \n     for service of legal process;\n       (2) if the prospective defendant does not have a registered \n     agent, then to the chief executive officer of a corporation, \n     the managing partner of a partnership, the proprietor of a \n     sole proprietorship, or to a similarly-situated person for \n     any other enterprise; or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissability.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence a legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff in its initial response to the plaintiff. If any \n     defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 7. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application with Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Natre and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 8. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       In addition to any duty to mitigate imposed by State law, \n     if the defendant has made available to purchasers or users, \n     as appropriate, of the defendant's product or services \n     information concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K \n     failure alleged to have caused plaintiff's damages, damages \n     awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude compensation for \n     damages the plaintiff could reasonably have avoided in light \n     of any such information, whether made available by the \n     defendant or others, of which the plaintiff was, or \n     reasonably should have been, aware.\n\n     SEC. 9. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility \n     and commerical impracticability shall be determined by the \n     law in existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act \n     shall be construed as limiting or impairing a party's \n     right to assert defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 10. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract, unless \n     enforcement of the term in question would manifestly and \n     directly contravene applicable State law on January 1, 1999, \n     directly addressing that term; or\n       (2) by operation of State law at the time the contract was \n     effective or by operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss involving a \n     defective device or system or service unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party;\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to property \n     caused by the Y2K failure (other than damage to property that \n     is the subject of the contract between the parties to the Y2K \n     action or, in the event there is no contract between the \n     parties, other than damage caused only to the property that \n     experienced the Y2K failure), and such damages are permitted \n     under applicable Federal or State law; or\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\n       (3) the defendant committed an intentional tort, except \n     where the tort involves misrepresentation or fraud regarding \n     the attributes or capabilities of the product that forms the \n     basis for the underlying claim.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c) whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n       (e) Device or System.--For purposes of subsection (a), a \n     ``device or system'' means any device or system (including \n     any computer system and any microchip or integrated circuit \n     embedded in another device or product), or any software, \n     firmware, or other set or collection of processing \n     instructions.\n\n     SEC. 12. STATE OF MIND; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     element of the claim by the standard of evidence under \n     applicable State law in effect before January 1, 1999.\n       (b) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n       (c) Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness \n     Disclosure Act.--Nothing in this Act shall alter or affect \n     any of the obligations, protections, or duties established by \n     the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.\n\n     SEC. 13. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 14. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (A) Minimum Injury Requirement.--A Y2K class action \n     involving a claim that a product or service is defective may \n     be maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as \n     to that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In any Y2K class action \n     in which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K class action, there shall \n     be filed with the complaint a statement of specific \n     information regarding the manifestations of the materials \n     defects and the facts supporting a conclusion that the \n     defects are material as to a majority of the members of the \n     class.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K class action in \n     which a claim is asserted on which the plaintiff class may \n     prevail only on proof that the defendant acted with a \n     particular state of mind, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint, with respect to each element of that claim, a \n     statement of the facts giving rise to a strong inference that \n     the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\n       (e) Application to Individuals and Non-Commercial Loss.--\n     The provisions of this section shall apply to claims brought \n     by individuals, to claims by entities described in section \n     4(c) and to claims for non-commecial as well as commercial \n     loss; but shall not apply to claims for wrongful death or \n     personal injury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 611\n\n  Mr. LEAHY proposed an amendment to amendment No. 608 proposed by Mr. \nMcCain to the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, the mark of a truly great \nperson may be identified by their generosity, and generosity is the \nreason I rise today. I would like to honor Mrs. Maxine Whitney, a long-\ntime Fairbanks, AK resident, businesswoman and philanthropist, for her \nmulti-million dollar contribution of Native Alaskan artwork to the \nPrince William Sound Community College in Valdez, AK.\n  For the past 50 years in Alaska, Mrs. Whitney and her husband, Jesse, \nhave traveled extensively in rural Alaska to gain a deeper \nunderstanding and appreciation of Native people and cultures. During \ntheir travels, Maxine amassed what is reportedly the world's largest \nprivate collection of Native Alaskan art and artifacts.\n  Maxine's hobby of collecting Native Alaskan art soon became a much \nlarger commitment when she purchased a small private museum in \nFairbanks to house her treasures. For nearly 20 years, Maxine's Eskimo \nMuseum showcased Native Alaskan history and the important contribution \nNative culture has had on the formation of Alaskan society. Mrs. \nWhitney maintained the museum from 1969 until the late 1980s.\n  Maxine's dedication to the arts is apparent from her recent donation \nof her extensive collection of Native Alaska art to Prince William \nSound Community College, part of the University of Alaska education \nsystem. The collection, known as the Jesse & Maxine Whitney Collection, \nis the nucleus of the college's Alaska Cultural Center. This multi-\nmillion dollar donation will provide a means for all visitors to the \ncenter to learn about past and present Native Alaskan cultures as well \nas the history of Alaska.\n  Mrs. Whitney's dedication to keeping the Native Alaskan history alive \nshould be celebrated. Her generous gift will enhance the knowledge and \nappreciation of Native cultures. It is people like Maxine Whitney, a \npatron of the arts and education, who enrich our lives with their \ngracious gifts.\n  In donating the Whitney Collection, Maxine has provided a world-\nrenowned educational gem for all who visit the collection . . . she has \nprovided a unique legacy for all Alaskans, and for all Americans.

What makes it even more unique is that it has remained as a \nsingle-family owned and operated business during all 75 years.\n  Clare's downtown business district has remained vibrant with the help \nof the Hotel Doherty.

Mr. President, June is a very special month for \nthis nation's dairy industry. It is the month farmers and consumers \njoin together to commemorate the contributions and history of our great \ndairy industry by celebrating National Dairy Month.\n  Even before the 1937 inception of National Dairy Month, Wisconsin led \nthe nation in milk and cheese production. Even today, Wisconsin leads \nthe nation in cheese volume, processing nearly 90 percent of the more \nthan 22 billion pounds of milk produced into cheese. More than 350 \nvarieties of cheese are produced in the state, including, Cheddar, \nAmerican, Muenster, Brick, Blue and Italian, not to mention the famous \nLimburger cheese variety, which is only produced in Wisconsin. Also, \nWisconsin buttermakers produce nearly 25 percent of the America's \nbutter supply.\n  National Dairy Month is the American consumer's oldest and largest \ncelebration of dairy products and the people who have made the industry \nthe success it is today. During June, Wisconsinities will hold nearly \n100 dairy celebrations across our state, including dairy breakfasts, \nice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. \nThese events all highlight the quality, variety and great taste of \nWisconsin dairy products and honor the producers who make it all \npossible.\n  June Dairy Month is a time to celebrate America's dairy industry and \nWisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. It provides \nWisconsin's dairy farmers a special time to reflect on their \naccomplishments and those of their ancestors, and to look forward to \ncontinued success in the future.\n  Wisconsin was nicknamed America's Dairyland in the 1930s, but it \nbecame a leader in the industry soon after the first dairy cow came to \nWisconsin in the 1800's. Dairy history and the state's history have \nbeen intertwined from the beginning. Why, before Wisconsin was even \ndeclared a state, Wisconsin's first cheese ``factory'' established when \none clever Wisconsinite combined milk from her cows with milk from her \nneighbor's cows and made it into cheese.\n  Other Wisconsin dairy firsts include: the development of Colby cheese \nin 1874, the creation of brick cheese in 1875, the first dairy school \nin America--established in 1891 at the University of Wisconsin at \nMadison, the first statewide dairy show in the U.S. in 1928, and the \ncreation of the world-record holding 40,060 pound, Grade-A Cheddar \ncheese in 1988. And Wisconsin also can claim one of the best-tasting \ninventions in the history of dairy industry: the creation of the first \nice cream sundae in 1881.\n  Also unique to Wisconsin's dairy industry is the crowing of ``Alice \nin Dairyland.'' This lucky young woman serves as the state's dairy \nambassador all over the country, and often in other parts of the world. \nLast year's Alice, Jennifer Hasler of Monroe, represented\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nWisconsin well as she promoted Wisconsin's agriculture in California, \nArizona, Minnesota and even Japan. She generated millions of dollars in \nunpaid advertising for hard working Wisconsin farmers. I congratulate \nher on her achievements and her hard work and wish the new Alice good \nluck in her year serving Wisconsin agriculture.\n  I am proud to honor this great American tradition--proud to honor the \ndairy producers not only in Wisconsin, but also those across this great \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6812-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          GIRL SCOUT TROOP 327 CELEBRATES 25 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 54 \nparticipants of Girl Scout Troop 327 from Wayne County, Michigan, as \nthey celebrate 25 years of continuous service at the Mackinac Island \nScout Camp.\n  Based in Grosse Pointe, the Troop recruits girls from Livonia, \nDearborn, and the entire east side of Detroit. This combined group from \nthe Michigan Metro Girl Scout Council will be traveling to Mackinac \nIsland on Thursday, June 24, 1999 to celebrate their 25th Anniversary \nof service to the Island.\n  While on the Island, the Girl Scouts will continue their commitment \nto be better citizens through community service and goodwill deeds. In \ncooperation with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, they plan \nto greet visitors in various public buildings, give directions to \ntourists, paint dilapidated park benches, and clean up heavily traveled \npark trails. The beauty of the Island will undoubtedly be preserved \nbecause of the Girl Scouts' service and dedication.\n  Past experiences have enabled Troop 327 to gain a wealth of \ninformation about the world around them. As members of Governor \nEngler's Honor Guard, the girls have been responsible for raising 26 \nUnited States flags over the country's National Cemeteries, Post \nCemetery, and another at the Governor's summer residence. Through their \nexperiences, the Girl Scouts have become more mature while gaining \nvaluable life and human relations skills.\n  Earning the ``Gold Award'' and ``Silver Award'' for their active \nparticipation in community service, members of the Troop continue to \nexemplify their self-professed national motto: ``Girl Scouting: where \ngirls grow strong.''\n  As individuals, communities and businesses strive to make positive \nimpacts on the world, our younger community sets an example for every \ngeneration to follow. I urge my colleagues to join me in praising these \ngirls for their continued efforts. The service provided by Girl Scout \nTroop 327 has left a mark on their lives, and in future weeks their \nservice will positively affect those who visit Mackinac Island from \naround the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6812-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6812-S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING RESPECT AND GRATITUDE TO THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility, I believe \nthe Senate should close its proceedings today by paying our profound \nand deepest respect to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States of America and their comrades in arms from 18 other \nnations, NATO, for having taken an enormous risk in performing with a \ndegree of excellence that by any standard can be judged by all who \nunderstand military operations as in keeping with the finest traditions \nof our military and the military of other nations of the world.\n  Their actions to bring about what appears to be a cessation of \nhostilities, certainly in the air, at this time receives our profound \ngratitude and our prayers for their safety.\n  I, moments ago, spoke with the Secretary of Defense to pass on to our \nold colleague from the Senate a ``well done.'' I had the opportunity, \nas did many here in the Senate, to work with him on a regular basis \nthroughout this crisis period in Kosovo, and I commend him for \nmaintaining a very strong hand on this situation, particularly at times \nwhen it became very difficult.\n  We have discussed the command from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nchiefs of services, down through the CINCs, to the privates, whether \nthey be in the air, on the sea, on the land. Again, they performed \ntheir job with great professional skill and dedication. It was not an \neasy job, because there was a good deal of uncertainty, and that \nuncertainty still remains as to exactly how this mission was carried \nout and whether it could have been done differently. But nevertheless, \nsome 3,000-plus sorties were flown by the men and women in the aircraft \nof eight nations, supported by ground personnel at bases throughout \nthat region, 17 bases alone in Italy.\n  I had the privilege last week, as a matter of fact a week ago today I \nwas in Albania with General Jackson, who will be heading the ARRC force \nand who broke the news of the agreement between the military side with \nthe representatives from Yugoslavia, General Clark and Admiral Ellis. I \nwish to say to these commanders that, again, it was their leadership \nwhich instilled a sense of confidence and conviction in their \nsubordinates that this job had to be done, that we had to stay the \ncourse, and the professionalism we have witnessed now in the air \noperation.\n  I was asked momentarily, does this represent a victory or how would \nyou characterize it? I simply said to the press early today, and to my \ncolleagues I say now, it is far too early to try to make those \njudgments. The Senate Armed Services Committee, which I am privileged \nto chair, will hold a series of hearings on what went right and what \nwent wrong and what, most particularly, will be the strategy of our \nforces for the future if faced with another situation of the \nseriousness and the complexity of this one in Kosovo.\n  I visited this region last September. As I stood there in Albania and \nMacedonia and observed the terrain, which is identical in many ways to \nthat in Kosovo, I thought back to the refugees at that time huddling in \nthe hills. I said on the floor of the Senate there would be a need \nthen, as there is now, for a ground military force to stabilize the \nsituation, stabilize it so while the ground forces of NATO will go in, \neventually other nongovernmental organizations from all over the world \nwill come to help these people who were tragically driven from their \nhomes and villages by a very brutal military force under the direction \nof President Milosevic, a man who has conducted himself with complete \ndisregard of all international law and human rights.\n\n  Again, I return to the troops. While the air operation, hopefully, \nwill be secured, if not already, within hours, we have remaining before \nus the challenge on the ground, and the ground forces will now take up \ntheir professional responsibilities. May the hand of God rest upon \ntheir shoulders, because they will be faced with land mines and booby \ntraps, all types of uncertainty. They will have to perform tasks not \nunlike those of a mayor of a village, to the extremes of how to deal \nwith this hidden weaponry and a tragic situation of returning people to \na devastated homeland.\n  The KLA will present challenges. In some instances, they fought with \ngreat courage. But now they must reconcile themselves to the fact that \nthis international force, indeed NATO and the United Nations, must \nresolve the situation in a peaceable manner.\n  So while victory cannot be pronounced now, not until the ground \nforces go in and perform their challenging tasks, I say clearly that \nNATO has taken another major, significant step in the international \ncommunity toward reaching its five basic goals. Those goals have been \nstated on this floor and in the press many times.\n  I salute all. In my discussions with Secretary Cohen, we made \nreference to the President. The President is Commander in Chief. The \nwords that Secretary Cohen used--and I have a great respect for Bill \nCohen, having served with him here some 18 years in the Senate--were \nthat the President was steady. He stayed steady at every turn in these \nevents, stayed focused and gave it his attention. In every way, I think \nthe comments of the Secretary of Defense were very respectful. Clearly, \nin the minds of all of us, we have to credit the President with holding \ntogether the 19 nations.\n  It was essential that that coalition under the NATO charter remain \ntogether throughout this first phase--that is, the air phase--and now \nthey must remain together throughout an equally difficult and \nchallenging phase, that of securing the ground.\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\n  As I said, when I was there one week ago with General Jackson, \nGeneral Clark, Admiral Ellis, and other military commanders, it is \nclear that the magnitude of the uncertainty relating to the landmines \nand booby traps, and indeed the problems associated with moving the \nSerb forces out, pose a challenge that, in many respects, has never \nbeen faced by a U.S. military force. But I have confidence in those \ncommanders and in the men and women who will boldly undertake this \ntask.\n  So I wish to just pay my humble respects, and I will follow this \noperation very clearly, in terms of our duties in the Senate and on the \nArmed Services Committee and, most assuredly, in our prayers for their \nsafety and for the safety of those Kosovars who were driven from their \nhomes and now have hope to once again return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6813-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NOMINATIONS OF GENERAL SHINSEKI AND GENERAL JONES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee met yesterday \nunder the advise and consent role with respect to General Shinseki to \nbe Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and General Jones to \nbecome Commandant of the Marine Corps. I want to say with the deepest \npersonal reverence that in my 21 years in the Senate, I cannot recall \never being moved as strongly by the remarks of a fellow Senator as I \nwas yesterday when the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, \naddressed the Armed Services Committee and introduced General Shinseki.\n  While I would like to read these remarks, it is better that they just \nbe printed in the Record. I urge all Senators to examine these remarks. \nThey are extraordinary. They come from the heart of a Senator who has \nserved his country with the greatest distinction, and his praise for a \nfellow Hawaiian who came up under circumstances not unlike his, \nalthough removed by a generation or so.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the remarks of Senator Inouye printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Honorable Daniel K. Inouye, U.S. Senator From Hawaii\n\n       Senator Inouye. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this \n     opportunity to say a few words in behalf of our President's \n     nominee for the 34th Chief of Staff of the United States \n     Army. General Shinseki began his military career as a \n     commissioned officer 34 years ago, almost exactly, on June 9, \n     1965. He received his commission as a Second Lieutenant after \n     receiving a baccalaureate degree from the United States \n     Military Academy at West Point.\n       After a few weeks of preparation, he was sent to Vietnam. \n     On his first tour of duty there he distinguished himself, and \n     he received his first purple heart. He was sent back to the \n     States to be hospitalized, and a few years later he was back \n     in Vietnam. On his second tour of duty there as a captain he \n     once again distinguished himself, but he was wounded very \n     seriously, losing part of his foot.\n       Notwithstanding that, he applied for a waiver and requested \n     that he be given the opportunity to continue his service to \n     our Nation. This was granted, and he continued his \n     illustrious career, and in 1997 became a four-star General. \n     As Chairman Warner indicated, in March of 1994 he was made \n     Commanding General of the First Cavalry Division.\n       In July 1997 he became Commander-in-Chief of the United \n     States Army in Europe, and Commander-in-Chief of the Seventh \n     Army. He was also Commander of the Stabilization Force on \n     Bosnia.\n       As indicated by Chairman Warner, there is no question that \n     General Shinseki is eminently qualified for this, and if I \n     may at this juncture be a bit more personal, this is a \n     special day for many of us in the United States. In February \n     of 1942, the United States Selective Service System, because \n     of the hysteria of that time, that all Japanese, citizens or \n     otherwise, be designated 4C. 4C, as you know Mr. Chairman, is \n     the designation of an enemy alien.\n       It was a day of shame for many of us, although it was not \n     deserved, and we petitioned the Government to permit us to \n     demonstrate ourselves and a year later President Roosevelt \n     declared that Americanism is a matter of mind and heart. \n     Americanism is not, and has never been, a matter of racial \n     color, and authorized the formation of a special Japanese-\n     American combat unit, and the rest is history.\n       But what I wish to point out is that this young man sitting \n     to my right was born in November of 1942. At the time of his \n     birth he was an enemy alien, and today, to the great glory of \n     the United States, I have the privilege of presenting him as \n     the 34th Chief of Staff, Army nominee. This, Mr. Chairman, \n     can happen only in the United States. I cannot think of any \n     other place where something of this nature can happen.\n       He is the grandson of a Japanese laborer from Hiroshima who \n     arrived in Hawaii in the late 1800's, about 1888, raised his \n     children, and raised his grandson to love America, and I \n     believe he succeeded eminently.\n       Mr. Chairman, on this day the shame that has been on our \n     shoulders all these years has been clearly washed away by \n     this one action, and for that I am very grateful to this \n     Nation. I am grateful to the President, and I believe that we \n     have before us one of the great illustrious warriors of our \n     Nation. And I hope that this committee will vote to approve \n     his nomination as the 34th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.\n       It is my pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to present to the \n     Committee, General Shinseki.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee reported out favorably the nominations of General Shinseki \nand General Jones, and I anticipate tomorrow the Senate will move on \nthose nominations.\n  As chairman, I designated Senator Roberts, a former U.S. Marine, to \nplace the nomination by the committee, as approved, of General Jones to \nthe Senate; and Senator Cleland of Georgia, an Army veteran of great \ndistinction and an officer who served in Vietnam, will place before the \nSenate the nomination of General Shinseki.\n  Once again, I close by saluting the Secretary of Defense, the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces of the United States, and our allies for \ntheir courage and perception in meeting the challenges proposed in \nKosovo. I wish them well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/09/senate-section/article/S6813-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
