Mr. President, I would like to note that there are some \nthings happening around here of late that make me wonder if we are in \nan episode of the X-Files. I am troubled with the mysterious appearance \nand disappearance of funds within the conference report for Military \nConstruction. In the effort to develop an emergency spending package, \nthe House included money for meth lab clean-up. It voted on money. The \nSenate-passed bill had money for meth lab clean-up. Both Houses of \nCongress recognized that there was a real emergency. Both bodies \nrecognized the need to provide emergency money to DEA to help pay for \nthe costs of cleaning up the toxic waste dumps caused by illegal meth \nproduction.\n  I and other members of this body have been concerned for some time \nabout this problem. We have written the President, the head of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the Attorney General, and the Majority \nLeader and members of the Committee on Appropriations. The Majority \nWhip of the Senate had an emergency meth spending item accepted as part \nof the bill passed by the Senate. But it seems we've had a case of \nalien abduction. All--all the meth money disappeared in conference and \nno one seems to know how or why. The House included money. The Senate \nincluded money. The conference to reconcile the differences, however, \nincluded no money. What this means is strange math in which one plus \none equals zero.\n  Mr. President, I have participated in various conferences with the \nother body, and I know they can be complicated affairs. Strong \ndisagreements can exist over how to phrase a section,\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nor how much funding this particular project should receive. But there \nhave always been some guidelines governing a conference. First, you are \nworking toward a compromise. This means, by definition, you are not \ngoing to get everything you want. However, it also means you will get \nsomething that will work. Second, in a conference, you aren't starting \nfrom scratch. Each body has reviewed, debated, and passed a version of \nlegislation--a starting point, if you will, for compromise.\n  These compromises, often difficult to arrive at, are worked out \nbehind closed doors. Out of the watchful eye of the public. Legislating \ncan be an ugly process, and often negotiations continue in a much more \nopen and frank manner in private than under the media microscope. But \ncompromise should not be the occasion for legislating afresh, for \nignoring the expressed intent of majorities in both Houses.\n  Looking through the Military Construction Appropriations bill this \nlast week, I was distressed at some of the items I found that seem to \nhave magically appeared. 6 C-130Js and a new Gulf Stream 5 for the \nCoast Guard, for example. So far as I know, the Coast Guard did not ask \nfor a Gulf Stream, and we did not vote for one. But there it is.\n  At the same time, it seems that needed funds to support the DEA's \ncontinued assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies to \nclean up methamphetamine labs have disappeared--and no one seems to \nknow where it went.\n  Heading into the conference, it was clear what the situation was. The \nHouse had provided $15 million in emergency funds for needed \nmethamphetamine lab-cleanup. The Senate provided a total of $50 million \nfor meth-related activities by the DEA--$10 million was added in \nCommittee, and an additional $40 million was adopted on the floor for \n``initiatives to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking.'' \nSo you would think--I certainly thought--that the conferees would \nreturn with some funding--most likely between $15 and $50 million--for \nmeth lab clean-up.\n  But something happened in the conference. Someone waved a magic wand, \nand ``Poof!'' The money is gone. Where did it go? The conferees don't \nknow. Why is it gone? The sponsors of the funds don't know. I don't \nknow. Inquiries have left me feeling like Jimmy Stewart commenting on \nthe evidence in his case in the 1959 movie classic, ``Anatomy of a \nMurder,'' where he notes evidence appears and disappears in a ghostly \nfashion. But what I do know is that I have to explain this to my \nconstituents--to the law enforcement agencies in Iowa who are dependent \nupon these funds to support their clean up efforts of these mini \nenvironmental catastrophes. I am not alone.\n  All of this funding hocus pocus I find to be very troubling. I hope \nwe can solve the mystery and avoid its like in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask to speak as if in morning business, \nand I believe my time is taken from the time controlled by Senator \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to follow on with the comments of \nmy good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and praise him for pointing \nout that the conference system is becoming bankrupt.\n  Way too often conferees put in measures and take out measures that \nhave nothing to do with the underlying bill that goes to conference. It \nis becoming so bad that I think sometime--my hope is in the next \nCongress--the Senator from Iowa, myself, and others should meet with \nour leadership to prevent this from continually happening. It bankrupts \nthe process. It also causes more Americans to become even more \nconcerned about the political process. We, as Senators, cannot go home \nand say what is or is not happening. Rather, we have to go home and \nreport just what the Senator from Iowa reported--that somehow, by magic \nor by mystery, things sort of appear and disappear. It does not make us \nfeel good as Senators because we like to know what is occurring. It \ncertainly doesn't help our constituents feel any better about the \nprocess because they hope we know what is happening. More than that, \nthey hope we are fighting for their case. But if we don't know the \ncontents of the conference process, we don't know how something gets \nput in or taken out, and we look foolish. It is a major abrogation of \nour responsibility as a Senate to the American people for whom we work. \nThey are, after all, our employers. At times, the Senate is too \nsecretive.\n  It reminds me of an incident I was involved in when I first came to \nthe House more than 20-some years ago. At that time, I was a freshman \nHouse Member. I had a few free minutes one afternoon--about an hour or \ntwo. I thought that I would go to the conference on the tax bill; I \nmight learn something. I thought I would go to the conference and learn \na little about tax law and the conference process.\n  I called around to try to figure out where the conference was \nmeeting. Nobody would tell me. At that time, Mike Mansfield from \nMontana was the majority leader of the Senate. I thought I could call \nSenator Mansfield's office; certainly they could tell me where the \nconference was meeting. They did. They told me. It was in the big \nhearing room over in the Longworth Building. There was a policeman \nstanding at the door leading to the executive room. I knew what was \ngoing on. He challenged me. I said I was a Member. I intended to reply \nthat I was a member of the conference, but, rationalizing, I said I was \na Member of Congress, and he waved me in.\n  I walked back into the executive room. There were Senate Members in \nthe hearing room on one side of the table with conferees, and Russell \nLong was at the table with House conferees. Russell Long was talking \nabout when he was a kid in Louisiana. It was great listening to it. \nThere was a sea of executive branch people. In the hearing room with \nTreasury Secretary Simon was a sea of Treasury employees.\n  I took an out-of-the-way spot. I found a chair over on the side, and \nI sat down out of the way to watch. After about 10 minutes, Congressman \nJim Burke from Massachusetts shuffled over to me--an elderly man. He \ncame to me and said: I am sorry. I have to ask you to leave. Leave? \nWhy? He said it was just the rules. I said respectfully that I would \nlike to know what rule was requiring me to leave. He said, well, it is \nthe Senate rules. So I said, well, I appreciate that. As a House \nMember, I wanted to know which Senate rule it was that prohibited my \nattendance as a Member of Congress watching this conference. He said, \nwell, it is just the Senate rule.\n\n  I thought for a while. I thought: That is wrong; it is not right. I \nam not going to make a big fuss about it right here; I will later. I am \ngoing to leave because he asked me to leave, but I will see what I can \ndo about it. It is the rule.\n  For example, Congressman Bill Green couldn't be there either. Bill \nGreen was then a Congressman and the member of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House who authored a provision to delete the depletion \nallowance that was in the House bill. Even he could not attend, the \nrule then being nobody could attend a conference except conferees--\nnobody else. But there were more people from the executive branch. They \nwere there, along with Treasury Secretary Simon.\n  I came over to the House floor. I mentioned this to Congressman Mikva \nfrom Illinois. He said: Max, you are entirely right. That is wrong. I \nhave been fighting that rule for years.\n  A few of us stood up on the House floor that afternoon and explained \nhow we thought it was wrong. In the next session of Congress, the rules \nwere changed. Afterwards, all conferences were totally open to the \npublic.\n  I know some Members of Congress don't like that. They do not like the \nsun shining in conferences. But that was the rule. We started it back \nthen. I think it is in the public interest. It is a good rule.\n  It seems things have changed slowly; conferences should not be \nsecret. They are bipartisan. Both political parties attend, but often \nthe minority party is shut out. One wonders what is happening. The real \ndanger is, if and when the Democrats are in the majority, the Democrats \nare going to be tempted to do the same thing. It is wrong. Neither side \nshould do that. They should be\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nmuch more open and much more closely should enforce that rule, and \nmatters not pertaining to the conference should not be included in the \nconference report. It is something we have to stand up and enforce for \nthe good of the Senate and for the good of the country; otherwise, \nthere will be chaos, or anarchy, or a dictatorship--whatever it is.\n  Based upon the comments of my good friend, I am very inclined to work \nwith him next year to see if we can do something about that. I think \nthere are many others in the Senate who share the same view. It has \ngotten out of hand.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for the statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7461-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7461-S7462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PERMANENT NORMAL TRADING RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few words on a \nmatter that will be coming before this body, I hope, later this week; \nthat is, beginning the process of the United States agreeing to extend \npermanent normal trading relations status with China.\n  I would like to step back for a few moments and reflect a bit on its \nsignificance and on its implications. The irony is that we are even \ntalking about this today because I think the bill to grant China PNTR \nhas the strong support of at least three-fourths of the Senate. It is \ndeeply in our national interest. I wish it had been passed some time \nago. Actually, we should have passed it months ago. Instead, we have \nhad to struggle to find time to consider it in this chamber. We are now \napproaching the eleventh hour of this session of Congress with a week \nleft this month and a few weeks in September.\n  I personally believe this issue should have been handled differently. \nWe should have brought it up much earlier. But later is better than \nnever. I am glad we are finally approaching the denouement.\n  For over two millennia, China was ruled by a series of imperial \ndynasties. The last Emperor was overthrown in 1912. Warlords, \ndictators, and the Japanese military then took over parts of the \ncountry at various times.\n  In 1949, the Chinese Communists took control of the entire Chinese \nmainland. Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters were forced to flee to \nTaiwan. Then followed three decades of absolute, totalitarian, \nCommunist rule by Mao Zedong.\n  To oversimplify, in 1979, Deng Xiaoping signaled the beginning of the \nend of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology as the underlying construct of \nthe Chinese economy, polity, and society.\n  Another critical turning point was Deng's so-called ``Southern \nJourney'' in 1992. He visited Shenzhen, other parts of Guangdong \nProvince, and Shanghai. On that journey, he advocated more economic \nopenness, faster growth, and more rapid progress toward a market-based \neconomy.\n  For the next two decades, we witnessed both progress and retreat in \nChina's economic and political developments. Dramatic opening to \nforeign products and foreign investment. Yet a continuing government \neffort to maintain control over telecommunications.\n  The massacre of students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Yet relatively \nunfettered access today by many Chinese to the Internet. Repeated \nviolations of contract sanctity. Yet the development of domestic stock \nmarkets and Chinese companies placing issues on foreign stock \nexchanges.\n  The battle in China between the forces of reform and the forces of \nreaction continues. No one can predict how it will end, or when. But it \nis certainly in the vital interest of the United States to do \neverything we can to support those who favor reform over \ntotalitarianism. Those who favor private enterprise over state-owned \nenterprises.\n  That means we must work to incorporate China into the international \ncommunity. We need to engage China with the goal of promoting \nresponsible behavior internally and externally. Encouraging them to \nplay by international rules. Integrating the Chinese economy into the \nmarket-driven, middle-class, participatory economies of the West.\n  Economic reforms never have an easy time. And the forces in China \nthat want to maintain the status quo are strong.\n  But, economic reform, moving to a market economy, transparency, \ndirect foreign investment, listing of companies on overseas markets. \nProgress in all these areas is of vital importance to the United States \nas they relate to stability in China, accountability, and the \ndevelopment of a middle class. China's entry into the WTO will help \nanchor and sustain these economic reform efforts and empower economic \nreformers. China will not become a market-driven economy overnight. But \nit is in our interest that they move in this direction. And the WTO \nwill help the process.\n  Around the world, we have seen that economic growth leads to the \ndevelopment of a large and strong middle class. Eventually, the middle \nclass makes demands on political leaders for greater participation, \naccountability, and openness. It takes time. For example, eighty years \nago, the Kuomintang, the KMT, was created by the same Soviet advisors \nwho created the Chinese Communist Party. Fifty years ago, the KMT \nmassacred Taiwanese citizens. Twenty years ago, the KMT still ruled \nTaiwan under martial law. Yet Taiwan just held its second truly \ndemocratic election.\n  There are many other examples. Look at Korea. A quarter of a century \nago, the Korean government tried to murder the dissident Kim Dae Jung. \nNow, President Kim Dae Jung has begun to transform Korea's economic \nstructure. He has traveled to Pyongyang in one of the most remarkable \ninitiatives in modern world history. He is worried about being turned \nout of office in the next democratic election; such is the way of \ndemocracy.\n  The Philippines in 1986, Thailand in 1990, Indonesia in 1999. They \nall showed us the power of the development of a middle class. There is \nnothing fundamentally unique about China that makes a similar type of \nchange impossible, or even improbable, over time.\n  Once China joins the WTO, China will be accountable for its behavior \nto the outside world, for perhaps the first time in history. The \ndispute settlement system at the WTO is far from perfect. Many members \nare working to open up dispute settlements and make it more available \nto the outside world. I have been among its most vociferous critics. \nBut WTO dispute settlement will allow other countries to examine \nChinese domestic economic practices.\n  It will force China to explain actions that other members believe \nviolate global rules for the first time in world history. When a \nviolation is found, it will put pressure on China to change and comply \nwith the internationally accepted rules of the WTO. Not a perfect \norganization, but certainly better than none. This type of external \nscrutiny of China is virtually unprecedented. It has implications that \nmay go far beyond trade, as China learns about the need to respect the \nrule of law among nations.\n  Let me turn to Taiwan for a moment. Taiwan will accede to the WTO \nvery shortly after China does. What will happen when both enjoy full \nmembership?\n  They will participate together, along with all other WTO members, in \nmeetings ranging from detailed technical sessions to Ministerial level \ngatherings. There will be countless opportunities for interaction at \nmany levels. Under the WTO's most-favored-nation rule, they will have \nto provide each other the same benefits that they grant to all other \nmembers. That is a very important principle. Taiwan's current policy \nlimiting direct transportation, communication, and investment with the \nmainland will not stand up to WTO scrutiny. Each will be able to use \nthe WTO dispute settlement mechanism against the other. They will have \nto meet directly and deal with economic differences in a peaceful way.\n  Presumably, either could take reservations, such as a national \nsecurity exception, against the other in certain areas. That is a \ndecision still to be made. But, no matter what, membership in the WTO \nand WTO-induced liberalization will increase and deepen ties between \nTaiwan and the PRC in trade, investment, technology, transportation, \ninformation, communications, and travel. And that has to contribute to \nthe maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait.\n  China is emerging from one hundred and fifty years of national \ntorpor. How we in America, and how the leadership in China, manage this \nrelationship will\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nset the stage for regional and global politics, security, and economics \nfor decades to come.\n  We must make a profound choice. Do we bring China into the orbit of \nthe global trading community with its rule of law? Or do we choose to \nisolate and contain China, creating a 21st century version of the cold \nwar in Asia?\n  It is a truism in international relations that rising powers have \nproven to be the most dangerous. Germany at the end of the 1800s and \nthe Soviet Union in the 1940s. But this is not 1900 or 1945. As the \nworld has become smaller for us because of revolutions in information, \ntransportation, and production, so for China has the world come closer.\n  China is not our enemy. China is not our friend. The issue for us is \nhow to engage China, and this means engagement with no illusions. \nEngagement with a purpose. How do we steer China's energies into \nproductive, peaceful and stable relationships within the region and \nglobally? For just as we isolate China at our peril, we engage them to \nour advantage.\n  Incorporation of China into the WTO, and that includes granting them \nPNTR, is a national imperative for the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, as the Senate recalls the tragic loss \ntwo years ago of two fine Capitol Police Officers, Officer Jacob J. \nChestnut and Detective John M.

Senator Coverdell's departure from this life had been \nsudden. It had come without warning. Paul was only 61 and he could look \nforward to many fruitful years of service to the Nation and to his \npeople. But it was not to be. The Scriptures tell us:\n\n       As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the \n     field, So he flourishes. For the wind passes over it, and it \n     is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.\n\n  On Wednesday of last week, I journeyed to Rhode Island with several \nother Senators to pay our last respects to a late departed former \ncolleague, John O. Pastore, and to commiserate with his bereaved family \nand a great host of friends. We said the last goodbye to a man who had \ngiven much to the service of his country and who had retired from this \nbody 26 years ago. A great throng paid homage to the remembrance of one \nwhom they loved and who had served them so well, as was the case with \nour beloved late colleague, Paul Coverdell. There was a great throng, a \nlarge church filled to overflowing.\n  In both instances to which I have just referred, the choirs sang \nbeautifully, the eulogies came forth from wounded hearts, the final \nfarewells were spoken; then the crowds departed, and each person went \non his or her own way to family hearth and home.\n  Over a long life of more than 80 years I have traveled this same \njourney many times. It is always the same. We travel the last mile with \na departed friend and we come to the end of the way, when we can go no \nfarther. That is as far as we can go. There we must part forever--\ninsofar as this earthly life is concerned. From there, the loved one \nmust go on alone, to ``The undiscovered country,'' as Shakespeare said, \n``from whose bourne no traveler returns''.\n  So it is, and so it has been since the very beginning of our race, \nand so it will be in all the years to come. We are here today, and gone \ntomorrow.\n     The clock of life is wound but once,\n     And no man has the power to know just when the clock will \n           strike,\n     At late or early hour.\n     Now is the only time you have, so live, love, work with a \n           will;\n     Put no faith in tomorrow for the clock may then be still.\n\n  Mr. President, John Pastore lived to be the ripe old age of 93; for \nPaul Coverdell, the grim reaper beckoned earlier, and the end came at \n61. For those of us who remain on this side of the vale of trials and \ntears, the message from both of these lives is clear: be ready, be \nready to go. William Cullen Bryant said it for you and for me:\n\n       All that breathes will share thy destiny. The gay will \n     laugh when thou art gone, the solemn brood of care plod on, \n     and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom; . . .\n\n  As one who has lived in this town of inflated egos for nearly half a \ncentury, I can testify that William Cullen Bryant had it right. I have \nseen the great, the near great, those who thought they were great, \nthose who would never become great, and each incoming wave of life's \nsea surges forward on the sands of humanity's rocky coast, and then, \njust as quickly recedes into the vast emptiness of the past. But what \ncannot be washed away is the love and the memory of man's deeds and \nservice to his fellowman.\n  So, each of us will carry within ourselves the memory of Senator \nPastore's, Senator Coverdell's, Officer Chestnut's, and Detective \nGibson's deeds and service to his fellow man. They have touched all of \nus, and we have been changed by them, because it was Tennyson who said, \n``I am part of all that I have met.'' And so, in this small way, they \nlive on in our hearts and in our dedication to do good with the hours \nand days that remain to us. The poet John Donne expressed it well, how \neach man's life--and each man's death--touches ours:\n\n       No man is an island, entire of itself;\n       Every man is a piece of the continent,\n       A part of the main;\n       If a clod be washed away by the sea,\n       [America] is the less,\n       As well as if a promontory were,\n       As well as if a manor of thy friend's\n       Or of thine own were;\n       Any man's death diminishes me,\n       Because I am involved in mankind;\n       And therefore\n       Never send to know for whom the bell tolls:\n       It tolls for thee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7462-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7462-S7463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize there are some 6 minutes left \nunder the time agreement for the Democratic leadership to be able to \nhave comments during the first hour; and then we will have an hour \nunder the control of Senator Thomas. But I will use my leader time now \nso we will not take the remaining 6 minutes of the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the week's schedule, we had \nhoped we would be making progress now on the energy and water \nappropriations bill. But a disagreement developed on Friday afternoon, \nand we are continuing to see if we can work through that. I have spoken \nto Senator Domenici, the chairman of the energy and water \nappropriations subcommittee, about trying to find a way to proceed.\n  It is very important legislation for our country. It does involve \nappropriations for the Energy Department, the very important nuclear \nweapons labs, as well as water projects all over this country in which \nMembers and States and various groups are very interested. So I hope we \ncan find a way to proceed on that.\n  It has been held up, basically, by a disagreement over how to handle \nthe water levels on the Missouri River, affecting the States of North \nDakota, South Dakota, Missouri, and perhaps others downstream. It is \nnot easy to reconcile or to come to an agreement because there are very \nstrong feelings about it, and it is very important to local areas. I \nknow Senator Domenici is ready to proceed. He will be over later to \nmake some comments about the importance of this legislation.\n\n  We also hope to take up the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations \nbill this week. It should not be that controversial. I understand there \nmay be some amendments to it; It may take some time, but that is \nunderstandable. That is fine. We could do that and still\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nconclude that legislation probably in a day or so.\n  We had hoped that during the pendency of the week we could also go to \nthe Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. We had hoped to do all \nthree of them, or at least two of the three, and make some progress on \nCommerce-State-Justice.\n  We also would like to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill. \nAs is always the case, after the Armed Services Defense authorization \nbill for the year is done, we, in relatively short order, then go to \nthe intelligence authorization. I do not need to talk about the \nimportance of the intelligence authorization bill and what it means to \nthe security of our country, but we have not been able to work out \nexactly how to proceed on that either.\n  Then on Wednesday, we had indicated we would go to the China PNTR \nissue. Indications had been that there would be resistance to moving \nforward on the motion to proceed, and I would have to file cloture on \nthat, with that cloture motion then ripening on Friday. So we would go \nahead and go to that and get over the first hurdle in being able to \ncomplete the China trade legislation when we come back in September.\n  We had hoped to go to the Executive Calendar and get some nominations \ncompleted this week and also consider some additional judges that might \nbe reported from the Judiciary Committee during the week.\n  All of that right now is in abeyance. We have not been able to get an \nagreement on how to proceed at this time. I think that is unfortunate \nbecause we do have 4, 4\\1/2\\ days this week in which we need to make \nreal progress on appropriations bills and other issues, as well as the \nChina trade legislation.\n  If we cannot get an agreement here in the next couple of hours or so, \nthen I will have to try to proceed to one of the appropriations bills \nand the intelligence authorization bill, and perhaps even file cloture \non them. Both of those will then ripen on Wednesday. Of course, if \ncloture is obtained, then we will be on those bills, which will then \nget tangled up in the China permanent normal trade relations issue. So \nthis is not a good way to proceed, but that may be our only \nalternative.\n  But I have talked to Senator Daschle this morning. I have talked to \nSenator Hatch. We will continue to work with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to see if we can find a way to make some good progress this \nweek, because this is the last week before the August recess, and it \nwill have an effect on what we are able to do in September.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7463-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7463-S7464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise at this time to talk about our \nbeloved friend, Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. I had hoped to be \nable to make some further comments last week, after it fell my duty to \ncome to the floor and announce his very untimely death, but I just \ncould not do it because I was so emotionally disturbed and grieving \nover the loss of this good friend.\n  I guess maybe the week and the services in Georgia on Saturday have \nhelped me come to peace with this very difficult loss and to say a fond \nfarewell to my good friend from Georgia. But I wanted to speak now \nbecause I felt, even this morning, a void for this week; Paul will not \nbe here. He will not be here saying, What can we do next? How can I \nhelp? He was willing to work with all of the Republicans and all of the \nDemocrats, going over to the Democratic side of the aisle and seeking \nout Senator Harry Reid or Senator Torricelli, trying to find some way \nto make a bipartisan piece of legislation possible. So we will have a \nvoid this week.\n  But, as I was thinking about it a few moments ago, there will be a \nvoid forever in the Senate with the loss of Paul Coverdell because his \nwas an unfinished symphony. A lot more beautiful sounds were going to \ncome from that somewhat uncertain trumpet from Georgia.\n  Folks have talked about his flailing hands and his squeaky voice, but \nthat is what really made Senator Coverdell all the more attractive. He \nwas not always as smooth as some of us like to think we might be, but \nhe was always effective. Maybe it was because of the way he presented \nhis speeches and the way he came across in his daily relationships with \nall of us.\n  The Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd Ogilvie, at the church services in \nmemory of Paul Coverdell on Saturday, referred to him as a peacemaker. \nAnd maybe this is a good time of the year to be thinking about the \nbeatitudes because I think it really did describe Paul. Even though he \nfelt very strongly about the issues he believed in or that he was \nopposed to, he was always binding up everybody else's wounds. He would \nfind a way to make peace and get results.\n  I thought the Chaplain's description of him as a peacemaker was \napropos. When I did my Bible study this morning, I came to that \nparticular passage, ``Blessed is the peacemaker.'' Again I thought, \nthat is just one more message about Paul and the great job he did in \nthe Senate.\n  I met Paul years ago actually, way back in the 1970s when there was a \nvery fledgling Republican Party in Georgia. We didn't have much of a \nRepublican Party at that time in my State, but we were beginning to \nmake progress. Maybe Georgia was even a little bit behind us. I \nremember going down to Atlanta and then having to go to Albany, GA, to \nattend events, then back into Atlanta. It was one of those occasions \nwhere a number of Congressmen and Senators came in for a fly around the \nState, and then we all came back in for the big dinner. It was \nlogistically hard to orchestrate. Then I finally met the maestro; the \nmaestro was Paul Coverdell.\n  Typically, I learned later, it was the way he would work. He had five \nor six of us come in. We went to five or six different places in the \nState like spokes on a wheel. We came back. We had dinner. It was a \nvery effective event. Everything worked like clockwork. It worked like \nclockwork because Paul Coverdell was making it happen.\n  In those days, as I recall, he was in the State legislature, in the \nState senate. They had three Republicans. He was the minority leader. \nThey had a minority whip and they had a whipee. There were three of \nthem. That is the way he used to describe his powerful role in the \nsenate, although, as I came to find out a lot later, he was a very \neffective member of the State senate, working as always both sides of \nthe aisle, even though he only had three in his party in the State \nsenate at that time.\n  Of course, he went on to work in the Bush administration in the Peace \nCorps. I wasn't quite sure what that meant, but I am sure he did a \ngreat job at the Peace Corps. I remember then supporting him when he \nactually ran for the Senate in 1992. I wasn't that intimately involved \nin the campaign but knew him to be a good man. I remember making a \npitch for him both here and in Georgia.\n  When I really got to know him was when he came to the Senate. Almost \nimmediately he started throwing himself into the fray, whatever was \ngoing on. I remember we had the Clinton health care plan. I think he \nmade 147 appearances in one State or another, on one occasion or \nanother, against the Government takeover of health care. He felt \npassionately about it. He took off on the trail with Senator Phil Gramm \nand Senator John McCain. They had a lot to do with the eventual, and in \nmy opinion, appropriate demise of that legislation. I learned that he \nwouldn't just talk a good game or wouldn't just give direction; he \nwould put his body on the line. He would go anywhere, anytime to see \nthat the message was delivered.\n  Immediately he started saying: If we are going to do this in a \npositive way, if we are going to be fighting this legislation, how are \nwe going to get our message out? He would be persistent about it. He \nwould follow you around and keep wanting to talk about it. I remember \nhe actually instigated meetings, at that time between the Speaker of \nthe House and me, first as whip and then as majority leader, in which \nhe would get the two of us together. He would have charts. Here he is \nfrom Georgia in probably his fourth year in the Senate, and he is using \ncharts to explain the situation to the Speaker of the House and the \nmajority leader. Only we listened because he had thought about it; he \nwas organized. He had some ideas.\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n  I remember one occasion he said: You have to come to Atlanta.\n  I said: I don't want to come to Atlanta.\n  He said: Just come for lunch; Newt and I want to sit and talk with \nyou.\n  So I flew down. We had lunch. He had charts and he had a video this \ntime. He talked about how we should be planning our strategy. Then we \nflew back. I thought about that many times, in a way, the temerity of \nthat. But that was Paul. Nobody objected. Nobody took it as a threat. \nNobody worried he was stepping on their turf. And thank goodness, \nsomebody was thinking and planning. That was Paul.\n  Then after that, of course, he got involved as a member of the \nleadership team. I really liked that because I can remember very early \non I realized that if there was a task that needed to be performed that \nnobody else would do, I could call on Paul; he would be glad to do it. \nI can remember going down the leadership line: Would you have the time \nto do this? Do you have the staff to do this? It would come down to the \nthird person. He always sat at the other end of the leadership table. I \nwould get to Paul, having had three turndowns, and Paul would say: \nSure, I'll do it.\n  Very quickly I developed the moniker for Paul of ``Mikey.'' I like to \nnickname Senators. Most of them wouldn't like for me to talk about it \npublicly. But Paul actually kind of liked being called Mikey. Mikey \ncame from the television cereal commercial where the two kids are \npushing a bowl of cereal back and forth saying: You eat it; no, you eat \nit. Finally, they push it to the third little boy and say: Give it to \nMikey; he will try anything.\n  That was the way Paul was. When all the other great leaders of the \nSenate were not willing to take the time, not willing to do the dirty, \ndifficult, time-consuming job, Mikey would do it. I remember every time \nI called him Mikey, he would break out in a big smile. Tricia, my wife, \npicked it up, too. We liked too talk to Nancy about how sorry we were \nto have kept him tied up a little extra, too, sometimes in the Senate. \nBut Mikey had his work to do. So it was a very affectionate term I had \nfor him, and it described him so perfectly.\n  He was not a funny, ha-ha sort of guy, but he was willing to laugh. \nHe had a sense of humor. He was willing to laugh at himself, which \nreally made him attractive. He was self-effacing. There was no grandeur \nthere. He was, as Phil Gramm said in his remarks at the services \nSaturday--I believe it was Phil--or as somebody said: An ordinary man \nwith extraordinary talents. He was willing to work hard to make up for \nwhatever he lacked in some other way. He surely was loyal. I never had \nto worry about anything I said or asked Paul to do being used in an \ninappropriate way against me or against anybody else. He would handle \nit properly. And he was sensitive. He was always sensitive: Did I do \nthe right thing? Did this Senator react some uncertain way?\n  I remember asking him to come and help us on the floor on issues he \ncared about. He really cared about education. He wanted education \nsavings accounts. He believed it would help parents with children in \nschool. He believed it would help low-income parents have the ability \nto save just a little bit of their money, just a little bit to help \ntheir children with clothes or computers or tutoring. If we ever find a \nway to pass that legislation, instead of education savings accounts, it \nshould be the Coverdell savings accounts. That would be an appropriate \nmemorial and monument to Paul Coverdell. He believed in it. It wasn't a \npartisan political thing. It was something he thought would make a \ndifference.\n\n  As for drugs, I remember him following me around in the well heckling \nme about the need to pay more attention to the drug running in the Gulf \nof Mexico area across the borders in the Southwest. The Senator from \nArizona worked with him on that issue. I remember his commitment to \ntrying to be helpful to the Government in Colombia to fight drug \nterrorism there. He was passionate about it because he felt it \nthreatened our country, threatened our very sovereignty, and it \nthreatened our children. Once again, as with education, he saw it in \nterms of what it was doing or could do to our children. Again, he was \ninvolved.\n  One of the last discussions I had with him was on the intelligence \nauthorization bill. There is a provision in it which he didn't \nparticularly like. He was determined to have a way to make his case on \nthat. In his memory, we will make sure his case is made by Senator Kyl, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator DeWine, perhaps others. He really would dig \ninto issues and make a difference.\n  I also called on him at times when there really was nobody else who \ncould take the time to do the job.\n  He worked with us for a solid week on the floor on the Labor, HHS, \nEducation appropriations bill. I came in one day and found that we had \nover 200 amendments pending. Somebody had to take the time to work with \nboth sides to begin to get those amendments reduced, accepted, \neliminated, withdrawn, or whatever. To his credit, Senator Specter \nsaid: I would like to have Paul spend time helping me with this.\n  Other leadership members were involved in other issues. I could not \nbe here. Senator Nickles could not be here. We had other things we had \nto do. Within a short period of time, the 200 became 50. Before the \nweek was out, it was done.\n  Senator Reid will tell you that Paul really made the difference. He \ndidn't just hang out on this side of the aisle; he was rummaging around \non the other side trying to see if we could work through it. I remember \nat the end of the week he was a little pale and, obviously, a little \nstressed. He came to my office and said: Boy, do I understand a little \nbit better what your job entails.\n  Well, he was able to do it because nobody felt threatened by Paul. He \nwasn't getting in my hair, stepping on Senator Nickles' turf, or \ninappropriately shoving amendments away. He was working with everybody \ninvolved. Nobody got mad. Nobody got even. It is sort of a unique thing \nfor a Senator to be able to do that.\n  So I guess I will be trying to find another ``Mikey.'' But I don't \nthink there is one. And so as I thought about doing this speech, I \ntried to find some statement, some poem, something that would pay a \nfinal appropriate treatment to Senator Coverdell. I came across a \npassage from a poem, ``The Comfort of Friends,'' by William Penn.\n  He said:\n\n     They that love beyond the world\n     Cannot be separated by it.\n     Death cannot kill what never dies,\n     Nor can spirits ever be divided\n     That love and live in the same divine principle:\n     [Because that is] the root and record of their friendship.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments and \nhis very strong feelings about friends, people with whom he has worked.\n  I had a little different experience, I guess, with Paul Coverdell in \nthat he was here when I came. So I was not in this business of \nleadership with him. Indeed, he took time to spend time with those of \nus who were new and to say: How can I help you? How can we work \ntogether? This was the kind of man that Paul Coverdell was. Certainly, \nhe was an image that each of us should seek to perpetuate--that of \ncaring, that of really feeling strongly about issues, and then, of \ncourse, being willing to do something about it. So I want to share with \nthe leader my sorrow and sadness in not having Paul Coverdell here with \nus. I extend our condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7464-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7464-S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOALS FOR THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to talk \nabout some of the things we are doing, some of the goals I hope we \nhave, and the position we find ourselves in now as we come down to the \nlast week prior to the August recess.\n  When we come back from the August recess, we will have, I suppose, \nabout 20 working days to finish this 2-year session of Congress, the \n106th session. We will have a great deal to do. As we go forward, as we \ntake a look at the day-to-day tasks and activities that we have before \nus, I hope always that we look at where we want to go and what the \ngoals are.\n  Sometimes I feel as if we get wrapped up in the day-to-day operations \nand the day-to-day problems and we lose sight\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nof where it is we want to be. But overall, as a Member of the Senate, \nor as an American citizen who is interested in Government, and as a \nvoter, it seems to me that we ought to look at where we want to be over \na period of time. Many things are involved, of course, in that. I think \nwe have to take a look at where we are with respect to the \nConstitution. Most of us believe this Constitution has given us the \ngreatest country in the world. This Constitution has given us more \nfreedom, more opportunity, and more privileges than anywhere else in \nthe world. Are we continuing to support that Constitution? Where will \nwe be in 50 years? Where will we be in 10 years?\n  With regard to the role of the Federal Government, where do we want \nto be? What is our goal in terms of the future? What is the role of the \nFederal Government with regard to individual freedoms? What is the role \nof the Federal Government with respect to local government--the States \nand counties? Do we want a Federal Government that dominates all the \nthings that we do? I don't believe so. So as we do each of these steps, \nit seems to me that it is appropriate to try to evaluate a little what \nwe are doing and how that contributes to where we want to go. I know it \nis difficult. I think it is a challenge for each of us as we go about \nwhat we are doing.\n\n  I am, frankly, proud of what we have been able to do in this session. \nI am pleased about the direction the majority in the Senate has taken \nwith regard to many of the issues; with regard to the balanced budget; \nwith regard to Social Security; with regard to spending as it reflects \nSocial Security and the changes that we have made to stabilize Social \nSecurity, making it strong; what we have done in terms of education; \nwhere we are in terms of the military and the security of this country, \nwhich is probably the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  So I think we ought to look at where we are. We are close now to \nfinishing up. We have a number of things to do. But our determination, \nI believe, should be to stay within the budget we established. We have \na budget program in which early this year we established spending \nlimitations that we wanted to live within. It is difficult to do that. \nEveryone has a good idea as to where we can spend money. There are \nthousands of opportunities to spend money.\n  Frankly, when you have a surplus, spending becomes easier; it becomes \nsomething that everybody sort of gets into doing. We a have balanced \nbudget. We maintain Social Security without spending Social Security \ndollars. We have been working on strengthening Medicare and \npharmaceuticals, and we must continue to do that. We need to set up the \ntechnique for paying down the debt that we ought to pay. We have an \nobligation to pay that so our children don't have to. We are dedicated \nto returning the surplus back to the taxpayers, the people who have \npaid in the dollars. The surplus, indeed, should go back to them.\n  So it seems to me that we have a principle in our party, in this \nmajority of the Senate, and in the Senate generally, for fiscal \nresponsibility, for preserving Social Security, tax relief, and \neducation. I am very proud of what we have done.\n  With regard to balancing the budget, actually in the last several \nyears--it is the first time since the Eisenhower administration in 1957 \nthat we balanced the budget with funds outside of Social Security. As \nthe money comes in, of course, it comes in a unified budget. Social \nSecurity money has been borrowed and spent on programs other than \nSocial Security. In 1995, when the Republicans took control of \nCongress, for the first time in 42 years, we began to balance the \nbudget. I am pretty proud of that. I hope that we continue to be.\n  In terms of Social Security, of course, the first obligation is to \nset aside those dollars so that they are not spent on something else. \nUnder our system, all that we can do with Social Security dollars is to \nput them into the trust fund, a Federal investment, which yields a \nrelatively low return. We are seeking to take a portion of the Social \nSecurity funds now and let that account belong to the individual, so \nthat when young people take their first job and have 12.5 percent of \ntheir earnings set aside, a portion of that can be in an account that \nbelongs to them, which can be invested in the private sector at their \ndirection, which can return a much higher yield so that over time there \nwill be benefits for young people, probably leaving the ones 55 and \nolder not doing anything at all and making sure they stay as they are.\n\n  Young people years from now will not have a return unless they do \nsomething different. We could increase taxes. Nobody is much interested \nin that. We could reduce benefits. That is not an answer. But we can \nincrease the return on the trust funds. We are doing that.\n  We are funding education at a higher level than before, at a higher \nlevel than the administration requested. But probably more important is \nthe effort made to return the decisions made with regard to elementary \nand secondary education back to the schools--closer to the school \ndistricts and closer to the school boards, rather than having those \ndecisions being made in Washington. I can tell you that the needs in \nPine Bluffs, WY, are much different from those in Pittsburgh.\n  You have to have some flexibility. We have the Ed-Flex bill so that \nthose kinds of decisions can be made. I am pretty proud of that. I am \nvery pleased with that. As the leader said, Senator Coverdell was the \nleader in doing those kinds of things.\n  As for strengthening the military, we are finding ourselves, of \ncourse, at a time when we don't have the cold war, where the \ninclination is for the emphasis to be off the military. This is not a \nsimple world. We find ourselves at times needing a strong defense. We \nhave a voluntary military, which we should have. But you have to make \nit relatively attractive for people to go into the military and stay \nthere. You bring people into the military and train them to be pilots \nand mechanics; then they leave. We have done something there. We have \nincreased the appropriations. We have increased, hopefully, the pay. Of \ncourse, if you are going to have an up-to-date military, there has to \nbe science moving forward in new weaponry. We have to have new weapons. \nIt is most difficult to do that.\n  This weekend I visited the Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, WY, one \nof the major bases. It is really one of the stable portions of our \ndefense. We have to support that, of course.\n  Health care, naturally, is one of the things that is most important. \nWe have moved to improve some of the payments that were made. We made \nsome reductions in the balanced budget amendment in 1996. However, the \nadministration has made those even larger than was intended. We have to \ngo back and reclaim some of those payments--particularly for outpatient \ncare and hospitals.\n  These are the things the majority party has worked toward and \ncontinues to work on.\n  We find ourselves now in the appropriations process. There are 13 \nappropriations bills to be passed. Hopefully, we will get 11 of them \npassed by the time this week is over. But it is very difficult. We have \nto challenge the administration. If they don't get their way--if they \ndon't get the money they want in a particular appropriations--they are \ngoing to veto it. The President has threatened to shut down the \nGovernment, as he did before, and blame the Congress, of course. We \nhave to keep that from happening. Nobody wants to shut down the Federal \nGovernment. We have different points of view. We have a different \nphilosophy.\n  That is what this is all about. We debate those philosophies. Some \npeople think government ought to be involved in all of life's \nactivities. Others think there is no end to the amount of abuses that \ncan take place. Others believe there ought to be some limit on the \nrules of the Federal Government. After we strengthen Medicare and pay \ndown the debt, we ought to return additional money to those people who \nhave made the payments.\n\n  With regard to paying down the debt, I am hopeful we can consider the \nproposition of a plan to do that. Again, our goal is to pay off the \nnational debt of $6 trillion. It seems to me we ought to do it in an \norganized way--do it a little as a mortgage where you decide every year \nyou are going to pay off some on the debt--and move toward doing that. \nIf you keep saying, we will pay it down one of these days, it never \nhappens. The interest on that debt becomes one of the largest items in \nthe budget. We can fix that if we are willing to do it.\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n  I am very proud of what we have accomplished in this Congress. I \nthink we have established a philosophy and a direction of providing \nadequate programs for controlling the size and growth of expenditures \nof the Federal Government; doing those things that are necessary, yet \nmoving many decisions back closer to the people and the local \ngovernments; taking care of the obligations we have, such as paying \ndown the debt and returning those dollars.\n  One of the real controversies, of course, is going to be the tax \nrelief that passed the Senate. The tax relief is in two areas that seem \nto be particularly appropriate--the marriage penalty tax, where two \npeople who are working for x amount of dollars get married, continue to \nmake the same amount of dollars, and then pay more taxes. It is a \nfairness issue. There is something wrong with that. We have changed \nthat. The President has threatened to veto it.\n  The other one that needs to be changed, in my opinion--and the \nPresiding Officer has been a leader in this--is the death tax, the \nestate tax, the idea that when someone dies, up to 50 percent of their \nearnings throughout their life can be taken by the Federal Government.\n  The alternative, of course, is to not let death be a trigger for \ntaxes but, rather, let those moneys be passed on to whomever they wish \nto pass them on to, and whenever things are disposed of and sold, there \nis a capital gains tax, of course, on the growth that has taken place. \nIt seems to me that is a fairness issue.\n  That is where we are. Those are some of the exciting things that I \nthink are happening, and things that fit in, I believe, with the goals \nmost of us have in terms of moving forward with this Federal \nGovernment.\n  We now have a fairly short time to continue doing what has to be \ndone. Appropriations have to be done. We need to continue with our tax \nreductions and continue with strengthening education. We need to \ncontinue in health care. We are on the road to doing that. I am very \npleased with how we are doing it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7466-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to take a few \nmoments to reflect on some things you said and also on what the \nmajority leader said a little while ago.\n  After our colleague Paul Coverdell died, I made a very brief \nstatement on the floor. I knew I should speak briefly because it would \nbe difficult to talk very long about Paul without becoming too \nemotional.\n  I think at a time when politics generally and politicians \nspecifically are the subject of a lot of humor--they are denigrated \nbecause of cynicism about the political process, and in fact in some \ncases the denigration of some politicians is probably warranted--it is \nimportant for the American people to be reassured that there are some \nextraordinarily fine public servants who toil very hard on their behalf \nand who are responsible for whatever good comes out of these \ninstitutions--the House and the Senate.\n  Paul Coverdell was such a man. All of us who have spoken about him \nhave shared with our colleagues and with the American people the same \ngeneral notion that it is amazing what you can do if you are willing to \nlet others take the credit for it. That was Paul Coverdell--self-\neffacing, very hard working, totally trustworthy and honest. Everyone \ncould rely upon him to do the things that had to be done without fear \nhe would in any way attempt to take advantage of any situation. He was \nas solid as a rock and a very important part of this institution--\nsomeone who really helped to make it run, and run in a good way.\n  I am sure my constituents in Arizona for the most part are unaware of \nSenator Coverdell, but they and others all around this country need to \nknow how sorely he will be missed--not only personally but \nprofessionally--and how important a contribution he made to this \ncountry. There are truly some wonderful public servants, and Paul \nCoverdell was one of the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7466-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7466-S7468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONCERNS OF ARIZONA CONSTITUENTS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when I was in Arizona this weekend, there \nwere three things that seemed to come up frequently. One, of course, \nwas the Vice Presidential selection of Governor Bush for the Republican \nnomination this fall. The other two subjects were the issues of tax \nrelief, and I will briefly discuss that, and missile defense, which I \nwill add to the mix, to share some of my constituents' concerns.\n  On the matter of Vice President, obviously, that is a subject of \nwhich Governor Bush will speak today or tomorrow, perhaps. Those on the \nRepublican side will be, I am sure, very supportive. If it is former \nDefense Secretary Dick Cheney, I think we will be especially pleased. I \ncan't think of anyone who could make a better contribution, not only to \nthe ticket but also to a future Republican administration, than Dick \nCheney. He is from the Presiding Officer's State of Wyoming. He \nrepresents the kind of values that both the Presiding Officer and \nothers from that great State represent: Straightforwardness, plain-\nspokenness, honesty, directness, a good strong sense of values, a \nwillingness to do the hard work without having to take a lot of the \ncredit, traits we treasure in someone such as Senator Paul Coverdell, \nand which Dick Cheney would certainly bring to the job. His experience \nand the great respect which people not only in this country but around \nthe world have for Dick Cheney would serve the ticket well. I am not \nattempting to influence Governor Bush in any way, but if his choice is \nDick Cheney, there couldn't be a better choice.\n\n  Now the other two subjects my constituents raised this past weekend. \nI was astounded that these were the two things they wanted to talk \nabout: The tax relief that the Republican Congress continues to pass, \nand pass on to the President; and, secondly, the matter of missile \ndefense, which I will get to in a moment.\n  I was amused to hear the Democratic candidate for President talk \nabout a do-nothing Congress. This is rather strange, considering the \nfact that we have passed over and over and over legislation to help the \nAmerican people, particularly to relieve them of some of the tax burden \nwhich imposes upon them an extra burden that they need not bear and \nthat is inhibitive of future economic growth.\n  I am surprised that a Congress which has been so active--and, indeed, \nPresident Clinton has criticized us for being so active in this \nregard--would be accused then of being ``do-nothing.'' In truth, it is \nnot the Congress that isn't willing to do these things; it is the \nClinton-Gore administration that is unwilling to do these things.\n  Let me give some cases in point. We passed the estate tax relief \nabout which the Presiding Officer talked. It passed overwhelmingly in \nboth bodies, with bipartisan support. But the Clinton-Gore \nadministration says it will veto this tax relief. We passed the \nmarriage penalty, something that President Clinton said, in his State \nof the Union speech, was a top priority for him. He says he will veto \nthat legislation. We can pass all of these things, but we can't get \nthem into law unless the President signs them. We are doing our best in \nthe Congress. It is now up to the President.\n  He did sign one thing that we passed this year. The Social Security \nearnings limitation was finally repealed. That was an important part of \ntax relief for an important part of my constituency, our senior \ncitizens. There is more work to do there.\n  We want to also repeal the 1993 tax increase on Social Security which \nwas imposed by the Clinton administration and the Democratic Congress \nwhen it controlled the House and the Senate, and Vice President Gore is \nalways proud to remind everyone that he had to cast the deciding vote. \nThis was the 1993 tax increase which, among other things, imposes a tax \nrate of up to 85 percent on the Social Security earnings of our senior \ncitizens. This is\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nwrong and it ought to be repealed. If and when we do it, I will call \nupon the President to sign that.\n  We will probably send to him a repeal of the Spanish-American War era \ntelephone tax. I think we can safely do this. The war has been over now \nfor some time. We don't need to fund the Spanish-American War anymore. \nLike many other taxes and programs in Washington, once they are \ninstituted, it is very difficult to ever get rid of them.\n  We are finally going to take the step to do that, as we did with the \nmarriage penalty, as we did with the estate tax, as we did with the \nSocial Security earnings limit. We are going to repeal this tax, as \nwell, and call upon the President to sign this.\n  We have not been doing nothing. We have been doing something, \nsomething very worthwhile for the American people. I ask the President \nto reconsider his threat to veto these important tax cuts. Now, his \nargument is, maybe we can't afford it; it is a lot of money--this after \nreceiving news that our tax surplus is going to be in the trillions of \ndollars--not billions, not hundreds of billions, but trillions of \ndollars. This is not a budget surplus; this is a tax surplus. It is a \ntax surplus because the taxes we have imposed on the American people \nbring in far more money than we should or can spend. I say ``can'' \nbecause, of course, Congress has the capacity to spend an unlimited \namount of money.\n\n  We have set some standards in the Republican-controlled Congress. We \nhave said we are not going to touch a dime of the Social Security \nsurplus. The Social Security surplus is much larger than the non-Social \nSecurity surplus. This is the money that comes in as a result of the \npayment of our FICA taxes. Those are far greater than the need to pay \nthe benefits under the Social Security program right now. And we are \napplying every dime of the Social Security surplus to a reduction of \nour Federal debt. That is why our Federal debt is being reduced so \ndramatically now.\n  The question is, What should be done with the non-Social Security \nsurplus? It does not seem too much to me to return a dime, a dime on a \ndollar of that surplus, in the form of the marriage penalty relief and \nthe estate tax relief to the American people. Under the most liberal \ninterpretation of how much that would cost--and it is not nearly as \nmuch as this figure would suggest--but under the most liberal \ninterpretation, it would be 10 cents on the dollar of the surplus we \nhave.\n  It seems to me, since we are collecting more in taxes than we need--\neven after huge increases in spending in virtually every program we \nhave--it is not too much to return 10 percent of this tax surplus to \nthe American people. That is the magnitude of the issue. When President \nClinton says it costs too much, he is saying the Federal Government \nought to spend that money, rather then allowing the American people to \nkeep this 10 cents on the dollar. That is arrogance of the first \nmagnitude. That was one of the concerns my constituents presented to me \nthis week.\n  The other had to do with missile defense. My constituents understand \nthe need to protect America. They understand that Secretary Cohen has \nsaid we have a threat from North Korea, from Iran. There will be a \nthreat from Iran; certainly China has been rattling its sabers these \ndays. They understand that there is no way we can prevent an attacking \nmissile from landing on the United States today and that it will be at \nleast 5 years before we can do that if we proceed as rapidly as we \npossibly can. They are anxious we get on with the job of getting a \nmissile defense program in place to protect the American people and to \nprevent other countries from blackmailing the United States from being \ninvolved in issues around the world in which we know we need to be \ninvolved.\n  This last weekend, there was a successful test--it didn't get much \npublicity--of the Patriot missile against a cruise missile target. This \nis another important component of missile defense. The last national \nmissile defense test was a failure. From that, many people have said \nthey conclude that there can't possibly be a successful program and we \nought to just pack up and go home, ignoring the fact that the threat \nexists; also, Mr. President, ignoring something else. There is a phrase \nthat has found its way into our jargon these days: ``It is not rocket \nscience.'' Mr. President, this is rocket science, and it ain't easy. \nSometimes it takes some failures in order to get to the successful \nconclusion of a program. There are over 20 tests in this particular \nprogram scheduled, most of them yet to be conducted. It is rocket \nscience. It is hard. But we can do it. The people involved in the \nprogram are confident of that.\n  The failure in this last test, incidentally, was not a failure of any \nof the high technology. It was one of those quirks that can occur when \nsomething you have done hundreds of times before just did not happen to \nwork on this particular occasion. But it was not a failure of the high-\ntech end of this missile defense program which we need to test to make \nsure it can work.\n  To my colleagues who may have been concerned as a result of the \nfailure of this last test, I suggest to them we stay the course and \ncontinue the program as outlined by the Department of Defense, which I \nbelieve will be successful and will enable us to deploy a missile \ndefense to protect the American people.\n  Final point. There are many who have urged the President to defer a \ndecision, that he not make a decision. We have already made that \ndecision when we passed the Missile Defense Act and President Clinton \nsigned it into law. That decision was to deploy a national missile \ndefense as soon as technologically feasible, and we believe it will be \nfeasible. Therefore, we need to move forward with the program. That is \nwhy the President should not defer a decision. He should make a \ndecision to go forward, but he should, of course, defer the specifics \nas to exactly what that program is for the next President to decide. \nThat can be done, but there should be no backing away from going \nforward, and that is the decision the President should make.\n  Ultimately, of course, I think Governor Bush is correct. There will \nneed to be not just one element of a system but, rather, the \nflexibility to deploy a multilayered defense for the American people \nwhich involves both land-based assets as well as sea-based assets and \nspace-based assets. You need satellites to detect and track the \ntrajectory of a missile. You can also be benefited by other assets in \nspace. Certainly a missile defense would be augmented very well with \nsea-based capability, which could, under certain circumstances, even \nhave a boost-phase intercept capability because of its proximity to the \nlaunching of the offensive missile.\n  All of this is well understood. I believe the Congress should stay \nthe course and urge the administration to go forward with its decision. \nOf course, the details will be left to the next administration, but we \nshould not signal we are not willing to protect the American people \nfrom missile attack.\n  Mr. President, you mentioned, in closing, we are hoping to take up \nthe permanent trade relations with China toward the end of this week. I \nvery strongly support the efforts by Senator Thompson to ensure that at \nthe same time we are moving to open our trade with China, we make it \nclear to China that there are certain things which are inimical to \npeace around the world and certainly to our security. Included in that \nis China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmissiles to deliver those weapons to other countries, countries of \nconcern--the so-called rogue nations of Iran and Iraq and North Korea. \nIt may also be proliferating to other countries that we would prefer \nnot have large arsenals of these weapons.\n  The bottom line is that although we can and should move forward in \ndeveloping closer and more robust trade with China, we cannot allow \nthat kind of activity to suggest to China that we do not care about our \nown national security and about peace and stability and security in the \nworld. That is why I think it is appropriate for us to also adopt the \nThompson legislation which will make it clear that, for those who are \ninvolved in the proliferation, sanctions will result. I am hoping we \ncan take that up at the end of this week.\n  Those are concerns that were expressed by my constituents this \nweekend. I told them I would share them with my colleagues. I have now \ndone that and I appreciate the indulgence of the Presiding Officer, \nwhose time I have been taking.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the last part of our time here I want \nto follow up a little bit on your comments about the prospects for the \nVice Presidential nomination for Dick Cheney. Partly, I guess, that is \nbecause it is a personal thing. As you mentioned, Dick Cheney is from \nWyoming. Indeed, he is still a resident and now I understand he is \nvoting in Wyoming. Certainly he is a friend. As a matter of fact, I \ntook Dick Cheney's place in the House when he took the job as Secretary \nof Defense. I was more delighted about his promotion than anyone else, \nI suppose.\n  Aside from that, I guess I am really impressed with the opportunities \nthat might bring about. Of course, it is up to the Governor, Governor \nBush, to do whatever he chooses. He has not yet made an announcement. \nBut it seems to me it is satisfying to think of someone being on that \nticket who is just a basic person, who has demonstrated his ability to \ndo so many things in government and outside of government. I think it \nis kind of unusual in today's political scene for it to be someone who \njust says it like it is, not the great spin.\n  I was thinking about that yesterday. I was hearing some things on the \nradio, trying to make one thing sound like another. That is not the way \nDick Cheney does things. He just says it.\n  He has a great background in government. He worked in the White \nHouse, was Chief of Staff. By the way, I saw him at the airport in \nDenver. He seems to be doing well. Of course, he was in the House of \nRepresentatives, I think, for six terms--a number of terms, anyway. He \nrose to leadership there. He was selected then, as you know, to be \nSecretary of Defense. He did a super job in the gulf war and the \nactivities there.\n  So it just seems to me he would bring to anyone's ticket this ideal \nof a strong, stable person, knowledgeable, ready to move in and do the \nkinds of things that are required of the leadership of this country.\n  I guess I am a cheerleader for Dick Cheney. Hopefully, we will have a \nchance to continue to do that over the next several months.\n  Mr. President, our time is nearly expired. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is still our hope, but at this \ntime, at least, there is objection from our colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to proceeding on appropriations bills. We \nhave a lot we can do this week, and I certainly hope we will do that. \nUnder this action we have just taken, we can have some discussion by \nthe chairman of the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations \nsubcommittee. I see the manager, the chairman of the subcommittee, is \nhere. I am sure he will want to make some comments and outline what is \nincluded in the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7468-6", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7468-S7469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, we also need to get the intelligence \nauthorization bill done this week. I don't think it will take that long \nto complete it, although I suspect there are at least a couple issues \nthat will have to be debated and voted on. I had the impression maybe \nhalf a day or a night would be all that would be necessary to complete \nthis. I am hoping maybe sometime even Thursday we might complete it, \nand before, if possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 654, S. 2507, the intelligence \nauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I say to my \nfriend, the majority leader, on the minority side we also want to move \non. We think there is a lot of work that could be done and should be \ndone. For example, on Friday, with the energy and water appropriations \nbill, there was a provision in there that is very objectionable to a \nnumber of people on this side of the aisle, not the least of whom is \nthe minority leader. The minority leader said take that out; it can be \ndealt with in conference. We think that is the case.\n  That is my bill. It is a very important bill, almost $23 billion. All \nof this money is discretionary money. It is a very important \nappropriation bill on which Senator Domenici and I have worked. We wish \nwe could move that forward. We think it should move forward.\n  I also say to my friend, the majority leader, I think it is \nunfortunate that we have been unable today to deal with Senator Hatch. \nI understand there is a big celebration in Utah, Pioneer Day, on July \n24, and he is committed to be there. I hope this evening or tomorrow we \ncan sit down and talk. For example, I believe the judge's name is \nWhite, a Michigan judge, who has been before the committee and has not \nhad a hearing; the nomination had been sent to the committee almost \n1,200 days ago. In meeting with Senator Hatch and learning what his \nproblems are, we will try to be as understanding as we can of his \nproblems. I hope he will be as understanding of our problems as we are \nof his.\n  Senator Daschle and I said this on Thursday: We appreciate very much \nthe work the majority leader has done. As powerful as he is, he still \ncannot overrule all the committee chairmen. They are here by virtue of \ntheir seniority. It makes it very tough to do that. We want to work to \nmove this along. We believe the energy and water bill could move in a \nday or a day and a half.\n  Treasury-Postal: We don't believe that is a difficult bill. There are \na couple touchy issues on that, but we believe we could work with the \nmajority and move that along. We don't want it to appear that we are \ntrying to hold things up. I think we have a pretty good record the past \nmonth or so of working with the leader.\n  In short, we hope in the meeting with Senator Hatch, either tonight \nor tomorrow, we will be in a position where we can expedite the rest of \nthe work this week and move on to other things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I want to note that I did not move to \nproceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. I did that on \npurpose. I did it out of respect for the Democratic leader and the \nobjection he has made to a particular section and the fact that it is \nobviously something very important to him and the Senators from North \nDakota and South Dakota and other States.\n  But there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who actually \nsupport section 103 because of the impact this might have on the \nMissouri downriver in States such as Missouri, Illinois, and perhaps \neven, most importantly, as far as my own State of Mississippi. I talked \nto Senator Domenici and Senator Daschle this morning. I still hope we \ncan find a way to resolve that. If that one issue can be resolved, I \nthink that bill might take a couple hours and could be completed. I \nstill have that on our list as one of the three bills we really must do \nthis week.\n  With regard to the judges, I have made a commitment to try to \ncontinue to move judges who have been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. I continue to urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nto act on those judges who could be reported out. They did report out \nfive judges last week, including a circuit judge from the State of \nNevada who will wind up being on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nCalifornia, I guess, and so I think I have been keeping my word to try \nto move those.\n  I believe the Judiciary Committee is prepared to have a hearing or is \nhaving a hearing tomorrow and will move at least four more judges \ntomorrow. I think it would be unfortunate if those four got tangled up \nin these difficulties we are outlining now.\n  It is very hard for me to understand why these appropriations bills \nand this authorization bill, the intelligence authorization bill, would \nbe held up over one circuit court judge or even two circuit court \njudges who may still be acted on or have hearings and be reported out. \nBut the majority leader cannot just direct the Judiciary Committee or \nthe chairman that he must report a specific judge. I think it is \nresponsible for me to say: Report those judges where you can and that \ncan be cleared and voted on. But I am not now in a position to \nguarantee that a specific one judge will be reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. We will keep working with the chairman of the committee, and \nhopefully some solution can be found. I think we can find it.\n  In the meantime, we are losing a day here. I hope we don't lose all \nday tomorrow. But that is our goal this week, to try to get some \njudges, try to do two or three appropriations bills, try to do \nintelligence authorization, and to begin debate on the China PNTR \nissue.\n  I guess there is no option for me at this time, though, but to move \nto proceed to the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I move to proceed to S. 2507, and I send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this cloture vote will occur on Wednesday, \nunless we are already in a post cloture situation on the Treasury-\nPostal Service appropriations bill, or unless, of course, we have done \naway with the procedure and found a way to go directly to the substance \nof the bill. And, again, I hope we can do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I now withdraw the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The motion is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the leader leaves the floor, I want \nto say very quickly--and we need not discuss the issue of judges--this \nSenate really did well last week. Around the country, there were a \nseries of editorials that were supportive of what the Senate did \nregarding the appellate judge; they were all positive for the majority \nand minority. That was a good move.\n  One reason, as I indicated, is that one of the Senators is upset \nbecause his judge is taking some 1,200 days before a hearing. Also, we \nrecognize that the number of judges approved, while we have done quite \nwell in the last few weeks, is still way behind what it should be.\n  I wanted to direct a question to the majority leader. Are we still \ngoing to have a vote at 6 o'clock? We are getting telephone calls in \nboth Cloakrooms.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we could manufacture a vote, as the \nSenator knows, and force that vote. But in light of all that is going \non, I don't see that it would serve any purpose other than sort of a \nbed check vote. It had been my intent to have votes on amendments to \nthe Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, but that is not \npossible. I think since we have had to take this action and file \ncloture, we should announce that there will not be a recorded vote or \nvotes tonight at 6 o'clock.\n  The next opportunity to vote, I presume, will possibly be in the \nmorning. I hope we can begin to make progress in some way during the \nday today, or early tomorrow, so votes can be held, if necessary, \nbefore the luncheon, or immediately thereafter.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want the Record to reflect that during \nthe past week, on Mondays--last Monday, we had lots and lots of votes. \nThe preceding Friday, we had lots and lots of votes. If the public is \nlooking at the number of votes cast, we are doing pretty well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I don't know what the number was, but I \nthink on Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday of last week and the \nprevious week, we probably cast at least 20, 25 votes--maybe 30. So we \ncertainly are turning out votes and getting our work done. We had a \nvery good week last week and the week before. I hope we are going to \nhave one yet this week. We are just not ready to make a lot of progress \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7470-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nprovision included in the House-passed Department of Defense (DOD) \nAuthorization bill which provides a permanent chiropractic benefit to \nall active military personnel. Iowans have a long history of support \nfor the chiropractic profession. In fact, the nation's oldest \ninstitution of higher chiropractic learning--Palmer College--is located \nin Davenport, Iowa.\n  I am pleased that both the House and Senate have included provisions \nin their respective DOD authorization bills which expand access to \nchiropractic services for members of the military. These provisions \nfollow on the heels of a multi-year pilot program enacted in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. The pilot \nprogram demonstrated that military personnel who received chiropractic \ncare had higher levels of satisfaction with the care they received as \ncompared to personnel who only received traditional medical care. \nFurthermore, the pilot project demonstrated that chiropractic care \nwould reduce hospitalization, return injured patients to work more \nquickly, and would result in a net savings to the Department of Defense \nin excess of $25 million annually.\n  The Defense Authorization Act passed by the House of Representatives \nbegins the process of fully integrating chiropractic care into the \nmilitary health care system on a direct access basis. The Senate-passed \nbill, however, limits chiropractic care through a medical gatekeeper. \nDirect access to chiropractic care would expedite the delivery of \nchiropractic care to those patients most in need of services and would \nfree up existing health care providers to concentrate their time and \nefforts in other areas requiring attention. Therefore, I join the \nchiropractic profession in asking the conferees of the DOD \nAuthorization legislation to accept the House-passed provision and \nprovide direct access to chiropractic services to all active military \npersonnel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7471-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7471-S7472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR EDWARD W. BROOKE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a former member of \nthis body, Senator Edward W. Brooke. Senator Brooke has served the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts as both a Massachusetts Attorney General \nand United States Senator. Recently, I had the privilege of attending \nthe dedication of the New Chardon Street Courthouse in Boston on June \n20th, named in honor of Senator Brooke. Given the former Senator's \nprestigious record of service to both the citizens of Massachusetts and \nthe Nation, it is fitting that this honor be bestowed upon him.\n  During his distinguished career which spanned the course of two \ndecades, Senator Brooke earned the prominent distinction of being the \nfirst African-American directly elected to both a State Attorney \nGeneral position and the United States Senate. While in each office, \nSenator Brooke spearheaded efforts to achieve civil rights and equality \nfor women, minorities, and the poor.\n  Elected Massachusetts Attorney General in 1962, Senator Brooke earned \nhis reputation as a crime-fighter through his extensive work with the \nnewly created Massachusetts Crime Commission. He actively combated \ncorruption in State government and singlehandedly organized and \ncompleted the extensive investigation of the infamous ``Boston \nStrangler'' homicides.\n  Only 4 years later, he became the first African-American Senator to \nserve since Reconstruction, and the first and only to be re-elected. \nDuring his two terms in Congress, Senator Brooke figured prominently \ninto all aspects of the Senate. He vigorously opposed escalation of the \nVietnam war and supported arms control treaties like the MIRV and ABM \nproposals that would eventually become the catalysts in establishing \nimproved relations and recognizing the People's Republic of China. \nSenator Brooke was the first Republican Senator to call for President \nNixon's resignation after the Watergate scandal. In addition, Senator \nBrooke was a tireless champion of the poor. He authored the ``Brooke \namendment,'' which provided that public housing tenants pay no more \nthan one-fourth of their income for housing.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the text of Senator \nBrooke's comments at the New Chardon Street Courthouse dedication \nceremony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Edward W. Brooke Courthouse Dedication\n\n       I respectfully ask that you join me in a moment of silence \n     in memory of a dear and cherished friend, Roger H. Woodworth, \n     a former Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General, who served \n     his country in war, and his fellow man all the days of his \n     life.\n       I could not write nor can I speak words which adequately \n     convey the appreciation of my wife, Anne, our daughters, son, \n     grandchildren and all of our family for this splendid \n     recognition. It is, of course, an honor for me, but, more \n     importantly, the naming of this courthouse also recognizes \n     the exemplary service of the men and women with whom I was \n     privileged to work in the Boston Finance Commission, the \n     Office of the Attorney General and in the United States \n     Senate.\n       I am particularly grateful to Senator Brian Lees, Governor \n     Paul Cellucci, Senate President Thomas Birmingham, House \n     Speaker Thomas Finneran, the 200 members of the Great and \n     General Court, and all of the people of the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts for this honor.\n       I also want to thank Kallmann, McKinnell & Wood, for their \n     architectural vision and creativity and the contractors \n     O'Connor & Dimeo & O'Connor for building this magnificent \n     structure.\n       Thanks also go to those who labor within, Chief Justice \n     Barbara Dortch-Okara, the judges who dispense justice, \n     clerks, administrators, and especially those who secure and \n     maintain this courthouse and who bear the responsibility for \n     present and future safety, cleanliness and decorum.\n       I extend my warmest appreciation to all who have organized \n     and participated in this ceremony, the clergy, the officials, \n     the speakers, the singers, the band, the color guard, the \n     police, the Metropolitan District Commissioner David Balfour \n     and the dedication committee, and to all of you who have come \n     from Maine to California, from the Berkshires to the Cape and \n     Islands, and from the Caribbean.\n       My association with Massachusetts began on Pearl Harbor \n     Day, December 7, 1941, when I received a telegram from the \n     United States Army ordering me to report to the 366th \n     Infantry Combat Regiment at Fort Devens, in Ayer, \n     Massachusetts. It was to be the first time for me to set foot \n     on Massachusetts soil.\n       I could not possibly have foreseen that after the war I \n     would have returned to Massachusetts to study law at the \n     Boston University School of Law, to practice law in Roxbury \n     and in Boston and to serve in public office. Nor could I have \n     known that the people of Massachusetts were to give me the \n     greatest opportunities and challenges of my life.\n       This building and its location have special meaning for me. \n     In my law school days I lived a stone's throw away, at 98 \n     Chamber Street in the West End of Boston before I moved to \n     Roxbury to live with my old Army buddy Al Brothers and his \n     wife, Edith. I attended classes at Boston University Law \n     School at 11 Ashburton Place, a few blocks up the hill from \n     here and studied contract and constitutional law on a bench \n     in the Boston Commons just behind the Robert Gould Shaw \n     Monument. I practically boarded at Durgin Park, over there, \n     near Faneuil Hall, where the servings of pot roast, mashed \n     potatoes and cornbread were generous and the price was right.\n       Later, after practicing law on Humbolt Avenue in Roxbury, I \n     practiced law in Pemberton Square across the street from the \n     old Boston Municipal Court just up the hill. It was during \n     those days that I practiced in the same probate, land and \n     juvenile, now the more civilly named family court, all now in \n     this new building. And, at first, to make a living, I \n     searched many a title in the musty volumes upstairs in the \n     office of the old Suffolk County Registry of Deeds, Later, I \n     worked in the offices of the Boston Finance Commission, just \n     down the street from the Parker House, and still later, in \n     the Office of the Attorney General in the old bullfinch State \n     House, all within a short walking distance of this new \n     building.\n       My relationship with Boston has now come full circle within \n     the naming of this courthouse and my involvement in the \n     restoration of another old Bullfinch Building built in 1804 \n     at the corner of Beacon and Park Streets. It was also in \n     Boston close by, where my fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, \n     inducted a\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\n     young Boston University Divinity School student named Martin \n     Luther King.\n       In order to be on time for this ceremony, Anne and I came \n     to Boston last Friday morning, which enabled me to lunch at \n     the famous Doyle's Pub in Jamaica Plains with some of the \n     retired newspapermen of yesteryears. Having been married 21 \n     years, and still being young lovers and on Saturday Anne and \n     I strolled hand-in-had Saturday through the historic Boston \n     Commons, founded in 1634, and the beautiful Boston Gardens \n     with its spectacular beds of flowers. We walked over the \n     footbridge and looked down at the ducks and the swan boats. \n     We later ate streamed mussels and broiled bluefish at Legal \n     Seafoods just behind the Four Seasons Hotel. We continued our \n     walk up Newbury and Boylston Streets, miraculously without \n     incurring major debt, and at noon, sat in silence, prayed and \n     listened to the beautiful rehearsal music of the choir of \n     Trinity Church in old Copley Square where I worshipped years \n     ago, heard the wonderful sermons of the rector, Dr. Theodore \n     Ferris, and where my daughters were confirmed. I shall always \n     remember election night 1966 when I received my first \n     congratulatory telegram. It simply read: ``Hallelujah'' and \n     was signed Ted Ferris.\n       It has been said that this may well be the first state \n     courthouse named for an African-American and perhaps the only \n     one in Massachusetts named for a living person. If true, both \n     are sad commentaries. It would be shameful with all of the \n     qualified and talented African-American men and women in this \n     country, that it has taken 137 years since the Emancipation \n     Proclamation to give such recognition. And as for the \n     recognition of the living versus the dead, I, of course, vote \n     for the living.\n       In fact, in the present case, the new name of this building \n     was approved by the Massachusetts legislature on a budget \n     bill to which it had been attached by Senate President \n     Birmingham and Senate Minority Leader Lees, and signed into \n     law by Governor Cellucci on November 22, 1999. The Governor \n     is his wisdom, wanting to have an outdoor ceremony and being \n     assured of perfect weather, set the date for this dedication \n     ceremony for June 20th, 2000. Of course, politicians always \n     claim credit for things with which they had nothing \n     whatsoever to do. So with due respect, Governor Cellucci, I \n     give credit for the beautiful weather to Richard Winkleman, a \n     dear friend who goes to church every day of his life, and who \n     has been praying continually for good weather for today. \n     During the interim between the passage and the signing of the \n     budget bill, when told that this might be the first for a \n     living person, my response was, ``Well, you'd better hurry up \n     or your record may stay in tact.''\n       Today is not one to dwell on criticism of the past no \n     matter how valid that criticism may be. It is a day of joy, a \n     day of celebration and a day of acknowledgement and \n     appreciation for what has been accomplished. It is also a day \n     for a commitment to accelerate our efforts for greater \n     progress in the present and in the future. Massachusetts \n     Governors Michael Dukakis, William Weld and Paul Cellucci are \n     to be commended for having appointed many highly-qualified \n     women, African-Americans, Jews and representatives of other \n     minorities to the judiciary and elsewhere in their \n     administrations. I trust that successor governors will \n     continue that record including the appointment of Hispanics, \n     Asians and Native Americans. Like justice, appointments and \n     recognition should be racial and gender-blind, and I \n     respectfully urge other states across the country to follow \n     the example set by this Governor, this legislative body, and \n     the citizens of Massachusetts.\n       As we look to the future and the generations to come who \n     will avail themselves of equal justice under law in this \n     gleaming symbol of civil society, let us all pledge to work \n     for a nation in which barriers of race, religion and ethnic \n     origin do not stand in the way of achievement or recognition, \n     a nation that continues to strike down the barriers that make \n     us weak and lives up to the noble principle that make us \n     strong. In the strength of unity and purpose may we recall \n     the words of that old hymn:\n       ``God of justice save the people from the wars of race and \n     creed, from the strife of class and friction make our nation \n     free indeed.\n       ``Keep her faith in simple manhood, stronger than when she \n     began, till she finds her full fruition in the brotherhood of \n     man.''\n       For this high honor, thanks be to Almighty God and the \n     people of Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7472-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act and urge that it be \nbrought to the Senate floor for a vote.\n  Sadly, breast and cervical cancer will afflict nearly 200,000 women \nthis year, and take the lives of more than 45,000. Women in every State \nand every community in the country are today facing the daunting \nchallenge of overcoming these diseases. They are not strangers; they \nare our sisters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers. They are people we \nlove and care about.\n  The statistics are disturbing. The family stories are sobering. But \nlet us find hope in the strides that we have made so far. In 1991, \nCongress created the Early Detection Program at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, which provided low-income, uninsured women with \nbreast and cervical cancer screening services. It was a positive first \nstep toward ensuring that every woman, regardless of her annual income \nand insurance situation, could request a screening for breast and \ncervical cancer. I wholeheartedly support the program, and I know many \nof my colleagues do as well.\n  However, just as critical as guaranteeing universal access to cancer \nscreening is the need to provide treatment options following a \ndiagnosis of cancer. While the CDC Early Detection Program supplies \nparticipating women with an evaluation, it offers nothing in the way of \ntreatment should that evaluation reveal cancer. The very same women who \nare not expected to pay for a screening are somehow expected to finance \ntheir own treatment program. It simply does not make sense.\n  We must, therefore, draw a line from A to B, from screening to \ntreatment. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, a bill I am \npleased to co-sponsor, does just that. It gives States the option of \noffering Medicaid coverage to women that participated in the CDC Early \nDetection Program and were diagnosed as having breast or cervical \ncancer. In so doing, it provides a much-needed complement to the Early \nDetection Program.\n  We have broad bipartisan support in the Senate to pass this bill. \nNearly 80 Senators have cosponsored it. The program was included in the \nPresident's fiscal year 2001 budget. But we need a vote.\n  As time in this Congressional term wanes, we are increasingly forced \nto make difficult choices about which bills to address. But I believe \nthis bill must be a top priority. It is unacceptable that women who are \ndiagnosed with cancer often go without life-saving treatment simply \nbecause they cannot afford it. Congress has the responsibility to act \nquickly on this issue.\n  In the spirit of the CDC Early Detection program, which is \napproaching its 10th anniversary, I urge the leadership to bring S. 662 \nto the floor as soon as possible, and advance America's fight against \nbreast and cervical cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7472-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Houston \nMinority Business Council and the other groups and individuals who are \nnow preparing for ``EXPO 2000, a Business Opportunity Marketplace,'' to \nbe held on August 31, 2000, in the George R. Brown Convention Center in \nHouston, Texas. This annual event is Texas' largest minority business \ntrade fair and offers a meeting ground for corporations seeking to \nidentify experienced minority entrepreneurs.\n  Over the last decade, the number of minority owned businesses grew in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nU.S. by an impressive 168 percent. These businesses generate half a \ntrillion dollars in revenue and employ nearly four million workers. \nThis success has been in large measure due to the efforts of groups \nlike the Houston Minority Business Council and the dedicated \nindividuals throughout Texas and this nation who seek to expand \neconomic opportunities for all Americans.\n  The EXPO has been an outstanding example of such efforts, and has \nopened the doors of the marketplace by successfully pairing minority \nbusiness owners with representatives from more than 220 local and \nnational companies. The event provides these minority entrepreneurs \nwith direct marketing opportunities with corporations, government \nagencies and educational and financial institutions that need capable \ncontractors to support their missions. The EXPO has produced real \nresults, with two thirds of participants reporting having obtained \ncontracts for as much as two million dollars within a year of the \nevent.\n  I have worked hard in the U.S. Senate to build upon efforts like this \nto expand Federal contracting opportunities to small and disadvantaged \nbusiness entrepreneurs. I have helped lead the efforts to defend \nprograms such as the 8 (a) Federal business development program, worked \nto curb the ``bundling'' of Federal contracts that hurt small \nbusinesses, and I have served as a champion of Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, which assist small businesses in getting the \ncapital and assistance needed to get started and expand.\n  I again commend the organizers, supporters, and participants of EXPO \n2000. These fine men and women represent the best of Texas' \nentrepreneurial, hard-working and neighborly spirit. I wish them all \nmuch future success, and I look forward to continuing to work with them \nto ensure that all Americans share in the fruits of our economic \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7473-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO BERNIE WHITEBEAR\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great admiration that I \nrise to pay tribute to Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, \nwho passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000.\n  A long-standing advocate and leader in the fight for tribal self-\ndetermination, Bernie Whitebear was an outstanding role-model for \ntribal and non-tribal people alike. Known for his vision, humor and \ncommitment, he lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone who knew \nhim.\n  Bernie Whitebear was born on September 27, 1937 on the Colville \nIndian Reservation in Eastern Washington. Born into a large family, \nBernie grew up confronting many of the barriers facing reservation \nchildren, including poverty and discrimination.\n  As an adult, he moved to Seattle, attended the University of \nWashington and worked as an engineer for Boeing. He later joined the \nArmy as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and served as a \nGreen Beret.\n  During the activism of the late 1960's, Bernie Whitebear emerged as \none of the central tribal leaders in the Pacific Northwest and was a \ntireless advocate for American Indian recognition and empowerment. We \noften remember his social action, seen through his leadership in the \n``invasion'' of Fort Lawton in Seattle in 1970. Bernie and others \noccupied the Fort Lawton property after plans were announced to list \nthe Fort as surplus property for the city to designate as a park. He \nfelt local tribes had a historic right to the land, which could be \nbetter used as a central service base for Seattle's largely unserved \nurban Indian population.\n  The 3-month occupation, civil arrests and resulting media attention \nprompted Congress to order the city of Seattle to negotiate a \nsettlement, which included a 99-year lease on a 20-acre parcel for \nWhitebear's group. The settlement provided space for construction of \nthe Daybreak Star Art Center, which currently stands in Discovery Park.\n  I want to share with the Senate one of my favorite memories of Bernie \nWhitebear. Bernie had invited me to attend the Mini-Pow Wow in my state \non February 7, 1998. He asked me to stop by to talk about the People's \nLodge, to see the artwork, and to have a quick look at some of the \ntraditional dances. I told Bernie I would stop by, but that I only had \na short while because I had a lot of events I needed to attend that \nday.\n  I remember when I arrived at the University of Washington Bernie \nwelcomed me with his big bright smile and an outstretched hand. We \nwatched some of the traditional dances, and then I realized that if I \ndidn't leave soon I would be late for my next event. It was one of \nthose days when I was trying to meet as many people as possible. Well \nBernie didn't let me just meet the people at the Mini-Pow Wow, he made \nme stay and understand them. He started by introducing me to everyone \nin the room.\n  Then Bernie leaned over to me and explained that it was customary for \na visiting United States Senator to move to the front of the dancing \ngroup. You know, it was one of the many Native American traditions \nBernie told me about that always sounded a little invented to me. Like \nanother old tradition he told me about: That anytime a U.S. Senator \nstepped foot in Discovery Park he or she had to pay a visit to the \nDaybreak Star Center. Well there was Bernie asking me to move to the \nfront, and who could say no to Bernie?\n  He had his arm around me. He was leading me to the front. Everyone \nwas watching, and I went along. The next thing I knew, I was leading \nabout 300 people in a tribal dance. Even though I was not born to be a \ndancer and I certainly didn't know that particular dance, Bernie made \nit easy. He had such an open, loving, and compassionate nature that you \njust couldn't help but feel a part of it. As I looked around, people \nwere smiling, and there was a real sense of comradery and respect \nshared by everyone in the room. About two hours later, as the event was \nwinding down, I said goodbye to Bernie, and I got into my car.\n  As I drove away, I realized what Bernie had really done for me that \nday. He helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside, \nnot as someone sitting on the sidelines watching, but as someone in the \nmiddle of the festivities. I felt the sense of community and respect \nthat Bernie was always so proud of. Anyone can talk about those \nqualities and traditions, but Bernie let me experience them, and he did \nit with a big grin on his face. I know I'm better off for that \nexperience.\n  That day shows just how effective Bernie was at getting us to shed \nour expectations, to realize what we have in common, and to work \ntogether.\n  Throughout his life, Bernie used his own unique style and generous \nheart to accomplish many things. He founded the United Indians of All \nTribes Foundation, which provides education and counseling resources \nfor the estimated 25,000 American Indians in the Puget Sound area. \nAlong with the Daybreak Center and the United Indians Foundation, he \nworked to sensitize Seattle police to urban Indian issues. Recognizing \nthe persistent need for American Indian health services, he also helped \ncreate the Seattle Indian Health Board and later served as its first \nexecutive director.\n  For his many contributions, Bernie Whitebear was awarded numerous \nhonors. In 1997, Governor Gary Locke named him a ``Citizen of the \nDecade.'' He recently received Seattle's Distinguished Citizen Medal. \nIn 1998, the University of Washington gave him the Distinguished \nAlumnus of the Year Award. Bernie was a remarkable man with spirit and \na warmth that touched everyone he encountered. My thoughts and \nsympathies are with all of Bernie's family and friends.\n  Bernie Whitebear acted as a beacon for compassion, cultural \nunderstanding and tribal sovereignty in the Puget Sound Region. His \nlegacy is left in all of us who have tremendous respect for the history \nand cultures of the tribes, a history Bernie would draw us into, by his \npassion, by his words and by his deeds. I will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7473-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7473-S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO CARDINAL HILL REHABILITATION HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Two \nof the more publicized patients would include Missy Jenkins, survivor \nof the Paducah Heath High School Shooting and Palmer Harston, of \nLexington, 2000 National Easter Seals Child Representative, that have \nbeen given care and treatment by Cardinal Hill Hospital. Cardinal Hill \nhas provided for patients who have dealt with all kinds of tragedies, \nwhether small or large.\n  Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital continues to display an \nunswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possesses the \nrespect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work \naccomplished at this hospital promises a successful future for the \ncitizens of this state as they can be ensured that disabilities will be \ncontinued to be treated at Cardinal Hill.\n  I am certain that the legacy of dedication that Cardinal Hill \nRehabilitation Hospital has left will carry on. Congratulations to the \ndirectors and staff of Cardinal Hill on 50 years of service to \nKentucky.

Mr. President, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a \npound of cure.'' When our parents and grandparents told us that, they \nprobably weren't talking about the problem of crime in America. But \nthey might have been.\n  So many times in our debates, in the testimony given by experts from \nlaw-enforcement professionals to psychologists and social workers, the \nvalue of prevention--of keeping kids away from crime before they ever \nget into it--is clear and indisputable. And it is just as clear that \none of the best ways to keep kids out of trouble is, simply, to give \nthem something else to do.\n  Terrance Collier, a 13-year-old from Washington, DC, had something \nelse to do this summer. In fact, he had a lot to do. Through a program \ncalled City Kids Wilderness Project, Terrance went to Wyoming, where he \ncamped, cooked, helped with cleaning up, paddled a canoe, went rafting, \nmade new friends and, in the process, learned about nature, himself, \nteamwork and responsibility.\n  Randy Luskey started City Kids Wilderness Project and continues to \nfund the program himself. A few years ago, Randy donated his Wyoming \nranch to the kids. But, Randy is not just a blind donor. Randy leaves \nhis own family in Colorado every year to actively participate with the \nkids in Jackson Hole.\n  Cathy Robillard takes time away from her home and family in Vermont \nevery summer to work with the kids in Wyoming. She is the person that \nruns the nuts and bolts of the program and does so with a measure of \ncare and discipline.\n  City Kids Wilderness Project is one of the best possible examples of \ntime and money well spent. And it is an example that should be \nfollowed.\n  A lot of the participants get into City Kids Wilderness Project \nthrough Boys and Girls Clubs, the kind of partnership that gets the \nbest out of both programs, the kind of partnership that has proven \nsuccessful time and time again.\n  In debating funding for crime-prevention programs and public-private \npartnerships, we hear testimony from the experts and professionals, as \nwe should, but we will never have a witness more important than 13-\nyear-old Terrance Collier. Terrance found his time in Wyoming to be \nrewarding, it made a difference to him, he thought it was important and \nit kept him off the street.\n  Let's listen to that testimony, and let's thank the people like Randy \nLuskey and Cathy Robillard who are offering ``an ounce of prevention'' \nto kids like Terrance, brightening the promise of the future for all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7474-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO PAUL M. MONTRONE--NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESS IN THE ARTS \n                        LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Paul Montrone upon his recognition as the 2000 New Hampshire \n``Business in the Arts-Leadership'' award winner.\n  In order for arts programs to run smoothly and efficiently, there \nmust be a strong leader behind the operation. Paul has been \ninstrumental in the development of the arts in New Hampshire for many \nyears. He has been a leading figure in enhancing corporate and \nindividual financial support both regionally and nationally, and has a \ndemonstrated interest in improving the operation and effectiveness of \narts organizations.\n  Paul's strong leadership has proven to be an effective model for \nothers to follow. He gives generously of his time by serving on the \nboards of many non-profit organizations such as the Wang Center in \nBoston and the New England Conservatory, and also serves as the \npresident and CEO of the Metropolitan Opera. He personally assists the \nMayer Arts Center at Phillips Exeter Academy which attracts visiting \nartists to display their work on campus and establish residencies and \nworkshops in the surrounding community. He also supports the \nscholarship program at Phillips Exeter Academy, designed to help \nsupport gifted students pursue their dreams in the arts. His early and \nconsistent support of the Music Hall in Portsmouth is yet another \ntestament of his vision and long-term commitment to the community.\n  Without the support of generous financial donations, arts programs \nwould suffer tremendously. Paul has long patronized arts organizations \nand has convinced major corporations to do the same through \n``challenge'' grants. These grants are made at significant points of \nthe fund drive, thereby motivating other potential donors to donate. \nHis keen business skills are evident in the large amounts of financial \nsupport he earns for particular programs.\n  It is citizens like Paul who exemplify the importance of civic \nresponsibility. His work in making the arts more accessible to the \ncommunity is commendable. Without the support of such dedicated people \nlike Paul, the arts would not be able to thrive in New Hampshire. It is \nan honor to serve him in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7474-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7474-S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF BEDFORD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Bedford on its 250th anniversary, an important \nand historic milestone in New Hampshire's history.\n  The town was incorporated on May 21, 1750. Once an unsettled \nwilderness located in the heart of New Hampshire, Bedford has grown \ninto a booming residential and commercial community. Its close \nproximity to the center of Southern New Hampshire makes it very \nconvenient for residents to commute to bigger cities like Manchester \nand Nashua. Bedford is a thriving small town with a strong commitment \nto family and community values, evidenced by a first-rate school system \nand active participation by many residents in civic groups such as the \nRotary Club and the Lions Club.\n  The town has come together to celebrate its anniversary with year-\nlong events, such as town picnics, exhibits and a parade marking the \ntown's official birthday. A 250th anniversary ball is planned as the \ncumulation of the year's events. These celebrations strengthen town \norganizations' staying-power and provide an opportunity for residents \nto congregate and enjoy all the town has to offer. The overwhelming \nnumber of Bedford residents who attended these events is a testament to \ntheir commitment to town and civic affairs.\n  Slowly but surely, this quiet former farming town has seen tremendous \ncommercial growth within the last 50 years. Bedford is now home to many \nsmall businesses and office parks, but has certainly not lost that \nsmall-town charm. With 16,500 citizens, it is easy\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\nto meet familiar faces in passing. Although the town may be steadily \nexpanding its collection of businesses, the residents have not let them \noverwhelm their beautiful scenic community.\n  Once again, I want to congratulate the town of Bedford on its 250th \nanniversary. Stable and secure communities such as Bedford are \nessentially the backbone of this great nation. It is an honor to serve \nits citizens in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7475-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO TOM SCHWIEGER UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the outstanding leadership of Tom Schwieger, President and CEO of \nthe Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. Tom's seventeen years of \nservice have been marked by integrity, vision and dedication, earning \nhim the respect and admiration of the people of New Hampshire.\n  During his tenure at the Manchester Chamber, Tom has initiated and \noverseen some of the most important revitalization projects of the last \nfifty years. He was the driving force behind the development of the \nManchester Airport and the newly approved Civic Center. In 1998, as a \ntestament to the success of Tom's efforts, Manchester was named the \nbest small city in America in which to live.\n  When I speak with Tom, I am always left with the impression that he \ntruly loves what he does. His energy and enthusiasm is contagious and \nTom has assembled a very prestigious Board of Directors. As BJ Eckhardt \nof Business New Hampshire Magazine remarked, ``people are honored to \nserve on the board; no one says `no' to Tom.''\n  In addition to his many professional achievements, Tom has served as \na mentor and an inspiration to many members of the Chamber staff. Many \ncurrent New Hampshire community leaders credit Tom with giving them \ntheir start and helping to shape their careers.\n  Walter Lippman once said, ``The final test of a leader is that he \nleaves behind him in other men, the conviction and the will to carry \non.'' In his seventeen years at the Chamber, Tom has given the \norganization direction, drive, and a sense of mission. He has served \nwith spirit and devotion, and his legacy will serve as an example to \nhis successors for years to come.\n  Tom, it has been an honor and a pleasure to serve you in the United \nStates Senate. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. \nMay you always continue to inspire those around you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7475-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO SITESURFER PUBLISHING--NEW HAMPSHIRE ``BUSINESS IN THE \n                          ARTS'' AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Sitesurfer Publishing upon its recognition as a 2000 New \nHampshire ``Business in the Arts'' award winner in the microenterprise \ncategory.\n  Sitesurfer Publishing has proven that a little bit of time and energy \nis all it takes to make a significant impact in the arts. This company \nhas allowed such organizations as the Capitol Center for the Arts in \nConcord to become more competitive in today's high-tech world of on-\nline business. Sitesurfer created a website for the Capitol Center \nwhich resulted in thousands of dollars worth of contributions and \ntickets sold. This type of competitive edge has attracted worldwide \nvisitors and increased the appeal of corporate sponsorship packages, \nproving to be the sort of revenue needed to continue the Capitol \nCenter's many programs.\n  Sitesurfer has gone a step further in assuring the future of the \nCapitol Center's newest technology by providing the necessary hands-on \ntraining for the Center's staff to maintain and update the website, \nwhile still making itself available for support and hands-on work when \nit is needed. Sitesurfer understands the importance of making the arts \naccessible to others by providing memberships and complimentary tickets \nto their employees and clients.\n  Without the support of dedicated businesses, the arts would not be \nable to flourish in the state. Despite its small size, Sitesurfer \nPublishing has demonstrated that even small businesses can take an \nactive role in the community not only by donating money, but by \ninvesting time and hard work into civic causes. Sitesurfer truly \nsignifies the deep personal commitment of small businesses across the \nstate to supporting the causes that make New Hampshire the place to \ncall home. It is an honor to represent them in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7475-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO LOU SISSON--WAKEFIELD CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Lou Sisson upon her recognition as the Wakefield Citizen of \nthe Year by the Greater Wakefield Chamber of Commerce.\n  Lou's tireless efforts to better her community are truly \ninspirational in a time where civic duties are declining. Aside from \nher duties as owner of the Wakefield Inn, Lou has been an active member \nof the Lions Club, the Women's Club, the Heritage Commission and a \nfounding member of the Wakefield Arts Club. Her long list of \ninvolvements are a testament to her strong dedication to the community \nand her commitment to making various events and programs available to \nall Wakefield citizens.\n  Lou's hard work on the Sidewalk Committee led to the construction of \nnumerous sidewalks throughout downtown Wakefield, making the streets \nsafer for pedestrians. She is also involved in a summer youth program \nwhich recently created a two-mile heritage trail that outlines \ninformation about the town's historic sites, providing educational and \nrecreational opportunities for all town residents. Lou truly enjoys \nvolunteering and cites the friendly, personable town atmosphere as the \ntrue motivation for her efforts.\n  It is citizens like Lou who make our communities stronger and \nexemplify what is good about America today. Lou's dedication to making \nher community a better place to live is commendable.

A bill to authorize funding for successful reentry of \ncriminal offenders into local communities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         THE OFFENDER REENTRY AND COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Offender \nReentry and Community Safety Act of 2000. I am introducing this \nlegislation because all too often we have short-term solutions for \nlong-term problems. All too often we think about today, but not \ntomorrow. It's time that we start looking forward. It's time that we \nface the dire situation of prisoners re-entering our communities with \ninsufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, inadequate drug \ntreatment, insufficient housing and deficient basic life skills.\n  According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are \nnow living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in \nlocal jails. A record number of those inmates--approximately 585,400 \nwill return to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of \nreturning prisoners have been rearrested for new crimes within three \nyears.\n  The safety threat posed by this volume of prisoner returns has been \nexacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly \nproperly supervise all their returning offenders, parole systems have \nbeen abolished in thirteen states and policy shifts toward more \ndeterminate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority to impose \nsupervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities.\n  State systems have also reduced the numbers of transitional support \nprograms aimed at facilitating the return to productive community life \nstyles. Recent studies indicate that many returning prisoners receive \nno help in finding employment upon release and most offenders have low \nliteracy and other basic educational skills that can impede successful \nreentry.\n  At least 55 percent of offenders are fathers of minor children, and \ntherefore face a number of issues related to child support and other \nfamily responsibilities during incarceration and after release. \nSubstance abuse and mental health problems also add to concerns over \ncommunity safety. Approximately 70 percent of state prisoners and 57 \npercent of federal prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse. \nResearch by Justice indicates that between 60 and 75 percent of inmates \nwith heroin or cocaine problems return to drugs within three months \nwhen untreated. An estimated 187,000 state and federal prison inmates \nhave self-reported mental health problems. Mentally ill inmates are \nmore likely than other offenders to have committed a violent offense \nand be violent recidivists. Few states connect mental health treatment \nin prisons with treatment in the return community. Finally, offenders \nwith contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are released \nwith no viable plan to continue their medical treatment so they present \na significant danger to public health. And while the federal prison \npopulation and reentry system differs from the state prison population \nand reentry systems, there are nonetheless significant reentry \nchallenges at the federal level.\n  We need to start thinking about what to do with these people. We need \nto start thinking in terms of helping these people make a transition to \nthe community so that they don't go back to a life of crime and can be \nproductive members of our society. We need to start thinking about the \nlong-term impact of what we do after we send people to jail\n  My legislation creates demonstration reentry programs for federal, \nstate and local prisoners. The programs are designed to assist high-\nrisk, high-need offenders who have served their prison\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nsentences, but who pose the greatest risk of reoffending upon release \nbecause they lack the education, job skills, stable family or living \narrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and \nmedical health services they need to successfully reintegrate into \nsociety.\n  Innovative strategies and emerging technologies present new \nopportunities to improve reentry systems. This legislation creates \nfederal and state demonstration projects that utilize these strategies \nand technologies. The projects share many core components, including a \nmore seamless reentry system, reentry officials who are more directly \ninvolved with the offender and who can swiftly impose intermediate \nsanctions if the offender does not follow the designated reentry plan, \nand the combination of enhanced service delivery and enhanced \nmonitoring. The different projects are targeted at different prisoner \npopulations and each has some unique features. The promise of the \nlegislation is to establish the demonstration projects and then to \nrigorously evaluate them to determine which measures and strategies \nmost successfully reintegrate prisoners into the community as well as \nwhich measures and strategies can be promoted nationally to address the \ngrowing national problem of released prisoners.\n  There are currently 17 unfunded state pilot projects, including one \nin Delaware, which are being supported with technical assistance by the \nDepartment of Justice. My legislation will fund these pilot projects \nand will encourage states, territories, and Indian tribes to partner \nwith units of local government and other non-profit organizations to \nestablish adult offender reentry demonstration projects. The grants may \nbe expended for implementing graduated sanctions and incentives, \nmonitoring released prisoners, and providing, as appropriate, drug and \nalcohol abuse testing and treatment, mental and medical health \nservices, victim impact educational classes, employment training, \nconflict resolution skills training, and other social services. My \nlegislation also encourages state agencies, municipalities, public \nagencies, nonprofit organizations and tribes to make agreements with \ncourts to establish ``reentry courts'' to monitor returning offenders, \nestablish graduated sanctions and incentives, test and treat returning \noffenders for drug and alcohol abuse, and provide reentering offenders \nwith mental and medical health services, victim impact educational \nclasses, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and \nother social services.\n\n  This legislation also re-authorizes the drug court program created by \nCongress in the 1994 Crime Law as a cost-effective, innovative way to \ndeal with non-violent offenders in need of drug treatment. This is the \nsame language as the Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act \nthat I introduced with Senator Specter last year.\n  Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the \ncriminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts \ntogether so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court \nprograms they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in \nsociety. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school \nor obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial \nobligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They \nare also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track.\n  This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia \nUniversity's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) \nfound that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little \nprevious treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they \nprovide closer supervision than other community programs to which the \noffenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are \ncost-effective.\n  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least \n$5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing \nof the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as \nimportant, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals.\n  I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-\nthirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After \ngetting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many \nof these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 \ndrug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a \nsizable victory for society and the budget alike.\n  This bill reauthorizes programs to provide for drug treatment in \nstate and federal prisons. According to CASA, 80 percent of the men and \nwomen behind bars in the United States today are there because of \nalcohol or drugs. They were either drunk or high when they committed \ntheir crime, broke an alcohol or drug law, stole to support their \nhabit, or have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The need for drug \nand alcohol treatment in our nations prisons and jails is clear.\n  Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft.'' It is a \nsmart crime prevention policy. If we do not treat addicted offenders \nbefore they are released, they will be turned back onto our streets \nwith the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first \nplace and they will reoffend. Inmates who are addicted to drugs and \nalcohol are more likely to be incarcerated repeatedly than those \nwithout a substance abuse problem. This is not my opinion, it is fact. \nAccording to CASA, 81 percent of inmates with five or more prior \nconvictions have been habitual drug users compared to 41 percent of \nfirst-time offenders. Reauthorizing prison-based treatment programs is \na good investment and is an important crime prevention initiative.\n  This legislation is a first step. Someday, we will look back and \nwonder why we didn't think of this sooner. For now, we need to \nimplement these pilot projects, help people make it in their \ncommunities and make our streets safer. I am certain that we will revel \nin the results.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Offender Reentry and \n     Community Safety Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are now nearly 1,900,000 individuals in our \n     country's prisons and jails, including over 140,000 \n     individuals under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons.\n       (2) Enforcement of offender violations of conditions of \n     releases has sharply increased the number of offenders who \n     return to prison--while revocations comprised 17 percent of \n     State prison admissions in 1980, they rose to 36 percent in \n     1998.\n       (3) Although prisoners generally are serving longer \n     sentences than they did a decade ago, most eventually reenter \n     communities; for example, in 1999, approximately 538,000 \n     State prisoners and over 50,000 Federal prisoners a record \n     number were returned to American communities. Approximately \n     100,000 State offenders return to communities and received no \n     supervision whatsoever.\n       (4) Historically, two-thirds of returning State prisoners \n     have been rearrested for new crimes within three years, so \n     these individuals pose a significant public safety risk and a \n     continuing financial burden to society.\n       (5) A key element to effective post-incarceration \n     supervision is an immediate, predetermined, and appropriate \n     response to violations of the conditions of supervision.\n       (6) An estimated 187,000 State and Federal prison inmates \n     have been diagnosed with mental health problems; about 70 \n     percent of State prisoners and 57 percent of Federal \n     prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse; and nearly 75 \n     percent of released offenders with heroin or cocaine problems \n     return to using drugs within three months if untreated; \n     however, few States link prison mental health treatment \n     programs with those in the return community.\n       (7) Between 1987 and 1997, the volume of juvenile \n     adjudicated cases resulting in court-ordered residential \n     placements rose 56 percent. In 1997 alone, there were a total \n     of 163,200 juvenile court-ordered residential placements. The \n     steady increase of youth exiting residential placement has \n     strained the juvenile justice aftercare system, however, \n     without adequate supervision and services, youth are likely \n     to relapse, recidivate, and return to confinement at the \n     public's expense.\n       (8) Emerging technologies and multidisciplinary community-\n     based strategies present new opportunities to alleviate the \n     public safety risk posed by released prisoners while helping \n     offenders to reenter their communities successfully.\n\n      SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) establish demonstration projects in several Federal \n     judicial districts, the District of\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\n     Columbia, and in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, using new \n     strategies and emerging technologies that alleviate the \n     public safety risk posed by released prisoners by promoting \n     their successful reintegration into the community;\n       (2) establish court-based programs to monitor the return of \n     offenders into communities, using court sanctions to promote \n     positive behavior;\n       (3) establish offender reentry demonstration projects in \n     the states using government and community partnerships to \n     coordinate cost efficient strategies that ensure public \n     safety and enhance the successful reentry into communities of \n     offenders who have completed their prison sentences;\n       (4) establish intensive aftercare demonstration projects \n     that address public safety and ensure the special reentry \n     needs of juvenile offenders by coordinating the resources of \n     juvenile correctional agencies, juvenile courts, juvenile \n     parole agencies, law enforcement agencies, social service \n     providers, and local Workforce Investment Boards; and\n       (5) rigorously evaluate these reentry programs to determine \n     their effectiveness in reducing recidivism and promoting \n     successful offender reintegration.\n\n            TITLE I--FEDERAL REENTRY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Madam President, I came to the floor to tell my \ncolleagues my disappointment that we are not able to move forward with \nthe Treasury and general government bill. It is certainly not a perfect \nbill, but it is a darn good bill. As chairman of the subcommittee, I \ncan say that we worked very hard on that. I remind my friends that we \nonly have about 28 working days left--not much to complete the whole \nappropriations process, which we are required to do by law. That gets \nus in trouble.\n  Two years ago, we didn't have the opportunity to complete the \nTreasury bill, and it ended up in what is commonly referred to as the \nomnibus bill. People in the Senate understand what\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nthat is, but to the millions of Americans who watch these proceedings, \nthe omnibus bill is, in one word, a mess. It is that bill where we \nstick everything in at the end that we didn't have time to finish. We \nend up with a bill a foot thick and weighs 30 pounds, with 3,000 to \n5,000 pages. Nobody in this body can read it all because we don't have \nthe time before we have to vote on it. That is how we get in trouble. \nWe vote to pass it through as a last-minute emergency. When we go home, \npeople say: Why did you vote to give money to that frivolous thing on \npage 2,403? And we don't even know why we voted for it, which is why it \nis so important to get the bills through one by one.\n  Let me mention a little bit about the Treasury and general government \nbill as it is going to come to the floor, if we can get an agreement. I \ndon't think there is anybody in this body who doesn't know that we have \na sieve, not a border, between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and \nMexico. Our customs people are severely understaffed and underfunded. \nIf you want to stop drugs at the border, the money to do that is in \nthis bill. We need to do that. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nAreas we started about 8 years ago expanded to about 44 States and many \ncities. That is the agency that coordinates reduction of drug use and \ntrafficking among our local law enforcement, State law enforcement, and \nFederal law enforcement.\n  If you want to reduce drug trafficking, the money is in this bill. We \nalso have upkeep and maintenance for Federal buildings. A number of \nthem nationwide are in disrepair, as everybody knows. We have to put \nmoney into making sure the buildings are sound, safe, and fireproof. We \nare not doing that very well. The money to do that is in this bill, \ntoo. If you want to reduce drug violence, the money to do that is in \nthis bill. We know this is a very important year for the Secret \nService. They are being asked to do more in an election year, with \nlimited resources. The money to do that is also in this bill.\n  In fact, as all of us know, there are many, many requests by \nindividual Senators in all of these bills. I was going through the list \non our bill. We have 13 pages of requests by individual Senators for \nmoney in this bill. It is rather surprising to me that some of the \nSenators who are opposing bringing this bill to the floor are the ones \nwho asked for money to be put in the bill in the first place. It is \nsimilar to when we consider the so-called pay raise and people demagog \nit, the thing passes, and they quietly pocket the money and leave. We \nhave the same situation with this bill. A lot of people have very \nimportant programs in this bill. Again, there are 13 pages of things \nSenators want in this bill.\n  Also, Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about \na program which I believe deserves the support of the Senate--the Gang \nResistance Education and Training or GREAT Program. GREAT is \nadministered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in \npartnership with State and local law enforcement.\n  Unfortunately, gang activity has increased in our country in recent \nyears. ATF has developed a program to give our children the tools they \nneed to be able to resist the temptation to belong to a gang.\n  The GREAT program is eight years old, and has grown from a pilot \nprogram in Arizona to classrooms all over the United States--and in \nPuerto Rico, Canada, and overseas military bases. ATF estimates that \nabout 2 million students have received GREAT training.\n  GREAT was designed to provide gang prevention and antiviolence \ninstruction to children in a classroom setting. ATF trains local law \nenforcement officers to teach these classes, and provides grants to \ntheir offices to help pay for their time.\n  This program is having a positive effect on student activities and \nbehaviors, and is deterring them from involvement in gangs. A side \nbenefit is that the graduates seem to be doing a better job of \ncommunicating with their parents and teachers, and getting better \ngrades.\n  For the third year in a row, the Administration is requesting only 10 \nmillion dollars for grants for the GREAT program. For the last two \nyears, Congress felt that wasn't enough to fund the many requests for \nhelp from State and local law enforcement and provided 13 million \ndollars for GREAT grants. 10 million dollars still isn't enough. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the effort of the Committee to again provide \n13 million dollars for grants to State and local law enforcement for \nthis worthwhile and effective program.\n  I hope my colleagues will reach some consensus and allow us to move \nforward. It is an extremely important bill, and I certainly urge our \nleadership to try to get this to the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7485-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING SLAIN CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS JACOB J. \n                      CHESTNUT AND JOHN M.

Madam President, we have recently witnessed another \nexample of the indifference of Members of Congress to the needs of \nhard-working, low-wage American workers. While our minimum wage bill \nstill languishes, Members of Congress are raising their own pay yet \nagain. Congress has cut the taxes of the wealthiest Americans, but the \nRepublican leadership still insists on doing nothing for those at the \nbottom of the economic ladder. It is an outrage that Congress would \nraise its own pay but not the minimum wage.\n  Over the past decade, in spite of the recent prosperity, the average \ninflation-adjusted income of the poorest fifth of Americans rose by \nonly 1 percent, while the average inflation adjusted-income of the \nrichest 5 percent rose by 27 percent.\n  The Republican Congress just passed an estate tax repeal that \nprovides 100 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 5 percent of \nAmericans and 91 percent\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\nof its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent. The Republican marriage \ntax penalty bill passed last week is also heavily tilted to benefit \nonly the wealthy. Members of this Republican Congress are quick to find \ntime to increase their own salaries and cut taxes for the wealthiest \nAmericans, but they cannot find the time to pass an increase in the \nminimum wage to benefit those hard-working, low-wage Americans.\n  These low-income working families deserve a raise. Their pay has been \nfrozen for 3 years, and our Democratic proposal will increase the \nminimum wage by 50 cents this year and another 50 cents next year. The \nRepublican leadership is doing all it can to prevent this fair \nincrease, but this issue will not go away, and we will continue to \noffer our minimum wage amendment to bills on the floor again and again \nat every opportunity until we pass it and send it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  In recent months, a bipartisan House voted by a solid majority to \nincrease the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years, and many of our Senate \ncolleagues have also supported an increase: 50 cents now and 50 cents a \nyear from now.\n  The American people agree that the minimum wage should be increased. \nThe time is now to give America's hard-working families the raise they \nso desperately need and deserve. It is unconscionable for the \nRepublican leadership to vote themselves a pay raise yet again, cut \ntaxes for the wealthiest Americans, and then deny workers at the bottom \nof the economic ladder a fair pay increase. Our Democratic proposal \noffers workers the minimum wage raise they need and deserve: No tricks, \nno poison pills, no tax breaks for the wealthy, and we have bipartisan \nsupport for this increase.\n  The issue is a priority. The Senate should act on a fair minimum wage \nbill, and we should act as soon as possible. It is wrong for the Senate \nto continue to block this long overdue act of simple justice for \nworking families.\n  This chart shows the real value of the minimum wage. It is from 1968 \nup to the year 2001. If we were to take the real value and use constant \ndollars, the minimum wage would be $7.66, if we were to have the same \npurchasing power as we had in 1968.\n  We have seen the minimum wage decline over these years, particularly \nin recent years. Without an increase, it will be valued at $4.90. If we \nwere to have the increase of 50 cents and 50 cents, the purchasing \npower would only be $5.85, which is still below what it was for over 12 \nyears. That is all we are asking: Let's bring it up by 50 cents this \nyear and 50 cents next year. Even though that would be $6.15, it \nrepresents $5.85 of purchasing power in constant dollars.\n  What we are seeing is that it is almost $2 lower than what the \nminimum wage was in 1968. This is against the situation, if one looks \nover this particular chart, that working families are living in \npoverty. If one looks at what has happened, again in constant dollars, \nof where the minimum wage has been going in recent years in adjusted \ninflation dollars, then one sees where the poverty line has been going \nin recent years.\n\n  We are finding out now that since 1988, minimum wage workers are \nworking, in many instances, longer, harder, more jobs, and are sinking \ndeeper and deeper into poverty.\n  This is against the background of the last 10 days where we gave over \n$1.5 trillion--a huge amount in estate taxes, the majority of which \ngoes to the highest income individuals, and $300 billion to the \nwealthiest individuals in marriage tax penalty relief. Then last week, \nthe House of Representatives voted themselves a $3,800 pay increase. \nThat represents what a minimum wage worker would make in 2 years. They \nvoted themselves that in 1 year.\n  This is where we have seen America's poorest families are getting \npoorer. The bottom fifth of the families are right at the edge where \nthey have been from 1979 to 1999, 20 years, working harder, working \nlonger, and their benefit from the economic expansion is virtually \nnonexistent. The middle fifth has gone up 5 percent, and the top fifth \nof families has gone up 30 percent.\n  These are the men and women who are the backbone of the whole \neconomic expansion. Yet they are the ones who are experiencing almost \ncrumbs in advancing their quality of life and their lifestyle.\n  Last week, we saw all this happening in the House of Representatives. \nThe House of Representatives increased their pay by $3,800 a year. As I \nmentioned, if our minimum wage amendment is passed, it works out to be \nless than $2000.\n  Even if we give the increase in the minimum wage, minimum wage \nworkers in 2 years will make half of what the pay increase will be for \nMembers of Congress.\n  That is not bad enough, but Congressman DeLay was asked by a \ncolumnist, Mark Shields:\n\n       Can you and Dick Armey and others who voted for that pay \n     raise or cost-of-living increase defend voting against an \n     increase in the minimum wage?\n\n  Mr. DeLay said:\n\n       Well, Mark, we don't work for minimum wage. . . .\n\n  How dismissive can one be? Evidently, Members of Congress, their \nchildren, and their lives are more important than workers who are \nworking hard as children's aides in the Head Start Program, or working \nin nursing homes taking care of seniors.\n  These are men and women who have a great sense of dignity and pride \nin their work, working, in many instances, two or three jobs.\n  Mr. DeLay says:\n\n       [W]e don't work for minimum wage. Members of Congress \n     represent 250 million people. . . .''\n\n  How dismissive: We are more important.\n  I defy that. These are men and women who are working, and working \nhard, and who have a sense of dignity and a sense of pride in the work \nthey do. They are teachers' aides. They are children's aides, working \nin child care programs. They work in nursing homes. They work in the \nbuildings across this country in order to make the buildings clean for \nAmerican industry.\n  This is basically a women's issue because the great majority of \nminimum wage workers are women. It is a children's issue because \nmillions of the women who are working at the minimum wage have \nchildren, and their lives are all being affected by this. It is a civil \nrights issue because great numbers of the minimum wage workers are men \nand women of color. And most profoundly, it is a fairness issue, where \nwe hear so many speeches here in the Senate saying: We honor work. We \nwant Americans who want to work.\n  Here are men and women, who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year, trying to make ends meet, trying to bring up children, trying \nto pay for rent because they don't have the income in order to purchase \na house, trying to put food on the table, and trying to spend some time \nwith their families.\n  It is an interesting fact, American workers now spend 22 hours less \nper week with their children. Why? Because they have to work at more \njobs, and to work longer at their jobs. So it is a family issue.\n  Of all the times we listen to statements about family values and \nfairness in our society, we are crying crocodile tears, evidently, \nbecause we heard last week that people who have estates over $100 \nmillion should not be taxed twice. Even if you scored $100 million, we \nare still going to provide more tax breaks. We refuse to even permit a \nvote on an increase in the minimum wage here in the Senate, while we \nare going out and increasing our own salary, and doing it in a \ncontemptuous way to these men and women. Shame on this body.\n  We are going to bring this up. We have heard a lot about: This is not \nrelevant. Is it going to be fair to bring this up? We are going to be \ntold that we do not set the agenda in the Senate.\n  I can just tell you, there are men and women who have struggled, and \nstruggled mightily, and are struggling today. They deserve the \nincrease. These arguments about inflation are out the window. Every \neconomic indicator has demonstrated that the last two increases have \nhad no impact in any way in terms of inflation. The idea that we are \ngoing to have lost jobs is absolutely preposterous. Every economic \nstudy has indicated the same. We have responded to those arguments.\n  This is a fairness issue. It is a decency issue. It is about our \nfellow citizens. It is about work. It is about families. It is about \nchildren. It is about\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nwomen. It is about fairness in civil rights. We are going to continue \nto pursue this item. We are going to pursue it this week and the 4 \nweeks when we return in September. We are going to continue to pursue \nit until we have justice for these workers.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on several occasions I have risen \nbefore this body to address the crisis associated with energy in our \nNation today. We have all experienced the high price of gasoline. We \nhave seen a slight reduction of late, but I want to assure my \ncolleagues that that situation is temporary, at best.\n  The rationale for that is understandable if one considers the fact \nthat we are currently consuming just about an amount equal to the \nproductive capacity of our industry to supply gasoline. There are many \ngood reasons for this. One is that we haven't built a new refinery in \nthis country for almost 10 years now. We have closed about 37 \nrefineries in the United States in the last decade and, as a \nconsequence of our increased dependence on imported oil, we have lost a \ngood deal of our leverage because currently about 56 percent of the oil \nwe consume in this country is imported. Most of that comes from the \nMideast. As a consequence, we have become more dependent on imported \noil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n  The fastest-growing supply of oil now coming into the United States \nis from Iraq. That is rather curious. A lot of people forget that in \n1991 we fought a war over there. We lost 147 lives. We had nearly 427 \nwounded. We had a number taken prisoner. Yet Saddam Hussein is the one \nwe are looking toward now.\n  I think the American public should be aware that it is pretty \ndifficult to define just what the energy policy of the Clinton-Gore \nadministration has been. We have seen their policy with regard to the \nnuclear industry, which provides about 20 percent of the power \ngenerated in this country, and they have said no to storing high-level \nnuclear waste. We are one vote short of a veto override on that matter. \nWe have not been able to generate that last vote. So it is clear that \nthe administration has said no to the nuclear industry, as far as \nexpanding its contribution to energy in this country.\n  As we look to hydroelectric, we have seen a policy which suggests \nthat perhaps some of the dams out West should be taken down, with no \nconsideration for the realization that there is a tradeoff associated \nwith that. If you take those dams down, you are taking the tonnage that \nis moved by barge and putting it on the highways. The implication of \nthat is significant. It is estimated that as many as 700,000 trucks per \nyear would have to go on the highways to replace the current cargo \ncapacity of barges that would be lost.\n  If we take away nuclear and go to hydro, oil is certainly something \nwe are looking toward other nations to provide, as opposed to \ndeveloping the resources here in the continental United States, in the \noverthrust belt of Colorado, Wyoming, and other areas, and where there \nis oil in my State of Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, and other \nStates. It is my understanding that the administration has withdrawn \nabout 64 percent of the public land in the overthrust belt, which is in \nthe Rocky Mountain areas, excluding them from the development of energy \nresources. The potential for coal, of course, is significant. There are \nno new coal plants being built in this country. The cost of permitting \nis such that we find they are uneconomical. The emphasis seems to be on \nnatural gas. But if we look to the last 6 months, we have seen natural \ngas prices go from about $2.16 to over $4 for delivery later this \nwinter.\n\n  The crisis associated with our energy policy, or lack of an energy \npolicy, is real in every field of energy resources. Emphasis is placed \nby the administration to some extent on renewables. While we all \nsupport renewables, it is fair to say that renewables only constitute \nabout 40 percent of our energy consumption, even though we have spent \nabout $70 billion in subsidies in this area. While they have a \npotential, surely they are not at the forefront nor are they capable at \nthis time of relieving our dependence on conventional energy sources.\n  As we look at our policies today, I think there is confusion in the \nminds of Americans as they reflect on the statements of their political \nleaders and the policies they pursue. It is very easy to be confused.\n  I would like to share some examples with my colleagues.\n  If we go back to our Vice President, Al Gore, in his book ``Earth in \nthe Balance,'' Al Gore, the environmentalist, wrote that ``higher taxes \non fossil fuel . . . is one of the logical first steps in changing our \npolicies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the \nenvironment.''\n  All of us are obviously concerned over the health of our environment. \nWe want to have a responsible approach associated with the environment. \nNevertheless, the idea that raising the price of gasoline is good for \nthe American economy and good for the American people is pretty hard to \nsell to the American public at this time when gasoline prices, \ndepending on where we are in the country, range anywhere from $1.75 to \n$1.95 or higher.\n  I think it is fair to say that perhaps the Vice President overlooks \nthe reality that Americans live long distances from their jobs because \nthey prefer to do so. We are a mobile society. As we are confronted \nwith higher energy prices, obviously it not only affects our \npocketbooks, but it affects inflation rates.\n  At about the same time that the Clinton/Gore administration was \ntalking about conservation, the Vice President was casting a tie-\nbreaking vote in the Senate to raise gasoline taxes--we all remember \nthat--and the Environmental Protection Agency determined that more \nexpensive ``reformulated gasoline'' needed to be sold in many areas of \nthe country.\n  I am not arguing the merits of that--other than to report that before \nmy committee on Energy and Natural Resources, one of the principals of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency advised us that they are now \nrequired under the Clean Air Act to have nine different types of \nreformulated gasoline in this country.\n  That meant our refiners had to batch the gasoline additives, they had \nto transport it separately, they had to store it separately. Obviously, \nall of that has a significant cost for the taxpayer. According to a \nmemorandum from the Department of Energy and the Congressional Research \nService, EPA's gasoline requirements balkanized markets, strained \nsupplies, and raised prices.\n  Since the policies of the administration were so effective in raising \nthe prices, one might expect the Vice President to be pleased. But \nconfronted with angry consumers on the campaign trail, the Vice \nPresident suggests that refiners and oil companies are to blame. A lot \nof finger-pointing is going on around here.\n  Let me refer to an article that appeared in the Washington Times of \nJuly 19. This is an editorial covering a memorandum that came from the \nClinton Energy Department suggesting that the Department was indeed \naware that the administration's own regulations pertaining to so-called \n``reformulated'' gasoline, rather than the oil industry gouging, were \nprimarily responsible for the increased price of motor fuels.\n\n  The reformulated gas--RFG--rule, which stipulated that refiners mix \ndifferent types of gasoline for different localities, has made it \nimpossible, or at least very difficult, to take advantage of the \neconomies of scale in production and distribution that heretofore have \nhelped keep U.S. energy prices stable and low.\n  Their memo, which was sent June 5--a full week before the \nadministration began to blame the oil industry for raising fuel \nprices--states that the RFG reformulated gasoline rule was a major \nreason for the price spike, delaying claims made by the administration \nthat they couldn't see any reason other than blind greed for the change \nin per-gallon gasoline prices.\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n  I am not here to defend the industry, but I think it is fair to say \nthat for the administration and the media to simply overlook what the \ncost of reformulated gasoline, applied regionally in this country with \nnine specific types of reformulated gasoline, has done to the price of \ngasoline speaks for itself.\n  It is kind of interesting. This article said something to the effect \nthat the media and Dan Rather stated during the July 14 broadcast that, \n``Republicans today sided with the oil companies against the Clinton/\nGore administration on the question of who and what is to blame for \nhigher gasoline prices.''\n  When you invoke this type of mandate on the first of June, you are \ncertainly going to get a reaction from the American public when the \nprice of reformulated gasoline goes up dramatically, particularly in \nthe Midwest. That is what is known around here--and we are no strangers \nto it--as ``dancing the sidestep.''\n  Another example of the Clinton/Gore administration's attitude towards \nenergy goes back a little further, when we needed Russia's support--or \nat least its acquiescence--in NATO's war in Kosovo. There is strong \nevidence that the administration sought to persuade OPEC to cut \nproduction and drive crude oil prices up some 18 months ago. It seems \nthis was done to help Russia, an oil exporter generally badly in need \nof hard currency, in exchange for its acquiescence--which we got--in \nNATO's war in Kosovo.\n  Despite the fact that his own administration colluded with OPEC to \nmanipulate prices, our Vice President has called on the Federal Trade \nCommission to investigate oil companies and refiners--for colluding to \nmanipulate prices. I don't know how long that is going to take, but I \nsuspect it is going to take some time for that investigation to be \ncompleted. In any event, I find that highly ironic.\n  Here is another example.\n  We have all heard that our Vice President says he wants to reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil in the volatile Middle East. But \nhis stated policy is to curtail Federal oil and gas leasing on the \nOuter Continental Shelf. We heard him make that statement in Louisiana, \nthat, if elected, he would terminate leases and buy back others.\n  He would also defer any opening of public land in the Rocky Mountain \nOverthrust Belt in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado. He also urged the \nPresident to veto a 1995 bill allowing a small sliver of the Alaska \nCoastal Plain to be opened for oil and gas exploration.\n  That area, I might add, in my State of Alaska, could have enough oil \nto replace imports of Saudi Arabian oil for the next 30 years. It is \nestimated the area might contain as much as 16 billion barrels. Of \nfurther note, the area known as ANWR has 19 million acres, most of \nwhich is already set aside in wilderness. The remaining acreage, 1.5 \nmillion acres, is left for Congress to make a determination on. The \nindustry says that out of that 1.5 million acres, oil is in abundance. \nWith the advancement of technology we have in building icy roads in the \nwilderness, the footprint will be less than 2,000 acres. Clearly, the \nClinton-Gore administration will not give us an opportunity to make a \ndetermination whether domestically we can reduce our dependence on \nimported oil and develop this very important resource in my State of \nAlaska.\n\n  Over the past 8 years, domestic production in this country has \nplummeted 17 percent as demand for foreign oil has risen 14 percent. We \nnow depend on foreign oil to supply 56 percent of our needs. The \naverages of the last few weeks are as much as 64 and 65 percent. \nHowever, during the disastrous 1973 Arab oil embargo, we were only 35-\npercent dependent. Some of my colleagues remember we had gasoline lines \naround the block. The public was mad. They were upset and blamed the \nGovernment. Their rhetoric and policy just doesn't match up. We are now \nin the year 2000 and we are on average in excess of 56 percent \ndependent on foreign imports.\n  Our Vice President also says we must increase our use of cleaner-\nburning natural gas to replace ``dirty coal.'' But his policy is to put \nthe most promising areas for the discovery and production of natural \ngas off limits to exploration. I refer to another quote he made October \n22 at a campaign appearance in Rye, NH. Our Vice President said: I will \ndo everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling, even \nin areas of the OCS already leased by previous administrations.\n  This is yet another example of what folks find confusing. Our Vice \nPresident, in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' wrote: Mining \ninffluent must return to the Earth as pure as they came.\n  But did you know that the Vice President, with his family, certainly \ndon't follow this practice, pocketing $20,000 a year in mining \nroyalties from the zinc mine on his Carthage, TN, property. He has \npocketed $500,000 over the past 25 years. Considering this zinc mine \nhas contaminated the banks of the Caney Fork River with heavy metal--\nthat is in this general area. This is the Caney Fork River. This is the \narea that is concentrated with pollutants from the leaching field. This \nis the actual area where the mines are. This is the leaching field. \nThis is the Gore complex above. They have had violations of clean water \nstandards from time to time. It is clear that the mine does not meet \nstandards set forth in the Vice President's book. I am sure however, \nthat the royalty checks got cashed.\n  This is a picture that appeared in the June 30 Wall Street Journal \ncover article of this particular mine and the activities associated \nwith it. I ask unanimous consent the article from the Wall Street \nJournal of June 30 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 30, 2000]\n\n                Al Gore, Environmentalist and Zinc Miner\n\n                          (By Micah Morrison)\n\n       ``The lakes and rivers sustain us; they flow through the \n     veins of the earth and into our own.

Vice President Al Gore lists a $20,000 \n     mining royalty for the extraction of zinc from beneath his \n     farm here in the bucolic hills of the Cumberland River \n     Valley. In total, Mr. Gore has earned $500,000 from zinc \n     royalties. His late father, the senator, introduced him not \n     only to the double-bladed ax but also to Armand Hammer, \n     chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., which sold the zinc-\n     rich land to the Gore family in 1973.\n       It also seems that zinc from Mr. Gore's property ends up in \n     the cool waters of the Caney Fork River, an oft-celebrated \n     site in Gore lore. A major shaft and tailings pond of the \n     Pasminco Zinc Mine sit practically in the backyard of the \n     vice president's Tennessee homestead. Zinc and other metals \n     from the Gore land move from underground tunnels through \n     elaborate extraction processes. Waste material ends up in the \n     tailings pond, from which water flows into adjacent Caney \n     Fork, languidly rolling on to the great Cumberland.\n\n\n                             messy business\n\n       Mining is intrinsically a messy business, and Pasminco Zinc \n     generally has a good environmental record. But not one that \n     would pass muster with ``Earth in the Balance,'' Mr. Gore's \n     best-selling environmental book. As recently as May 16, the \n     Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation issued a \n     ``Notice of Violation.'' It informed Pasminco that it had \n     infringed the Tennessee Water Quality Control act due to high \n     levels of zinc in the river.\n       Those zinc levels exceeded standards established by the \n     state and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. A \n     ``sample analysis found that total zinc was 1.480 mg/L \n     [milligrams per liter], which is greater than the monthly \n     average of .65 mg/L and the daily maximum of 1.30 mg/L.'' \n     Pasminco ``may be subject to enforcement action pursuant to \n     The Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1977 for the \n     aforementioned violation,'' the notice stated.\n       This was not the first time Mr. Gore's mining benefactor \n     had run afoul of environmental regulations. In 1996, the mine \n     twice failed biomonitoring tests designed to protect water \n     quality in the Caney Fork for fish and wildlife. Mine \n     discharge ``failed two acute tests for toxicity to \n     Ceriodaphnia dubia,'' a species of water flea, according to a \n     mine permit analysis by Tennessee environmental authorities. \n     ``The discharge of industrial wastewater from Outfall #001 \n     [the Caney Fork effluent] contains toxic metals (copper and \n     zinc),'' the analysis stated. ``The combined effect of these \n     pollutants may be detrimental to fish and aquatic life.''\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n       Tests for The Wall Street Journal by two independent \n     Tennessee laboratories, showed trace amounts of zinc and \n     other metals in the Caney Fork that were in compliance with \n     federal standards. But soil tests revealed what one lab \n     called problematic ``large quantities'' of heavy metals in \n     the riverbank soil downstream of the Caney Fork effluent. In \n     both sets of tests, samples of water and soil were provided \n     to the labs by the Journal.\n       Soil samples drawn from the mine effluent and downstream \n     ``contained large quantities of Barium, Iron, and Zinc, as \n     well as smaller amounts of arsenic, Chromium and Lead,'' \n     Warner Laboratories found in September. ``The soil from each \n     of these sites seems to have some problems according to our \n     findings. The levels of Barium, Iron and Zinc far exceed any \n     report limit [a detection threshold within the testing \n     system] and it should be noted that these results are \n     extremely high compared to typical soil found in a populated \n     neighborhood.''\n       Tests conducted in June by the Environmental Science Corp. \n     found similar traces of heavy metals in the water and soil. \n     The report found the soil samples to contain relatively high \n     levels of ``Barium, Iron, Zinc, and several of the other \n     metals, including Aluminum, Calcium and Magnesium.'' The ESC \n     report also noted traces of cyanide in some water and soil \n     samples.\n       Pasminco is not required to test soil along the banks of \n     the Caney Fork. Both labs, while noting anomalies in the \n     soil, believe the results do not warrant concern as \n     environmental hazards. The water and soil clearly are not, \n     however, ``as pure as they came,'' as Mr. Gore demands in \n     ``Earth in the Balance.''\n       A 1998 study by the Environmental Working Group, a \n     Washington-based organization, criticized the zinc-mining \n     operation for purchasing a toxic waste that included sulfuric \n     acid and reselling it as fertilizer. The mine buys acid waste \n     from steel plants, uses it as purification agent in zinc \n     processing, and then sells the waste to fertilizer companies, \n     according to a report in the Tennessean, a Nashville \n     newspaper. Most soil scientists say the procedure is safe.\n       Tennessee environmentalists disagree. Clearly, when you \n     spread those types of chemicals around on a farm or on the \n     land, you're going to get a lot of runoff,'' Brian McGuire, \n     executive director of Tennessee Citizens Action told the \n     Tennessean. ``So it's going to get into the water. We're \n     poisoning ourselves.''\n       A Pasminco official noted that the mine has had few \n     violations and works to uphold a ``very strict standard'' of \n     environmental quality. The Gore campaign did not respond to \n     requests for comment. But some Tennessee residents say Mr. \n     Gore becomes testy when questioned about the zinc mine. Tom \n     Gniewek, a retired chemical engineer from Camden, Tenn., has \n     studied zinc mine for years and tried to question Mr. Gore \n     about it at town-hall meetings. ``He gets real angry,'' Mr. \n     Gniewek says. ``Instead of answering the question, he \n     attacked my motives and accused people like me of vandalizing \n     the earth.''\n       Mr. Gore's original purchase of the zinc-rich land is of \n     some interest as well, shedding light on his long \n     relationship with Mr. Hammer, the former Occidental Petroleum \n     chief. A controversial influence peddler who trafficked in \n     politicians of all stripes and parties. Mr. Hammer pleaded \n     guilty in 1975 to providing hush money in the Watergate \n     scandal.\n       Mr. Hammer cut a wide swath across Washington from the \n     1930s until his death in 1990 at 92. His controversial career \n     was marked by decades of profitable business dealings with \n     the Soviet Union, which were closely watched by the FBI. He \n     leapt into the big time by acquiring Libyan oil rights for \n     Occidental Petroleum through what biographer Edward Jay \n     Epstein has characterized as a combination of shrewd business \n     dealings and bribery. After his 1975 conviction, Mr. Hammer \n     spent the rest of his life campaigning for a pardon, which \n     President Bush granted in 1989.\n       Mr. Hammer cultivated close relationships with many \n     politicians, but he was closest to Mr. Gore's father, a U.S. \n     senator from 1953 until 1971. Mr. Hammer's Occidental \n     Minerals snapped up the zinc-bearing property in 1972. The \n     senior Mr. Gore's farm is on the opposite bank of the Caney \n     Fork. Mr. Hammer paid $160,000, double the only other offer, \n     according to the Washington Post, which first disclosed \n     details of the arrangement during the 1992 presidential \n     campaign.\n       According to deed documents in Carthage, a year later Mr. \n     Hammer sold the land to the senior Mr. Gore for $160,000, \n     adding the extremely generous $20,000 per year mineral \n     royalty. Ten minutes after that sale, the former senator \n     executed a deed selling the property, including the mineral \n     rights, to his son, the future vice president, for $140,000. \n     Albert Gore Sr. told the Post he kept the first $20,000 \n     royalty for himself, evening up the father-son transaction.\n       The purpose of the sale appears to have been transferring \n     the annual $20,000 payment from Mr. Hammer to the young Mr. \n     Gore. The Post reported that the ``$20,000 a year amounts to \n     $227 an acre, much more than the $30 an acre Occidental \n     Minerals, part of Hammer's oil company, paid the senior Gore \n     and some neighbors a few years before the 1973 arrangement.''\n       In 1992 then-Sen. Gore told the Post that although he had \n     been working for ``slave wages'' as a newspaper reporter, he \n     quickly came up with a $40,000 down payment from two previous \n     real-estate investments. In 1974, the zinc mine began annual \n     payments of $20,000 to Mr. Gore, an important source of \n     income to the young politician for many years.\n       After the senior Mr. Gore lost his 1970 Senate re-election \n     bid, Mr. Hammer named him chairman of Island Creek Coal, an \n     Occidental subsidiary, and appointed him to the board of \n     directors of Occidental Petroleum. The late Mr. Gore's estate \n     is conservatively valued at $1.5 million, including a block \n     of Occidental stock worth between $250,000 and $500,000. The \n     vice president is executor and trustee of his father's \n     estate, with ``sole discretion'' to manage a trust on his \n     mother's behalf.\n       As Albert Gore Jr. rose through the political ranks, Mr. \n     Hammer continued to assist him. The Hammer family and \n     corporations made donations up to the legal maximum in all of \n     Mr. Gore's campaigns, according to Mr. Hammer's former \n     personal assistant, Neil Lyndon, writing in London's Daily \n     Telegraph. Mr. Gore regularly dined with Mr. Hammer and \n     Occidental lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Lyndon wrote. \n     ``Separately and together, the Gores sometimes used Hammer's \n     luxurious private Boeing 727 for journeys and jaunts.'' The \n     former Hammer aide noted that the ``profound and prolonged \n     involvement between Hammer and Gore has never been revealed \n     or investigated.''\n       Mr. Hammer was famous for his dealings with the Soviet \n     Union, and received a humanitarian award in Moscow in 1987 \n     from International Physicians Against Nuclear War. Mr. Gore, \n     who had been elected to the Senate in 1984, delivered a \n     speech to the same convention, saying conventional arms \n     should be cut along with nuclear weapons. As vice president, \n     Mr. Gore became the Clinton administration point man on \n     relations with Russia.\n\n\n                             more hypocrisy\n\n       Mr. Gore would be well served to get the facts out about \n     his relationship with Mr. Hammer, beginning with the zinc \n     bounty. The issue is bigger than whether there is a pollution \n     problem in Tennessee. When Mr. Gore's zinc riches are at \n     stake, he appears unwilling to live by the standards he sets \n     out for others in ``Earth in the Balance.''\n       His record of uncompromising environmental rhetoric seems \n     another instance of the kind of hypocrisy that has dogged his \n     campaign for months. He's been accused of being a slumlord \n     for providing substandard housing to a tenant on a rental \n     unit adjoining his farm. A well-remembered 1996 speech to the \n     Democratic National Convention, invoking his sister's death \n     by lung cancer and attacking the tobacco industry, also \n     contributed to his reputation for slippery sanctimony when \n     his close ties to Tennessee tobacco were revealed. And of \n     course Mr. Gore has been sharply criticized for posturing on \n     campaign finance reform while under investigation for \n     possible fund-raising crimes in the 1996 campaign.\n       No mention of the zinc mine appears in ``Earth in the \n     Balance,'' on Mr. Gore's campaign Web site or in his \n     speeches. At this point the story of the Tennessee farm, the \n     zinc mine, the politician and the influence peddler is \n     largely one of cant and hypocrisy. This is not a hanging \n     crime in the political world, but the vice president, among \n     others, might note that Bill Clinton's problems also began \n     with a murky land deal and a shady financier.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, it is not my desire to criticize somebody \nbecause they own a mine or have a resource interest, but there is a \ncertain criticism when one recognizes the reality that this mine is \nhardly a model for anyone, based on the number of violations that have \nbeen filed in Tennessee over an extended period of time on this \nparticular mine.\n  We know the Vice President has been critical of some; namely George \nW. Bush, for his close ties to big oil. In fact, the Vice President's \nfamily has close historical ties to Occidental Petroleum and shares in \nthat company which, in its public disclosure, is valued between \n$500,000 to $1 million. Occidental Petroleum plans to drill in the \nancestral lands of over 5,000 U'wa Indians in the Colombia rain forest. \nThey threatened suicide if Occidental goes forward with its plans.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article from the June 26 Washington Times \nthat substantiates that allegation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOccidental Deal Benefits Gores--Sale of Federal Oil Field Boosts Family \n                                Fortune\n\n                            (By Bill Sammon)\n\n       Vice President Al Gore's push to privatize a federal oil \n     field added tens of thousands of dollars to the value of oil \n     stock owned by the Gore family, which has been further \n     enriched by skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n       Shares of Occidental Petroleum jumped 10 percent after the \n     company purchased the Elk Hills oil field in California from \n     the federal government in 1998. Mr. Gore, whose family owns \n     at least $500,000 in Occidental stock, recommended the sale \n     as part of his ``reinventing government'' reform package.\n       The sale, which constituted the largest privatization of \n     federal land in U.S. history,\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\n     transformed Occidental from a lackluster financial performer \n     into a dynamic profit-spewing, oil giant. Having instantly \n     tripled its U.S. oil reserves, the company began pumping out \n     vast sums of crude at low cost.\n       As the months went by, Occidental was able to sell the oil, \n     which ends up at gasoline retail outlets like Union 76, for \n     more profit. Rising oil prices have significantly improved \n     Occidental's bottom line, said analyst Christopher Stavros of \n     Paine Webber.\n       This year, the company posted first quarter revenues of \n     $2.5 billion, or 87 percent higher than a year earlier. \n     That's a bigger increase than at nine of 10 other oil \n     companies listed in a survey that Mr. Gore cited last week as \n     evidence of price gouging.\n       The rise in Occidental oil prices, coupled with the \n     acquisition of the Elk Hills field, has paid handsome \n     dividends for the Gore family.\n       The vice president recently updated his financial \n     disclosure form to put the value of this family's Occidental \n     stock at between $500,000 and $1 million. Prior to the Elk \n     Hills sale and gasoline price spike, Mr. Gore had listed the \n     value of the stock at between $250,000 and $500,000.\n       Gore aides insist the vice president's push to sell Elk \n     Hills does not constitute a conflict of interest. They point \n     out the family's Occidental shares were originally owned by \n     Mr. Gore's father, who died in 1998, leaving the stock in an \n     estate for which the vice president serves as executor.\n       Although Mr. Gore continues to list the stock on his \n     financial disclosure forms, aides said the shares are in a \n     trust for the vice president's mother, Pauline.\n       ``He doesn't own stock because he's trying to avoid \n     conflicts of interest,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. \n     ``He's the executor of the estate, but he's not the trustee \n     of the trust. It's a separate thing.''\n       Still, Mr. Gore's recommendation to privatize Elk Hills \n     ended up enriching his mother, who is expected to eventually \n     bequeath the stock to the vice president, her sole heir.\n       Last week, Mr. Gore began a concerted effort to blame \n     skyrocketing gasoline prices not only on ``big oil'' but also \n     on Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Gore aides have emphasized that \n     Mr. Bush once ran several oil-exploration firms and has \n     accepted more campaign contributions from oil companies than \n     the vice president.\n       The Texas governor has dismissed the attacks as an attempt \n     to divert attention away from Mr. Gore's energy and \n     environmental policies, which have driven up gasoline prices. \n     Political analysts say the spiraling gas prices could imperil \n     Mr. Gore's presidential bid because they are highest in the \n     Midwest, which he must carry in order to win the White House.\n       The political and financial fortunes of the Gore family \n     were established largely with oil money from Occidental's \n     founder, Armand Hammer. Part capitalist and part communist, \n     Mr. Hammer became the elder Gore's patron more than half a \n     century ago, showering him with riches and nurturing his \n     political career through the House and Senate.\n       The elder Gore enthusiastically returned the favors. In the \n     early 1960s, Sen. Gore took to the Senate floor to defend Mr. \n     Hammer against FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who wanted to \n     investigate Mr. Hammer's Soviet ties.\n       In 1965, the elder Gore helped Mr. Hammer obtain a visa to \n     Libya, where he opened oil fields that turned Occidental into \n     a multinational powerhouse.\n       When the elder Mr. Gore lost his re-election bid in 1970, \n     Mr. Hammer installed him as head of an Occidental subsidiary \n     and gave him a $500,000 annual salary. The man who had begun \n     his career as a struggling schoolteacher in rural Tennessee \n     ended it as a millionaire oil tycoon.\n       The younger Gore also benefited from Mr. Hammer's \n     generosity. He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in \n     annual payments of $20,000 for mineral rights to a parcel of \n     land near the family's homestead in Tennessee that Occidental \n     never bothered mining.\n       When the younger Gore first ran for president in 1988, Mr. \n     Hammer promised former Sen. Paul Simon ``any Cabinet spot I \n     wanted'' if he would withdraw from the primary, according to \n     a 1989 book by the Illinois Democrat.\n       Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, once flew in Mr. Hammer's \n     private jet across the Atlantic Ocean. They hosted Mr. \n     Hammer, at several presidential inaugurations and remained \n     close to the oilman until his death in 1990.\n       In 1992, when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was considering \n     Mr. Gore as his running mate, the elder Gore wrote a memo \n     describing his son's ties to Mr. Hammer. The document was \n     designed to provide Mr. Clinton with answers to possible \n     questions from reporters.\n       Mr. Hammer's successor at Occidental, Ray Irani, has \n     continued to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars into the \n     campaigns of Mr. Gore and the Democratic Party. For example, \n     two days after spending the night in the Lincoln Bedroom in \n     1996, he cut a check for $100,000 to the Democratic Party.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have heard that the Vice President and the \nadministration tried to stop drilling in Alaska with expressions of \nconcern for the G'wichin Indians, some of which reside in Alaska, and \nothers which reside in Canada.\n  But has he spoken out for the U'was in Colombia? Is there an \ninconsistency here? On the one hand, he allows, and evidently ignores, \nthe drilling in the Colombia rain forest on leases owned by Occidental \nPetroleum, and he seems to have no objection. But in an area the \nG'wichin Indians in Alaska depend on for subsistence, a significant \narea which is in the purview of the Senate to make decisions for \nopening, he does not support oil and gas exploration. My point is, \nthere is an inconsistency here.\n  The weight of their policy as it twists and reinvents itself is a \nmystery to me as I try to summon a clear vision of their intent. His \nbeliefs are a confusing world of images and contradictions. I suspect \nit might be difficult for others, as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7490-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROJECTS ON GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am also going to take the \nopportunity to address an issue that some time ago my Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources asked the General Accounting Office to \nprovide a detailee to conduct a preliminary inquiry into payments made \nby the Project On Government Oversight to two Federal officials. The \nProject On Government Oversight is known as ``POGO.'' This report was \nreceived by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It was \nprepared by Paul Thompson, the detailee from the General Accounting \nOffice. It is dated July 2000.\n  There is no question in my mind after reviewing this that the \ninspector general of the Department of the Interior should be required \nto review this report and respond to our Committee. I think it is \nfitting that the Attorney General, Janet Reno, address and resolve some \nof the questions that are raised by the inquiry.\n  Let me share some of them. I read as follows from the report of the \nPOGO on July 2000.\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       It appears that POGO paid the two Federal officials in \n     connection with their activities to influence the Department \n     toward taking actions and adopting policies that, among other \n     things, (a) directly and indirectly assisted POGO in a \n     project involving matters in which these two individuals were \n     substantially involved as Federal employees and that led to \n     POGO's filing of a lawsuit through which it and the two \n     officials received substantial sums of money and stand to \n     receive potentially millions of dollars more, and (b) \n     benefited the professional and business interests of POGO's \n     chairman and a client of his law firm. The circumstances \n     associated with the payments raised the possibility that the \n     Department of the Interior's development of the policy \n     underlying the new oil royalty regulations may have been \n     improperly influenced by expectations or understandings of \n     the officials that they could personally benefit from using \n     their positions as Federal employees to assist POGO and two \n     of its principals. The officials were substantially involved \n     in key stages of the Department's policy development process \n     in ways that served the interests of the POGO's chairman and \n     its executive director. Whether the payments and \n     circumstances under which they were made could serve to erode \n     confidence in the Department's administration of the royalty \n     management program is a well grounded concern.\n  Madam President, the entire transcript of the committee report on \nPOGO, prepared for the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, is \navailable from the committee's website at http://www.energy.senate.gov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/24/senate-section/article/S7490-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO H.R. 4461\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
