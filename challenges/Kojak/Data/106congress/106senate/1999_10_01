On behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce \nthat we will now begin 30 minutes of debate on the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, regarding diabetes. \nFollowing that debate, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the \namendment at approximately 9:30 a.m.\n  The Senate is expected to continue consideration of the Labor-HHS \nbill during today's session. Senators who still intend to offer \namendments to the bill are encouraged to work with the managers to \nschedule time for those amendments. Following the Labor-HHS bill today, \nthere will be a period of morning business.\n\n  The leader advised me last night that the Senate will be proceeding \nto other business on Monday and Tuesday and that we will return to the \nLabor-HHS bill on Wednesday.\n  There are a great many amendments pending. As the chairman of the \nfull committee announced yesterday, it is his intention, and for that \nmatter, mine, too, to challenge any amendments which violate rule XVI; \nthat is, to offer legislation on an appropriations bill. I encourage \nall Senators to consult with me or have their staffs consult with \ncommittee staff to work out time agreements and sequencing so that when \nthe amendment is called we can move to it as promptly as possible.\n  The leader called my attention to the fact that following next week's \nsession, we will be on the holiday for Columbus Day, so there may be \nsome motivation for people to want to get the Senate business in order \nto be concluded as promptly as possible before the start of that 3-day \nweekend.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11757-7", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ----. EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE TO RAISE THE \n                   AWARENESS OF THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF DIABETES \n                   AND TO SUPPORT INCREASED FUNDS FOR DIABETES \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that \n     affects people of every age, race, income level, and \n     nationality.\n       (2) Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes, and \n     millions more are at risk of developing the disease.\n       (3) The number of Americans with diabetes has increased \n     nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years, leading the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention to call it the ``epidemic \n     of our time''.\n       (4) In 1999, approximately 800,000 people will be diagnosed \n     with diabetes, and diabetes will contribute to almost 200,000 \n     deaths, making diabetes the sixth leading cause of death due \n     to disease in the United States.\n       (5) Diabetes costs our nation an estimated $105,000,000,000 \n     each year.\n       (6) More than 1 out of every 10 United States health care \n     dollars, and about 1 out of every 4 Medicare dollars, is \n     spent on the care of people with diabetes.\n       (7) More than $40,000,000,000 a year in tax dollars are \n     spent treating people with diabetes through Medicare, \n     Medicaid, veterans benefits, Federal employee health \n     benefits, and other Federal health programs.\n       (8) Diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed, and an estimated \n     5,400,000 Americans have the disease but do not know it.\n       (9) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, \n     blindness in adults, and amputations.\n       (10) Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease, \n     stroke, and birth defects, and shortens average life \n     expectancy by up to 15 years.\n       (11) An estimated 1,000,000 Americans have Type 1 diabetes, \n     formerly known as juvenile diabetes, and 15,200,000 Americans \n     have Type 2 diabetes, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (12) Of Americans aged 65 years or older, 18.4 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (13) Of Americans aged 20 years or older, 8.2 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (14) Hispanic, African, Asian, and Native Americans suffer \n     from diabetes at rates much higher than the general \n     population, including children as young as 8 years-old, who \n     are now being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, formerly known \n     as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (15) In 1999, there is no method to prevent or cure \n     diabetes, and available treatments have only limited success \n     in controlling diabetes devastating consequences.\n       (16) Reducing the tremendous health and human burdens of \n     diabetes and its enormous economic toll depend on identifying \n     the factors responsible for the disease and developing new \n     methods for treatment and prevention.\n       (17) Improvements in technology and the general growth in \n     scientific knowledge have created unprecedented opportunities \n     for advances that might lead to better treatments, \n     prevention, and ultimately a cure.\n       (18) After extensive review and deliberations, the \n     congressionally established and National Institutes of \n     Health-selected Diabetes Research Working Group has found \n     that ``many scientific opportunities are not being pursued \n     due to insufficient funding, lack of appropriate mechanisms, \n     and a shortage of trained researchers''.\n       (19) The Diabetes Research Working Group has developed a \n     comprehensive plan for National Institutes of Health-funded \n     diabetes research, and has recommended a funding level of \n     $827,000,000 for diabetes research at the National Institutes \n     of Health in fiscal year 2000.\n       (20) The Senate as an institution, and Members of Congress \n     as individuals, are in unique positions to support the fight \n     against diabetes and to raise awareness about the need for \n     increased funding for research and for early diagnosis and \n     treatment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about the importance of the \n     early detection, and proper treatment of, diabetes; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for screening and treating \n     diabetes;\n       (2) the National Institutes of Health, within their \n     existing funding levels, should increase research funding, as \n     recommended by the congressionally established and National \n     Institutes of Health-selected Diabetes Research Working \n     Group, so that the causes of, and improved treatments and \n     cure for, diabetes may be discovered;\n       (3) all Americans should take an active role to fight \n     diabetes by using all the means available to them, including \n     watching for the symptoms of diabetes, which include frequent \n     urination, unusual thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight \n     loss, extreme fatigue, and irritability; and\n       (4) national organizations, community organizations, and \n     health care providers should endeavor to promote awareness of \n     diabetes and its complications, and should encourage early \n     detection of diabetes through regular screenings, education, \n     and by providing information, support, and access to \n     services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Abraham, be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my co-chair of the Senate \nDiabetes Caucus, Senator Breaux, as well as the chairman of the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging, Senator Grassley, and the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, in introducing a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to help address the devastating impact of diabetes \nand its resulting complications on Americans of all ages.\n  This resolution calls for increased support for diabetes research, \neducation, early detection, and treatment. Diabetes research has been \nunderfunded in recent years. It is imperative that we increase our \ncommitment in order to take full advantage of the unprecedented and \nexciting scientific opportunities that we have as the millennium \napproaches for advances leading to better detection, treatment, \nprevention, and ultimately a cure for this devastating disease.\n  Diabetes is a very serious condition that affects people of every \nage, race, and nationality. Here in America, 16 million people suffer \nfrom diabetes, and about 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.\n  Moreover, diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed. Of the 16 million \nAmericans with diabetes, it is estimated that 5.4 million do not \nrealize they have this very serious condition.\n  Diabetes is one of our Nation's most costly diseases, both in human \nand economic terms. It is the sixth deadliest disease in the United \nStates and kills almost 200,000 Americans annually. It is the leading \ncause of kidney failure, of blindness in adults, and amputations. It is \na significant risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and birth defects. \nThe disease shortens the average life expectancy by up to 15 years\n  Moreover, it is very costly in financial terms as well. Diabetes \ncosts the Nation in excess of $105 billion annually in health-related \nexpenditures. At present, more than 1 out of every 10 dollars that we \nspend on health care is related to treating people with diabetes. About \n1 out of 4 Medicare dollars are used to treat people with diabetes. \nIndeed, more than 40 billion in tax dollars is spent each year treating \npeople with diabetes through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' health, and \nFederal employees' programs.\n  Unfortunately, there currently is no way to prevent or to cure \ndiabetes. Available treatments have had only limited success in \ncontrolling the devastating consequences of this disease. This problem \nis made all the more complex by the fact that diabetes is not a single \ndisease, but rather it occurs in several forms and the complications \naffect virtually every system of the body.\n  Children with type I diabetes face a lifetime of multiple daily \nfinger pricks to check their blood sugar levels, daily insulin \ninjections, and the possibility of lifelong complications, including \nkidney failure and blindness, which can be deadly, can be disabling.\n  Older Americans with diabetes also can be disabled by the multiple \ncomplications of the disease.\n  Every year, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation hosts a children's \ncongress in Washington, DC. They bring children from all over this \nNation to put a human face on the consequences of type I diabetes.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to meet a courageous 8-year-old boy \nfrom North Yarmouth, ME. Nathan Reynolds is an active young boy. He \nloves school, biking, swimming, and baseball, and he particularly likes \ncollecting old coins. He is also suffering from type I diabetes. He was \ndiagnosed about 2 years ago, and it has completely changed his life and \nthe life of his family.\n  He has had to learn how to check his blood. In fact, his 4-year-old \nbrother reminds him to do it before each meal.\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nHe has to give himself an insulin shot or get his teacher or the school \nnurse or his parents to help him do so. Nathan can never take a day off \nfrom his disease. It does not matter whether it is Christmas or his \nbirthday, he still has to prick his finger and check his blood sugar. \nHe still has to inject himself with insulin in order to keep relatively \nhealthy.\n  I will never forget the story a teacher told me of all the children \nin her class making a wish for Christmas. Some of them wished for a new \ntoy, one wished for a pony, another wished to go to Disney World. But \none little boy who had juvenile diabetes made the wish that he could \njust have Christmas without having to give himself ``yucky'' shots.\n  That story touched me deeply, and it hit home with the fact that this \nis a lifelong condition for children who are diagnosed with type I \ndiabetes.\n  I will also never forget the anguish on a young mother's face who \ntold me her 5-year-old son had just been diagnosed with diabetes. ``How \ndo I tell him?'' she said. ``How do I tell him he is going to have to \nhave shots every day, that he is going to have to constantly prick his \nfinger to check his blood sugar levels? How do I tell him what this \nmeans for him and for all of us who love him?''\n  There is also some good news. Exciting research is underway that \nshould lead to medical breakthroughs for Nathan, for other children, \nand for adults who have type I and type II diabetes. Reducing the \ntremendous health and human burdens of diabetes and its enormous \neconomic toll depends upon identifying the factors responsible for the \ndisease and developing new methods for treatment, prevention, and \nultimately a cure.\n  The next decade holds tremendous potential and promise for diabetes \nresearch. Improvements in technology and the general growth in \nscientific knowledge have created unprecedented opportunities for \nadvancements that might lead to better treatments, prevention, and a \ncure.\n\n  Earlier this year, the congressionally mandated diabetes research \nworking group, an independent panel composed of 12 scientific experts \nof diabetes and 4 representatives of the lay diabetes communities, \nissued an important report. It is called ``Conquering Diabetes: A \nStrategic Plan for the 21st Century.'' This important report details \nthe magnitude of the problem, and it lays out a comprehensive plan for \nresearch conducted by the National Institutes of Health on diabetes.\n  In this report, the diabetes working group found, ``Many scientific \nopportunities are not being pursued due to insufficient funding, lack \nof appropriate mechanisms and a shortage of trained researchers.''\n  The report also concluded that the current level of funding, the \nlevel of effort, and the scope of diabetes research falls far short of \nwhat is needed to capitalize on these promising opportunities. The \nfunding level, the report found, is so far short of what is required to \nmake progress on this complex and difficult problem.\n  The report goes on to recommend a funding level of $827 million for \ndiabetes research at NIH in fiscal year 2000, and, indeed, many of our \ncolleagues signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting \nan appropriation of just that level to be included to advance the goals \nof this legislation.\n  I am a strong supporter of increased research and of efforts to \ndouble our investment in biomedical research over the next few years. \nThere is simply no investment that would yield greater returns for the \nAmerican taxpayers, and the commitment of the bill before us of an \nadditional $2 billion in funding for NIH, which represents nearly a 13-\npercent increase, will bring us so much closer to that goal. This \nstrategy is particularly important as we move into the next century \nwhen our public health and disability programs will be under increasing \nstrains due to the aging of our population.\n  I am also very pleased and commend the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Specter, and the ranking minority member, Senator Harkin, for \nincluding very strong language in the report accompanying this bill \nwhich recognizes that diabetes research has been underfunded in the \npast and directs that funding for diabetes be increased at the National \nInstitute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease and other NIH \ninstitutes. Again, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, have all been \ntremendous advocates for people with diabetes and are to be commended \nfor their strong leadership in this effort.\n  The amendment I am offering today does not earmark a particular \nfunding level for diabetes research. Rather, it is intended to heighten \nawareness of the devastating impact of this disease, and it is intended \nto affirm that diabetes research is a high priority. Most of all, the \namendment expresses the clear intent of the Senate that the National \nInstitutes of Health should substantially increase its investment in \nthe fight against diabetes along the lines recommended in this landmark \nreport, the $827 million recommendation.\n  We must ensure that sufficient resources are available to take full \nadvantage of the extraordinary and unprecedented scientific \nopportunities identified by the diabetes working group. If we do so, we \ncan better understand and ultimately conquer this devastating disease.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention. I hope all of my colleagues will \njoin us in supporting this resolution to send a clear signal that we \nare committed to conquering diabetes.\n  I reserve any remaining time I may have left.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution regarding diabetes. I thank my colleagues from \nMaine for sponsoring this resolution. Senator Collins and I were among \nthe original co-founders of the Senate Diabetes Caucus and have worked \ntogether to raise awareness of the disease and the need for a cure.\n  Diabetes is a devastating illness that affects people of every age, \nrace, and nationality. More than sixteen million Americans suffer from \ndiabetes and 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Diabetes is \nalso a leading chronic illness affecting children, a special population \nwith which it places an especially heavy burden.\n  Although many people with diabetes are able to survive with multiple \ndaily injections of insulin, it is not a cure for this dreaded disease. \nDespite the availability of insulin, diabetes continues to cause \nserious health complications, including kidney failure and blindness, \nand it is the cause of nearly 200,000 deaths per year.\n  Diabetes costs our nation nearly $100 billion each year in direct and \nindirect costs. In fact, more than forty billion tax dollars are spent \neach year in treating people with diabetes through Medicare, Medicaid, \nveterans and federal employees health benefits.\n  Past investments in diabetes research at the National Institutes for \nHealth (NIH) are beginning to show real promise for a cure and the \nnumber of research opportunities in the field continue to expand. We \nnow stand at a pivotal juncture in the fight to cure diabetes and its \ncomplications.\n  A report released in February by the congressionally mandated \nDiabetes Research Working Group (DRWG) called upon NIH to substantially \nexpand its support for diabetes research and has identified specific \nresearch recommendations as part of a new national plan to find a cure.\n  On April 26, 1999, a letter signed by myself, Senator Collins, and 37 \nof our colleagues was sent to Chairman Specter and Ranking Member \nHarkin in requesting increased funding for diabetes research within NIH \nin accordance with the DRWG report. And, it is clear from the work of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee that diabetes has not been \nneglected. Therefore, in an effort to bolster the work of the \ncommittee, and I believe rightly so, this resolution is being \nintroduced today to send a clear signal to all Americans that diabetes \nis a serious concern of the United States Senate.\n  We have not yet found a cure for diabetes. But, I am confident that \nin time and with sufficient support, a cure will be found and we will \nbe able to declare victory over this debilitating disease.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, for offering this amendment. I agree with her \nthat the amendment will appropriately\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\nfocus attention on the problems of diabetes, especially among the young \npeople in America.\n  I thank Senator Collins for noting the work of the subcommittee and \nthe full committee in moving ahead with funding on this important \nailment and, as she noted, with the very strong language that is \npresent in the bill encouraging the National Institutes of Health to \nmove forward.\n  I think it appropriate to note for the record that on June 22 of this \nyear we had a special hearing on diabetes. At that time, we had \ntestimony from officials at the National Institutes of Health, the \nDirector, Dr. Harold Varmus; Dr. Phillip Gorton, the Director of the \nInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; as well as a \nnumber of others.\n  It is very important to put a human face on the issue, as Senator \nCollins did with the specific reference in her speech to the \nyoungsters. At that time, we had coming forward the celebrity, Mary \nTyler Moore, a juvenile diabetic; Mr. Tony Bennett, the famous singer, \nthe grandfather of a child with diabetes; Mr. Alan Silvestri, a \ncomposer and father of a child with diabetes; and also our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, who has a daughter \nwith diabetes.\n  It is a curious factor, but a fact of life nonetheless, that when \npeople of celebrated stature come and testify, there is more public \nunderstanding of the ailment and more willingness to face up to it in \nthe appropriations process.\n  In order to carry forward on what this sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nrequests--and I feel confident in predicting it will pass 90-something \nto nothing; the only open question is how many Senators will be present \nto vote for it; I think it will be a unanimous vote, but our ability to \ncarry that forward depends upon what we appropriate.\n  In the bill currently pending, we have an increase in NIH funding of \n$2 billion. That is a tremendous sum of money. We have a bill which is \n$4 billion higher than last year's bill, with the funding coming \nlargely for education, where we have an increase of $2.3 billion. In \nassessing the priorities in education, we have put in more than $500 \nmillion more than the President's request. We have in excess of $35 \nbillion for education.\n  When it comes to health care, Senator Harkin and I have taken the \nlead in adding $2 billion, as we did last year. When we have assessed \nthose priorities, it has made it necessary to reduce funding on some \nother proposals. I found myself in a very unique position in managing \nthis bill. I have voted against amendments I never voted against \nbefore. I voted against an amendment to add $200 million on class size, \nwhich I would like to have supported. The bill continues the funding at \n$1.2 billion. If we added the $200 million on class size, in addition \nto the $1.2 billion, there would not be room for funding for NIH, for \nprograms such as diabetes.\n  Then we had an amendment come up on afterschool programs, again, a \nrequest for $200 million more. There is $200 million in the current \nbudget, and Senator Harkin and I took the lead of adding $200 million \nto bring it to $400 million. I would like to have more for afterschool \nprograms, but I had to vote against that amendment, because if we add \n$200 million more to afterschool programs, it has to come from some \nplace. And NIH is a big target out there. The amendment adding the $200 \nmillion for afterschool programs was offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer.\n\n  Then Senator Dodd offered an amendment to add about $900 million more \nto day care. I have always supported. But again, when you have a bill \nof $91.7 billion, which is at the breaking point as to what this body \nwill pass--and I think there is a question as to whether we will have \n51 votes for that because it is a lot of money, although staying within \nthe caps--again with great reluctance, I could not support Senator \nDodd's amendment on day care.\n  Then we had a very important social service block grant, again where \nit is a matter of priorities. When it comes to health, I believe there \nis no higher priority. I have said with some frequency that the \nNational Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government.\n  In my position as chairman of the subcommittee, which has the \nbaseline responsibility to fund the National Institutes of Health--and \nSenator Harkin has the same consideration--we receive requests \nconstantly from people who have Parkinson's--we had a hearing this week \non Parkinson's disease. We had a hearing on prostate cancer, a special \nconcern on breast cancer, heart ailments, a very large number of \nunknown diseases.\n  I said on the floor yesterday that Senator Harkin is very frequently \nlobbied when he gets on the plane between Washington and Des Moines. I \nfind a lot of people with unique ailments on the Metroliner between \nWashington and Philadelphia.\n  As Senator Collins has brought forward the issue this morning, I \nthink it is a very profound message. But to accomplish what Senator \nCollins seeks, we have to appropriate the increase of $2 billion. Even \nthen, if there are 10 doors with research projects behind them, 7 of \nthose doors will not be opened, even with funding NIH at a level of \n$17.6 billion.\n  So again, I thank my colleague from Maine--carrying on the great \ntradition of Maine Senators.\n  I yield the floor, leaving her the remainder of the time before 9:30 \nto close.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I again salute the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \ntremendous commitment to medical research. Without his leadership, we \nwould not see the kinds of advancements that are being made. I thank \nhim for his support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nDeWine, and the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, be added as \ncosponsors to my sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are on the edge of an exciting \nbreakthrough in the treatment and ultimately the prevention and cure of \ndiabetes. That is why I am so excited by the possibility of a \nsignificant increase in research in this area.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have had the \nopportunity to visit some of the leading-edge research labs that are \ndoing work on diabetes. I have visited Jackson Labs in Bar Harbor, MA, \nwhere very exciting research is ongoing into the causes of both type I \nand type II diabetes. I am very proud of the contributions made by \nthese distinguished scientists in my home State.\n  In addition, I have had the pleasure of visiting the JDF Foundation \nCenter at Harvard Medical School, where there is also tremendous \nresearch underway. I am convinced, with the kind of increased \ncommitment called for by my resolution, and indicated in the \nAppropriations Committee's report, that we can in fact break through \nand reach a cure for this devastating disease.\n  Mr. President, I do not know whether there is any other request for \ntime. It is my understanding the vote is scheduled for 9:30. We have \nreached that hour.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one seeking further time to speak, I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Does the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania yield back the remaining time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, Mr. President. The hour is 9:30. I think we are \nset for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the Collins amendment No. 1824. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas), are necessarily \nabsent\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, 2 years ago, we passed the Balanced \nBudget Act. It was a monumental example of what Congress can achieve \nwhen we work together.\n  Not only did we end 30 years of deficit spending with the Balanced \nBudget Act, we also extended the life of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund \nby 13 years. And we added important new preventive benefits, including \nmammograms and Pap smears, for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  We made many changes that achieved a lot of good.\n  We also know now that we made some miscalculations.\n  Frankly, that is to be expected. Very often, when you make a lot of \nchanges, you don't get everything right the first time.\n  But the miscalculations we made about Medicare in the Balanced Budget \nAct are causing real hardships for some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens--hardships that cannot be justified on either financial or \nmedical grounds. We did not anticipate these consequences when we \npassed the Balanced Budget Act. But now that we know about them, we \nhave a responsibility to address them.\n  Today I am introducing the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of \n1999.\n  This bill is not a comprehensive Medicare reform plan. Nor is it a \nwholesale revision of the Balanced Budget Act. Instead, it is a \nreasonable, targeted solution to certain specific problems with \nMedicare that Congress created inadvertently as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act.\n  Before I outline the specific remedies in my bill, I want to tell you \nabout the real-life consequences of one of the changes we made to \nMedicare under the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Two years ago, Congress decided to limit how much Medicare would pay \nfor rehabilitation therapy. The new limits are $1,500 a year per \npatient for physical and speech therapy combined, and another $1,500 \nfor occupational therapy.\n  For some Medicare patients who need rehabilitation therapy, the new \nlimits on payments are not a problem. But for Ruth Irwin, they are a \nnightmare.\n  A while back, Mrs. Irwin had to have one of her legs amputated \nbecause of complications of diabetes. With an incredible amount of \neffort and the help of regular physical therapy, Mrs. Irwin was \nlearning how to walk with a prosthetic leg and two canes.\n  Her goal was to learn to walk with one cane, so she would have one \nhand free. She was on the verge of reaching that goal--when she hit the \n$1,500 physical-therapy limit. She couldn't afford to pay out-of-\npocket, so she stopped seeing her physical therapist. Her condition \ndeteriorated. A few months later, she tripped on a curb and broke three \nribs. Ruth Irwin is not alone.\n  It is estimated that 1 in 7 Medicare recipients who need physical \ntherapy--about 200,000 Americans--will hit the caps this year. These \nare mostly patients who are recuperating from amputations, strokes, and \nhead trauma, and people who suffer from serious degenerative diseases \nsuch as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.\n  Mr. President, between 1990 and 1996, Medicare spending on \nrehabilitation therapy grew 18 percent a year, to $1 billion. We had \ngood reason to try to curb that growth. But we now know, we chose the \nwrong way to accomplish our goal. It's wrong to force stroke victims in \nnursing homes to decide whether they want to learn how to walk or talk. \nThe Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act repeals the current, \narbitrary caps rehabilitation therapy and replaces it with limits based \non individual patients' specific needs.\n  It also makes a number of other, targeted adjustments.\n  First: It adjusts the new payment system for nursing homes and \nskilled nursing facilities to better reflect the increased costs of \ncaring for very sick patients.\n  Second: It postpones additional cuts in home health care payments for \ntwo years and addresses the more serious problems that have come to \nlight while the current ``interim payment system'' has been in place.\n  Third: It protects hospitals from crippling losses they might \notherwise suffer as the result of a new Medicare payment system for \noutpatient medical services.\n  This protection is especially important for people who depend on \nrural hospitals--like Mobridge Hospital, in Mobridge, South Dakota. \nMobridge Hospital is the only source of inpatient hospital care for 100 \nmiles. If it were forced to drastically reduce its services, or close, \nthat would have a devastating impact on scores of communities. Because \nthey serve a population that is generally older and less wealthy than \naverage, America's rural hospitals operate on lower profit margins, and \nthey have virtually no margin for error. They need the relief that is \nin this bill.\n  A fourth area addressed by the bill are the deep cuts made by the BBA \nin payments to teaching hospitals. Major teaching hospitals represent \nonly 6% of all hospitals. But they account for 70% of the burn units in \nAmerica, more than half of the pediatric intensive care units, and they \nprovide 44% of the indigent care in this country. The bill moderates \nthese cuts.\n  When you combine other BBA cuts in payments with reductions in \npayments for indirect medical education, nearly half of America's major \nteaching hospitals are projected to lose money during the next few \nyears. We cannot sacrifice the high-quality care, teaching, and \nresearch activities these hospitals provide. We must make this fix, and \nkeep these hospitals whole. This bill does it.\n  Fifth, Mr. President, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act \nprovides new protections for seniors enrolled in Medicare+Choice, when \ntheir plan pulls out of their community.\n  Finally, the bill includes additional provisions to protect access to \nrural hospitals, hospice care, community health centers, and rural \nhealth clinics.\n  As I said, this is not a comprehensive solution to Medicare. There \nare still many questions we must work together to answer. How can we \nadd the prescription drug plan both our parties--and the vast majority \nof Americans--say we support? How can we make sure Medicare remains \nsolvent when the Baby Boomers retire--and beyond?\n  These are questions that must be answered. They are important and \nmust be addressed in legislation that falls outside the purview of the \nbill we introduce today. But make no mistake,\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\nthey are high priorities, and ones which will not go away, and will be \naddressed in future bills.\n  For now, though, there is no question that we made some \nmiscalculations in 1997, when we changed the way Medicare pays for \ncertain services. There is no question that those miscalculations are \ncausing real hardships today for some of America's sickest and frailest \ncitizens, and for the institutions that care for them. And there should \nbe no delay in correcting those miscalculations.\n  We should make these changes not just because of the human suffering \nthey are causing. There are compelling economic reasons to make them as \nwell. That is the other part of Ruth Irwin's story. As a result of her \nthree broken ribs, Mrs. Irwin received regular visits by a registered \nnurse and a home health aide--all paid for by Medicare. She also \nreceived physical therapy three times a week.\n  The bottom line: Her recovery was far longer, more painful--and more \ncostly--than it needed to be. We did a lot of good in 1997. We made \nsome tough decisions that added years of solvency to Medicare, and \nenabled us to add life-saving new preventive benefits. But we also made \nsome miscalculations.\n  We didn't know at the time the harsh consequences some of these \nmiscalculations would have.\n  Now that we do, we need to correct them--the sooner, the better. So I \nurge all my colleagues to support this bill and to work with us to \nensure its prompt consideration and passage.\n  This legislation was the result of a tremendous amount of work by a \nnumber of our colleagues. This is clearly a team effort. I thank in \nparticular Senator Moynihan for his extensive efforts to help us draft \nand craft this legislation. His expertise was invaluable in making very \nimportant decisions. I thank Senators Mikulski and Durbin and Kerrey \nfor their commitment to solving the problem. I thank Senator Jack Reed \nfor his help on home health and Senators Baucus and Conrad for their \nefforts on rural health. I thank especially Senator Rockefeller and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts for their commitment to \naccess to health care, to education, and to the array of issues they \nhave raised throughout the work we have done on this bill to this date.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor and again thank Senator Kennedy \nand others for their efforts on the floor this morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we all want to express our appreciation \nto our leader, Senator Daschle, for the development of this proposal. \nAs he has pointed out, we have worked closely with Senator Moynihan and \nthe members the Finance Committee. We hope this will be the basis of \nthe coming together here in the Senate. This should not be a partisan \nissue. The kinds of problems Senator Daschle pointed out are problems \nnot only in urban areas but in rural communities, too. The program he \nhas advocated touches the health care needs of people all over this \ncountry. This particular issue cries for a response and action from \nthis Congress in these final few days.\n  I join with him and others who say we should not leave, we cannot \nleave, we will not leave this session without addressing these \nproblems. We have the time now to work this process through. I think \nthe way this has been fashioned has demonstrated a sensitivity to the \nrange of different emergencies that are out there across the landscape \naffecting real people.\n  So I join others on our side in commending him for the leadership he \nhas provided on this issue as in so many other areas. Hopefully, he \nwill be successful in reaching across the aisle so that we can all work \non this issue together.\n  Mr. President, no senior citizen should be forced to enter a hospital \nor a nursing home because Medicare can't afford to pay for services to \nkeep her in her own home and in her own community.\n  No person with a disability should be told that occupational therapy \nservices are no longer available because legislation to balance the \nbudget reduced the rehabilitation services they need.\n  No community should be told that their number one employer and \nprovider of health care will be closing its doors or engaging in \nmassive layoffs because Medicare can no longer pay its fair share of \nhealth costs.\n  No freestanding children's hospital should wonder whether it can \ncontinue to train providers to care for children because it receives no \nfederal support for its teaching activities. Yet these scenes and many \nothers are playing out in towns and cities across the country today, in \nlarge part due to the unexpectedly deep Medicare cuts in the Balanced \nBudget Act passed two years ago.\n  The 1997 Act was the final part of a process undertaken since 1993 to \nbalance the federal budget and lay the groundwork for the current \neconomic boom and the large budget surpluses we anticipate in the years \nahead. However, our ability to balance the budget was primarily \nattributable to deep savings achieved by cuts in Medicare--by\n\n[[Page S11769]]\n\nslowing the rate of growth in provider payments and other policy \nreforms. These cuts were expected to total $116 billion over five \nyears, and nearly $400 billion over ten years. Clearly, as experience \nnow shows, these cuts are too deep for the Medicare program to sustain.\n  In fact, these cuts were more than double the amount ever enacted in \nany previous legislation. The Congressional Budget Office has now \nincreased the estimate of the savings to total $200 billion over five \nyears and more than $600 billion over ten years--far greater than \nCongress intended.\n  Not surprisingly, we are now hearing from large numbers of the \nnation's safety net providers--especially teaching hospitals, community \nhospitals, and community health centers. We are hearing from those who \ncare for the elderly and disabled when they leave the hospital--nursing \nhomes, home health agencies and rehabilitation specialists. We are \nhearing from virtually every group that cares for the 40 million senior \ncitizens and disabled citizens on Medicare. They are saying--with great \nalarm and anxiety--that Congress went too far.\n  The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act that we \nare introducing today will alleviate much of this damage. It will \nprovide $20 billion over the next ten years to reduce the pain created \nby the harshest cuts in the Balanced Budget Act. It will ensure that \nthe nation's health care system is able to care responsibly for today's \nsenior citizens, and is adequately prepared to take care of those who \nwill be retiring in the future.\n  The current Balanced Budget Act is unfairly imposing a $1.7 billion \ncut over the next five years for Massachusetts hospitals alone. Our \ncommunity hospitals are reeling. Many of our teaching hospitals have \nlaid off staff, and are unable to continue to participate in Medicare \nHMO contracts. Some say that these cuts are needed to make Medicare \nmore efficient. But Massachusetts teaching hospitals are already \nefficient. In the past six years, one out of five of our teaching \nhospitals and one out of four hospital beds have been closed. We cannot \nafford to compromise on patient care, doctor training, and the state-\nof-the-art medical research conducted at the nation's top hospitals.\n\n  In addition, children's hospitals deserve help as well. They \ncurrently receive almost no federal support for their important \nteaching and training activities. They train a majority of the nation's \npediatricians and pediatric specialists. Yet current rules keep them \nfrom receiving the level of federal support available to other teaching \nhospitals. While this particular legislation does not address this \nproblem, Senator Bob Kerrey and I have proposed a separate bill with \nstrong bipartisan support to correct this injustice and give children's \nhospitals the funding they deserve to train the pediatricians needed to \ncare for the nation's children in the years ahead.\n  The home-bound elderly--our most vulnerable senior citizens--are also \nsuffering. In Massachusetts alone, home health agencies are losing $160 \nmillion annually, and 20 agencies have closed their doors since the \nBalanced Budget Act went into effect. The ones that remain are seeing \nfewer patients, and seeing their current patients less often.\n  Massachusetts nursing homes are predicting losses of $500 million \nover the next five years. Eleven facilities have declared bankruptcy \nthis year, and more are expected to follow.\n  With the impending retirement of the baby boom generation, the last \nthing we should do now is jeopardize the viability and commitment of \nthe essential institutions that care for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet \nthat is now happening in cities and towns across the nation. In the \nvast majority of cases, the providers who care for Medicare patients \nare the same ones who care for working families and everyone else in \ntheir community. When hospitals who serve Medicare beneficiaries are \nthreatened, health care for the entire community is threatened.\n  Nearly one million elderly and disabled Massachusetts residents rely \non Medicare for their health care. This legislation is a sensible, \naffordable step to ensure that our health care system will continue to \nbe there for them when they need it. It deserves prompt consideration \nand passage. I commend Senator Daschle for his leadership on this vital \nissue, and I urge the Senate to approve this important measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for his remarks and for his extraordinary commitment \nto this effort. He has been at every meeting. He has been engaged from \nthe very beginning, and we are grateful, as on so many of the issues \nour caucus cares deeply about, for the leadership he has provided.\n  I am proud of the fact we have had the participation of well over 20 \nMembers, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts has been the leader \nof the pack, as he is on so many other issues.\n  I also thank Senator Rockefeller for the extraordinary effort he has \nput forth. As a member of the Finance Committee, no one has worked \nharder on many of these issues than has he. I am grateful for the \nparticipation and leadership he has provided to get us to this point.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me say how urgent this matter is. My \ncolleagues yesterday discussed the urgency of this legislation again \nand again. I am disappointed and deeply concerned about the fact that, \nat least to date, there is no date yet set for consideration and markup \nof a bill to repair the damage done in the 1997 act. We have to address \nand consider and ultimately pass such a bill prior to the time we leave \nthe Senate this year. We will do anything, and everything we know how, \nto ensure this becomes one of the highest legislative priorities left \nprior to the end of this session of Congress. It must be addressed. It \nmust be passed. We must take this legislation up soon in order for us \nto accomplish what I know is a bipartisan recognition of the \nshortcomings and the miscalculations made in the 1997 act.\n  I will say again, the fact that we have over half of our caucus \nalready, and will probably have two-thirds of our caucus as cosponsors \nin the not-too-distant future, is a clear recognition of the depth of \nfeeling our Members have on this bill and the importance we place on \ngetting something done this year. We must do it. We will do it, and we \nwill work with our Republican colleagues to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly agree with the words our \nDemocratic leader has offered, and I congratulate him for mobilizing \nthis effort, but it is a mobilization not so much of Democrats as it is \nof Senators in general. Hospitals and patients and skilled nursing \nfacilities and home health agencies are not Republican or Democrat. The \nshortages, the closings, the health care denied is not Republican or \nDemocrat. It has to do with the people of our States and of our \ncountry.\n  This is a bipartisan matter. I know, without even having talked to \nbut five or six of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when \nthey went back to their homes during the August recess and when they \nhave been back since, this has been the subject with which we have all \nbeen, in a sense, lobbied in the best sense; that is, lobbied by our \nown constituents, by our own voters, by people who are patients, by \npeople who have had these problems.\n  It is right; we should be fixing this because Congress, in 1997, when \nwe passed the Balanced Budget Act, made changes that were larger in \nMedicare than any in the history of the program, and we made mistakes. \nThis is actually one of the reasons our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle often criticize congressional action because we are trying to \nplay doctor. We often try, but we often do not do it very well. In this \ncase, we did not. We made mistakes.\n  When we make a mistake, we are causing skilled working facilities, \nhome health agencies, and hospitals to close; we are putting in \njeopardy margins of profit, which have gone into the red already, of \nother hospitals, particularly rural hospitals. We have to correct it.\n  There is nothing more self-evident to me than the need for this \nCongress to take up the BBA corrections and, in fact, do them on a \nbipartisan basis. We do not have very much time. There\n\n[[Page S11770]]\n\nseems to be quite a lot of anxiousness to get out of here. That is not \nshared by the junior Senator from West Virginia. In that case, it puts \nmore pressure on us to do it. We need a date. We need to do this. This \nis not makeup stuff. These are real problems.\n  In my State of West Virginia, which is not large but our citizens are \nno less important than anybody else's, and to me they are more \nimportant, in the next 4 years our hospitals are going to face an \nalmost $600 million cut in payment because of mistakes we made in the \n1997 Budget Act. They did not make the mistakes. They have not been \nkeeping their books incorrectly. They have not been trying to be \ninefficient. We made the mistakes. We made the mistakes in Congress, \nand it is up to us to correct them.\n  Many critical public health services will be cut back. That has \nhappened already. It will continue to happen. Home care agencies in my \nState expect there will be almost 5,000 less Medicare patients being \nadmitted for their services than before.\n  Eleven home health care providers in West Virginia have closed. That \nis not a lot, but that is a lot in West Virginia, and it is in a lot of \nplaces. We have 55 counties and 1.8 million people. Eleven home health \nagencies is a lot; 2,500 on a nationwide basis are closed. They are not \nthinking about closing but have closed because of mistakes we in \nCongress have made in making these enormous changes to Medicare. They \nhave been forced to close down because the current payment system does \nnot adequately reimburse them for what they have to do.\n  CBO originally estimated home health reimbursement reductions would \nbe $16 billion. It turned out the reduction was $47 billion. That was \nnot the hospitals' fault; That was not the home health agencies' fault; \nthat was our fault. We made that mistake. We have to correct that \nmistake.\n  The $1,500 cap on therapy is having bad results on nursing home \npatients with Parkinson's disease, burns, and other things. We need to \ncorrect that because we made the mistakes.\n  I will end by saying, I agree on teaching hospitals. We have three \nteaching hospitals in West Virginia. Whatever happens in general \nhappens in a much worse way in rural States. That is by definition, \nthat is by nature, whether it is hospitals, nursing homes, or anything \nelse. That has always been the case.\n  Rural hospitals have very little to fall back on because they do not \nhave margins. They depend on Medicare more than those in larger and \nmore urban States. These were unintended cuts we made, but we \nnevertheless made them. The mistake is ours. It is a bipartisan \nmistake. It came along with a very good bill, the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. Within it, there was some cancer, and the cancer was caused by \nus, and it is the mistakes we made which are causing havoc all over the \nhealth care world. We can change it easily and change it before we \nleave here, and surely we should. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of Senator \nDaschle's bill to address the draconian cuts to Medicare under the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). I thank Senator Daschle for \nintroducing this important piece of legislation.\n  I support this bill for two reasons. First, I believe the BBA went \ntoo far when it cut reimbursements to Medicare. Second, as we move \ntowards the millennium and our senior population continues to grow, our \nseniors must be able to rely on a sound and secure Medicare Program. \nThis bill will help them do just that.\n  When I travel throughout the State of Maryland, the issue my \nconstituents want to talk about most is cuts in services for the \nelderly. I have worked long and hard to find solutions to these cuts. \nThat is why I cosponsored an amendment to the recent tax bill which \nplaced a priority on fixing Medicare before providing for a tax cut. \nThat is why I am working on a new and improved Older Americans Act, and \nthat is why I am cosponsoring Senator Daschle's legislation, which \nhelps providers who are struggling under BBA cuts to Medicare.\n  The BBA is one of the reasons why we have a projected budget surplus. \nIt put us on the right track of fiscal prudence, but it went too far in \nthe case of Medicare by imposing deep cuts on providers: It cut \nreimbursements to home health agencies; it cut reimbursements to \nnursing homes; it cut reimbursements to Medicare HMOs. Our seniors and \nour providers are now feeling the effects of these cuts.\n  What exactly do these cuts mean? In my State of Maryland, this means \nthat 34 Home Health Agencies have closed their doors and only two \npublic Home Health Agencies remain. This is a particular problem in \nrural counties in Maryland. Agencies in these areas are committed to \nproviding health care to those who cannot travel to hospitals or \ndoctors offices. In fact, they are so committed to providing home-bound \npatients with care, I know some health care providers who have traveled \nto homes by a snowmobile in winter months just to get to a patient. But \nbecause of substantial cuts in reimbursements under BBA, these agencies \nare left with no choice but to close their doors; families lose these \nservices, employees lose their jobs, and nobody wins.\n  Our Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) also need the relief provided \nby this legislation. The BBA changed the way that payments are \ncalculated so that facilities do not get paid more money when they \nprovide expensive services such as chemotherapy or prosthetics. In some \ncases, the reimbursement is so low, that facilities cannot afford to \ntake the patients who need a high level of care. I hear stories about \npatients who need chemotherapy treatment but cannot find a facility to \nprovide it. Why? The answer is because Medicare doesn't pay enough to \ncover the cost of the chemotherapy treatment. Where does this patient \ngo? They could go to a hospital, but frequently this is more expensive, \nor might not specialize in these services. Patients and their families \ndo not want to hear complex stories about payment methodologies, or \nresource utilization groups. What these families want to hear is that \ntheir loved ones can get the care that they need.\n  My State of Maryland has also had a devastating problem with Medicare \nHMOs. Because of payment changes, reimbursements to many HMOs were cut. \nWhat are the effects of these cuts? One HMO in my state is projecting \nlosses of over $5 million this year in the rural counties of Maryland \nalone. This HMO can no longer afford to cover Medicare patients so it \nis closing up shop. 14,000 senior citizens in Maryland will lose their \nMedicare HMO. Where do these seniors go? In the rural counties of \nMaryland, these seniors do not have any other Medicare HMO to choose. \nThey all left--not because they weren't making a profit--these HMOs \ncouldn't even break even. Rural counties throughout Maryland and the \nnation will have seniors with little or no access to the extra benefits \nmany HMOs provide, including prescription drug coverage and preventive \nbenefits such as dental, vision and hearing screenings.\n  Imagine if your 85-year-old grandmother, living on a fixed income, \ngot a letter in the mail that says in 4 months she will no longer have \na Medicare HMO. She might not understand what it means. Is she losing \nher health care coverage altogether? Is she losing her doctor? Is she \nlosing her medicine coverage? In many cases, my constituents aren't \nwondering where they should go for a mammogram or prostate screening, \nbut if they can even go at all because their HMO is leaving town.\n  Some will say these cuts aren't so bad--why can't you just buy a \nMedigap policy? For around $150 a month you could get some of the \nsupplemental benefits that HMOs provide. But many of these senior \ncitizens only have $11,000 or $12,000 a year in retirement income and \nmany times their income is much less. These seniors cannot afford $150 \na month for a Medigap policy, so many of them will be forced to make \ndifficult choices between food, rent, health care and prescription \nmedications. This legislation provides needed relief so that our \nseniors would not have to make these terrible decisions.\n  I also know that our non-profit health facilities are having a \nparticularly rough time. These are providers such as Hebrew Home in \nRockville, Maryland, or Mercy Hospital in Baltimore, who are struggling \nto provide care under current reimbursements. It is especially \ndifficult for these providers because the care they provide is\n\n[[Page S11771]]\n\nfrequently uncompensated. This is health care that they frequently do \nnot get reimbursed for, also known as charity care. In many cases, they \nprovide the health services to seniors who have no other place to go. \nIf we do not take steps to fairly reimburse them, where will these \nseniors go to get the care they need?\n  One of my priorities as a United States Senator has always been to \nhonor your mother and father. It is a good commandment and good public \npolicy--in the federal law books and checkbooks. We must address these \ncuts in Medicare because our safety net for seniors is badly frayed, \nand senior citizens are being left stranded because many health care \nproviders have no choice but to close their doors.\n  In 1965 when Medicare was created, the Federal Government promised \nthat Americans who work hard all of their lives can count on Medicare \nwhen they retire. I believe that promises made should be promises kept. \nSenator Daschle's bill will help us keep the promise we have made to \nthe Nation's senior citizens.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Medicare \nBeneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act introduced today that \nworks to correct the inequities of Medicare reforms included in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for his tremendous efforts on this issue \nand for his leadership with the introduction of this bill. As well, I \ncongratulate a number of my other colleagues who have contributed \nimmensely to the crafting of this critical piece of legislation, \nincluding Senators Moynihan, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Baucus, Conrad, and \nothers.\n  As part of the effort to balance the Federal budget, the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for major reforms in the way Medicare \npays for medical services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) \nincluded numerous cuts in Medicare payments to health care providers. \nThese changes were originally expected to cut Medicare spending by \nabout $115 over five years, but recent CBO projections show spending \nfalling nearly twice that much. In the face of these deep cuts, health \ncare providers are struggling, and beneficiary access to care is \nthreatened. The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act is a targeted \nsolution to certain specific problems that the Balanced Budget Act has \ncreated.\n  As implementation of these reforms proceeds, health care providers \nand patient advocacy groups have asserted that some of the reforms are \nhaving--or are likely to have--undesirable or unintended consequences. \nAreas in patient care such as rehabilitative therapy, skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health services, and hospital outpatient services have \nalready begun to feel the effects of the reforms set forth in 1997.\n  Not surprising, I have heard from many safety net providers in South \nDakota about the devastating effects such reductions in reimbursements \nare having throughout the health care industry. Consumers are also \nfeeling the pain, as many individuals are being turned away from \nhospitals and nursing homes who cannot afford to accept new patients \nbecause of the lower reimbursement rates included in the Balanced \nBudget Act. These cuts are devastating and feared to have severe \nimplications on the quality and access of health care throughout our \nnation, including South Dakota, unless Congress acts immediately to \ncorrect these problems. In South Dakota, and other rural parts of the \ncountry, hospitals and other health care providers have an extremely \nhigh percentage of Medicare beneficiaries making these cuts in \nreimbursement even more devastating. If Congress does not act in a \ntimely fashion many of these providers may be forced to close their \ndoors.\n  I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on passage of \nthe Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act which \ndevelops creative, cost-effective approaches to address the unintended, \nlong-term consequences of the BBA. The proposed budget surplus provides \nCongress the unique opportunity to address many of the deficiencies in \nour nation's health care system. We need to address the valid concerns \nof teaching hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health \nproviders, rural and community hospitals, and other health care \nproviders who require relief from the consequences of the BBA.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, we are all hearing from our constituents \nabout the hardships they have encountered from the unintended \nconsequences of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. From rural \nhospitals to home health care agencies, cuts in Medicare reimbursement \nhave forced these health care providers to absorb tremendous debt and \nhave threatened patients' access to care. Senator Daschle has proposed \nover 30 items that will provide immediate relief across the health care \ncontinuum. Among these provisions, the bill would redirect BBA surplus \nmonies to provide a cap on hospital outpatient Prospective Payment \nSystem (PPS) loss, a delay on the proposed 15 percent cut to home \nhealth care reimbursement, a fix for the graduate medical education \nresident cap and the indigent care problem, the repeal of nursing home \ntherapy caps, a technical correction to limit oscillations to Medicare \nphysician reimbursement, a delay of risk adjustment for frail elderly/\nEvercare. Senator Daschle is to be commended for developing this \ncomprehensive BBA relief bill in an incredibly short period of time. My \ncolleague has more than met the challenge of this urgent health care \ndilemma. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this critical \nremedial legislation for a BBA fix. I will support Senator Daschle with \nall my resources to pass a BBA fix this session.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the legislation offered earlier \nby the Senator from South Dakota, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to \nCare Act of 1999.\n  I supported strongly the balanced budget amendment of 1997, the \ndeficit reduction acts of 1993 and 1990, and am proud of the supporting \nrole I played over the last 7 or 8 years in taking the United States of \nAmerica to the point where the Federal Government was borrowing \nhundreds of billions of dollars--$300 billion when I came in 1989--to a \npoint where we now have a surplus. It is quite an exciting change in \nthe dynamics of this country.\n  This morning's New York Times had a story by Louis Uchitelle about \n1.1 million Americans having been lifted off the rolls of poverty as a \nconsequence of demands of wages that occur because interest rates are \nlow, corporate profits are good, and the American economy is as strong \nas it has been in my lifetime. It is quite impressive what a strong \neconomy will do with low interest rates and what increased rates in \nproductivity will do. The report also pointed out the significant \nproblems we still have with income growth, especially with African \nAmericans.\n  But I am proud of the role I played in eliminating the deficit and \ncreating a surplus that has contributed enormously to the growth of the \nU.S. economy. Certainly lots of action in the private sector \ncontributed to it, but Congress and those who were here--Republicans \nand Democrats--over the last 7 or 8 years who voted for these three \npieces of legislation can take some pride in taking the United States \nnot just into recovery economically, but I remember how frustrating the \ndeficit was--politically frustrating--that caused Americans to lose \nconfidence that Congress could get anything done. It seemed a \nrelatively small ``bone'' in a great nation and I am glad we finally \ncoughed it up. I don't want to backtrack on that.\n  That is why I am pleased Senator Daschle has indicated this bill has \nto be paid for. Not only do we have to be careful to not drain the \nSocial Security trust fund, but we have to be careful we not do this in \na fashion that takes America back to the bad old days of deficit \nfinancing. It is easy to do that.\n  The 1997 act had an impressive number of people in the Senate and the \nHouse voting for the legislation. The United States was to produce $100 \nmillion of savings in 10 years. It is now estimated it will produce \n$200 million in savings. I voted for $100 million. That is what I \nthought the legislation would produce. Not all of that $200 million \nestimate occurs as a consequence of the changes in reimbursement. Some \nhas occurred as a result of the vigorous effort by Secretary Shalala \nand HCFA to reduce fraud and, as a consequence, save taxpayer money. \nThey made billing changes that produced some savings. They are doing a \nbetter job of\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\nmanaging the taxpayers' money. Some of the savings has occurred as a \nconsequence.\n  There is no question there is a fraction of that excess $100 million \nthat has come as a result of our making some changes to take more out \nof the providers than anyone anticipated. This legislation will put $23 \nbillion back. I believe that is fair, reasonable, and defendable. I \nthink it will have a tremendously positive impact on the ability of my \nState of Nebraska to get high-quality health care; that is what is at \nstake. What is at stake is not just the health of health care \ninstitutions but the health of the citizens of the country who depend \nupon those institutions.\n  I believe this piece of legislation is needed. It is needed in \nNebraska and by citizens who depend upon their doctors, who depend upon \ntheir hospitals, who depend upon this thing we call the health care \nsystem in the United States of America. It is an issue of life and \ndeath for them. It is a very important issue. It is a very personal \nissue.\n  When we talk to somebody in a hospital, it is easy to acquire the \nright sense of urgency to overcome whatever ideological differences we \nmight have. The people of Nebraska need this Congress to act. It is not \njust something that we are being asked to do; it is something that is \nnecessary in order to improve the quality of life in our State.\n  I will go through some of the things this legislation does. For \nhospitals, the 1997 act cuts hospital payments in several ways: Lower \ninpatient payments; a new outpatient prospective payment system; a \nspecial payments cut for low-income patients: and cuts in graduate \nmedical education.\n  This legislation does not restore all of those cuts. It creates a 3-\nyear transition period to protect hospitals under this new outpatient \nsystem, and there is additional protection for rural and cancer \nhospitals. The bill also moderates the cut in DSH and GME payments, a \ncentral concern of teaching and academic centers. And it takes action \nfor pediatric hospitals.\n  I urge colleagues who have not studied this to examine the very low \nreimbursements for graduate medical education for pediatric hospitals. \nThere is a glaring difference and it will create tremendous problems as \nwe try to train pediatricians--a very important profession in the \nhealth care industry.\n  There are a number of changes that increase the quality of care in \nNebraska hospitals and increase the chances, especially in rural \nhospitals, that we will not see a continuation of what we had in 1998 \nwhen two rural hospitals closed. My hospital administrators tell me \nthere may be more of the same unless we make some reasonable \nadjustments.\n  The Balanced Budget Act made some changes in skilled nursing \nfacilities. We understand the need to balance the budget. This does not \nundo that. It is paid for. The Balanced Budget Act created a \nprospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities. This does \nnot adequately account for the costs of very sick patients and rare \nhigh-cost services. This bill attempts to address both of these \nproblems by increasing payments for groups of patients for whom payment \nis low and by paying separately for high-cost services, such as \nprosthetics, to ensure the nursing homes receive adequate payment.\n  We have heard about the impact of therapy caps. I hope in addition to \nputting some money back into the providers, we can take the advice of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and get some structural changes enacted in \nMedicare. One of the problems we have as a Congress trying to make \nchanges in Medicare is we don't know the full impact of changes.\n  Senators Breaux and Thomas were proposing the creation of a new \nSenate-confirmed board that has authority over HCFA to make certain \nHCFA has the authority to offer fee-for-service plans on a competitive \nbasis and make sure competitors have a level playing field to compete \nand offer their plans against the fee for service that HCFA has. I \nthink it would be easier to solve the problem of dealing with waste, \nfraud, and abuse and make it more likely the consumers receive good \ninformation when they are trying to make decisions about what to buy. \nConsolidating Part A and Part B was also in the proposal of Senator \nBreaux, and as a consequence of consolidating those two programs, it \nwould make it much more likely when dealing with medical procedures, \nsuch as therapy, that we get it right.\n  What we did with the Balanced Budget Act is create a 1,500-per-\nannual-beneficiary cap, but these are arbitrary. They don't allow any \nflexibility based upon the need of the patient. What we have done with \nthe legislation is repeal the caps until 2003 and require HCFA to \nimplement a new system for therapy payments that is budget neutral to \ncaps. It is designed to address the needs for varying amounts of \ntherapy based upon a patient's condition. That is the point I was \ntrying to make earlier, why we need structural changes, as well.\n  There are varying needs of the patient that are extremely difficult \nfor HCFA to address. It is a central system. They have fiscal \nintermediaries in the country making payments. It is still a centrally \ncontrolled system and awfully difficult to get it right in Ohio, \nNebraska, and Missouri simultaneously. They have to apply a system \nnationwide. It is better, in my judgment, if we have a board of \ndirectors, Senate-confirmed, to manage HCFA, moving in a direction \nwhere the private sector is able to compete for HCFA's fee for service \nsimultaneously, with HCFA offering its fee-for-service plans.\n  It makes changes in home health. We created under the BBA an interim \npayment system for home health agencies which limits payments on both a \nper beneficiary as well as a per visit basis. The temporary system \nlocked in very low rates. This affects rural areas more than urban \nareas. There are very low rates for areas that had traditionally low \ncosts such as Nebraska. We have low costs.\n\n  The IPS locked in those very low costs in October 2000, and the IPS \nis scheduled to be replaced by a new PPS system for home health \nservices. Those payments will be reduced in an arbitrary fashion by 15 \npercent. We make three changes in the legislation that are vital: \nFirst, we postpone this 15-percent cut for 2 years; second, we assist \nlow-cost agencies that have been disadvantaged under the IPS by \nincreasing the per visit limit; finally, the bill reduce administrative \nburdens placed upon the providers by eliminating interest on \noverpayments, eliminating a 15-minute reporting requirement, and \neliminating a requirement for home health agencies to do the billing \nfor durable medical equipment.\n  We make changes for physicians. The BBA created a new system for \nphysician payments based on a target rate of growth. The system \nincludes bonus payments and reductions intended to create incentives to \nmeet the target rate of growth. However, what we have done will cause \npayments to fluctuate widely, creating tremendous uncertainty in the \nphysician communities and causing physicians who are out there trying \nto manage a clinic or their business to say: We can't depend upon HCFA. \nWe can't depend upon a revenue stream. There is too much uncertainty in \nthe system. We may opt out as a consequence.\n  They are facing a very big challenge in dealing with HCFA's \nrepresentation that there may be fraud when, in fact, all that has \noccurred is there are a number of additional changes that will be very \nconstructive for physicians, for Medicare+Choice, for rural health \nclinics, federally qualified health centers, and for hospice care where \nwe have not had any rebasing of payments since 1982. It is a $1 \nbillion--an extremely important program.\n  Unfortunately, we do not pay a lot of attention to the problem we are \nfacing when individuals know for certain they are dying. Hospice \naddresses that. This is an important change, in my view, and I urge \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to say, whether it is with the \nDaschle bill, which I support, or a bill that comes out of the Finance \nCommittee, which I am apt to support as well: This is one of the things \nwe need to do. We need to get this done.\n  I hope we can at least get some minimal changes in Medicare as well, \nbut we need to address this.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 1999.'' I \nwant to commend the leadership in the development of this legislation \nand hope\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\nthat the Congress will act upon this now, before we adjourn.\n  The bill is designed to modify some of the many, unforseen \nconsequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Daily I receive \nletters and calls citing the negative impact of the Balanced Budget Act \non access to patient care and to the delivery of quality care in an \nongoing and coordinated fashion. In my State of New Mexico, the health \ncare delivery system has been particularly hard hit. Essentially, the \nsystem for delivery of health care that we have worked so hard to \nattain is being eroded and must be bolstered before patients face a \ncrisis.\n  I represent a state where 21 out of 33 counties are designated as \nhealth professional shortage areas. I represent a state that has seen \nan exodus of physician specialists and rural doctors this past year. \nOver the last year, New Mexico had 70 home care agencies close despite \nyeoman's efforts to keep these agencies open and serving our citizens. \nThis represents closure of over 40 percent of our home health care \nagencies. We currently have one county, Catron, that has no home care \nentity available for serving patients. Failure to deal with the \nadditional 15-percent cut that is slated to go into effect in October \nof 2000 would be the end of numerous other home health agencies \nthroughout my state. It would be inexcusable not to address this issue \nthis session.\n  Additionally, the system is further under stress in the nursing home \narena. We have seen one nationally based entity declare bankruptcy and \nface the demise of others. Long term care facilities must be reimbursed \nat a level that reflects the acuity of the residents for whom they \ncare. Long term care is key not only for the residents but for their \nfamilies near and far.\n  Mr. President, several of my colleagues have addressed the issue of \nGME and the plight of our teaching hospitals. Hospitals have a \nmultitude of services that they provide and which we should bolster. I \nmust note, for example, that in New Mexico, declining Medicare \nreimbursement is forcing the only acute care hospital in Dona Anna \nCounty to close a 15 bed skilled nursing unit because of mounting \nfinancial losses. Realities such as this must make us mindful of the \nfar reaching and adverse effects the BBA of 1997 is now having on \ncommunities and their residents. We want to ensure that no other \nfacilities face closure.\n  Finally, I must add that rural and frontier clinics are critical \ncomponents to care for seniors and others in the community with limited \nresources and serve to allow for timely, geographic access where there \notherwise would be no health care available. I am pleased that some \nredress of their needs is provided in this legislation.\n  Others have outlined the components of this legislation and I will \nnot repeat the specifics. It is sufficient to say, that these changes \nare needed to avert a crisis in the health care delivery system of this \ncountry, to maintain access to quality care for our seniors and to \nrectify problems for the system that were created inadvertently. We \nmust act now to provide for easy access to quality, continued health \ncare for our citizens.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues here in the \nSenate to see that this legislation is passed prior to adjournment.\n  Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my Democratic \ncolleagues in introducing this important legislation. In the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, we reformed the Medicare program to extend its \nsolvency. In the past year, we have seen the dramatic and negative \nimpact of those reforms on patients and health care providers. The bill \nwe are introducing today will fix those unintended consequences and \nwill ensure that millions of seniors have access to high quality health \ncare. I urge the Republican leadership to act on it before we adjourn \nfor the year.\n  Two years ago, the Medicare Program was in serious trouble--facing \nbankruptcy within 5 years. We had to make substantial changes to the \nprogram to extend its solvency. It was a painful and difficult process, \nbut we made changes intended to slow the growth of Medicare \nexpenditures.\n  And overall, it worked. Medicare is still functioning and is on a \nmore sound financial footing.\n  But the revisions we implemented went too far. Let me give you an \nexample. Based on the estimates we had at the time, our changes were \nsupposed to reduce the overall growth in Medicare expenditures by $100 \nbillion over 10 years. In reality, the changes we enacted will result \nin more than $200 billion in lost Medicare revenue for health care \nproviders over the same period. This was not the order of change I \nsupported.\n  And today we see that those revisions are hurting our health care \nproviders and making it more difficult for them to give patients the \nhigh quality care they need.\n  When I meet with health care providers in my state, this is their top \nconcern. Each day we delay making these corrections, we make it harder \nfor them to ensure that quality health care is available to millions of \nseniors.\n  I have heard from hundreds of hospital administrators, home health \ncare workers, doctors, rehabilitation therapists, teaching hospitals, \nskilled nursing facilities, and hospice providers. For example, I've \nreceived letters from Providence General Medical Center in Everett, \nWashington, from hospital caregivers at Prosser Memorial Hospital, from \nthe University of Washington's School of Medicine and from hundreds of \nothers. They have shared with me the impact of the 1997 changes and \nwhat it means for patient care. I believe the situation is critical.\n  If we fail to correct this, we will see hospitals closing. We will \nsee home health agencies turning away patients. We will see skilled \nnursing facilities unable to take complex patients. We will see a \ndevastated rural health system. Our health care system is in jeopardy.\n  The bill we are introducing today will go a long way toward \ncorrecting some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997. I worked with my Democratic colleagues in drafting what I \nbelieve is a reasonable bill that provides immediate relief to \nhospitals, home health care agencies, skilled nursing facilities and \nhospice care to ensure that seniors in this country have access to \nquality, affordable health care services. The bill we have put forth is \nmodest. It is not a cure-all, but it addresses the most pressing \nchallenges. This is not about repealing the fiscal discipline imposed \nin BBA97. This is about adjusting the changes we made to reflect the \ncurrent estimates. Our bill fixes the problems and provides legislative \nremedies. It does not jeopardize the solvency of Medicare. We can and \nshould make changes to improve access and ensure access without \njeopardizing solvency.\n\n  There is still much we have to address from quality care to \naffordable health insurance to prescription drugs. However, if the \nhospitals close or seniors are denied quality care, the ability to pay \nis not an issue. The very foundation of our health care system is at \nstake. This legislation is long overdue. We need to pass it and make \nthe Medicare Program function better today.\n  Mr President, at the same time, we cannot forget that the entire \nMedicare Program will run out of money in 2015. So, I want to remind my \ncolleagues there is still much work to be done to ensure Medicare \nremains a stable program that our children will be able to count on for \ntheir health care.\n  Mr. President, from my point of view, this Congress has failed on too \nmany vital issues this year. This Congress failed to pass a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights--that would put patients and doctors, not \ninsurance companies, in charge of their medical decisions. Earlier this \nweek, this Senate failed our children, by cutting our commitment to \nputting 100,000 teachers in the classroom to reduce the size of our \novercrowded classrooms. This Congress failed to help our farmers, and \nall those facing too many challenges in rural America. Let me just say, \nthat I am not giving up or letting up on any of those fights--because \nthey are too important. And let's not forget that this Congress even \nfailed to do one of its most basic work--passing our appropriations \nbill on time, with real numbers--not gimmicks.\n  Mr. President, it is high time we bring some good news back to our \nconstituents. I want my hospitals and health care providers, as well as \nthe senior citizens in Washington State, to know I have heard their \nconcerns and I recognize the dangerous implications of BBA97 on health \ncare. It is high time\n\n[[Page S11774]]\n\nwe show them we see the problems facing Medicare, we understand them, \nand we are acting to fix them. It is high time we move on our \npriorities. This is one of them. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to voice my support for a \nbill which addresses the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997. I am pleased to join my Democratic colleagues as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Medicare Beneficiaries Access to Care Act.\n  Since I've been in the Senate, one of the greatest concerns of \nArkansans is the lowered Medicare reimbursement rate for a variety of \nservices that resulted from the Balanced Budget Act. Yes, we must \ncontinue to rid our Medicare system of waste, fraud and abuse. That is \na high priority for our government and it should remain so. However, \nwhen Medicare changes were made as part of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, Members of Congress did not intend to wreak havoc on the health \ncare industry.\n  Enough time has elapsed to know the unintended consequences of the \nBalanced Budget Act. Hospitals have lost tremendous amounts of money \ndue to changes in the outpatient prospective payment system. Many \nhospitals in my state are on the brink of closing due to the tremendous \nfinancial losses they have suffered. Nursing homes have not been \nreimbursed by Medicare at rates that cover the cost of patients with \nacute care needs. Payments for physical and rehabilitation therapy have \nbeen arbitrarily capped. Teaching hospitals have lost funding to \nsupport their training programs. Home health agencies have been forced \nto absorb huge losses and limit services to the elderly. Rural health \nclinics have been forced to cope with even more losses and operate on a \nshoestring budget.\n  Not only do these cuts and changes in Medicare reimbursement wreak \nhavoc on the health care community and force them to absorb unfair \nfinancial losses, but Medicare beneficiaries, the very people that \nMedicare was set up to help, lose access to critical services. We \ncannot allow our parents and grandparents to be denied access to \ncoverage or receive limited medicare care because we didn't take action \nto correct the devastating cuts of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  As a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus and a member of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging, I care deeply about the quality of \nhealth care and our citizens' access to health care. Over the past few \nmonths I have cosponsored various pieces of legislation which address \nall of the above-mentioned issues and the need to restore Medicare \ncuts. However, this legislation is ``all encompassing'' and if passed, \nwould ensure that hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, physical \ntherapy clinics, home health agencies, rural health clinics, and \nhospice programs receive important financial relief.\n  Above all, this legislation is about priorities. Ensuring the health \nand well-being of our Nation's seniors and most vulnerable citizens \nshould be our highest priority. I thank my colleagues for their hard \nwork on this proposal and I look forward to the quick passage of this \nlegislation so we can deliver relief to our health care communities and \nlet them know how much we value their services.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Daschle, \nKennedy, Rockefeller and others to introduce the Medicare Beneficiary \nAccess to Care Act of 1999.\n  In July, during consideration of tax relief legislation, I offered an \namendment on the floor of the Senate to carve out $20 billion from the \ntax bill and devote it towards relief for Medicare providers from the \nunintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act. Although the \namendment received the support of 50 Senators, including seven of my \nRepublican colleagues, it did not gather the necessary three-fifths \nmajority required for passage. Today's legislation, a $20 billion \npackage of specific measures to address the shortcomings of the \nBalanced Budget Act, represents the embodiment of our continued \ncommitment to ensure that this relief is enacted before the end of the \ncongressional session.\n  Mr. President, I cannot fully express the urgency of this matter. \nHere in Washington, we often throw around numbers with little \nrealization of the real impact on America's communities. In this \ninstance, I assure you, the impact is real. Take the town of Quincy, \nMassachusetts, population 88,000, and the birthplace of former \npresidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. As we introduce this bill, \nthe community hospital in Quincy, Massachusetts stands at the edge of \nclosure. Jeffrey Doran, the hospital's CEO, has been working overtime \nto ensure that if the hospital closes, patients will be safely \ntransferred to health care providers outside the community. Over the \npast several weeks, I have been on the phone multiple times with our \nState leaders asking them to step in and provide the needed relief \nwhere the Federal Government has failed. Failed, Mr. President, because \nthe Medicare cuts enacted in 1997 have gone above and beyond what we \nintended or desired. The budget savings have exceeded the levels we \nenvisioned at the time of enactment.\n  Alternatively, Mr. President, let's take a look at the home health \ncare industry. Home health care providers deliver rehabilitative \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries in the safety and comfort of their \nhome. In the State of Massachusetts, just since passage of the Balanced \nBudget Act, we have witnessed the closure of 20 home health care \nagencies who are no longer able to cover their costs as a result of \ncuts in Medicare payment reimbursements. The same is true with our \nnursing homes and extended care facilities.\n  And just to provide some perspective, the cost of the legislation we \nintroduce today amounts to less than three percent of the cost of the \ntax bill President Clinton vetoed last month. The cost of the entire \nbill is less than one provision in the tax bill to subsidize the \ninterest expenses of American multinational corporations operating \noverseas. In fact, we could have passed this bill, repealed the \ninterest expense provision, and saved American taxpayers an additional \n$4 billion.\n  What a sad reflection on our state of affairs when the Senate would \napprove a tax provision to expand eligibility for Roth IRAs for people \nmaking over $100,000 a year, a provision that would cost over $6 \nbillion, but has yet to address the dire needs of our teaching \nhospitals. A full legislative remedy for the Medicare payment problems \nfacing teaching hospitals would cost $5.7 billion.\n  Mr. President, the time will come for this debate, and the time will \ncome before we adjourn. The bipartisan support exists. Let's keep the \ndoors of our teaching and community hospitals, nursing homes, home \nhealth care agencies, and rural clinics open. Let's accept \nresponsibility for the unintended effects of our previous legislation. \nLet's not wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11774-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11774-S11780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n\n     PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n     excluding the surpluses generated by the social security \n     trust funds; and\n       (2) social security surpluses should only be used for \n     social security reform or to reduce the debt held by the \n     public and should not be spent on other programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 \n     appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget deficit \n     (excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security \n     trust funds) by adopting an across-the-board reduction in all \n     discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such \n     deficit if necessary.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the modification of the amendment is very \nminor and technical. I will tell you what it is:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Congress should \n     ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do \n     not result in an on-budget deficit (excluding the surpluses \n     generated by Social Security trust funds) by adopting an \n     across-the-board reduction in all discretionary \n     appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit. . . .\n\n  The original amendment I filed said it is the sense of the Senate \nthat conferees would make sure they did not dip into Social Security \nfunds. Now I am saying the Congress should make sure we do not dip into \nthe Social Security funds and, if necessary, that we have across-the-\nboard reductions in spending to make sure we do not touch Social \nSecurity funds.\n  I have stated--and I think all of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle have done so as well--that we do not want to touch Social \nSecurity, we absolutely do not want to touch the Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  We are going to have a surplus next year and it is in large part, if \nnot totally, because of the Social Security surplus. Many have drawn \nthe line and said: We are not going to touch that. Maybe because of \nemergencies we will spend the non-social security surplus. Those funds \nmay well be spent--as a result of the hurricane, agricultural \ndisasters, the events in Kosovo or East Timor, or whatever. There may \nbe some emergencies that that $14 billion is going to be spent on, but \nabsolutely not a dime more.\n  As we total all of these appropriations bills--the numbers are \ngrowing, or at least some people are trying to make them grow. I am \nsaying that no matter what we do, at the end of this process, we will \nhave across-the-board cuts if they are necessary. Hopefully, we won't \nhave to. If we do our jobs, we will not need to have across-the-board \ncuts.\n  Senator Stevens, the Appropriations chairman, said we are not going \nto need the cut because he is going to make sure we come in below the \namounts necessary. He said that he will make sure outlays do not exceed \nthe level that would intrude upon or have us spend Social Security \ntrust funds. I respect that and I agree with it. But just in case I am \nsaying--let's go on record; let's make sure that, if necessary we will \nhave across-the-board cuts.\n  What are we talking about? I have added up all the bills. Just for \nthe information of colleagues, I have added up all the bills including \nthe Labor-HHS bill we have before us. If you add them all up, we are \nabout $5 billion into the Social Security surplus right now. According \nto the calculations I am using, the same ones I believe CBO and OMB are \nusing, we are about $5 billion over. That is about $5 billion out of \n$500 billion on discretionary spending. It equals about 1 percent.\n  I hope we can avoid an across-the-board cut. I do not think it is the \nbest way to govern because we should be making reductions throughout \nthe process. But, it may be necessary if we can not accomplish the FY \n2000 appropriations without dipping into Social Security.\n  Incidentally, in the bill we have before us, I see we have about a $2 \nbillion increase in NIH, about $1.7 billion more than the President's \nrequest; we have $2.3 billion more in education spending; we have $500 \nmillion in administrative expenses in the Department of Labor, and \nmuch, much more. There is a lot of squeezing we could do. Even if we \nwent to the President's numbers on a few items, we could save $3.5 \nbillion or $4 billion.\n  So I hope an across-the-board cut will not be necessary. But I think \nit is important we do whatever is necessary to make sure we do not raid \nthe Social Security trust fund. A lot of us agree with that \nrhetorically, but we should make sure that each and every one of us \nmean it.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues saying: Well, we need to make some \nfixes in various areas such as Medicare, to correct some of the \nmistakes made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I will just say that \nthere are many on this side of the aisle who are willing to make some \nadjustments in Medicare. We understand that some of the assumptions and \nsome of the guesstimates were inaccurate and fell disproportionately on \nsome different areas. So we are willing to make some adjustments.\n  Medicare is an important issue and I am very disappointed that the \nadministration would not work with and support the Bipartisan \nCommission on Medicare, to make significant, real reforms that would \nhelp save Medicare long term. The idea that the administration is going \nto save Medicare by putting an IOU into the Medicare fund, is baloney. \nIt is false, it is misleading, it is deceptive, and it does not do \nanything to save Medicare.\n  My colleagues have just talked about introducing a proposal that will \ngreatly increase Medicare spending. We are willing to make some \nadjustments. I do not use the word ``fix'' because you are not going to \nfix it with a few Band-Aids.\n\n  A lot of us are somewhat knowledgeable on the issue, and we are \nwilling to take the bipartisan efforts of the Breaux Commission and put \ntogether some positive solutions to help save Medicare for several \nyears. Maybe we can only do a Band-Aid this Congress.\n  Frankly, I think we could and should do more. Certainly this Senator, \nand others on this side of the aisle are willing to work toward that. \nIt is the administration that has been unwilling to dedicate itself to \nsaving Medicare and as a result they have withdrawn their support of \nthe Medicare proposal that was chaired by Chairman Breaux and \nCongressman Thomas.\n  Regardless, I hope we can lay aside the partisan guns and ask \nourselves what we need to do to fix the system? I know Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska worked on that commission and did some outstanding work. \nFrankly, I think there are many of us who want to help fix and save \nSocial Security, not just apply a few Band-Aids to alleviate a few of \nthe problems. We are willing to try to work to help fix the entire \nsystem.\n  In working on these various appropriations it has become apparent \nthat there is no limit to the appetite of some members of this body to \nspend money. Democrats yesterday offered about $3 billion of additional \nspending on the Labor-HHS bill that is already growing by tremendous \namounts. Chairman Specter has already come out with an amount that was \n$2.3 billion over last year. Obviously, no matter what is reported out \nof committee, it is not enough, so we have to have billions more.\n  I think the appropriations process is getting a little faulty when we \nstart appropriating so many years in advance. I do not quite subscribe \nto some of the games that are being played. And how much money can we \nmove forward? We are seeing this happen time and time again.\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\n  Incidentally, the administration's budget had $19 billion in forward \nfunding. And now, evidently, the process will come out closer to $19 \nbillion or $20 billion, but that is still not enough.\n  I know the Medicare fixes are going to cost money. My point is, I \nalready said, before we have the add-ons, we are $5 billion into the \nSocial Security trust funds. We are going to have to make those \nadjustments in the conferences in the next couple weeks. It is going to \nhave to happen. It is going to have to happen by people working \ntogether. If, for some reason, these conferences come out and exceed \nthe amount and raid Social Security, we should have across-the-board \nreductions to stop it, to make sure we do not raid Social Security.\n  Maybe with the momentum for popular programs and we can't say no--if \nwe do not have the collective will to say we are going to vote down and \nvote no on some of these appropriations bills, then let's set up a \nmechanism to say the bottom line is, if these amounts are so large that \nthey actually raid Social Security, we are going to have to say no by \nhaving across-the-board reductions.\n  I hope that is not necessary. I do not expect it to be necessary. I \nthink when it is all said and done, and the budgeteers finally start \nscrubbing these numbers--the CBO and Budget Committee--Democrats as \nwell as Republicans will say: Wait a minute, let's limit the appetite \nof growth in spending and make sure we do not raid Social Security. \nThat is the purpose of this amendment. It is a sense of the Senate.\n  Frankly, I was considering budget language that would implement it. \nSenator Stevens has pointed out he will make a budget point of order \nthat it is legislation on appropriations. But at some point we are \ngoing to have to get serious and say we are not going to touch Social \nSecurity.\n  At this point, I offer this sense of the Senate. I hope 100 Members \nof the Senate will support it. I am hopeful we will not need it, but we \nwill have it if necessary to make sure--absolutely sure--that we do not \ntouch the Social Security trust funds in our spending programs. Let's \nmake absolutely positive that does not happen for the fiscal years 2000 \nand 2001 or for the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened, with interest, to the comments \nmade by my colleague from Oklahoma. I read his amendment. All I can say \nis I will use a term that is very popular out in the Midwest: It is \nlike closing the barn door after you let the horse out.\n  I would have to ask my friend from Oklahoma--he's part of the \nRepublican leadership--I wonder if he has talked to himself lately.\n  I wonder if he has talked to the other Republican leaders.\n  This is a great sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but the fact is, the \nRepublican leadership has already dipped into Social Security. Don't \ntake my word for it; take CBO's word for it. They have already dipped \ninto it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me finish a couple of things, and then I will. We \nwill get into a dialogue on this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want the Senator to be factual.\n  Mr. HARKIN. ``GOP Spending Bills Tap Social Security Surplus, CBO \nCites Planned Use of $18 Billion.'' This was in the paper yesterday:\n\n       On the same day House Republicans launched a new attack \n     charging Democrats with ``raiding'' Social Security to fund \n     spending programs, congressional analysts revealed that the \n     GOP's own spending plan for next year would siphon at least \n     $18 billion of surplus funds generated by the retirement \n     program.\n       Yesterday's report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \n     Office seemed to undermine a concerted GOP effort to blame \n     President Clinton for excessive spending and gain the high \n     ground in the high-stakes political battle over Social \n     Security.\n\n  There it is. They already have dipped into Social Security. We have \nalready used up the non-Social Security budget of $14 billion, \naccording to CBO. Actually, it was by $19 billion, but that included \nabout $5 billion that was in the tax scheme they came up with, which \nthe President vetoed. So we get that back. We are about another $15 \nbillion into Social Security already.\n  Again, this is a great sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The fact is, \nthough, the President sent a budget this year that was balanced, that \nmet all our needs. I might have wanted to add a few things here and \njiggle a few things there, but there were some penalties on tobacco \ncompanies in that budget. But, no, the Republicans, they don't want to \npenalize the tobacco companies, oh, no. Hands off the tobacco \ncompanies. We can't penalize them. But what we can penalize are the \nelderly on Social Security. They can pad the budget on the Pentagon. \nThey added more to the Pentagon budget than what the Department of \nDefense even asked for. We have been playing all these shell games all \nyear, moving money around.\n  Well, we have a plan, and we have had a plan, to be able to balance \nthe budget, fund these programs by not dipping into Social Security but \nby penalizing the tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking.\n  It seems to me we could beef up our efforts to reduce Medicare waste \nand abuse. There is $13 billion right there, by the latest estimates. \nHow about legislation that would save money by reducing student loan \ndefaults and cutting excessive administration fees that we pay to banks \nfor student loans? How about reducing some corporate welfare? How about \nclosing some special interest tax loopholes?\n  No, no, the GOP, the Republicans don't want to do that. They want to \ncut education and health care. Oh, yes, and the earned income tax \ncredit; that is their latest scheme. I see in the paper this morning \nthat their frontrunner for the Presidency, Governor Bush of Texas, \ncouldn't even swallow that one. He said: What are the House Republicans \ndoing? He said: I am against balancing the budget on the backs of the \npoor. Obviously, House Republicans want to do that; evidently, a few \nRepublicans over here, too, want to use the earned income tax credit to \npay for their schemes and for the faulty budgeting they have done.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I may come up with a second degree. \nI guess he has already second degreed it. We can second degree it \nagain. We will have a vote on that. I think we need a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that we send the Republican leadership back for \nremedial math so they can add things up a little bit better.\n  I yield to my friend from Oklahoma, having said that; I yield for a \nquestion anyway.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me make a couple of comments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator want me to finish and yield the floor?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator doesn't mind.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, don't take my word for it. Read the \nCBO's letter, dated August 26, almost a month ago. Things haven't \ngotten any better. You can read it in the newspapers. You can add it \nall up for yourselves.\n  This is what they have done, all these schemes. Now they are going to \ndesignate the census as an emergency. Thomas Jefferson could have told \nyou there was going to be a census in the year 2000, but they think it \nis an emergency.\n  I said they want to delay the tax cut for low-income Americans, the \none program that helps get people from welfare into work, the earned \nincome tax credit. They want to cut that down to pay for their schemes \nand their tax cuts for the wealthy. They are using two sets of books--\nCBO books, OMB books, one or the other, whichever make it look good on \nany one day or the other. They want to spread one year's funding over 3 \nfiscal years. They propose to defer approximately $3 billion in \ntemporary assistance for needy families, TANF block grants, from fiscal \nyear 2000 to 2001.\n  The schemes go on and on and on, all because, it seems to me, the \nRepublicans looked at the Clinton budget that was sent down this year, \nwhich was balanced, which moved us ahead in the areas of education and \nhealth, which moved this country forward but had some penalties on \ntobacco companies and some offsets, as we call it around here, which \nmeans we pay for some of this by penalties on the tobacco companies. It \nis obvious to me the Republicans said, no, we can't touch the tobacco \ncompanies.\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\n  All year we have been having this jiggling going back and forth and \nback and forth about where they are going to come up with the money to \nfund the extra $4 billion that they put onto the Pentagon. Where are we \ngoing to come up with the extra money to pay for their tax breaks for \nthe wealthy? So on and on, we get these schemes; they keep bouncing \naround.\n  Now we are told that defense, I guess, is going to be an emergency. \nThat is the latest scheme. The defense bill is now going to be an \nemergency bill, but there is no emergency out there.\n  As I said, you can have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which says \nwe should adopt an across-the-board reduction if we don't have a \nbalanced budget. But quite frankly, why don't we have some penalties on \nthe tobacco companies? Rather than cutting health care for the elderly, \nrather than cutting education for our kids, which his sense of the \nSenate would do, why don't we have some penalties on the tobacco \ncompanies for their failure to reduce teen smoking? CBO told us that \nwould raise, if I am not mistaken, about $6 billion. There is $6 \nbillion we could get right there for teen smoking.\n  That is where we are. I find it odd, kind of amusing, kind of \nbemusing, I guess, that the Senator from Oklahoma, one of the leaders \non the Republican side, would offer this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. As I said, they have already dipped into Social Security. \nNow he wants to close the barn door.\n  All I can say is, too little and too late. I think the Senator from \nOklahoma needs to have some remedial math.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the article from which \nI quoted.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 30, 1999]\n\n GOP Spending Bills Tap Social Security Surplus--CBO Cites Planned Use \n                             of $18 Billion\n\n                  (By Eric Pianin and Juliet Eilperin)\n\n       On the same day House Republicans launched a new attack \n     charging Democrats with ``raiding'' Social Security to fund \n     spending programs, congressional analysts revealed that the \n     GOP's own spending plan for next year would siphon at least \n     $18 billion of surplus funds generated by the retirement \n     program.\n       Yesterday's report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \n     Office seemed to undermine a concerted GOP effort to blame \n     President Clinton for excessive spending and gain the high \n     ground in the high-stakes political battle over Social \n     Security. Indeed, only hours before the report was released, \n     House GOP leaders unveiled a national advertising campaign \n     vowing to ``draw a line in the sand'' in opposing Democratic \n     spending initiatives that they said would eat into the Social \n     Security surplus.\n       But in a new analysis, CBO Director Dan L. Crippen shows \n     that lawmakers writing the spending bills that would fund \n     government next year have already used up billions of dollars \n     of funding beyond what they were supposed to spend under \n     existing budget restrictions.\n       As a result, he shows, lawmakers will have to dip into the \n     projected government surplus next year of $167 billion to \n     fund programs at the level they are targeting. Because almost \n     all of that surplus will be created by extra money rolling \n     into the Social Security program, Crippen suggests that as \n     much as $18 billion will have to be drawn from the retirement \n     program.\n       This is up from an August CBO estimate that showed Congress \n     on the way to spending $16 billion of the Social Security \n     surplus, but it does not include the extra spending lawmakers \n     are likely to approve for hurricane and earthquake relief, \n     restoring cuts in Medicare and other needs that could drive \n     the number even higher.\n       The country has more than enough surplus funds to \n     accommodate the new spending plans under consideration on \n     Capitol Hill, but the CBO numbers are likely to sharpen the \n     intensifying political debate over Social Security. Although \n     the government has routinely tapped Social Security to \n     fund other agencies in years past, both parties have \n     elevated protection of the retirement program to the \n     highest priority this year.\n       ``What the Republicans are protesting in their ad campaign \n     they already are guilty of themselves, and have been for two \n     months now,'' said Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (S.C.), the \n     Ranking House Budget Committee Democrat who requested the CBO \n     study. ``They're . . . invading the Social Security surplus, \n     and these are conservative numbers.''\n       But one GOP lawmaker said the CBO numbers are premature \n     because Congress has yet to complete work on all the 13 \n     spending bills, implying that the numbers could change. ``To \n     somehow suggest that CBO says the funding level is going to \n     be this or that for fiscal year 2000 is completely \n     hypothetical,'' said Rep. John E. Sununu (R-N.H.), a member \n     of the Budget Committee.\n       GOP lawmakers remained defiant yesterday. ``Under no \n     circumstance will I vote to spend one penny of the Social \n     Security surplus for anything but Social Security,'' House \n     Majority Whip Tom DeLay (Tex.) said during a media event \n     dubbed ``Stop the Raid.''\n       Although Clinton and congressional leaders have agreed to a \n     three-week extension of Friday's budget deadline in an effort \n     to iron out their differences over sensitive spending issues, \n     the two sides still appear to be far apart on numerous \n     issues. If anything, the GOP may be forced to accept even \n     more spending--and to dip further into Social Security--to \n     accommodate Clinton.\n       By far the biggest fight is likely to be over the huge \n     labor, health and education spending bill, which trims or \n     guts many of Clinton's education initiatives, including his \n     call for the hiring of 100,000 new teachers. The Senate began \n     debating its version of the bill yesterday and voted 54 to 44 \n     to kill an effort by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to restore \n     funding for the hiring of more teachers. Instead, senators \n     approved a plan providing $1.2 billion that states could use \n     for hiring teachers or other education goals.\n       The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to vote \n     today on what the administration considers a far more \n     draconian version of the bill, and there is certain to be a \n     major dustup not only on funding levels but also on how \n     Republicans intend to pay for the additional spending in the \n     bill.\n       In an effort to keep from drawing on Social Security, House \n     Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) outlined a plan to delay \n     the earned income tax credits to the working poor to save \n     $8.7 billion from the bill next year.\n       Republicans defended the measure, saying that it would \n     encourage better monthly planning by the beneficiaries. But \n     critics said it would create undue hardship on people \n     struggling to stay off welfare, and senators are balking at \n     the idea.\n       Hastert has been under pressure from some of his House \n     colleagues not to make significant concessions to the White \n     House, but criticism seemed to recede after the speaker \n     delivered an unequivocal declaration yesterday that \n     Republicans would safeguard the Social Security surplus.\n       Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff John D. Podesta, who \n     addressed Democratic lawmakers yesterday morning, called the \n     GOP's spending approach ``crazy'' and said ``the budget \n     process is headed toward chaos.''\n       Overall, Congress made little progress in completing work \n     on the overdue spending bills. Faced with opposition from \n     both Democrats and antiabortion Republicans, House leaders \n     were forced to postpone a vote yesterday on the foreign \n     operations spending bill.\n       The agriculture budget bill was also held up, a GOP leaders \n     scrambled to line up enough signatures to force it out of a \n     contentious conference committee. Yesterday, Democrats as \n     well as several Republicans accused the GOP leadership of \n     shutting down the committee in order to kill a provision \n     lifting trade sanctions on Cuba.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I tell my colleague from Illinois, I will be very brief, \na couple comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Gregg and Gramm as original \nsponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Very briefly, we don't have to debate all the budget \nassumptions.\n  My colleague pointed out a lot of things he has read in the paper \nthat different people have tried. The earned income tax credit, \nfrankly, needs to be reformed. About 24 percent of that program is \nwaste and fraud. It needs to be reformed, but we are not going to do \nit. I am probably the biggest proponent of reforming the program, but I \nhave already said it shouldn't be done in this bill and it will not be \ndone in this bill. It is not in the Senate bill. You haven't seen it; \nyou are not going to see it in the conference report. At least that is \nmy intention.\n  The Senator mentioned a few other things. My point is, we don't have \nto play games. He mentioned tax cuts. We don't have a tax cut in this \nbill.\n  When it is all said and done, let's not raid Social Security. The \nSenator said we are going to have to cut education. We have more money \nin the bill that is pending than the President requested for education. \nEven if we had an across-the-board cut to make sure we didn't touch \nSocial Security, we would still have more than the President requested. \nThere is $500 million more than the President requested in this bill \nfor education, and if we had an across-the-board cut, it still comes \nout. There would still be more money than the President requested, and \nalmost $2 billion more than last year. My colleague said: Hey, the \nhorse is out of the\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\nbarn. Well, it is not out of the barn. We have a lot of horses in the \nbarn. Big horses are still there, such as the Defense bill, Labor-HHS. \nThose are two bills that are expensive. Most of the other bills are \ncoming in at last year's level, maybe a little less. There are big \nincreases in Labor-HHS and in the Department of Defense. Those are not \nout yet. Defense is close to being finished.\n\n  If Defense and Labor-HHS, Commerce-State-Justice, and HUD, come in \ntoo high--we do not know yet because they haven't been reported out, \nbut if they raid Social Security, let's cut everything across the \nboard. That is what this says. I hope they don't. I absolutely believe \nif I had my say-so, they would not. But I am just one person.\n  I think if the conferees show some restraint, and if we show some \nrestraint on Labor-HHS, on the Department of Defense, and on the \nremaining bills, we don't have to touch Social Security, not one dime. \nBut if, for some reason, we are not able do it, with the Agriculture \nbill for instance, the Agriculture bill emergency funding, as \ndesignated has blown from $6 billion to $8.7 billion; it grows by $1 \nbillion every few days. I question that. I may vote against it. I think \nit has grown too much.\n  I have a lot of farmers in my State who are going to be quite upset \nwhen I vote against it, but I may well because I think it is getting \nridiculous how much we are spending. Even if we do, that will be \nclassified as an emergency; but I don't care if it is called emergency \nor regular outlays. If it starts dipping into Social Security, this \nresolution says let's cut all spending enough to make sure we don't. \nAre we going to draw the line and stop at a certain level or not?\n  Let me make one other comment because we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion on Medicare. President Clinton's budget proposal proposed to \nfreeze hospital payments. How many of us have had hospitals coming up \nhere and saying: You have cut too much? The President's proposal was to \ncut it more. Nobody has talked about that. My colleague says President \nClinton's budget was balanced. It was not. The President's budget, \naccording to CBO, still raids Social Security by $7 billion in 2000. I \nam saying, no, let's not let Congress do it, or the President; let's \nnot do it. But if we have to, let's have an across-the-board cut and \ncut everybody a little bit.\n  Right now, the projections are that maybe it would take 1 percent if \nwe don't show a little restraint. We can show a little restraint. We \ncan save a measly $5 billion out of $500 billion of appropriations that \nhave not been passed. We can do that, and we should. Absolutely. I am \ngoing to be disgusted if we don't do it. We used to have Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings that provided for an automatic sequester if we didn't meet \ncertain targets. I prefer that we not touch Social Security, but if we \ndo, let's cut across the board so it is a small percentage.\n  I urge my colleagues to seriously consider that and, hopefully, pass \nthis resolution when we vote next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator and I do agree we \nshould not raid Social Security. But I think it already has been under \nsome of their proposals. That could be open for debate. The Senator \nsays let's make an across-the-board cut if at the end have gone \noverboard. I made a list of some of the things we could cut, such as \n$13 billion in Medicare fraud and abuse; $6 billion in tobacco penalty; \n$2 billion in student loan guarantees, as fixes that we can make; $10 \nbillion in corporate welfare; $4 billion cut in Defense to get just to \nthe DOD request. That is about $35 billion. Why don't we take some of \nthat money, if we have to, rather than cutting education and community \nhealth centers? That is what the Senator from Oklahoma would propose, \nif I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague has made several references \nabout Republicans cutting education. I have called him on it in the \npast, and I am calling him on it again. The budget we have before us \nincreases education by $2.3 billion. If you took what I said, cut 1 \npercent, that increases education from $35 billion to $37 billion. And \nthat is a $2.3 billion increase. So I keep hearing him say Republicans \nare cutting education, and it has grown every single year.\n\n  I think he needs to stay with the facts. If you adopted this \ndraconian proposal, you would reduce the growth of education from maybe \n$2.3 billion to $2 billion, which is still a big growth. So I want to \nmake clear there is too much rhetoric that is too inaccurate which says \nRepublicans are cutting education, when education is growing by over $2 \nbillion in this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, the last time I checked, the \nRepublicans do run the House of Representatives. Their education budget \nis below that. Ours is up a little bit, but you know what happens when \nyou go to conference. And who runs the conference? The Republicans. I \nam saying, we may be up in the Senate, but the Republicans run the \nHouse and they have cut it down below. That is my point.\n  The Senator said education was up. But under the Senator's scenario \nof an across-the-board cut, obviously, education would be cut, as would \ncommunity health centers and Head Start, because it would be across the \nboard. I am saying, if we want to have a balanced budget, which we do, \nwhere do we cut?\n  Why won't the Senator accept penalties on the tobacco companies? The \nCBO gave us scoring of $6 billion just from penalties on tobacco \ncompanies for not reducing teen smoking to the level they said they \nwere going to do. That is $6 billion right there. Yet the Senator \ndoesn't seem to be willing to even entertain that as a possible source \nof revenue. No, he wants to cut across the board.\n  So, again, this debate will continue, obviously, for the remainder of \nthe fall as we get into the final crunch on our bills around here. But \nit seems to me that to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we do \nan across-the-board cut, without looking at some other things--as I \nmentioned, there are $2 billion in student loan guarantee fixes we can \nmake, and the tobacco penalty I talked about, or bringing Defense back \ndown to the DOD request. There are a whole bunch of things we can look \nat that will still let us increase Head Start and education, community \nhealth centers, all the things that meet human needs and invest in the \nhuman resources of our country, rather than doing it as the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has suggested.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to change the mood a little \nbit and wish all of my colleagues a happy new year. Here we are on \nOctober 1, a new fiscal year. I wish to say it is a pleasure to be in \nthe Senate debating the spending bills for our Nation, and it is a \npleasure to have the resolution brought by my friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I have to agree with the Senator from Iowa; it is hard for some \npeople to keep a straight face when the Congressional Budget Office \nreported just 2 days ago that the Republican leadership in the House \nand Senate is already $18 billion into the Social Security trust fund, \nand we are considering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says, by \nall means, we are never going to touch the Social Security trust fund. \nI don't think we can pull that off with a straight face. I think the \nAmerican people are going to see through that. I think they understand \nwhat is happening. They understand we have not met our new year's \ndeadline of October 1 and passed our spending bills.\n  But very few Congresses ever do, in all fairness. What is different \nabout this Congress is, here we are on October 1 and we don't have a \nclue how to finish. We don't have a dialog between the President and \nCongress to try to bring us to a reasonable, bipartisan conclusion. \nInstead, as my old friend, Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, used to \nsay: ``Too many people are posing for holy pictures here.'' They want \nto be known as the person who ``saved'' this or that.\n  I think the American people expect candor and honesty from us. Candor \nand honesty would tell us several things. First, if we are so desperate \nnow that we want to do across-the-board cuts in spending, why in the \nworld were we ever discussing a $792 billion tax cut? That was the \nRepublican mantra a few weeks ago. We have so much money, we can give \naway $792 billion. Well, the American people were\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\nskeptical and folks on this side of the aisle were also skeptical, and \nthey dropped the idea. But now they come back and say we are in such \ndire straits that we have to pass this sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nto discipline ourselves, keep our hands off Social Security.\n  Some of the schemes the Republican leaders are coming up with to try \nto end this budget debate are, frankly, not only greeted with \nskepticism by Democrats, but even by fellow Republicans. Gov. George W. \nBush of Texas, yesterday, took a look at the House Republicans' \nproposal to end this budget impasse, and this is what he said:\n\n       I don't think they [Congress] ought to balance their budget \n     on the backs of the poor. I am concerned for someone who is \n     moving from near poverty to middle class.\n\n  The nominal front runner for President of the Republican Party has \ntossed congressional Republicans overboard because of their extremism \nand their budget policy. What is it they want to do? They want to cut \nthe earned-income tax credit--a credit that goes to 20 million low-\nincome working Americans to help them get by. That is their idea. Some \nwould argue that is painless. I don't think anyone among the 20 million \nfamilies would. They understand that can hurt a family when they are \ntrying to meet the basics.\n  The balanced budget amendment which is being debated on the floor--\nand the reason I came over--passed in 1997, established caps on \nspending and wanted to make some cuts in areas such as Medicare to save \nmoney to move forward a balanced budget. It was a sensible thing to do. \nI supported it. I did not believe that I was in any way voting for the \nTen Commandments. I thought instead I was voting for a reasonable \nlegislative attempt to bring this budget into balance.\n  But I will tell you that at this point in time I don't believe \nSenators on either side of the aisle can ignore what is happening \nacross America when it comes to health care.\n  I support the legislation introduced by Senator Daschle this morning. \nI have my own bill, introduced a few days ago, which is very similar \nwhich tries to come to the rescue of many of these hospitals across \nAmerica.\n  I am worried about the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is pending \nnow before the Senate because it suggests we can ignore problems such \nas this. And we certainly cannot.\n  As I travel across my State, I find hospitals are really in trouble, \nparticularly teaching hospitals. In Illinois, we have about 66 teaching \nhospitals. These are hospitals where young men and women are learning \nto be the doctors of tomorrow. It is not the most cost-efficient thing \nto do at a teaching hospital. You have to take extra time to teach, and \nmany insurance companies don't want to pay for that now that Medicare \nis not reimbursing adequately for it. Hospitals come to me--St. Francis \nHospital in Peoria, St. Johns Hospital in Springfield, hospitals in \nChicago, and all across the State--and say: If we are going to meet our \nteaching mission, we need help.\n  I think Senator Daschle is right. Before this Congress pats itself on \nthe back and goes home, we need to address this very serious problem--\nthis problem that could affect the quality of health care, the quality \nof future doctors, and not only teaching hospitals as educational \ninstitutions but also because they take on the toughest cases. These \nare the academic and research hospitals which try to institute new \nprocedures to deal with disease and try to find ways to cure people in \nimaginative ways. We don't want to in any way quell their enthusiasm \nand idealism. Unfortunately, these Medicare cuts are going to do just \nthat.\n  I might also add that these teaching hospitals in my State account \nfor 59 percent of charity care. In other words, the poorest of the poor \nwho have no health insurance, who are not covered by Medicaid, who may \nbe working poor, for example, come into these hospitals. They are taken \ncare of free of charge.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma thinks we can just walk away from this, \nmake a 1-percent cut and go home and accept that as the verdict of \nhistory, I think he is wrong. I think, frankly, whether you are in \nTexas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska, or Illinois, these hospitals are in \ntrouble. Rural hospitals are in trouble, as well.\n\n  These hospitals have seen dramatic cutbacks in reimbursement. In my \npart of the world, these hospitals are a lifeline for farmers who are \ninjured in their farming operations or in traffic accidents. These \nsmall hospitals keep people alive. If we turn our backs on them and say \nthat because we are enmeshed in some theoretical budgetary debate we \ncan ignore what is happening to these hospitals, we are making a \nserious mistake. Some of the hospitals may close, some will merge, some \nwill be bought out, some may keep the sign on the door that you have \nseen for years, but what is going on inside the hospital is going to \nchange. It is going to change for the worse instead of the better.\n  When we consider sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that try to strike \nsome position of principle--and I respect the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis point of view--I say: Let's get down to the real world.\n  Let's be honest with the American people in the closing days of this \nbudget debate. And I sincerely hope we are in the closing days of this \ndebate. Let's tell them what is going on here.\n  We are no longer awash in red ink as we have been for 20 years. We \nare starting to move toward a surplus. The economy is strong. We feel \ngood about that. We would borrow less from Social Security this year, \nif it is held to $5 billion, than probably any year in recent memory, \nand all of it will be paid back with the interest. We would use it to \nmeet emergency needs of America--such as the farm crisis the Senators \nfrom Iowa and Nebraska have shown such leadership on--and we would be \nresponsive to these crises at a time when what is at stake is, frankly, \na major part of our economy and a major part of America.\n  Second, we would address the health care needs of this country. If we \nthink we can go home and beat our chests about how pure we were in the \nbudgetary process and don't lift a finger to help these hospitals that \nare struggling to survive, we will have made a very serious mistake.\n  I salute the Senator from Iowa and other colleagues, such as Senator \nBoxer of California and Senator Murray of Washington, who have tried to \nmake sure this Labor-HHS bill does not lay off 29,000 teachers at the \nend of this school year. This bill would do it. The bill that some \nRepublican Senators are so proud of would lay off 29,000 teachers \nacross America because of cuts that are made in that bill and 1,200 \nteachers in my home State of Illinois.\n  Is that how we want to welcome the new century? Is that how we want \nto tell our kids we are going to greet a new generation, by laying off \nteachers and increasing class size? No.\n  There are important priorities for us to face. I sincerely hope \nbefore we get caught up in some theoretical debate, as Senator Harkin \nhas said, about whether the horse is out of the barn, that we talk \nabout whether or not we are going to protect Americans in their homes \nand protect them in their communities.\n  I support Senator Harkin's remarks. I support--maybe one of the few \ntimes--Gov. George W. Bush, who has reminded his congressional \nRepublicans to keep their feet on the ground and to realize there are \nreal people out there who, frankly, are going to be injured and damaged \nand their lives changed if congressional Republicans have their way in \nthis budgetary process. Governor Bush is on the right track. We will \nstay tuned to see if he stays there.\n  I sincerely hope before we leave and before we think we have \ncompleted our responsibility that we will pass a budget we can explain \nto American families is in their best interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I voted against Senator \nHutchinson's amendment to transfer $25 million from the budget of the \nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to increase funding for community \nhealth centers. I am not opposed to expanding the services provided by \ncommunity health centers--to the contrary, I believe they are an \nimportant element in health care delivery in West Virginia.\n  However, Mr. President, the National Labor Relations Board is also \nimportant to West Virginia. During the first half of this century, \nlabor conditions in West Virginia coal mines, and the resulting growth \nin unions, led to a virtual state of war, in some instances.\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\n Having an orderly process in place to resolve these kinds of issues, \nsuch as that managed by the NLRB, helps to keep management-labor-union \nrelations on a civilized path.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is an independent agency created \nby Congress to administer the National Labor Relations Act, which is \nthe primary law governing the relationship between unions and employers \nin the private sector. The NLRB has two principal functions: first, to \ndetermine, through secret ballot elections, if employees want to be \nrepresented by a union in dealing with their employers; and second, to \nprevent and remedy unfair labor practices by either employers or \nunions. The NLRB investigates violations of the National Labor \nRelations Act, seeks voluntary remedies to violations, and adjudicates \nthose businesses that refuse to comply with the Act.\n  Opponents of the NLRB have been eager to eliminate it in recent \nyears, but have not had much success in doing so on the merits. \nInstead, they have been attacking its financing. The NLRB's budget has \nnot kept pace with inflation over the last six years, and, even though \nthe case load has decreased since last year, overall, staffing levels \nhave fallen at a greater rate. The NLRB had 6,198 unfair labor practice \ncases pending initial investigation at the end of Fiscal Year 1998. The \nHutchinson amendment, according to the NLRB, would have caused them to \nprocess six thousand fewer cases, and cut all staff training and \ninformation technology activities in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  I support community health centers. They provide a vital service to \nlow income persons who cannot afford health insurance. However, in my \nopinion, it is not practical to underfund one valuable program in order \nto fund another. Rather, I would prefer to see the funds come from \nother sources less disruptive to agencies as valuable to our nations' \nlaborers as the NLRB.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I heard an exchange earlier between the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Oklahoma who talked about \nraiding the Social Security trust fund. We have not been raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund for the last 16 years. What we have--since \n1983--is a tax that generates revenue in excess of what we need. The \nlaw says we have to take that tax and purchase Treasury bonds. When the \nTreasury is purchasing Treasury bonds from itself, Treasury ends up \nwith cash.\n  The question is--since 1983--what do we do with that cash? We have \nbeen using it to fund general government, and the impact of that since \n1983 is that people who get paid by the hour are the ones who suffer. \nWe make this appeal to people over the age of 65 for political reasons: \nDo not raid Social Security. But the people who suffer and have been \npaying the price since 1983 are the American taxpayers, people who get \npaid by the hour. For the median-income family earning $37,000 a year, \nthey will pay $5,700 in payroll taxes and $1,300 or $1,400 in income \ntaxes. Since 1983, they have shouldered a disproportionate share of \ndeficit reduction. Now that the deficit is gone, guess what they get to \ndo. They get to shoulder all the debt reduction. This does not save \nSocial Security. What this does is save us from having to make a \nchange. That puts a tremendous burden upon people who are paid by the \nhour.\n  What we ought to be doing is debating reducing that burden, not, in \nmy judgment, making a play for people over the age of 65 and saying we \nhave been raiding the trust. We have not. We have not been raiding the \ntrust fund since 1983. The trust fund has been building up, and those \nTreasury bonds are valuable. They earn interest. In fact, there is $40 \nbillion worth of interest added on to the Social Security trust this \nyear as a result of paying for the interest on those bonds.\n\n  The people who suffer as a consequence of Congress' delay on fixing \nSocial Security are 150 million Americans under the age of 45. If you \nare under the age 45 and you are watching Congress say, ``Let's fix \nSocial Security'' and do nothing, what you ought to be saying is: Mr. \nCongressman, when are you going to fix it?\n  Why do we not fix it? You can see it. I was watching the news this \nmorning. I saw Ken Apfel, the head of the Social Security \nAdministration, in an interview with Katie Couric, proudly telling \nabout a letter he is sending out to Social Security beneficiaries \ntelling them what they are going to get when they retire. He left one \nthing out. If they are under 45 and they get a letter in the mail that \nsays ``this is what your benefits are going to be,'' Mr. Apfel is not \ninforming those beneficiaries that unless Congress increases taxes, \nthere is going to be a 25- to 33-percent cut in benefits, according to \nthe Social Security trustees. He is not informing them of that, and he \nis not informing them that Social Security, for that low- and moderate-\nwage individual, is not a very generous program. If you live very long \nafter the age of 65, God help you if that is all you have.\n  Those of us who have been arguing we need to fix Social Security get \na little irritated when we hear people say we have been raiding Social \nSecurity for the last 16 years and that the lockbox saves Social \nSecurity. It does not. What the lockbox does is say to people who are \npaid by the hour, the median family who has $5,700 in payroll taxes, \nafter shouldering all the burden for deficit reduction from 1983 to \n1999, it is now their responsibility to pay down the debt. On behalf of \nthose people, to keep Social Security as an intergenerational program, \nI beg my colleagues to finally decide: What will you support?\n  I went to the University of Nebraska, graduated with a degree in \npharmacy, and was trained in demolitions in the U.S. Navy. I do not \nconsider myself to be an intellectual giant. I am neither a Rhodes \nscholar nor some sort of scholastic achiever. I do not consider myself \nto be intellectually superior to anybody in this place. An average \nstaffer with an hour's worth of work can present to any Member of \nCongress the options that are available to us. This is not complicated. \nThis is not youth violence. This is not the deterioration of the \nAmerican family. This is not lots of issues that are complicated.\n  We have a liability that is too big, and for 150 million \nbeneficiaries who are now charged with the responsibility of paying \ndown all the debt with their payroll taxes, they face a 25- to 33-\npercent cut in their benefits. We are not keeping the promise to them, \nand we are making an appeal to people over the age of 65, saying: The \nlockbox saves you. Nonsense, it does not.\n  I know how difficult it is to finally say this is what I choose \nbecause you either have to increase taxes or you cut benefits. There \nare no other magical choices. There is not any other choice. You either \ncut the benefits in the future or you increase taxes. I wish there were \nsome other choice, but there is not.\n  I hope Americans, as they hear this debate about raiding Social \nSecurity, will understand we are not, in my view, raiding Social \nSecurity. What we are saying is that we are going to postpone fixing \nSocial Security because we are afraid of people over the age of 65. We \nare afraid they cannot stomach the truth. I believe that is wrong. They \ncan stomach the truth. They want to know the truth. They want the \nfacts. They are patriotic; they love their country; they love their \nkids and grandkids; and they want to make certain their future is \nsecure and sound and that Social Security is going to be there for them \nwhen they become eligible.\n  I hope we are able to take action on the Balanced Budget Restoration \nAct that Senator Daschle has introduced. But I hope in this budget \ndebate as well, we will finally recognize the sooner we fix Social \nSecurity, the smaller the changes will have to be. The people who are \ngoing to suffer the consequences today may not be us. We may be able to \nget by the next election by fooling people about what we are doing. But \nthe people who are going to suffer are 150 million Americans under\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nthe age of 45 who are not going to be happy when they wake up on \nChristmas morning and go down and check the sock and find out there is \na third less in it than they were told, by the Social Security \nAdministration, was going to be in it.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will try to say what I have to say in \nless than 10 minutes, especially because of my regard for my esteemed \ncolleague from the State of Connecticut, who I see has entered the \nChamber.\n  I appreciate the intensity and commitment of the Senator from \nNebraska. He is correct; we do not have on the drawing board a long-\nterm remediation for the long-term problems of Social Security. But if \nwe just spend and spend and spend so we continue to elevate the debt of \nthe United States rather than curtail the spending by not spending the \nSocial Security surplus, we are going to make it more difficult, when \nthe time comes, to pay for the Social Security benefits for which we \nare committed to pay.\n  So I think it is important not to spend Social Security surpluses to \nexpand Government and to make Government more and more committed and \ndeeper and deeper in debt. It is a major benefit to the future of this \ncountry if we decide to refrain from spending Social Security \nsurpluses, which will allow us to protect the integrity, not only of \nSocial Security, on a more persistent basis, but certainly to protect \nthe integrity of the finances of this Government so when the time comes \nfor us to make payments, we will have the fiscal integrity to do so.\n  I know we are in morning business, but particularly today I rise to \ncomment on and to support the Nickles amendment to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. I support the amendment because it puts the Senate \non record demanding we protect the Social Security trust fund from \nbeing raided to pay for other Government spending. The less we go into \ndebt for other Government spending, the more likely we are to be able \nto honor the claims of Social Security.\n  So the theft of Social Security funds this year must stop. We should \nstop spending as if Social Security were a funding resource for all \nkinds of other spending programs. I am concerned the Labor-HHS bill \nwill result in the Senate's completion of all 13 appropriations bills \nand, as a result, perhaps take us into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Some estimates have been as high as $5 billion. I would work to delay \nthe bill if I did not have assurances from the majority leader that the \nconference reports will not touch the Social Security surplus, even if \nSenate appropriations have, that the entirety of the package of bills \nwe send to the President after negotiation with the House will not \ntouch the Social Security trust fund.\n  The majority leader has worked tirelessly to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund. I commend him for it, and I appreciate his ongoing \neffort.\n  Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office has stated in a letter \nto Speaker Hastert that the House plan to spend $592.1 billion will not \ntouch the Social Security trust fund.\n  If we do dip into the Social Security trust fund this year, it would \nerase all the hard work we have undertaken to protect Social Security.\n  In January, President Clinton proposed bleeding $158 billion out of \nSocial Security surpluses over the next 5 years. This Congress objected \nto President Clinton's proposal, and I am glad to say that the Congress \ngot the President to change his mind and to take far less out of the \nSocial Security surpluses over that 5-year period of time. I wish I \ncould say that he had agreed to take none, and sometimes he represents \nit that way.\n  In the President's midsession review of the budget process, he said \nthat Social Security surpluses should be spent for Social Security, \nperiod. That is right. That is the Social Security lockbox philosophy. \nUnfortunately, his new budget still took $30 billion out of Social \nSecurity over the next 10 years, but that is a lot better than $158 \nbillion. I commend the President for moving so aggressively in the \ndirection of the Congress.\n  Still the President's midsession review, while it is a vast \nimprovement, and Congress has succeeded in moving him as far as he has \nmoved, it is not far enough. We need to work throughout this year to \ndemonstrate our commitment to protect every single penny of the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  In April, we passed a budget resolution that does not spend 1 dime or \n1 cent of the Social Security trust fund surplus. In addition to \nprotecting the Social Security surplus, the budget resolution sticks to \nthe spending caps from the 1997 balanced budget agreement. It cuts \ntaxes and increases spending on education and defense.\n  In addition to ordering our spending priorities correctly, the budget \nresolution contained a majority point of order preventing the use of \nSocial Security surpluses for non-Social Security purposes. The Senate \nvoted unanimously in favor of this point of order. I had the privilege \nof sponsoring this particular provision, and since that point, the \nCongress has continued along its responsible spending path and has also \nrepeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the Social Security lockbox \nconcept, which is to limit Government spending to the revenues designed \nfor Government spending, and not to have general Government spending \ncome out of the revenues designed to provide for the retirements of \nAmerica's workers.\n  The House of Representatives passed the Herger bill which created a \nsupermajority point of order of protecting Social Security.\n  These actions demonstrate a strong commitment and dedication to \nprotecting every dollar of the projected Social Security surplus to \nshoring up Social Security, making sure we treat it with integrity.\n\n  In addition, a majority of Senators have repeatedly voted for the \nAbraham-Domenici-Ashcroft Social Security lockbox provision. \nUnfortunately, the lockbox, which was approved by the House, has been \nendorsed by the President, and a majority of the Senate has been held \nhostage in the Senate by those on the other side of the aisle.\n  Despite this setback, we have made great progress in protecting \nSocial Security, the integrity of the fund, and limiting the kind of \nspending that would jeopardize our capacity to make good on our \ncommitments at some date when Social Security needs to call upon us.\n  The most important thing we can do right now is demonstrate our \ncommitment to protecting every cent of Social Security resources to \nmake sure they are available for Social Security and to make sure they \nare not spent on the operations of Government generally. This is a plan \nthat we have agreed to under the budget resolution. We promised the \nAmerican people that Social Security surpluses will be reserved for \nSocial Security, and now is the time when we are testing that resolve.\n  Last year, when faced with this test, Congress failed, agreeing to an \nomnibus appropriations bill that raided--and I think that is the right \nword--$21 billion from our retirement security fund. I voted against \nthe bill but was unable to prevent the raid by doing so.\n  This year, we have all been committed to completing all our spending \nbills on time and avoiding the omnibus spending train wreck such as we \nsaw in last year's $21 billion raid.\n  I approve of this plan, but a necessary element of the plan is that \nCongress not spend resources on operating Government that were destined \nto and designed to support the Social Security trust fund.\n  The Nickles amendment would put us on record stating we categorically \noppose a raid on our retirement system and will support spending cuts \nto let us meet that goal. As I said, according to unofficial Budget \nCommittee estimates, the Congress is now poised to spend as much as $5 \nbillion out of the Social Security trust fund. If that is the case, I \nwill vote against any plan that would do so. We must avoid filching \nresources from the Social Security trust fund to support the operations \nof Government.\n\n[[Page S11782]]\n\n  This spending bill, the Labor-HHS fiscal year 2000 appropriations \nbill, is the last of the 13 appropriations bills to reach the floor. It \nis also the largest of the nondefense discretionary appropriations \nbills. If the estimates about this year's spending that I have referred \nto are correct, we are going to dip into Social Security, and this is \nthe bill that will push us over the edge. For this reason, I commend \nSenator Nickles for bringing up this amendment on this bill at this \ntime.\n  Now is the time for us to stand up and say we will not support taking \nany money out of the Social Security trust fund to finance the \noperations of Government. Making sure that Social Security funds do not \ngo for anything other than Social Security is essential to the \nprotection of long-term Social Security integrity.\n  Social Security is expected to meet all of its obligations until the \nyear 2034--until then. Starting in 2014, however, Social Security will \nbegin spending more than it collects. It will begin spending the trust \nfund, the surpluses. By saving Social Security surpluses and using \nthose surpluses to pay down the debt, Congress will ensure the Nation \nis on secure economic footing when Social Security surpluses diminish \nand then disappear. If we do not save Social Security now, it will make \nit that much harder for us to meet our own obligations later.\n\n  We need to protect Social Security now for the 1 million Missourians \nwho receive Social Security, for their children, and their \ngrandchildren. We need to protect Social Security now, and this bill \nfails to do that. It certainly threatens not to do it, and it is time \nfor us to vote in favor of the Nickles amendment, and to vote against \nany plan that would invade the Social Security trust fund.\n  It is for this reason I urge my colleagues to support the Nickles \namendment calling for the full protection of our Social Security \nresources.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, last evening after the final vote \noccurred, my friend and colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, took \nthe floor and offered an amendment which he then withdrew. I was not \nable, because of my personal schedule, to be here at that time. But as \nan original sponsor of the original legislation offered by Senator \nBrownback, which would have created a special committee on cultural \nmatters, I did want to simply say a few words about this.\n  I know this became controversial within the Senate, but I felt from \nthe beginning that Senator Brownback's intentions were not only worthy \nbut they were relevant; that the cultural problems which the committee, \nor later the task force, would have addressed are real, as every family \nin America knows when their children turn on the television or go to a \nmovie or listen to a CD or play a video game.\n  The problems are not only real, but they are actually relevant to so \nmany of the matters we more formally discuss on the floor of the \nSenate--such as the solitary explosions, violent criminal behavior, \nproblems such as teenage pregnancies, I think all of which are affected \nby the messages our culture gives our children and, indeed, adults \nabout behavior. Of course, I am talking about the hypersexual content, \nhyperviolent content in too much of our culture.\n  In this case, this effort by Senator Brownback, with the withdrawal \nof the amendment last night, was not to culminate successfully. But the \nbattle will go on.\n  Clearly, the standing committees of the Senate will--I certainly hope \nthey will; I am confident they will--continue to pursue cultural \nquestions because they are so important, they are so central to the \nmoral condition and future of our country. I look forward to working on \nthose with Senator Brownback and other colleagues as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11782-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11782-S11783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESPN NETWORK\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note there is a rule in the Senate \nagainst using props. I, just for a moment, ask unanimous consent for a \ntransitional prop, if I might briefly hold this up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  This is my favorite ESPN parka. It gives you an indication of about \nwhat I am going to speak. It is in some sense as cultural as the first \npart of my comments. It does involve the influence of television on the \nAmerican culture. But today, in this part of it, the news is good and \nthe occasion is one to celebrate, particularly for those who may find \nsome meaning in words that might confuse visitors from another planet, \nsuch as ``en fuego'' or ``boo-yaah.'' Twenty years ago, a small cable \ntelevision enterprise, tucked away in the woods of central Connecticut, \nintroduced itself to America with these words:\n\n       If you're a fan, what you'll see in the minutes, hours and \n     days to follow may convince you that you've gone to sports \n     heaven.\n\n  True to that prophecy, the past 20 years have marked our national \nelevation into another world of sublime sports saturation.\n  In recognition of its outstanding contribution in shaping the sports \nentertainment industry, I wish to speak today--and I believe I speak \nfor all of my colleagues, at least a great majority--in offering our \nkudos to an American sports institution and the pride of Bristol, CT--\nthe ESPN Network which turned 20 years old last month, on September 7. \nThe folks at ESPN aired an anniversary special that night duly \ncelebrating the network's unique constructive contribution to our \nculture, and yesterday there was a congressional reception in honor of \nthat anniversary.\n  Those of us who attended not only had the chance to toast ESPN but to \nmeet an extraordinary group of American heroes: boxing legend Muhammad \nAli, football great Johnny Unitas, and Olympian Carl Lewis.\n  So I take the floor to pay tribute to one of my favorite corporate \nconstituents, and I think one of America's favorite networks.\n  The story of how ESPN came to be is really an American rags to riches \nclassic, and that network's unbreakable bond with the small Connecticut \ncity of its founding is part of that story.\n\n  Bristol, CT, population 63,000, is a wonderful town, 20 minutes west \nof Hartford. Most famous previously for being the cradle of clockmaking \nduring the industrial age, Bristol seemed an unlikely candidate to \nemerge as the cradle of electronics sports media, but it did. Believe \nit or not, ESPN probably would not exist today--certainly not in \nBristol--if the old New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association \nhad not had a disappointing season in 1978.\n  The Whalers' public relations director, a man named Bill Rasmussen, \none of several employees to lose his job in a front-office shakeup at \nthe end of that season, decided he had an idea he wanted to try. He was \na Whalers man at heart, and he figured he could stay involved with his \nteam by starting a new cable television channel that would broadcast \nWhalers games statewide. He even had a second-tier dream of someday \npossibly broadcasting University of Connecticut athletics statewide as \nwell.\n  Rasmussen rented office space in Plainville, CT, near Bristol, and \nthought up the name Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, or \nESPN. But before he had even unpacked in Plainville, he ran into his \nfirst problem--the town had an ordinance which prohibited satellite \ndishes. Undeterred, Rasmussen scrambled to nearby Bristol, found a \nparcel of land in an industrial park in the outskirts of the city, \nwhich he promptly bought, sight unseen, I gather, for $18,000. The \nrest, as they say, is history.\n  Today, ESPN, from this same location, generates $1.3 billion a year \nin revenues and is seen in more than 75 million American homes.\n  ESPN realized that second-tier dream that Rasmussen had. Earlier this \nyear, his station provided exhaustive coverage of UConn athletics when \nthe Huskies won the NCAA men's basketball championship--only the game \nwas not broadcast statewide; it was broadcast worldwide.\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\n  Twenty years after its founding, ESPN commands an international \naudience that watches every sport--from baseball to badminton to \nAustralian rules football. The network's flagship, SportsCenter, is \ncurrently the longest running program on cable television, with more \nthan 21,000 episodes logged--truly, the Cal Ripken of network \ntelevision.\n  In a measure of its enormous influence on our culture, the catch \nphrases coined by SportsCenter's quick-witted anchors routinely find \ntheir way into the American vocabulary, such as the aforementioned ``en \nfuego'' and ``boo-yaah.''\n  The program also has broadened sports appeal by peppering broadcasts \nwith references to literature, history, and other high-minded fields \nnot always connected with sporting events. The father of this breed of \nbroadcasting, of course, is Chris Berman, probably my most famous \nconstituent. He was hired from a Waterbury, CT, radio station at the \nage 24 to become one of ESPN's pioneering voices. What a great \nprofessional and source of great joy Chris Berman is.\n  A testament to his place among sportscasting greats can be heard \nacross ballparks in America each time a home run ball is struck. If you \nlisten closely, as the ball nears the fence, you may think that the \nballfield is being overtaken by a herd of chickens clucking: ``Back, \nback''--I am restraining myself here on the floor, Mr. President, but \nyou get the idea--``back, back, back, back, back,'' in homage to the \nSwami's classic call. Berman is also the father of the modern sports \nnickname, concocting such classics as: Burt ``Be Home'' Blyleven, John \n``I Am Not A'' Kruk, and Roberto ``Remember The'' Alomar. There are \ncertain individuals unnamed in the Democratic Cloakroom who have \nattempted to emulate this style of nicknaming for sports figures, and \nthey are not doing badly. Oh, and lest we forget another household \nname, ESPN introduced us to the man who genuinely put the ``Madness'' \ninto March Madness--the nattering nabob of Naismith, the great Dick \nVitale.\n  So thanks to Chris Berman, to Dick Vitale, and to all the others who \nhave made ESPN part of our lives.\n  ESPN is today to sports what Walter Cronkite once was to politics and \npublic affairs--the authoritative voice fans turn to when a major story \nbreaks. As political columnist George Will once wisely said: ``If \nsomeone surreptitiously took everything but ESPN from my cable \ntelevision package, it might be months before I noticed.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Despite ESPN's national prominence and its countless \nopportunities to relocate to a larger media market, the network has \nsteadfastly stayed with bucolic Bristol, as it is endearingly referred \nto on the air. ESPN maintains its foothold in the same industrial park \nwhere it began 20 years ago, although the Bristol campus, as it is now \ncalled, spans today 43 acres and the network has 210 employees. We in \nConnecticut are very proud of this relationship and particularly of \nESPN's leaders and broadcasters who have happily put down roots and \nraised their families in central Connecticut.\n  I think John Leone, former mayor of Bristol, now head of the Bristol \nChamber of Commerce, may have summed up the relationship between the \ncity and its network best when he said:\n\n       In New York, ESPN would be just another network. Here in \n     Bristol, ESPN is the king.\n\n  So to the king of Bristol--and their royalty of American sports \ntelevision--I say happy 20th, ESPN, and many more.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to give a special thank you to Eric \nKleiman of my office staff who truly inspired this statement of \ngratitude and tribute to a great television network.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11783-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11783-S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNBORN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, yesterday my colleagues in the Senate, \nSenator Helms, Senator Enzi, Senator Voinovich, Senator Tim Hutchinson, \nand Senator Nickles, introduced a bill that would establish new \ncriminal penalties for anyone injuring or harming a fetus while \ncommitting another Federal offense. By providing a Federal remedy, our \nbill, the bill we are calling the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, will \nhelp ensure that crimes against unborn victims are in fact punished. \nThe House passed their version of this bill yesterday by a vote of 254 \nto 172.\n  Tragically, unborn babies, perhaps more than we realize, are the \ntargets--sometimes intended, sometimes otherwise--of violent acts. That \nis why we need to pass this bill.\n  Let me give several very disturbing real-life examples.\n  In 1996, Airman Gregory Robbins and his family were stationed in my \nhome State of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. At that time, \nMrs. Robbins was more than 8 months pregnant with a daughter whom they \nwould name Jasmine.\n  On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman Robbins wrapped his \nfist in a T-shirt to reduce the chance he would inflict visible \ninjuries and then savagely beat his wife by striking her repeatedly \nabout the head and the stomach. Fortunately, Mrs. Robbins survived this \nviolent assault, but, sadly and tragically, her uterus ruptured during \nthe attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal cavity, causing this \nlittle child's death.\n  A prosecutor sought to prosecute the airman for the little girl's \ndeath, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor the Federal \ncode makes criminal such an act, such an act which results in the death \nor injury of an unborn child. So they had to look outside the Federal \ncode, outside that law. The only available Federal offense actually was \nfor the assault on the mother. That, of course, is a Federal offense.\n  This was a case in which the only available Federal penalty obviously \ndid not fit the crime. So prosecutors looked outside Federal law, used \nOhio law, and then bootstrapped--if we can use the term--the Ohio fetal \nhomicide law to convict Mr. Robbins of Jasmine's death. This case is \ncurrently pending appeal. We certainly hope justice is done. It is \nbeing appealed under the theory that if it was not in fact a Federal \noffense, you could not use the assimilation statute to bring this into \nthe court using the Ohio law.\n  If it weren't for the Ohio law that is already in place and that the \nPresiding Officer of the Chamber was very instrumental in getting \npassed and signed into law, there would have been no opportunity to \nprosecute and punish Airman Robbins for the assault against baby \nJasmine.\n  We need a Federal remedy to avoid having to bootstrap State laws and \nto provide recourse when a violent act occurs during the commission of \na Federal crime, especially in cases when the State in which the crime \noccurs does not have a fetal protection law in place, because there are \nsome States that simply do not.\n  There are other sickening examples of violence against innocent \nunborn children. An incident occurred in Arkansas just a few short \nweeks ago. Nearly 9 months pregnant, Shawana Pace of Little Rock was \ndays away from giving birth to a child. She was thrilled about the \npregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, did not share her joy and did \nnot share her enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. So he \nhired three thugs to beat her, and to beat her so badly that she would \nlose this unborn child. During the vicious assault against mother and \nchild, one of the hired hitmen allegedly said--and I quote--Your baby \nis going to die tonight.\n  Tragically, the baby did die that night. Shawana named the baby \nHeaven. We all should be saddened, we all should be sickened, by the \nsheer inhumanity and brutality of this act of violence.\n  Fortunately, the State of Arkansas, like Ohio, passed a fetal \nprotection law which allows Arkansas prosecutors to charge defendants \nwith murder for the death of a fetus. Under previous law,\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\nsuch attackers could be charged only with crimes against the pregnant \nwoman. That is under the old law, as in the case of Baby Jasmine's \ndeath in Ohio, but for the Arkansas State law, there would be no \nremedy--no punishment--for Baby Heaven's brutal murder. The only charge \nwould be assault against the mother.\n  Another example: In the Oklahoma City World Trade Center bombings--\nhere, too--Federal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with \nthe murders of, or injuries to, the mothers --but not to their unborn \nbabies. Again, Federal law currently only provides penalties for crimes \nagainst born humans. There are no Federal provisions for the unborn, no \nmatter what the circumstances, no matter how heinous the crime. This \nclearly is wrong.\n  Within the Senate, we have the power to do something about this, to \nrectify this wrong, to change the law. That is what our bill is \nintended to do.\n  It is wrong that our Federal Government does absolutely nothing to \ncriminalize violent acts against unborn children. We must correct this \nloophole. I think most Americans would look at it that way and say that \nis a loophole that should not exist. Congress should change this. We \nmust correct this loophole in our law, for it allows criminals to get \naway with violent acts--and sometimes even allows them to get away with \nmurder.\n  We, as a civilized society, should not, with good conscience, stand \nfor that. That is why our bill would hold criminals liable for conduct \nthat harms or kills an unborn child. It would make it a separate crime \nunder the Federal Code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to kill \nor injure an unborn child during the commission of certain existing \nFederal crimes.\n  Our bill, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, would create a separate \noffense for unborn children. It would acknowledge them as the victims \nthey are. Our bill would no longer allow violent acts against unborn \nbabies to be considered victimless crimes. At least 24 States already \nhave criminalized harm to unborn victims, so this is not a new concept. \nAnother seven States have criminalized the unlawful termination of a \npregnancy.\n  In November of 1996, a baby, just 3 months from full term, was killed \nin Ohio as a result of road rage. An angry driver forced a pregnant \nmother's car to crash into a flatbed truck. Because the Ohio Revised \nCode imposes criminal liability for any violent conduct that terminates \na pregnancy of a child in utero, the prosecutor successfully tried and \nconvicted the driver for recklessly causing the baby's death. Our bill \nwould make an act of violence such as this a Federal crime. It would \nmake sure it was always covered. This is a very simple step, but one \nthat will have a dramatic affect. It is, quite frankly, a question of \njustice.\n  Let me make it clear to my colleagues in the Senate that we purposely \ndrafted this legislation very narrowly. For example, it would not \npermit the prosecution for any abortion to which a woman consented. It \nwould not permit the prosecution of a woman for any action--legal or \nillegal--in regard to her unborn child. That is not what the intent of \nthis legislation is all about. This legislation, further, would not \npermit the prosecution for harm caused to the mother or unborn child in \nthe case of medical treatment. The bill would not allow for the \nimposition of the death penalty under this act.\n  It is time we wrap the arms of justice around unborn children and \nprotect them against criminal assailants. Those who violently attack \nunborn babies are criminals. The Federal penalty should, in fact, fit \nthe crime. I strongly urge my colleagues to support our legislation. We \nhave an obligation to our unborn children. This bill will bring about \njustice. It is the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

He, \nalong with many Members, including the occupant of the Chair, Senator \nVoinovich, have been very active in the promotion of laws and policies \nthat would help us to reach our goal of finding a loving and nurturing \nhome for every child in this world that needs one. Many of us believe \nthat it is a fundamental right to grow up in a home with a family, as \nopposed to in a hospital, or some type of institution.\n  I rise to bring the body up to date on some of the things that we \nhave accomplished and that we should be proud of, as well as some of \nthe challenges that are still before us as a Congress. In the short \ntime ahead, I am hopeful the appropriate committees will have hearings \non relevant legislation in order to move the adoption debate along \nquickly. There are literally millions of children and families \ndepending on us to act.\n  First, let me congratulate Senators Chafee and Rockefeller for \nleading the successful effort last year to pass the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act. Last week, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton hosted the \nfirst awards ceremony associated with the passage of that Act. The \ngreat news is that we have taken a mighty and important step forward \nbecause since the passage of the Act 36,000 American children have been \nplaced in foster care while 15,000 foreign children have found \npermanent homes--all with wonderful families throughout America. \nMoreover, at least 35 States were acknowledged for their outstanding \nwork in this area at the White House ceremony last week.\n  In some States, the increases have been 20 percent over last year's \nnumbers, while others have seen 50- to 70-percent increases over the \nprevious year. This has occurred because the law we passed gave the \nnecessary tools to parents, social workers, community activists, and to \nlocal elected officials so that the dream of a family became a reality \nfor these 36,000 children.\n  The problem is we still have over 500,000 children waiting for a \nfamily to call their own. Through this bill, many of the children in \nfoster care, who range from all ages, races, medical conditions, and \nbackgrounds, will be able to one day return to their biological \nfamilies. However, despite our best efforts, unfortunate circumstances \nexist which prevent some of these children from returning home. \nConsequently these children must be moved to a permanent place. The \nAdoption and Safe Families Act will provide the tools for us to help \nthese children in terms of guidelines and the necessary resources.\n  Again I want to thank all the members, particularly Senators \nRockefeller and Chafee, for their leadership in making this law \npossible. It is working and we just need to continue our \nefforts because many children are still waiting for a home to call \ntheir own.\n\n  That leads me to the next three points.\n  We have accomplished some wonderful things. But in this Congress \nduring the next few weeks, some important tasks still remain to be \nfinished. If we fail, there will be several million children left \nwaiting.\n  Next week, under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Helms, we will be having our first hearing on \nthe Hague Treaty, the International Convention for Adoption. The \npurpose of the hearing will be to consider the Intercountry Adoption \nAct, legislation which seeks to implement the objectives of this \nTreaty. I am an original cosponsor of this measure, along with Senator \nHelms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the \nRanking Member, Senator Biden from Delaware.\n  This Treaty is very important because, as we endeavor to ensure that \nevery child in America who needs a home will have one, it is also \nimportant for us to realize that there are millions of children around \nthe world--in South America, in Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern \nand Western Europe, and Asia--who are growing up in horrible \nconditions. Some of them are\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\nin institutions with unspeakable conditions and there are others who \nare actually living in the streets.\n  With all of our global successes, it is appalling and unacceptable \nthat these conditions exist anywhere in the world. We can do something \nabout it.\n  Today, the Internet will allow us to do more than we ever dreamed \npossible--connecting families with children, allowing agencies to work \nmore closely together, and, most importantly, allowing for improved \ncommunications between governments. The language barriers are coming \ndown as technology opens up greater opportunities.\n  But none of this can work without a body of international law that \ngives us the rules and regulations for how this is going to take place. \nWe must eliminate the corruption, the outrageous trafficking of \nchildren, and the extraordinary fees that are sometimes being paid \nillegally. So if we are to have protection for children, protection for \nfamilies, and protection for the legal framework, this Treaty is \nabsolutely essential.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay special attention next week during this \nhearing, and I urge them to learn more about this issue, because there \nis something we all can do; that is, to move this piece of legislation \nforward with the few minor differences that exist between both sides of \nthe aisle, approve the treaty, and then implement it.\n  If my colleagues are like me--and I think many of them are--when we \nget a few minutes to watch television we can view programs such as Save \nthe Children where there are thousands of children who are in need. I \nsit there and think about what I could do as one individual sponsoring \none child. It does not seem to be enough. But in many instances \nreaching out to sponsor that one child is quite enough. Millions of \nAmericans have the opportunity to do the same.\n  I am looking forward to the Senate Foreign Service Committee's \nhearing on adoption next week. I am confident that we can solve the \ndifferences that may exist among the interested parties who are working \nto move this important legislation forward.\n  In addition to the implementation of this international Treaty, we \nare faced here in the United States with some additional challenges in \nour adoption laws. One of the things we failed to accomplish, which \nperhaps may have been an oversight when we passed the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, was a requirement that employers offer adoptive \nfamilies the same benefits as birth families.\n  I believe the Family and Medical Leave Act made progress toward equal \ntreatment for adoptive families, but discrepancies remain for adoptive \nfamilies who seek the same employee benefits as birth families. This \nlaw enables both adoptive and birth families to take up to twelve weeks \nof unpaid, job protected leave. Some employers, however, permit \nemployees to use sick leave or provide paid leave for birth parents, \nbut do not provide these same benefits for adoptive families.\n\n  As an adoptive parent, I can certainly attest to the fact that \nwhether the child is biological or comes as a gift through adoption, \nthe stress on the families are very much the same. This is why the \nexpansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act is so important. It must \ninclude the thousands of families in our country who adopt either \ndomestically or internationally every year. This inclusion will allow \nCongress to say that building a family through adoption is a blessing \nfor children and parents. This is one important goal I hope we can \nachieve this Congress.\n  In addition, I hope we can extend the adoption tax credit we passed \nseveral years ago, which is now $5,000 based on actual expenses, and \ndouble it, making it $10,000. This will make it real and workable, \nespecially for those families who adopt special needs children.\n  Currently, this tax credit is working but it can be improved for \nthose parents who adopt special needs children--older children, \nhandicapped children, children with special emotional challenges, \nsibling groups, or international adoption. Unless you can demonstrate \nall expenses in connection with the adoption you are unable to avail \nyourself of the tax credit.\n  In many ways, when you take a special needs child, there are no \nexpenses associated with the adoption itself because the agencies of \ncourse want to place these children. I believe it would be in the best \nmoney this Congress could spend to provide tax credits, tax credits to \nfamilies who adopt hard-to-place children and sibling groups, and \nothers with difficulties.\n  The Government should state that if you will take a child into your \nhome and call it your own, we will give you a $10,000 tax credit. A \nfamily who would adopt two children would get a $20,000 Federal tax \ncredit. It is my hope that they would not have to pay Federal taxes for \nmany years because these families are doing something great for their \ncommunity and country.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me show you a picture of a beautiful \nlittle girl as an example of what I have been talking about. This child \nis coming from China. Her mother, Cheryl Varnado, wrote me a letter \nabout little Anna Grace Cai Yong Lin.\n  Her letter reads: Senator, would you fly an American flag over the \nCapitol today so that I can give it to our little girl in remembrance \nof her first day in the United States?\n  I commend the Government of China for the wonderful work they are \ndoing to provide homes for millions of Chinese children. Today they are \ndoing a much better job in this area. The challenges faced by this \ncountry are great. There are over one million children without families \nwho will grow up in institutional care unless someone brings them into \ntheir home and provides them with the love of a family.\n  We are happy for Anna and her new family. The flag flying over the \nCapitol today will remind us of her arrival to the United States and \nthe thousands of other children that have come from all over the world \nto find homes in America.\n  In conclusion, a wonderful couple that won an award was honored on \nthe front steps of the Capitol earlier today for adopting not one, not \ntwo, but 30 children of all ages, races, physical handicaps, and \nchallenges. They received the Norman Vincent Peale Award for \noutstanding service to our country. I commend Penny and Chuck Hauer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article printed in \nthe Record about this couple.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Some things are in short supply around Penny and Chuck \n     Hauer's house: Toilet paper. Money. Bathroom space.\n       But not love.\n       It radiates in the heart-melting smiles of Carissa, brain-\n     damaged as an infant, who is 17 and occupies a wheel-chair.\n       It's reflected in the sparkling eyes of Calli, who is 11 \n     and has Down Syndrome and a huge crush on skater Scott \n     Hamilton.\n       It zaps you like electricity in the gnarled handshake of \n     Clifton, who is 21 and has cerebral palsy and a fondness for \n     country music.\n       In all, over 20-some years, the Hauers have adopted 35 \n     physically and/or mentally disabled children of all races--\n     black, white, Korean, Hispanic. Nine have died. Others have \n     grown up and moved out on their own.\n       All were among those hardest to find homes for, the ones \n     nobody else wanted.\n       ``The world says these kids should be in a group home, or \n     in a hospital or an institution,'' says Penny Hauer. ``That's \n     not our philosophy.''\n       Sharing an eight-bedroom, three-bath home are 21 adopted \n     siblings, ages 8 to 32, plus two of the Hauers' five \n     offspring and a 7-year-old grandson.\n       ``It was a four-bedroom house but we've made some \n     revisions,'' Penny Hauer says. ``The living room is a \n     bedroom. The dining room is a bedroom.\n       ``Bath time can be a problem. If you want a bath every \n     night, fine--get in line.''\n       In a family tradition, the children all have names with C--\n     Catey, Cotey, Courtney, Curtis, Colin . . . and on it goes.\n       Much has changed in the year since a newspaper story \n     introduced readers to this remarkable family and their battle \n     with the Social Security system.\n       They've been on national TV. They've gotten back in touch \n     with a lost son. They've made lots of new friends.\n       And they have resolved the bureaucrats' mess that \n     threatened the $7,000 monthly Supplemental Security Income \n     funding the family depends upon.\n       The Hauers moved here from Montana in July 1997 because the \n     kids were being ridiculed and mistreated in the school system \n     there, the parents said. The sale of their Montana home fell \n     through, leaving them stretched beyond thin, paying two \n     mortgages.\n       In August 1997, filing routine renewal forms at San Diego's \n     Social Security office, the couple dutifully reported their \n     deeds on two homes. They were notified three months\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\n     later that their assets exceeded government allowances for \n     Supplemental Security Income.\n       With help from an attorney and Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-E1 \n     Cajon, the Hauers kept the checks coming while they appealed. \n     Finally, in April, they solved the problem by selling the \n     $600,000 Montana home to a Vista couple for $225,000.\n       Still, making ends meet is a struggle. The payment on the \n     East County home is $3,000 a month, groceries $2,000. The \n     family goes through three loaves of bread a day, two gallons \n     of milk and two boxes of cereal.\n       Other changes have occurred. The Hauers have re-established \n     contact with an adult son who was living on the streets in \n     San Diego a year ago. They say he's in an apartment now, \n     doing fine.\n       Chuck Hauer, 61, quit his part-time job because of high \n     blood pressure. He gets a small pension from General Tire and \n     Rubber in Akron, Ohio, where he worked until 1982 as a \n     quality-control inspector.\n       Penny, who discloses her age to no one, has resumed \n     volunteer work she gave up nine years ago when the family \n     moved from Ohio to Montana. From her bedroom, she makes calls \n     for a Toledo agency, Adopt America Network, trying to match \n     disabled children with families who will take them.\n       In three-ring binders, she has thumbnail descriptions of \n     hundreds of kids and potential adoptive families in the \n     agency's nationwide system. She gets new ones in every \n     Monday's mail--two to five families, 10 to 20 children.\n       ``In Los Angeles County (alone), each caseworker has 100 \n     kids. They don't have time to make the matches,'' she said. \n     ``Somebody's got to do it.''\n       Although there are never enough families, Penny Hauer is \n     determined to make a difference. She tells excitedly of \n     hooking up an Ohio couple just last week with three siblings, \n     ages 2 to 4, in Escondido.\n       ``I'm always looking,'' she said. ``I want these kids to \n     have a home.''\n       The Hauers' own story dates to the mid-'70s, when they took \n     in Charity April, a tot with cerebral palsy. The couple, then \n     with four biological kids of their own, fell in love with the \n     foster child and realized there were many more like her in \n     need.\n       ``We just decided to start adopting--not to adopt 35, but \n     that's just what's transpired over the years,'' Penny Hauer \n     said. ``One takes all your undivided attention. When you have \n     a group of children, they interact with each other.\n       Everyone has chores: Charity, 24, changes diapers for seven \n     incontinent siblings. Cristy, 21, helps cook. Chet, 18, takes \n     out the trash.\n       And the family may be growing. The Hauers have applied to \n     adopt four more disabled orphans.\n       ``I think when they carry me out of the house and I'm gone \n     and dead, there's going to be somebody wrapped in my arms, \n     because that's just the way I am,'' Penny Hauer said.\n       Today, the Hauers will squeeze some extra seats up to their \n     30-foot table--actually four oak tables stuck end to end.\n       After offering to provide Thanksgiving dinner to any armed \n     forces member with no place to go, they learned Tuesday that \n     they'll be joined by a mother and three young children whose \n     Navy husband and father is away.\n       ``It's all about sharing,'' said Penny Hauer. ``I hope they \n     like my cooking.''\n       Foothills Republican Women's Club President Dawn Sebaugh, \n     whose group adopted the Hauers last Christmas, has become a \n     year-round helper and friend.\n       ``It's just amazing,'' she said. ``You wonder how someone \n     could take care of, love and treat these children so well.''\n       Sebaugh said her group will be helping the family over the \n     holidays again this year.\n       ``We will make sure Santa's there for Christmas,'' she \n     said. ``I know they could use a couple of extra bedrooms. I \n     don't know if we can do anything (about that), but we're \n     going to try.''\n       Someone else who has fallen for the Hauers is Robert Stein \n     of New York. An HBO producer of in-house promotional videos, \n     he saw Penny Hauer's brief appearance on the ``Rosie \n     O'Donnell'' show in February and was deeply moved.\n       Since then, Stein has spent several days with the family \n     over repeated visits, filming a documentary at his own \n     expense that he intends to pitch to his cable network.\n       ``I was truly impressed witnessing these kids. They really \n     do have a strong sense of love for each other,'' he said.\n       Stein said the Hauers' story could open more eyes and \n     hearts to the disabled.\n       ``People see disabled or handicapped kids or adults in the \n     street, and a lot of times people look down . . . or write \n     them off as people they can't connect with,'' he said. \n     ``These people have been very selfless as far as welcoming \n     kids who may not have had a family life.\n       ``They've really nurtured kids who may have been forgotten \n     in the system, and they've really blossomed.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Obviously, there are many great things we can do in \nthis Congress to promote adoption. Many of them have already been \naccomplished. However, there is much more that should be done, \nbeginning with acknowledging the great work of everyone who has worked \non this issue in America and around the world. Finally, I am delighted \nthat we are taking the necessary time today to bring this important \nissue to the attention of all of our colleagues.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business \nwith a 10-minute restriction on length of comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11786-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11786-S11788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak on an issue which has \nalready been addressed by several of our colleagues earlier in the \nweek. Initially, I was reluctant to discuss this matter for fear of \ncontributing to a charge of politicization of an issue which, in my \njudgment, should not be thought of as political but, rather, one to be \njudged and decided in the finest traditions of our Nation, the \nrelationship of each of the branches of Government carrying out their \nappropriate responsibilities.\n  The reticence I had to discuss this issue was overcome when I heard \nsome of the comments made about our Justice Department and about our \nAttorney General relative to the decision made to file civil claims on \nbehalf of the Federal Government and the citizens of the United States \nagainst the tobacco industry.\n  The purpose of my remarks this afternoon is not to rebut comments \nmade elsewhere; rather, it is my purpose to remind our colleagues of \nthe bedrock principles upon which this body, upon which our Federal \nGovernment operates, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\n  The level of rhetoric on the question of whether the Federal \nGovernment should have initiated civil litigation against the tobacco \nindustry has been very high. The level of analysis, unfortunately, in \nmy opinion, has been quite shallow. In their haste to spring to the \ntobacco industry's defense and to, once again, heap partisan abuse upon \nthe Attorney General and the Justice Department, some Members of \nCongress have disregarded the very nature of our system of government.\n  I have heard it said the Justice Department suit violates both \nseparation of powers and the rule of law. In my opinion, these \naccusations turn the structure of our Government completely on its \nhead. Nearly 200 years ago, Chief Justice John Marshall explained the \npowers of our coordinate branches of Government. In Marbury v. Madison, \nthe seminal decision which established the concept of judicial review, \nthe Chief Justice wrote: The powers of the legislature are defined and \nlimited and that those limits not be mistaken or forgotten, the \nConstitution is written.\n  The Chief Justice went on to say it is emphatically the province and \nduty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\n  For the last 200 years, the American people have understood the \nrespective roles of the three branches of Government. As the national \nlegislature, our duty as Congress is to find and limit it to the role \nof making law. It is the executive branch's role, in part through the \nJustice Department, to enforce that law. It is the Judiciary's role to \ninterpret the law. Each branch of Government must be left to do its \nwork without interference from the other branches.\n  We in Congress have already done our job. We have made the laws which \nthe Justice Department now seeks to enforce. Whether the Justice \nDepartment ultimately prevails is left to a third branch of Government, \nthe judiciary. The only threat to the rule of law in filing this \nlitigation on behalf of the American people against the tobacco \nindustry is posed by those who seek to step beyond their proper \nrelationship and usurp the power granted by the\n\n[[Page S11787]]\n\nConstitution to other branches of Government. It is neither wise nor \nright for members in the legislature to attempt to tell the executive \nhow to enforce the laws or to tell the courts how to interpret the \nlaws. If we practice jurisprudence by press release, we become \nlawmakers, law enforcers, law judges. If we have learned anything at \nthe end of this millennium, it is that such an aggregation of power is \nthe antithesis of the rule of law and is, instead, the imposition of \ntyranny.\n  Throughout the world--from East Timor to Kosovo to Cuba--we encourage \nother countries to follow the rule of law. We must do no less here. We \nhave the greatest judicial system in the world. It resolves disputes \nbased on evidence not rhetoric. Let us allow our court system to \nadjudicate this dispute without congressional interference.\n  Undoubtedly there have been instances when individual Members, if not \na majority of the Senate, have questioned the wisdom of lawsuits \nbrought by the Justice Department.\n  When powerful industries violate federal law, it is not uncommon for \nthem to seek congressional interference. When individuals or groups \nhave used their power and privilege to dominate others, and that power \nwas challenged by the law, they have shrilled--``foul.''\n  Many disagreed when President Theodore Roosevelt's Justice Department \nsued to break up Standard Oil. Similar complaints were heard when \nPresident Reagan's Justice Department sued AT\n  And we can all remember the outcry in some quarters in the 1950's and \n1960's when the Justice Department sought to enforce civil rights \nguarantees.\n  While some influential members might have advocated congressional \nintervention, in none of those cases did the Congress step in to \nattempt to tell the Justice Department whom it can or cannot sue. We \nmust not do that now.\n  Some have asked why Congress was not consulted prior to this suit \nbeing filed. The questioners appear to have forgotten much of what has \nhappened in the last year.\n  Setting aside the fact that the Justice Department has no obligation \nto ask Congress for permission to enforce the law, Congress was well \naware this litigation was under consideration.\n  In his State of the Union address, the President discussed the \npossibility of this tobacco suit, by announcing that he had asked the \nJustice Department to prepare a litigation plan against the tobacco \nindustry. Specifically, the President said:\n\n       So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is \n     preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to \n     court--and with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.\n\n  It would have been hard to be clearer.\n  Congress also considered the potential for a federal tobacco suit \nwhen it protected the states' tobacco settlements from federal \nincursion. In the budget resolution, passed on March 25, 1999, I \noffered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which stated that the proceeds \nof a successful federal lawsuit should be used to shore up the Medicare \nTrust Fund and help to establish a prescription drug benefit. That \namendment passed without dissent.\n  In March of this year, during debate of the budget resolution, the \nSenate defeated an amendment offered by Senators Specter and Harkin to \nplace strings on the states' tobacco settlements. Several Members of \nthis body, including myself, stated that if the federal government \nbelieved it had claims against the tobacco industry, the Justice \nDepartment was free to bring those claims but that the Federal \nGovernment should not attempt to recoup State settlement proceeds. The \nmatter was discussed yet again when the Commerce, Justice, and State \nAppropriations Subcommittee attempted to impede the Justice \nDepartment's ability to pursue litigation against the tobacco industry. \nNot only was the offensive report language effectively removed through \na colloquy, the chairman of the subcommittee expressly acknowledged \nthat:\n\n       Nothing in the bill or the report language prohibits the \n     Department from using generally appropriated funds, including \n     funds from the Fees and Expenses of Witnesses Account, to \n     pursue this litigation if the Department concludes such \n     litigation has merit under existing law.\n\n  Quite obviously, the Justice Department has reached the very \nconclusion discussed on the floor of the Senate just a few months ago.\n  Surely it is absurd to suggest that the Justice Department somehow \nblind-sided Congress with the announcement of this lawsuit. But again, \nthese facts beg the question. The Justice Department does not need my \npermission or your permission, or the permission of anyone else in this \nbody to do its job, which is to enforce the law. Conversely, if we \nattempt to prevent the Justice Department from doing its job, we are \nengaging in obstruction of justice. Others have questioned the \nmotivation for bringing this suit. I believe the motivation for the \nAttorney General's decision is similar to that of the attorneys general \nin many of our states: to enforce the law--and by doing so--protect the \nAmerican people and particularly the children of America.\n  The suit seeks to end the cycle of addiction to nicotine, an \naddiction created in part by false advertising and advertising \ntargeting the youth of our country. It also seeks to recompense \ntaxpayers for the billions of dollars this addiction has cost them--the \ntaxpayers of America. These are motivations which should be celebrated, \nnot ridiculed.\n  The merits of this case rightfully will be determined in a court of \nlaw--not in this body, not in the Congress. But since some of my \ncolleagues have seen fit to put on their own imaginary black robes and \npretend to judge this case, I would like to offer a few observations of \nmy own.\n  It has been argued that the civil RICO statute does not apply in this \ncase because tobacco is a legal product. But this argument ignores the \nclaims made by the Justice Department.\n  The Justice Department does not allege that tobacco itself is \nillegal. Nor does it suggest that the tobacco industry broke the law by \nselling or marketing tobacco products to adults.\n  Instead, the Justice Department argues that tobacco companies \nviolated the civil RICO statute--a Federal law, of course, enacted by \nCongress--by conspiring to illegally market their cigarettes to \nchildren and by wilfully withholding critical information from the \npublic and the Government.\n  The tobacco companies have known for years what we are just beginning \nto learn. If they don't hook you early, they'll never hook you. And if \nthey never hook you, their business dies. It's as simple as that. \nTobacco relies by necessity on addicting our children.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 89 percent of all \nsmokers begin smoking before age 18. So, Mr. President, does it \nsurprise us that the tobacco industry has spent millions of dollars \neach year to addict our children? It certainly should not.\n  But whether it surprises us or not, we have an obligation to do \nsomething about it. In this case, we should simply let the Justice \nDepartment enforce the laws that we have passed.\n  As documents introduced in state court actions have demonstrated, \nsome of the marketing efforts of these companies have been directed at \nchildren as young as 10 years old.\n  The fact that tobacco is legal for adults does not give these \ncompanies the right to market their products illegally to children or \nto misrepresent or conceal information. These allegations, if proven, \nwill constitute a violation of the RICO statute.\n  I am even more disturbed by another argument made by the pro-tobacco \nforces. They argue that even if the Justice Department can prove the \ntobacco companies lied and illegally marketed their products, the \nFederal Government has suffered no damages because tobacco use imposes \nno net cost to the taxpayer.\n  Let me restate that: the Federal Government has suffered no damages \nbecause tobacco use imposes no net cost to the taxpayer.\n  Let us be clear on what is being argued here. Big Tobacco says that \nthe taxpayers incur no increased costs because tobacco kills people \nprematurely. Therefore, the industry argues that the taxpayers save \nmoney by not having to pay out Social Security or Medicare funds to \nAmericans whose lives are cut short by tobacco before they reach 65.\n  I imagine there might be some who would congratulate the tobacco \nindustry for saving us all this money by killing our fellow American \ncitizens before\n\n[[Page S11788]]\n\nthey become a burden. I, for one, and I am confident the vast majority \nof Americans, would much rather spend money on Social Security and \nMedicare than have millions of our fellow citizens die a slow, a \npainful, and a premature death.\n  Along with being a ghoulish and despicable argument, the industry's \ntwisted logic that it has imposed no net cost on the American taxpayer \nhas also been properly rejected on public policy grounds.\n  In January of 1998, the trial court in the Minnesota State suit \nagainst the tobacco industry upheld the motion of the State of \nMinnesota for summary judgment, effectively stating that the State of \nMinnesota had established its case with no further evidence required.\n  In granting this motion, Judge Fitzpatrick ruled the tobacco industry \ndefendants could not use the fact that they killed people prematurely \nto their advantage in defending against the suit.\n  Predictably, the friends of tobacco also make another slippery slope \nargument. If the Justice Department can sue tobacco companies, they \nsay, what other industries will not be safe? Will fast food or beef or \ndairy industries be the next in line?\n  This argument is truly offensive. It is an affront to me personally \nand should be an affront to all legitimate owners of businesses, large \nand small, who contribute to this Nation, instead of destroying its \nhealth. My family happens to have been in the dairy business for almost \n70 years. I take great offense at the comparison between the tobacco \nindustry and the dairy industry. Neither the dairy industry, the beef \nindustry, fast food industry, nor any other is comparable to tobacco. \nThe tobacco industry is unique. Only the tobacco industry has \nstonewalled and lied to the American public and the American Government \nfor half a century about the known addictive nature of its products. If \nanyone in this body wants to argue that the dairy or beef industries \nare analogous to big tobacco, then I invite them to come down to the \nSenate floor and let's have that debate. Better yet, go to Florida or \nWisconsin and tell cattle and dairy farmers they should be treated like \nbig tobacco, an industry which depends on destroying the health of our \nchildren in order to succeed.\n  Let's spend a moment talking about those children. When all the legal \narguments and all the political rhetoric fall away, our children \nremain. They, not lawsuits, not politicians, are our most important \nconcern. It is our children who have been the targets of a predatory \neffort by the tobacco industry to entice them into an addiction which \nwill eventually kill them.\n  We also know that early cigarette habits are directly related to \nother drug use. A 1994 Surgeon General report showed that cigarettes \nare a gateway drug, a significant risk factor to increased incidents of \nalcohol and illicit drug use.\n  This report highlighted the relationship of teenage smoking as a \nprecursor to the use of alcohol and drugs, including recent data from \nthe National Institute on Drug and Alcohol Abuse's ``Monitoring the \nFuture'' project which showed that 33 percent of those surveyed \nadmitted to starting drinking at the same time they started the use of \ntobacco. This same survey also indicated that 23 percent of the \nrespondents began using both cigarettes and marijuana in the same year.\n\n  Importantly, 65 percent of the respondents smoked cigarettes before \nthey used marijuana. This relationship was more pronounced for cocaine: \n98 percent of individuals who used cocaine first smoked cigarettes. \nPutting an end to the tobacco company's illegal marketing efforts \ntoward our Nation's youth will reduce children's smoking. This, in \nturn, will go a long way to helping combat the use of other illegal \ndrugs.\n  I know the Justice Department's suit is not a panacea. It will take a \ncombination of litigation and legislation to solve this problem.\n  A court, for instance, cannot grant enhanced Food and Drug \nAdministration authority to classify nicotine as a drug and cigarettes \nas a drug-delivery device, a powerful tool to prevent the tobacco \nindustry from manipulating the product to addict even more people. Only \nCongress can give the Food and Drug Administration that authority.\n  Should Congress find the tobacco industry responsible for the high \nrate of youth smoking, Congress may have to impose penalties on big \ntobacco based on the industry's failure to meet statutorily defined \nyouth smoking reduction targets. A court cannot bind future entrants \ninto the tobacco market to marketing and advertising restrictions which \nwere entered into by the previous participants in the tobacco industry \nthrough a consent decree. That may also require congressional \ninvolvement.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on all of these and other \nnecessary legislative issues, but this suit is, however, an important, \na useful step in enforcing the rule of law. It is important in \nprotecting our children and our grandchildren.\n  I am proud to call Janet Reno a friend. As an American, I applaud her \nfor her hard work, for her tenacity, and courage in the face of fierce \npartisan opposition. I say thank you, Madam Attorney General, on behalf \nof all of America's citizens.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that on \nMonday, October 4, at a time determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination, and it be \nconsidered under the following limitations: Executive Calendar No. 172, \nRonnie White to be District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, \nunder a 1-hour time limitation divided as follows: 45 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member; 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Ashcroft.\n  I further ask consent that following that debate, the Senate then \nbegin debate en bloc on the nominations of Calendar No. 215, Ted \nStewart, and Calendar No. 209, Raymond Fisher.\n  I further ask consent that following the granting of this consent, \nthe nominations of Calendar Nos. 213 and 214 be immediately confirmed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  I further ask consent that following the debate on Monday on the \nthree nominations, the Senate resume legislative session.\n  I finally ask consent that at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, October 5, the \nSenate resume executive session and proceed to consecutive votes, first \non the nomination of Ronnie White, to be followed by a vote on the \nnomination of Ted Stewart, to be followed by a vote on the nomination \nof Raymond Fisher. I also ask consent that following the votes, again \nthe President be notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  Before the Chair rules, I yield to the Democratic leader for his \ncomments and an appropriate response from me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the majority leader's effort to try to move \nthese nominations along. Before I make some comment, let me ask the \nmajority leader what his intentions are with regard to Marsha Berzon, \nthe nominee to be the United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth \nCircuit, as\n\n[[Page S11789]]\n\nwell as Richard Paez, a similar nominee for the Ninth Circuit. Can the \nmajority leader give me his current intentions with regard to those two \nnominations?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield under his \nreservation to respond, let me say again, I appreciate the cooperation \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle, from the Judiciary Committee, \nand other Senators who have interest in these nominations. It has been \na very delicate balance to work through a process where we could get \nthese nominations confirmed.\n  The nominations of Mr. Marrero from, I believe, New York, and Mr. \nLorenz from California have not been controversial. They have been \ncleared for quite some time. We had the unfortunate situation with \nregard to the nomination of Ted Stewart where we had a cloture vote, \nwhich I think both sides would prefer not to have happened. There are \nreasons for it. But I think it is important we not start down that \ntrail. Both sides have indicated we do not want to start having cloture \nvotes to determine the confirmation of judges. Then also there is the \nnomination of Mr. Fisher for the Ninth Circuit.\n  So we have here a process where we can have a voice vote on two of \nthem and some debate and votes on the other three: White, Stewart, and \nFisher. That is a significant undertaking. That will get us into the \nprocess where judges--certainly judges who are not controversial--will \nnot be held up because of controversial judges in other areas. So I \njust wanted to kind of go through that whole process.\n  With regard to the other two nominations Senator Daschle asks about, \nI will continue to work with the Democratic leader as well as other \nMembers on his side of the aisle and on my side of the aisle in \nscheduling executive nominations. I have to go through a process where \nI have to notify Members that a judicial nomination may be called up \nand see if there are problems with it, see if that can be worked out, \nsee if we are going to need an extended period of time of debate, see \nif there is a threatened filibuster.\n  So I will work, as I have in the past, to see if we can get these \nnominations cleared so we can move forward. I will continue to do that. \nI will do that on specifically the two that have been mentioned. I will \ntry to find a way to have them considered. I cannot confirm at this \npoint when or how that will be done, but I will continue to work on it.\n  That is one of the reasons that moving these other judges is \nimportant. Because it takes time to get the nominations cleared. When \nyou have five that you are close to getting cleared, once you get those \nout of the way, then you can focus your attention on the remaining \njudges on the calendar.\n  By the way, I understand there are other basically noncontroversial \njudges on whom the Judiciary Committee will be meeting, maybe in the \nnext week or two, and there will be more judges on the calendar. So we \nwant to keep moving the ones that can be cleared because there are \ndistricts and circuits around the country that do need these judges to \nbe confirmed. I think we can get this request agreed to. It will be \npositive, and we will be able to continue to work together.\n  I hope that is helpful in responding to Senator Daschle's question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is helpful. With that assurance, I will certainly \nnot object to the request propounded by the majority leader. He has \nmade it to me privately. It is my hope we will continue to work. These \nare important matters. As the majority leader has heard me say, and \nothers say, now for some time, in some cases they have been pending not \nfor months but for years. For anyone to be held that long is just an \nextraordinary unfairness, not only to the nominees but to the system \nitself.\n  The majority leader has also noted that a cloture vote is an \nunfortunate matter. Actually, a cloture vote is a recognition of the \ndifficulty to move judges. A cloture vote is probably no more \nunfortunate than a hold. We have people who are maintaining holds on \njudges, which is also very unfortunate. A hold is nothing more than an \nintent to filibuster.\n  So I hope our colleagues will drop their holds and will recognize \nthat taking hostages in this form is not the right way to proceed and \ndoes not live up to the traditions of the Senate when it comes to the \nexpeditious consideration of individuals who want to serve in public \nlife.\n  The majority leader also mentioned--I will mention this just briefly \nbecause it is another important factor in our decision to want to \ncooperate with the majority--the decision and the commitment made by \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee that he will hold hearings and \nhe will move other nominees forward. It is important that all of the \nnominees who are pending before the Judiciary Committee be considered. \nHe has indicated he will do his best to ensure they are considered.\n  Our ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, has been extremely \npersistent and dedicated to that effort. I appreciate his contributions \nas well.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11789-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11789-S11790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           NOMINATIONS OF M.

James Lorenz, of California, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Southern District of California.\n       Victor Marrero, of New York, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Southern District of New York.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Victor Marrero to serve as a judge on the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  I express my appreciation to Chairman Hatch for moving this \nnomination expeditiously to the floor.\n  This is one of those moments where you cannot help but feel proud \nabout this country and about how the American Dream is not a myth but a \nreality.\n  Where else in the world could a young child, with no knowledge of the \nnative language, go to school, learn English, become valedictorian of \nhis high school, and embark upon a distinguished and towering career in \npublic service?\n  Only in America.\n  That is the abridged story of Victor Marrero. He came to this country \nwith practically nothing. He studied and learned in school. He was \ninspired to public service by President John F. Kennedy.\n  And from that day on, he has never strayed from helping people, \nteaching them, from trying to make the world a better and more just \nplace.\n  President Clinton nominated Ambassador Marrero to this judgeship upon \nmy recommendation and on the basis of the Ambassador's extensive \nexperiences and accomplishments as both a practitioner of law and a \npublic servant.\n  Ambassador Marrero's legal career is extensive and distinguished. \nBetween his two stints in public service, he spent twelve years as a \npartner at two prominent New York City law firms.\n  Ambassador Marrero's public service career is almost without equal in \nits breadth and degree of achievement. He has served as Executive \nDirector of New York City's Department of City Planning, Chairman of \nthe city's Planning Commission, Commissioner of New York State's \nDivision of Housing and Community Renewal, and Under Secretary at the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  In 1993, President Clinton appointed him United States Ambassador to \nthe Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. In 1998, be \nbecame United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States.\n  Ambasssador Marrero, through charitable work, has helped to enhance \nNew York City's public schools, libraries, museums and parks, and to \nhelp bring opportunity to other Puerto Ricans and Hispanics.\n  Perhaps the most telling testament to the esteem in which Ambassador \nMarrero is held is the fact that he has been confirmed by the United \nStates Senate on three separate occasions over the past twenty years.\n  I am pleased today that Ambassador Marrero will be adding a fourth \nSenate confirmation to an already impressive resume.\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say, with both the leaders on the floor, \nthis is a matter that has had some discussion. I appreciate the \ndiscussions I have had with both my leader, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, and the majority leader of the Senate, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. The distinguished senior \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I have also had lengthy discussions \nabout this.\n  As I have stated before--I will not hold the floor here now because I \nknow others are waiting to speak; I will speak on this later this \nafternoon--I do have a concern about the slow pace of nominations being \nconfirmed, especially with those such as the Paez and Berzon \nnominations that have waiting years, not just weeks and months. We \nshould be moving forward on those nominations, as well.\n  I have also received the assurance of the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that we will expedite, as much as \npossible, the hearing schedule and the executive session schedule of \nthe Committee and that we will get more nominations promptly to the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  One thing I have learned after 25 years here is that in the last few \ndays of any session we suddenly find a lot can be done--provided items \nare available on the calendar. While it is a time, I am sure, to which \nthe two leaders look forward with great anticipation--and they have a \nchance to earn a higher place in Heaven because their patience will be \nstrained but they will not allow the strain to break them--I hope we \nwill have a number of judges who might then be available to start the \nDecember, if not the January, sessions of their courts.\n  I know that Bruce Cohen, counsel on the Democratic side, and Manus \nCooney, Senator Hatch's chief counsel on the Republican side, have been \nworking hard to make progress on these matters.\n  I think this is a good step forward. I think it is a positive thing. \nBut I hope the leader will be able to use his persuasion on the \nRepublican side for Berzon and Paez. I know there are those who will \nnot vote for them, but allow them to have an up-or-down vote.\n  I can assure the Democrat leader and I can assure the majority leader \nthat I have canvassed this side of the aisle and there is no objection \non the Democratic side--none whatsoever--to going forward with Berzon \nand Paez.\n  I know some Senators have told me on the other side they will vote \nagainst them. I have a number of Senators on the other side who say \nthey will vote for them. We ought to give them the courtesy of the \nvote.\n  I know that requires scheduling and work, but I urge that upon the \nleadership. I want the leaders to know there is no objection on this \nside.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like the Record to reflect that \nSenator Hatch is in agreement with this request. He has worked on it \nvery diligently; also, that he has made a commitment to have hearings \nand votes on additional nominees in the near future. I do not recall \nhim specifying a day. I think you have some tentative date you have \nworked on.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We do.\n  Mr. LOTT. One other request.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for the time \nand also my chairman from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, for permitting me \nto speak during this time.\n  I rise to address an issue of critical importance to our national \nsecurity: containing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nby North Korea. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I see this as one of the \nmost pressing security issues facing America. The Clinton \nadministration has been working hard at containing and countering this \nthreat, holding important discussions with the North Koreans, most \nrecently in Berlin. Last Friday, a North Korean spokesman stated that \nNorth Korea would ``not launch a missile while the talks are underway \nwith a view to creating an atmosphere more favorable for the talks'' \nwith the United States.\n  This, I believe, is a very positive step. North Korea's development \nand August 1998 testing of a long-range missile drew America's \nattention to this emerging threat to our national security. Even more \ndirectly, it raised concerns about Hawaii's security. Following this \ntest, the North Koreans began preparing to launch a second missile, \nwhich our intelligence analysts believe could deliver a several-hundred \nkilogram payload to Hawaii and to Alaska. North Korean preparations to \ntest launch a much larger missile prompted the administration to take \nmultilateral efforts to persuade the North Koreans not to launch and to \nrestrict their missile development.\n  Following negotiations in Berlin between the United States and the \nNorth Koreans last week, the President announced his decision to ease \nsome sanctions against North Korea administered under the Trading with \nthe Enemy Act, the Defense Production Act, and the Department of \nCommerce's Export Administration regulations. So far these efforts have \nbeen partially successful, and the North Koreans have agreed to a \nmoratorium on missile launches during this series of talks with the \nUnited States. The administration is to be congratulated for the \nintensity with which it has pursued a solution to this dangerous \nproblem.\n  There has been some criticism of the administration's approach, with \na few critics arguing that the administration is rewarding bad behavior \nor giving in to extortion demands. I do not believe this is the case. \nThe formal announcement by the North Korean Government stating there \nwould be no missile tests while talks are underway with the United \nStates is a clear indication that North Koreans have accepted the new \napproach in relations outlined by Secretary Perry. There is no doubt \nthat the North Koreans have an active missile export program which is \ndependent upon imports of foreign technology and exports of cruise \nmissiles.\n  Therefore, it is in our national security interest to limit North \nKorean missile development and especially North Korean missile exports \ntoward which the Berlin agreement takes a firm step. By lifting some \neconomic sanctions, holding out the possibility of lifting additional \nsanctions, and suggesting to the North Koreans that the United States \nis willing to normalize relations with North Korea, the North Koreans \nhave been given a powerful incentive towards agreeing to a permanent \nmoratorium on missile development. Reimposing sanctions would send such \na strong signal of distrust with North Korean actions that it could \nwell set back North Korean efforts to achieve international \nrespectability to lower levels than those today.\n\n  This is not a sanctions relief for moratorium deal. It leads, \ninstead, to a\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\nnormalization of relations for a reduction in threat. Normalization is \npredicated upon North Korean willingness to change their behavior in \nterms of terrorism, drug dealing, and proliferation, including a \nverifiable end to their nuclear warhead and missile programs. We are \nnot looking at an immediate end to the hostile atmosphere that has \nworsened tensions on the Korean peninsula. We must determine what our \nlong-term objectives are on the Korean peninsula. If our ultimate goal \nis the peaceful unification of the Koreas as one democratic state, we \nneed to assess more effectively how our current strategy will lead us \nin that direction.\n  I look forward to the administration's elaborating its next steps \ntowards North Korea. So far, the administration has worked hard and \nwell at containing tensions on the peninsula. It is not a success which \nmust come easily, given the difficulty of dealing with the North \nKoreans. More hard work and the support of Congress will be needed to \nmake a lasting peace possible.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Alaska for granting me \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my good \nfriend and colleague from Hawaii with whom I have a great rapport.

Mr. President, my purpose in coming to the floor today \nis to tell you about an extraordinary Alaskan family. And to pay \ntribute to a mother who took from her immigrant heritage and from her \nadopted Alaskan home, the courage and tenacity to excel at a time when \nsuccessful women were not the norm and too often uncelebrated. Her name \nis Mary Mikami Rouse. She died August 7th at the age of 87.\n  Her story begins in Japan with the arrival of a fifth son in the \nMikami family in 1864. Shortly after the birth of Mary's father, Goro \nMikami, Japan began a period of social and political revolution and \ntempestuous change. The Shogunate lost power and Japan's imperial house \nwas restored to a position of prestige and authority. The feudal system \nwas eroding and there was a remarkable degree of westernization in all \nareas of Japanese life.\n  Goro Mikami's father was a vassal of the Shogun, an admiral who was \nultimately responsible for a navy failure that contributed to the \nsubsequent loss of power by the Shogun. His sense of honor demanded he \ncommit seppuku, or suicide for that loss. Fortuitously, the emperor \nstopped him from that action, pardoned him and made him the head of the \ncountry's new naval academy. In that position he got to know a number \nof American naval officers.\n  As the fifth son to a family that was Samurai, or part of the \naristocracy, Goro Mikami made a decision that reflected the changing \ntimes in which he found himself. He rebelled against an arranged \nmarriage that was in the offing and he and a friend, who were studying \nin Tokyo around 1885, decided to head for the American West. Plans went \nawry and the friend stayed behind, but Mikami took the ship to a new \nlife. He settled in San Francisco where at some point he attended the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley to learn English. Two of his \nbrothers went on to serve in Japan's diplomatic corps. The family name \nwas Kondo, Goro was given the last name of Mikami in order to rescue a \nbranch of the family that was dying out--not unusual in Japanese \nculture.\n  Rumor says Mikami was drawn to the goldfields in Alaska, and there is \nsome evidence he may have worked as a civilian aboard a U.S. Coast \nGuard Cutter. By this time, he had Americanized his name from Goro to \nGeorge. But whatever his adventures, Mikami made a monumental decision \nin 1910, to take a trip back to Japan. His school friend had become a \nfamous lawyer in the intervening years, and put together a huge \nhomecoming for Mikami. At the homecoming events he met Mine Morioka, \nwho had served as a nurse in the Russian Japanese War. They married and \nreturned to the States in 1911, this time to Seattle. In 1912, Mary \nMikami was born.\n  About 1915, the family, including Mary's younger sister Alice, moved \nto Seward, Alaska. It appears George found work on the Alaskan railroad \nthen being constructed between Seward and Anchorage. That same year, \nMary's brother Harry was born. By 1918, the family had moved on to \nAnchorage where they opened George's Tailor Shop on Fourth avenue \nbetween ``B'' and ``C\" Streets. Flora was born in 1919, and the family \nwas complete. The Mikamis were either the first or one of the first \nJapanese families to settle in Anchorage.\n  Prior to the 1940s, Anchorage's population never moved above 2,000. \nAlaska was still a territory and not a stopping ground for the faint of \nheart. It was peopled with pioneers and adventurers seeking wealth, \nanonymity or a new way of life. The Mikami family persevered and \nprospered in this still rough and tumble atmosphere. They met the \nchallenges of a new business, a young family, assimilating into a \ndifferent culture and mastering a new language.\n  The second daughter Alice Mikami Snodgrass, who still lives in \nPalmer, Alaska, remembers her mother as a strict disciplinarian. She \nrecalls the lure of swing-sets and seesaws and clamoring friends, while \nher mother kept the Mikami kids inside until they finished their \nschoolwork. Even in summer, there were sums to do and chores before \nplay.\n\n  In Japanese tradition, children were kept at home until they were \nfive and then sent to school. Up to that point, the Mikami children \nspoke Japanese. Mary's relatives explain that she was highly \ntraumatized when she entered school and realized she had to learn \nEnglish.\n  But Mary's mother's dedication to her children's scholarship resulted \nin all four children being named valedictorian of their respective \ngraduating classes in Anchorage's public high school. Mary Mikami took \nthe honors first and subsequently attended the Alaska Agricultural \nCollege and School of Mines in Fairbanks. She graduated with highest \nhonors in 1934. The next year the College was renamed the University of \nAlaska at Fairbanks. Her sister Alice recalls that Doctor Charles E. \nBunnell, the first President of the University, at the time literally \ncame to the towns, visited with the families, and recruited students by \nbringing along a University basketball team to play the local high \nschool and community teams.\n  After graduating, Mary joined an anthropological expedition jointly \nsponsored by the college and the Department of the Interior to St. \nLawrence Island, located in the windswept Bering Sea between Alaska and \nSiberia. The expedition studied Alaskan prehistory. She was the only \nwoman on the team; another team member, Roland Snodgrass, was to become \nher brother-in-law.\n  After the expedition, she went to work for the University of Alaska \nMuseum and was considering graduate school, perhaps at Columbia \nUniversity. Instead, she met Froelich G. Rainey, a Yale graduate who \nbecame the head of the Museum. He influenced her to go to Yale instead \nand helped her make connections there. The intrepid Mary left Alaska \nfor the first time in her young life and took the steamer to Seattle \nand then the train across country to a different challenge--a new \nworld. Like her mother and father before her, she entered a new life \nwith few connections to the past, and no one to greet her and ease the \ntransition.\n  She adapted and continued her success. She met and married fellow \ngraduate student Irving Rouse. Both received Ph.D's and remained at \nYale for lifelong careers of learning and teaching. Mary Mikami Rouse \nwas a visiting lecturer, an editor of translations, instruction \nassistant at the Institute of Oriental Languages and a research \nassistant. She also served as an editorial assistant for American \nAntiquity, Journal of the Society for American Archaeology. Her \nhusband, now retired, was the editor of that journal and is a well \nknown anthropologist specializing in the Caribbean.\n  Back in Alaska, her brother and sisters followed her to the \nUniversity of\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\nAlaska and brother Harry also received a Ph.D from Yale. Sister Alice \nmarried Roland Snodgrass who later served as Director of the Division \nof Agriculture in Gov. Walter Hickel's first administration. Their son \nJack is an attorney in Palmer. Mary's youngest sister, Flora Mikami \nNewcomb lives in Vancouver, B.C. Her brother, Harry, is deceased.\n  The elder Mikamis sold the tailor shop and retired to Los Angeles \njust before World War II. Instead of the surcease they sought in \nretirement, they were moved to a Japanese internment camp in Arizona--a \nfate the four children escaped. In honor of their parents, the four \nMikami children established the Mikami Scholarship at the University of \nAlaska Fairbanks, and it is available today to any sophomore or junior \nstudent.\n  Mary and Irving Rouse were the parents of two boys, Peter M. Rouse of \nWashington, D.C. and David C. Rouse of Philadelphia. David is a \nlandscape architect and urban designer. In this body, we are most \nfamiliar with Pete Rouse, who many of you will recognize as the Chief \nof Staff to our esteemed Minority Leader Tom Daschle. Mary may have \nbeen as stern about studies as was her mother because Pete has a B. A. \nfrom Colby College, an M.A. from the London School of Economics and an \nM. A. from Harvard University. In the mid-1970s, Pete and Tom Daschle \nwere both legislative assistants to Sen. James Abourezk, D-S.D. While \nat the Kennedy School at Harvard, Pete became friends with an Alaskan \nnamed Terry Miller, who was to become an Alaskan Lt. Governor. In 1979, \nMiller asked Pete to come to Alaska and work for him in the State \nHouse, reestablishing Pete's family ties with the state.\n  The winds of political fortune soon brought him back to Capitol Hill \nand Chief-of-Staff positions with Representative Richard Durbin, \nRepresentative Thomas Daschle and then Senator Daschle. But Pete never \nforgot Alaska and his many friends there. His continuing efforts and \ninterest in our State are greatly appreciated.\n  Mary Mikami's life was an American success story. Hers was an example \nof achievement against great odds. She honored both of her cultures and \nher family. She was a combination of Samurai pride, Alaskan fortitude \nand New England grit. Mary was her own woman before anyone had heard \nthe term ``women's liberation''. She was also a lifelong Democrat, and \nI'm sure was always very proud of the path her son has followed. Today, \nI join my colleagues in expressing condolences to the family and \nfriends of Mary Mikami Rouse. Alaska is proud to claim her as one of \nits pioneers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Alaska in \nremembering Mary Mikami Rouse. Mary Rouse recently passed away, at the \nage of 87, leaving behind an accomplished family and a legacy of \nacademic achievement.\n  She was born in the United States in 1912, the daughter of Japanese \nimmigrants who had come to the United States to seek their fortune. \nGrowing up in Alaska, Mary Mikami excelled academically and graduated \nwith the highest honors from Alaska Agricultural College and the School \nof Mines, which later became the University of Alaska.\n  After completing her college work in Alaska, she traveled to New \nHaven, CT, where she attended Yale University, where she met and \nmarried Irving Rouse and earned her Ph.D. Throughout her life she \ncontinued living in New Haven, working as lecturer, translator, and \ninstructor at Yale's Institute for Oriental Languages.\n  With her husband Irving, Mary had two sons, David Rouse, an urban \nlandscape architect in Philadelphia, and Peter Rouse, my chief of staff \nand a man who has been my friend and closest adviser for now more than \n15 years.\n  All of us who know and work with Pete are aware of the enormous \ninfluence his mother Mary had on him. His success in life stems from \nthe legacy of his mother--a keen intelligence, unparalleled integrity \nand judgment, and basic human kindness.\n  The values he brings to this institution each day are, no doubt, the \nproduct of his upbringing and his mother's influence. In fact, it is \nher character we have the privilege of seeing reflected in her son each \nand every day.\n  For those of us who have the good fortune to work with Pete Rouse, \nthere is no way we can thank his mother Mary for all that she has done \nto influence his life, for all that she did to ensure we have the good \nfortune to call Pete Rouse our friend, to call him, now, our coworker, \nand for me to rely upon him each and every moment of every day to the \nextent that I do.\n  I, and all who know Pete, share his loss now. We are grateful that \nshe has had the good life, the successful life, the extraordinary life \nthat she has had, and we all wish Pete and his family well under these \ncircumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11792-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11792-S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IT CAME FROM SEATTLE: TRUE HORROR STORIES OF THE EPA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there is a letter in your mailbox from \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Your pulse quickens. Beads of \nperspiration break out on your brow as you tear open the envelope to \nsee what the most feared agency in Washington has in store for you.\n  At least that's how it used to be. Now the Environmental Protection \nAgency appears determined to replace the IRS as the government agency \nyou really don't want to hear from. Consider the following true stories \nfrom my office case files:\n  A small land owner in Ketchikan recently opened a letter from the EPA \nto learn that he had been assessed a $40,000 fine for a wetlands \nviolation. He knew he had problems with the EPA, but he had been \nmeeting with EPA officials and had been encouraged that an acceptable \nmitigation plan might be negotiated. The $40,000 fine hit him like a \nbolt of lightning our of a clear blue sky.\n  Meanwhile, in Anchorage the commanding general of the United States \nArmy in Alaska received a letter from the EPA. The General knew he had \na problem with the powerplant at Fort Wainwright that was not in full \ncompliance with the Clear Air Act, but he and his staff had been \nworking diligently to bring the plant into compliance. With the help of \nthe Alaska Congressional Delegation, he had received a $15.9 million \nappropriation for new pollution control measures. He had budgeted \nanother $22 million for additional upgrades next year. The Army had, of \ncourse, informed EPA of these efforts to bring the plant into \ncompliance, and the EPA seemed satisfied. But the letter the General \nnow held in his hand said that EPA was assessing the U.S. Army with a \n$16 million fine--a fine greater than the combined value of all EPA \nfines ever assessed against the U.S. Army nationwide. Another bolt of \nlightning out of a clear blue sky.\n  These stories suggest that the EPA hasn't learned a fundamental \nlesson understood by every decent cop--good law enforcement requires \ndiscretion. When you're pulled over by a trooper for going a few miles \nper hour over the speed limit and are calmly discussing the matter with \nthe officer, you have every right to expect that you will not be beaten \nsenseless with a nightstick. And when a small businessman, residential \nlandowner, or U.S. Army general finds himself engaged with the EPA over \nan alleged violation and is making an effort to find a resolution, he \nshould not be slammed with unprecedented, punitive fines.\n  We need laws to protect the environment, but the interpretation and \nenforcement of law must be blended with common sense and judgment. Take \nwetlands protection, for instance. Some wetlands perform critical roles \nin protecting water supplies and providing important wildlife habitat. \nOther wetlands are lower value muskeg. The letter of the law may not \nmake the distinction, but human beings with the responsibility of \nenforcing the law should understand the difference.\n  These ``bolt from the blue'' letters that Alaskans are getting in \ntheir mailbox are postmarked Seattle. The EPA regional office ``in \ncharge'' of Alaska is in Seattle. What the EPA folks in Seattle know of \nAlaska they get from their brief visits, or from their small staff in \nAnchorage. They aren't our neighbors. They aren't Alaskans. I want to \nchange that.\n  At the risk of enticing the mad dog from an adjacent neighborhood to \nour own backyard, I am renewing my efforts to force EPA to create a \nseparate region for Alaska. That way, the EPA\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\nofficials writing these letters will at least have a chance to better \nunderstand the environment in which we live. They would live in our \nneighborhoods, and send their kids to school with ours. If you're going \nto get fined, they'll have to look us in the eye. There would be no \nmore scary certified letters from distant bureaucrats in Seattle.\n  In the meantime, I'm inviting the Regional Administrator of the EPA \nto come and stand with me on Gravina Island, across from Ketchikan, \nwhere 13 feet of rain falls each year. As the rain from a driving \nrainstorm fills his wingtips and rivulets of water cascade down the \nhill into the Tongass Narrows, I'll ask him to point out where the \nwetlands end and the uplands begin. I'll also ask him to describe the \nirreplaceable environmental value of the muskeg that the EPA wants us \nto keep undisturbed. If I'm not satisfied with his answers I'll advise \nhim to start looking at real estate in Alaska, and suggest he hold a \ngarage sale in preparation for a move out of Seattle. Meanwhile, be \nafraid. Be very afraid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11793-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NUCLEAR TROJAN HORSE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, physicians use a specially engineered \nradioactive molecule as sort of a nuclear Trojan horse in the battle \nagainst pancreatic cancer. The molecule is absorbed by the cancer cells \nand only by the cancer cells. Once inside, the radiation breaks up the \nDNA and kills the tumor cell--another amazing tool in the war on \ncancer.\n  The physicians, technicians and even clean-up crews must carefully \ndispose of the medium that stored the radioactive molecule and other \nitems that may have come in contact with the radioactive materials. \nThere are strict procedures for disposing of such wastes by hospitals, \nuniversities, power plants and research facilities.\n  But, in a way, that waste itself is a Trojan horse, sitting \ninnocently in garages or closets in sites all over the country, waiting \nto be opened up and released on the public by an act of terrorism or of \nnature like the recent floods the East sustained, or the earthquakes \nand wildfires more common to the West coast. Most dangerous would be \nfire which would put the radioactive materials into smoke that could be \nbreathed by anyone near the fire.\n  Why is this a problem? Because there are only three facilities in the \nentire country that safely can accept such low-level radioactive waste, \nLLRW: that is material contaminated as a result of medical and \nscientific research, nuclear power production, biotechnology and other \nindustrial processes. In 1996, about 7,000 cubic meters of LLRW was \nproduced in the nation.\n  A study released by the General Accounting Office at the end of \nSeptember 1999, holds out little hope for the construction of any new \nlow-level radioactive waste disposal sites as envisioned under the Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Policy Act, signed by President Jimmy Carter in \n1980. That legislation resulted from states lobbying through the \nNational Governors' Association (NGA) to control and regulate LLRW \ndisposal. An NGA task force, that included Governor Bill Clinton of \nArkansas and was chaired by Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, \nrecommended the states form special compacts to develop shared disposal \nfacilities.\n  The GAO study, which I requested, states, ``By the end of 1998, \nstates, acting alone or in compacts, had collectively spent almost $600 \nmillion attempting to develop new disposal facilities. However, none of \nthese efforts have been successful. Only California successfully \nlicensed a facility, but the federal government did not transfer to the \nstate federal land on which the proposed site is located.''\n  Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt stopped the California \nfacility at Ward Valley from ever becoming reality. National \nenvironmental groups and Hollywood activists made Ward Valley a \nrallying cry, claiming waste would seep through the desert to the water \ntable and into the Colorado River. They claimed to believe this despite \ntwo complete environmental impact statements that found no significant \nenvironmental impacts associated with a disposal facility at Ward \nValley in the Mojave Desert. Secretary Babbitt asked the National \nAcademy of Science to convene an expert panel to determine whether the \nColorado River was threatened, and said he would abide by their \nconclusions. In May 1995, the Academy scientists concluded that the \nColorado River was not at risk. Yet, the property was never \ntransferred.\n  But the importance of this issue extends well beyond the borders of \nthe State of California or the borders of its fellow compact members, \nArizona, and North and South Dakota, which thought they had a deal with \nthe federal government. The losers are all Americans who believe the \nPresident and the executive branch should uphold federal law, not \nignore it and obstruct it for the sake of campaign contributions.\n  The GAO states that several reasons are behind the rest of the states \ngiving up on siting new waste disposal facilities. Public and political \nopposition is cited as the strongest prohibiting factor. Another reason \nis that, for the time being, states have access to a disposal facility \nat Barnwell in South Carolina, Richland in Washington State and \nEnvirocare in Utah. A very positive reason cited is the reduction in \nthe volume of low-level waste that is being generated, with waste \nmanagement and treatment practices including compaction and \nincineration.\n  However, the report cautions, ``Within 10 years, waste generators in \nthe 41 states that do not have access to the Richland disposal facility \nmay once again be without access to disposal capacity for much of their \nlow-level radioactive wastes.'' Barnwell could decide to close or \ncurtail access as early as 2000, and, at best, will only be open until \n2010. The Utah facility disposes of wastes that are only slightly \ncontaminated with radioactivity and thus is not available for all \nstorage.\n  In ten years states will be searching for storage as well as \ndisposal. That storage will be near every university, pharmaceutical \ncompany, hospital, research facility or nuclear power plant. It may be \ndown the street from you or within your city limits. And we have the \nClinton administration to thank for bringing the materials into our \ncommunities like a quiet Trojan horse instead of working with states to \nestablish a secure waste facility. Let's hope nothing ever opens the \nbelly of the beast accidentally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11793-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAKEOVER OF THE FISHERIES IN ALASKA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Secretary of the Interior today, \nunder the authority of current law, has taken over the management of \nfisheries in my State of Alaska. Our State legislature has been trying \nto resolve this problem, along with the Governor and our delegation, \nfor some time. Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve it within the \ntimeframe, so the Feds have officially taken over beginning today.\n  I have directed a letter to the Secretary of Interior putting him on \nnotice that, as chairman of the committee of oversight, chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, I will be conducting a series of oversight hearings \non the implementation of his regulations to ensure there is a \ncooperative effort and involvement of a public process with the State \nof Alaska, Department of Fish and Game, and the people of Alaska, as he \npromulgates his regulations, to ensure we are not taken advantage of by \nan overzealous effort by the Department of Interior to mandate \nprocedures only in the State of Alaska.\n  We are the only State in the Union where the Federal Government has \ntaken over the management of fish and game. Many Alaskans are wondering \njust what statehood is all about if, indeed, we are not given the \nauthority to manage our fish and game.\n  I will save that for another day. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11793-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11793-S11799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I said Tuesday of last week that the series \nof votes the Senate took that day, in which we were unable to consider \nand vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, \nwas unprecedented. I expressed my concern that the Senate not go so far \noff the tracks of our precedents that we end up creating a problem, not \njust for this administration, but for any future administration.\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\n  Today, we at least break out of the impasse of last week, and move \nforward toward voting on all the judicial nominations before the \nSenate. Just so we understand where we are, I said last week that \nDemocrats were prepared to vote on all of the judicial nominations \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar. Today we provided additional \nevidence of our resolve to do so. We did that by agreeing to a debate \nand a confirmation vote on the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to \nthe United States District Court for the District of Utah, as well as \nother nominees pending before the Senate.\n  Of course, the Senate has confirmed Victor Marrero and James Lorenz. \nI congratulate, incidentally, Senator Schumer and Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer, for the efforts they have made on behalf of those \nnominees.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for all his efforts in resolving this \nimpasse, in securing a vote on the nomination of Ray Fisher, and, in \nparticular, a vote on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White. Justice \nRonnie White is eventually, finally--I emphasize finally--going to get \nan up-or-down vote next Tuesday. Also, Ray Fisher and Mr. Stewart will \nbe voted on next Tuesday.\n  But our work is not complete. I look forward to working with the \nmajority leader to fulfill the Senate's duty to vote on the nominations \nof Judge Richard Paez and of Marsha Berzon. These are nominations that \nhave been pending for a very long time.\n  This debate is about fairness and the issue that remains is the issue \nof fairness. For too long, nominees--judicial nominees such as Judge \nPaez, Ms. Berzon and Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, and executive \nbranch nominees like Bill Lann Lee, have been opposed in anonymity, \nthrough secret holds and delaying tactics--not by straight up-or-down \nvotes where Senators can vote for them or vote against them.\n  They have been forced to run some kind of strange in-the-dark \ngauntlet of Senate confirmations. Those strong enough to work through \nthat secret gauntlet and get reported to the floor are then being dealt \nthe final death blow through a refusal of the Republican leadership to \ncall them up for a vote. They should be called up for a fair vote. They \nmay be defeated--the Republicans are in the majority; there are 55 \nRepublican Senators; they could vote them down. But let them have a \nfair vote, up or down. Let all Senators have to stand up and vote aye \nor nay, and be responsible to their constituency to explain why they \nvoted that way. Unfortunately, nominations are being killed through \nneglect and silence, not defeated by a majority vote.\n  So I ask, again, for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to vote \non all the judicial nominations on the calendar; vote for them or vote \nagainst them. We can vote them up or we can vote them down, but after \n44 months or 27 months or 20 months, let us vote.\n  Judge Richard Paez has an extraordinary record. He was praised by \nRepublicans and Democrats before our committee. He was nominated \nJanuary 25--not January 25 of this year, 1999; not January 25 of 1998; \nnot January 25 of 1997; but January 25 of 1996. He has been pending 44 \nmonths. Vote for him or vote against him, but do not put him in this \nkind of nomination limbo, which becomes a nomination hell.\n  Justice Ronnie White, an extraordinary jurist from Missouri, an \noutstanding African American jurist, he was nominated on June 26--not \nJune 26 of 1999, not June 26 of 1998, but June 26 of 1997. After more \nthan two years, this nomination remains pending. Vote up, vote down, \nbut do not take such an insulting and arrogant and demeaning attitude \non behalf of the Senate of not allowing this good jurist to come to a \nvote.\n  Marsha Berzon, again, nominated January 27, but not of this year, of \nlast year. Her nomination has been pending for almost two years. Allow \nher to come to a vote.\n  I contrast this, even though we have a Democratic President and \nnominations are usually the prerogative of whoever the President is, of \nthat party, with a nomination made on behalf of a Republican Senator \nwho happens to be a dear friend of mine. That man was nominated on July \n27 this year, barely two months ago. That nomination, the nomination of \nBrian Theadore Stewart, will be voted on next week. Good for him, I \nsay.\n  He has been considered promptly and will be brought up for an up or \ndown vote. There are some on this side of the aisle who oppose him and \nwill vote against him. But every single Democrat, whether they are \ngoing to vote against him or for him, should allow him to be voted on \nand they will. That nomination has been pending 2 months.\n  Let us have the same fairness on the other side of the aisle for \nMarsha Berzon, after 20 months, Justice Ronnie White after 27 months, \nand Judge Richard Paez after 44 months, especially--and some people may \nwish I would not say this on the floor, but especially after the \nnonpartisan report which came out last week that confirmed what I have \nsaid on this floor many a time--especially for nominees who are women \nand minorities. I have observed before that if you are a minority or if \nyou are a woman, this Senate, as presently constituted, will take far, \nfar longer to vote on your confirmation than if you are a white male. \nThat is a fact. That is fact, something that started becoming evident a \nfew years ago and has now been confirmed in a nonpartisan report.\n  Let me repeat that. If you are a minority, if you are a woman, you \nwill take longer to be confirmed than if you are a white male, by this \nSenate as presently constituted. And that is wrong. I advise Senators, \nI have checked on Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and Ms. \nMarsha Berzon, and nobody objects on the Democratic side of the aisle \nto them coming to a vote. We are prepared to vote at any time, any \nmoment, any day. There are no holds on this side of the aisle.\n  I said last week I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a Senate vote. I do \nnot. He is entitled to a vote. He went through the confirmation \nprocess. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted him out. It was not a \nunanimous vote, but he was voted out of the committee, and he is \nentitled to a vote. If Senators do not want to vote for him, vote \nagainst him. If Senators want to vote for him, vote for him. I intend \nto vote for him. I intend to give the benefit of the doubt both to the \nPresident and to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who \nrecommended him.\n  But I also ask the same sense of fairness be shown to everybody else \non the calendar. The Senate was able to consider and vote on the \nnomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, as controversial \nas that was, in 12 weeks. The Senate was able to consider and vote on \nthe nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas in 14 weeks. We ought to be \nvoting on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez, which has been pending \nalmost 4 years, and that of Marsha Berzon, which has been pending \nalmost 2 years. Let us have a sense of fairness. Let us bring them up \nand let us remove this notoriety the Senate has received, the notoriety \nestablished and emphatically proven, that if you are a woman or a \nminority, you take longer to get confirmed, if you ever get confirmed \nat all. That is wrong. We should be colorblind; we should be gender \nblind. Most importantly, we should be fair.\n  I should note, in fairness to the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, in committee he did vote for Judge Paez, Justice \nWhite, and Ms. Berzon and, of course, Ted Stewart, as did I. Now I work \nwith both he and the majority leader to bring them to a final vote by \nthe Senate.\n  I also want to work with those Senators who are opposed to bringing \nJudge Paez or Marsha Berzon to a vote. I read in the papers where we \nhave done away with secret holds in the Senate, but apparently not for \neverybody. Apparently, there are still secret holds.\n  In February, the majority leader and Democratic leader sent a letter \nto all Senators talking about secret holds. They said then: ``members \nwishing to place a hold on any . . . executive calendar business shall \nnotify the committee of jurisdiction of their concerns.'' I serve as \nthe ranking member on the committee of jurisdiction for these \nnominations. I have not been told the name of any Senator at all who is \nholding them up. Yet they do not go forward.\n\n  The letter from the two leaders goes on to state: ``Further, written \nnotification should be provided to the respective Leader stating their \nintention regarding the * * * nomination.'' Senator\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\nDaschle has received no such notification. In spite of what was \nsupposed to be a Senate policy to do away with anonymous holds, we \nremain in the situation where I do not even know who is objecting to \nproceeding to a vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, let alone why \nthey are objecting. I have no ability to reason with them or address \nwhatever their concerns are because I do not know their concerns. It is \nwrong and unfair to the nominees.\n  I do not deny each Senator his or her prerogative as a Member of this \nSenate. After 25 years here, I think I have demonstrated--and I \ncertainly know in my heart--I have great respect for this institution \nand for its traditions, for all the men and women with whom I have \nserved, the hundreds of men and women with whom I have served over the \nyears in both parties. But this use of secret holds for extended \nperiods to doom a nomination from ever being considered by the Senate \nis wrong, unfair, and beneath us.\n  Who is it who is afraid to vote on these nominations? Who is it who \nis hiding their opposition and obstructing these nominees? Can it be \nthey are such a minority, they know that if it comes to a fair vote, \nthese good men and women will be confirmed?\n  So rather than to allow a fair vote, they will keep it from coming to \na vote. I would bet you that the same people who are holding these \nnominations back from a vote will go home on the Fourth of July and \nother holidays and give great speeches about the democracy of this \ncountry and how important democracy is and why we have to allow people \nto vote and express the will of the people--except in the Senate and, \napparently, except if you are a minority or a woman.\n  If we can vote on the Stewart nomination within 4 weeks in session, \nwe can vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years and the Berzon \nnomination within 2 years. Let us vote up or down.\n  Once more I say, look where we are: There is Stewart, pending 2 \nmonths; Marsha Berzon, pending 20 months; Justice Ronnie White of \nMissouri, pending 27 months; Judge Richard Paez, pending 44 months. I \nlook at those green lines of this chart showing the time that each of \nthese nominations has been pending and I wish they could each be the \nshort sliver that represents the Stewart nomination. With a name like \nPatrick Leahy, I want to see green on St. Patrick's Day; I do not want \nto see the long green lines on this chart that represent delay and \nobstruction of votes on women and minority nominees.\n  Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist, a source of great pride \nand inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the country. He \nserved as a local judge before being confirmed to the Federal bench \nseveral years ago. He is currently a federal district court judge. He \nhas twice been reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee, twice \nreported out for confirmation. He spent a total of 9 months over the \nlast 2 years on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity \nfor a final confirmation vote to the court of appeals. His nomination \nwas first received 44 months ago, in January of 1996.\n  Justice Ronnie White, an outstanding member of the Missouri Supreme \nCourt, has extensive experience in law and government. In fact, he is \nthe first African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. He \nhas been twice reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee. He spent a total of 7 months on the floor calendar waiting \nthe opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was first \nreceived by the Senate in June 1997--27 months ago. I am glad that \nfinally, after all this time, the Democratic leader was able to \nannounce a date for a vote on this longstanding nomination of this \noutstanding jurist.\n\n  As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted in an editorial last week:\n\n       Seven of the 10 judicial nominees who have been waiting the \n     longest for confirmation are minorities or women. This is \n     hardly a shock to those of us who have watched [Justice] \n     White, an African-American, be ushered to the back of the \n     bus.\n\n  The words of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n  Marsha Berzon has been one of the most qualified nominees I have seen \nin my 25 years. Her legal skills are outstanding. Her practice and \nproductivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has \nlitigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. Her opponents \nin litigation are praising her and asking for her to be confirmed.\n  She was long ago nominated for a judgeship within a circuit that saw \nthis Senate hold up the nominations of other qualified women for months \nand years--people like Margaret Morrow, who was held up for so long; \nAnn Aiken, who was held up for so long; Margaret McKeown, who was held \nup for so long; Susan Oki Mollway, who was held up for so long. Marsha \nBerzon, too, has now been held up for 20 months.\n  The Atlanta Constitution, from Atlanta, GA, noted last Thursday:\n\n       Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years \n     and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried Tuesday to \n     get their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the \n     Republicans scuttled the maneuver. The Paez case seems \n     especially egregious. . . . This partisan stalling, this \n     refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is unconscionable. It \n     is not fair. It is not right. It is no way to run the federal \n     judiciary. Chief Justice William Rehnquist is hardly a fan of \n     [President] Clinton. Yet even he has been moved to decry \n     Senate delaying tactics and the burdens that unfilled \n     vacancies impose on the federal courts. Tuesday's deadlock \n     bodes ill for judicial confirmations through the rest of \n     [President] Clinton's term. This ideological obstructionism \n     is so fierce that it strains our justice system and sets a \n     terrible partisan example for years to come.\n\n  That is from the Atlanta Constitution. I share that concern. I have \nbeen on the floor of this Senate when we have had Republican Presidents \nwith Republican nominations, saying that they deserve to be brought \nforward for a vote one way or the other, including a couple instances \nof nominees I intended to vote against. I still said they deserved a \nvote. And they got their vote.\n  In fact, I probably voted for 98 to 99 percent of President Ford's, \nPresident Reagan's, and President Bush's nominees--three Presidents \nwith whom I have served.\n  What we are currently experiencing is unconscionable and \nunprecedented, these kinds of delays. I think we hurt the Senate when \nwe do this. We will have Republican Presidents; we will have Democratic \nPresidents. We will have Republican-controlled Senates; and we will \nhave Democratic-controlled Senates. I have served here twice with the \nDemocrats in control; twice with the Republicans in control. The \nprecedents we establish are important if we are to go into the next \ncentury as the kind of body the Senate should be.\n  We should be the conscience of the Nation. On some occasions we have \nbeen. But we tarnish the conscience of this great Nation if we \nestablish the precedence of partisanship and rancor that go against all \nprecedents and set the Senate on a course of meanness and smallness. \nThat is what we are doing with these nominations. We should establish, \nfor future Senates, that we are above this kind of partisanship.\n\n  Nobody in this body owns a seat in the Senate. Every single person \nserving today will be gone someday. Every one of them will be replaced \nby others. As I said, in the relatively short time I have been here, \nhundreds of Senators have gone through this body. But every one of us \nare guided by what previous Senates have done.\n  Do not let us end this century and this millennium leaving, as \nguidance for the next century and the next millennium and the next \nSenate, partisanship that tears at the very fabric, not only of the \nSenate but of the independence of the Federal judiciary itself. So many \njudges, judges who are considered conservative, judges who are \nconsidered liberal, judges who have had a Republican background or a \nDemocratic background, judges who have been appointed by Republican \nPresidents, judges who have been appointed by Democratic Presidents, \nhave been united in saying: Stop this. Do not go on with this. Because \nyou are tearing at the very core of our independent judiciary, the most \nindependent judiciary on Earth, a judiciary whose very independence \nallows us to maintain a balanced country, a country that is the most \npowerful on Earth, but a country that is also the most free and the \nmost respected democracy. And a main factor guaranteeing that freedom \nand that democracy is our independent judiciary.\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\n  So, against this backdrop, I, again, ask the Senate to be fair to \nthese judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the \nSenate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial \nnominations, and that is not fair.\n  Let me tell you what the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court \nwrote, a man who is widely considered a conservative Republican, also a \nman who, as we saw when he presided over the Senate earlier this year, \nis a man of fairness, of integrity and of great learning. He wrote in \nJanuary of last year:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  I could not agree more with Chief Justice Rehnquist. We should follow \nhis advice. Let the Republican leadership schedule up-or-down votes on \nthe nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can \nfinally act on them. Let us be fair to all.\n  The response to the Senate action last week was condemnation of the \nRepublican leadership's refusal to proceed to vote on the nominations \nof Judge Paez, Justice White, and Ms. Berzon. A Washington Post \neditorial characterized the conduct of the Republican majority as \n``simply baffling'' and noted:\n\n       [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up \n     abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies \n     nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor \n     votes, Mr. Stewart included, should receive them immediately.\n\n  The editorial speaks to the responsibility of the Senate, and it is \nright. On our side of the aisle, we have lived up to the \nresponsibility. Again, I tell all Senators, no matter how an individual \nDemocratic Senator may vote on any one of the pending nominees, no \nDemocratic Senator has a hold on any judicial nominee. We are all \nprepared to vote.\n\n  It is October 1, and the Senate has acted on only 19 of the 68 \njudicial nominations the President has sent us this year. We have only \n4 weeks in which the Senate is scheduled to be in session for the rest \nof the year. By this time last year, the committee had held 10 \nconfirmation hearings for judicial nominees and 43 judges had been \nconfirmed. By comparison, this year there have been only 4 hearings and \nonly 19 judges have been confirmed. We are at less than half the \nproductivity of last year and miles behind the pace of 1994, when by \nthis time we had held 21 hearings and the Senate had confirmed 73 \njudges.\n  The Florida Sun-Sentinel said last Monday:\n\n       The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as Senators \n     work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed \n     federal judges. . . . This worsening process is inexcusable, \n     bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the \n     urgent need to fill vacancies in a badly undermanned federal \n     bench. . . . The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more \n     than a partisan political dirty trick.\n\n  For the last several years, I have been urging the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial \nnominees more promptly, without the months of delay that now accompany \nso many nominations. Moreover, in the last couple weeks, as I said \nearlier, independent studies have verified the basis for many of my \nconcerns.\n  According to the report recently released by the Task Force on \nJudicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts, the time it has \ntaken for the Senate to consider nominees has grown significantly, from \nan average of 83 days in 1993 and 1994 during the 103rd Congress, to \nover 200 days for the years 1997 and 1998 during the last Congress, the \n105th. In fact, if we look at the average number of days from \nconfirmation to nomination on an annual basis, we would see that the \nSenate has broken records for delay in each of the last 3 succeeding \nyears, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In fact, in 1998, the average time for \nconfirmation was over 230 days.\n  That independent report also verifies that the time to confirm women \nas nominees is now significantly longer than to confirm men as \nnominees. That is a difference that defies any logical explanation \nexcept one, and that one explanation does not shed credit on this great \ninstitution. They recommend that ``the responsible officials address \nthis matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not treated \ndifferently based on their gender''--because they know that today they \nare.\n  I recall too well the obstacle course that such outstanding women \nnominees as Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown, and Susan Oki \nMollway were forced to run. Now it is Marsha Berzon who is being \ndelayed and obstructed, another outstanding woman judicial nominee held \nup, and held up anonymously because everybody knows that if she had a \nfair up-or-down vote, she would be confirmed.\n  I am angered by this, quite frankly, Mr. President. I think how I \nwould react if this was my daughter being held up like this, or the \ndaughter of someone I knew.\n  The report of Citizens for Independent Courts recommends the Senate \nshould eliminate the practice of allowing individual Members to place \nholds on a nominee. We ought to consider that.\n  This summer, Prof. Sheldon Goldman and Elliot Slotnick published \ntheir most recent analysis of the confirmation process in President \nClinton's second term in Judicature magazine. They note the \n``unprecedented delay at both the committee and floor stages of Senate \nconsideration of Clinton judicial nominees'' and conclude:\n\n       It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the \n     Republican leadership in the Senate is engaged in a \n     protracted effort to delay decisionmaking on judicial \n     appointments whether or not the appointee was, ultimately, \n     confirmable.\n\n  In fact, I can think of a number of these people, having been held up \nmonth after month after month, who finally got a vote and ended up \nbeing confirmed overwhelmingly. Margaret Morrow is an example of that. \nShe was held up for so long that it became a national disgrace that a \nwoman so qualified, backed by both Republicans and Democrats in \nCalifornia, was held up apparently because she was a woman. And when \nfinally the shame of it would not allow her to be held up any longer, \nshe came to a vote on the floor and was confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  In spite of efforts last year in the aftermath of strong criticism \nfrom the Chief Justice of the United States, the vacancies facing the \nFederal judiciary remain at 63, with 17 on the horizon. The vacancies \ngap is not being closed. We have more Federal judicial vacancies extend \nlonger and affecting more people. There will be more in the coming \nmonths. Judicial vacancies now stand at approximately 8 percent of the \nFederal judiciary. If you went to the number of judges recommended by \nthe judicial conference, the vacancy rate would be over 15 percent and \ntotal over 135.\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch, not delayed \nfor 2 and 3 years. We are talking about people going to the Federal \njudiciary, a third independent branch of Government. They are entitled \nto dignity and respect. They are not entitled automatically for us to \nvote aye, but they are entitled to a vote, aye or nay.\n  How do we go to other countries and say: You need an independent \njudiciary; you have to have a judiciary that people can trust; you have \nto treat it with respect; when we are not doing that in the Senate?\n  They deserve at least that. No nominee gets an automatic ``aye'' \nvote, but every nominee ought to be heard and at least voted on one way \nor the other.\n  One of our greatest protections as Americans is an independent \njudiciary, one the American people can respect and whose decisions they \ncan respect. We have built in all kinds of counterweights: the district \ncourt, the courts of appeal, the Supreme Court. We have this to make \nsure that there is this independence and balance. Yet we seem to be \nputting a break on it. The Senate's actions undermine our independent \njudiciary by the way we mistreat judicial nominations and perpetuate \nunnecessary vacancies.\n  We are seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and delayed to the point \nthat good men and women are being deterred from seeking to serve as \nFederal judges. Some excellent lawyers are being asked to serve as \nFederal judges and they say: No, I do not want to go through that. Why \nshould I?\n  In private practice, it is announced they are going to be nominated \nto be a\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\nFederal judge. All their partners will come in and say: This is \nwonderful, congratulations. We are going to have a great party for you \nFriday. And when are you going to move out of that corner office, \nbecause we want to move in? We realize you cannot take on any new \nclients. We would be a little bit better off if you were out of the \noffice now so that we do not have any conflicts of interest.\n  Then, for 2 or 3 years, they sit there, no income, no practice, \nneither fish nor foul. In a Senate that is constantly voting to say we \nare in favor of family values--as though anybody is against them--maybe \nwe ought to also consider the families of nominees, who might want to \nplan, and who need to know where that nomination is headed without \nunnecessary delay.\n  I have been here with five Presidents--I respected and know them \nall--President Ford, President Reagan, President Carter, President \nBush, and President Clinton. I have been on the Judiciary Committee \nduring that time. I know for a fact that no President, Republican or \nDemocrat, has ever consulted more closely with Senators of the party \nopposite from his on judicial nominees. No other President has \nconsulted as much with members of the other party as President Clinton \nhas, and that has greatly expanded the time it takes to make these \nnominations. But he has done that.\n\n  Having done that, the Senate at least should go about the business of \nvoting on confirmation for the scores of judicial nominations that have \nbeen delayed for too long without justification.\n  This summer, in his remarks to the American Bar Association, the \nPresident again urged us to action. He said:\n\n       We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations \n     to keep our courts vacant and to keep justice waiting.\n\n  We must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the \nlongstanding vacancies that plague the Federal courts and disadvantage \nall Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility.\n  I continue to urge the Republican leadership to attend to these \nnominations without obstruction and proceed to vote on them with \ndispatch. I urge that they schedule a vote on Judge Paez and Marsha \nBerzon without further delay. Again, I note for the record that no \nDemocratic Senator objects to them going forward for a vote--none. We \nare prepared to go forward with a vote on the shortest of notice at any \ntime. So the continuing delays on both Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon, \nare on the Republican side.\n  I do appreciate what the distinguished Republican leader and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader worked out today. And I appreciate the \nefforts of the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. It is my hope \nthat the example the four of us have set today will move the Senate \ninto a new productive chapter of our efforts to consider judicial \nnominations.\n  We took the action of initiating the calling up of a judicial nominee \nlast week to demonstrate where we were. We have urged the taking up of \na judicial nominee today whom some Democratic Senators oppose in order \nto demonstrate our commitment to fairness for all.\n  There is never a justification to deny any of these judicial nominees \na fair up-or-down vote. There is no excuse for the failure to have a \nvote on Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the recent editorials from the \nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, the Atlanta Constitution, the St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, the Denver Post, and the Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Sun-Sentinel, South Florida, Sept. 20, 1999]\n\n                  Pace of Judicial Confirmations Lags\n\n       The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators \n     work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed \n     federal judges.\n       More than eight months into 1999, the Senate has only \n     confirmed 14 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. By \n     this time in 1998, 39 judges had been confirmed. In 1997, it \n     was 58 judges.\n       This worsening process is inexcusable, bordering on \n     malfeasance in office, especially given the urgent need to \n     fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal bench. Even \n     after three new judges were confirmed Sept. 8, 11 nominations \n     are still pending before the Judiciary Committee and 35 \n     before the full Senate. The president has not yet nominated \n     candidates to fill 24 other vacancies.\n       The vacant seats, 70 of 846, represent 8.3 percent of all \n     federal judges.\n       The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a \n     partisan political dirty trick. Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has inexcusably delayed several \n     confirmation hearings and refused to hold others. \n     Conservatives like Hatch hate the idea of Clinton continuing \n     to put his stamp on the federal judiciary with more lifetime \n     appointments.\n       One of the newest people winning confirmation is Adalberto \n     Jose Jordan of Miami, who will join the bench on the U.S. \n     District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n       This is the first time in many years that the court will be \n     operating at full strength. At one time, it had four empty \n     spots, with some vacancies going unfilled four years.\n       Jordan's nomination process moved much faster than most. \n     The Senate got his nomination on March 15, held a \n     confirmation hearing July 13 and confirmed him Sept. 8. \n     That's still on the slow side; three months should be more \n     than enough. Miami Judge Stanley Marcus won confirmation to \n     the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in only 33 days.\n       Senate stalling on confirmations came under deserved attack \n     from Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on \n     the Judiciary Committee.\n       ``Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch, \n     not delayed for two or three years,'' Leahy said. ``We are \n     seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and delayed to the \n     point that good women and men are being deterred from seeking \n     to serve as federal judges.''\n       Leahy called it a scandal and a shame that one nomination \n     has been stalled 3 years and 8 months, despite two Judiciary \n     votes to confirm. Many vacancies have been unfilled 18 months \n     or more.\n       Senators should heed the request of U.S. Supreme Court \n     Justice William Rehnquist, who urged them to expedite \n     confirmation hearings and votes. A good bill by Florida Sens. \n     Bob Graham and Connie Mack requires a Judiciary Committee \n     vote within three months, then allows any senator to bring \n     the matter to the Senate floor. The full Senate would have to \n     vote one month after Judiciary action.\n       ``We are not doing our job,'' Leahy told his colleagues. \n     ``We are not being responsible. We are really being dishonest \n     and condescending and arrogant toward the judiciary. It \n     deserves better and the American people deserve better.''\n       Empty judicial benches and the Senate's Big Stall cause \n     severe problems.\n       They worsen an already high judicial caseload, burning out \n     overworked current judges.\n       They put off many civil lawsuits for years, delaying and \n     thus denying justice to litigants.\n       They force a hurry-up in criminal cases that can lead to \n     reversible error on appeal.\n       They force some talented nominees to drop out, or not even \n     apply.\n       They cripple urgent efforts to get tough on crime.\n       And they weaken an important branch of government.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Atlanta Constitution, Sept. 23, 1999]\n\n                    GOP Won't Warm Jurists' Benches\n\n       President Clinton struck a bad bargain two months ago. He \n     caved in to an insistent Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and \n     nominated a Hatch buddy with no judicial experience to be a \n     U.S. judge in Salt Lake City.\n       Clearly, Clinton hoped Hatch, chair of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, and other Republicans would appreciate the gesture \n     and reciprocate in kind--let's say, by finally freeing some \n     of the multitude of Clinton judicial nominees stranded in the \n     upper chamber.\n       Surprise, surprise. Clinton's peace offering has sparked no \n     such magnanimity. His partisan foes want to have their cake \n     and eat the president's lunch, too.\n       The issue came to a head Tuesday when Republicans attempted \n     to confirm Hatch's chum and right-wing soulmate, Ted Stewart. \n     Democrats blocked the procedure, contending justifiably that \n     Stewart had been pushed to the front of the line for Senate \n     consideration when other Clinton appointees have waited in \n     vain for a confirmation vote--some for years.\n       That's right, years. Two U.S. appellate court nominees, \n     Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, both of California, have been \n     on hold for four years and 20 months respectively. When \n     Democrats tried Tuesday to get their colleagues to vote on \n     the pair at long last, the Republicans scuttled the maneuver.\n       The Paez case seems especially egregious. He has been kept \n     in limbo this long, Democrats contend, because his GOP foes \n     would rather not cast a recorded vote against a Hispanic \n     jurist.\n       This partisan stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on \n     nominees, is unconscionable. It is not fair. It is not right. \n     It is no way to run the federal judiciary.\n       Chief Justice William Rehnquist is hardly a fan of Clinton. \n     Yet even he has been moved to decry Senate delaying tactics \n     and the burdens that unfilled vacancies impose on the federal \n     courts.\n       Tuesday's deadlock bodes ill for judicial confirmations \n     through the rest of Clinton's term.

Senate Republicans resorted to a highly unusual cloture \n     vote to try to force Democrats to vote on the nomination of \n     Ted Stewart, a friend of Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch who was \n     nominated, at Mr. Hatch's personal request, just two months \n     ago. The motion failed by five votes.\n       The irony of Democrats stalling their President's nominee \n     was plain, as they have been pleading for years for votes on \n     candidates. In a political deal gone wrong, President Bill \n     Clinton nominated Mr. Stewart--an environmentalist's \n     nightmare--in the apparent belief this would jump-start the \n     long-stalled confirmation process. The world record holder in \n     this wait-a-thon is Richard A. Paez (more than four years), \n     followed by Marsha L. Berzon (three years) and Mr. White \n     (more than two years). Instead of bringing these nominations \n     to the floor, the maneuver resulted in Mr. Stewart being \n     moved to the head of the line. Democrats refused to consider \n     him, and are digging in their heels until they are assured \n     their top three limbo inmates will be freed.\n       Cloture is a dramatic, desperate maneuver that has been \n     used only a handful of times. Even the hotly contested \n     nominations of Robert H. Bork and Clarence Thomas did not \n     require such hostile arm-twisting. It is unthinkable that \n     Republicans would resort to this over people like Mr. Paez.\n       But Democrats now fear Republicans would stall the process \n     until after the 2000 elections rather than vote on Mr. Paez. \n     Democrats say Republicans don't like Mr. Paez, but don't want \n     to be cast as voting against a Hispanic. Gosh, who would ever \n     get that impression? Seven of the 10 judicial nominees who \n     have been waiting the longest for confirmation are minorities \n     or women. This is hardly a shock to those of us who have \n     watched Mr. White, an African-American, be ushered to the \n     back of the bus.\n       The Limbo Three are political prisoners. They are \n     unquestionably qualified. If anything, Mr. Stewart--chief of \n     staff to Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt--is the one who looks thin on \n     courtroom credentials. Even if it delays the process further, \n     Democrats should not give in to this ridiculous double-\n     dealing and wave Mr. Stewart through until they are assured \n     Republicans will allow the process to go forward.\n       Believe it or not, we're getting tired of saying this: \n     Confirm Ronnie White.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Denver Post Corp., September 26, 1999]\n\n                         Erase Judicial Backlog\n\n       Confirmation of federal judges has become slower than \n     molasses and more contentious than a thicket of barbed wire, \n     turning judicial nominees into pawns in a political process \n     that has become a national disgrace.\n       Colorado's vacancy of U.S. District Court is frozen since \n     President Clinton named Patricia Coan at the recommendation \n     of Rep. Diana DeGette and other state Democrats, but Sen. \n     Wayne Allard of Colorado refused to back Coan and sent \n     Clinton a list of his five nominees instead.\n       Even uglier was last week's battle in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, where Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tried to push \n     his nominee, Ted Stewart, through a Senate vote after leaving \n     Democrats' nominees twisting in the wind for years.\n       Would-be California appeals judges Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon have waited four and nearly two years, respectively, \n     for a Senate vote. Ronnie White, the first African-American \n     state Supreme Court Justice in Missouri, has been on hold for \n     more than a year.\n       But Hatch, who won Clinton's appointment of Stewart by \n     freezing action on the others, then tried to slip his man \n     through without a vote on those who have waited so long. \n     Democrats retaliated by filibustering Stewart's nomination, \n     and all progress had come to a complete halt as of this \n     writing.\n       While Hatch's conduct was unconscionable, there is plenty \n     of blame to go around here. Clinton has taken an average of \n     315 days--the most of any president ever--to choose nominees \n     to fill judgeships. By comparison, President Carter averaged \n     240 days.\n       The Senate also is taking far longer than ever, from 38 \n     days, in 19777-78 to 201 in 1997-98.\n       Ideally, senators name a candidate, whom the president can \n     accept or reject. If accepted, the nominee's name goes to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee and, if approved, then to the full \n     Senate. The Senate should be able to vote within two months \n     after the president's nomination. These days, it takes years.\n       Even U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist has \n     criticized the Senate for moving too slowly.\n       Almost one in 10 positions weren't filled at the end of \n     1997. Today, 63 of the 843 federal judgeships are open--23 in \n     appellate courts, 38 in district courts and one in \n     international trade courts.\n       `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels of \n     indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \n     traditionally has been associated with the federal \n     judiciary,' Rehnquist said. `Fortunately for the judiciary, a \n     dependable corps of senior judges has contributed \n     significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships.'\n       That isn't fair to overworked senior judges or to those \n     whose cases gather dust on backlogs. Both are common in \n     Colorado. And it is an injustice to the nominees whose \n     careers are frozen as they await appointment or rejection. \n     The president and senators should make the selection of \n     judges a high priority and stop staging delays as strategic \n     moves. The federal judiciary is at stake.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Washington Post, Thurs., September 23, 1999]\n\n                       A Vote for All the Judges\n\n       The nomination of Ted Stewart to a federal district \n     judgeship in Utah has been a strange affair from the \n     beginning. Tuesday it turned into a circus.\n       Mr. Stewart, a favorite of Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Orrin Hatch, was nominated by President Clinton after Sen. \n     Hatch essentially froze consideration of the nominees to \n     force his appointment. When the White House finally gave in, \n     hoping to free some long-waiting appeals court judges, Mr. \n     Hatch moved Mr. Stewart through committee within days--even \n     though other nominees have waited years to get confirmed.\n       Now Mr. Stewart is awaiting a floor vote, as are several \n     nominees who should have had one long ago. Yet on the Senate \n     floor last week, Majority Leader Trent Lott announced that he \n     planned to move Mr. Stewart to a vote without also holding \n     votes for Richard Paez or Marshal Berzon, two of the most \n     abused administration nominees. Mr. Stewart, if Mr. Lott had \n     his way, would be confirmed a few weeks after his nomination, \n     while nominees who have waited around endlessly will continue \n     to wait.\n       Democrats understandably balked at this, so on Tuesday they \n     took the extraordinary step of filibustering a judicial \n     nomination from the Clinton White House--not in order to \n     prevent his confirmation but rather to ensure that other \n     nominees get votes. Afterward, Democrats sought to force \n     consideration of Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon, but Republicans \n     stopped this in two more party-line votes. The result is that \n     nobody is getting considered, though all of the nominees on \n     the floor likely have the votes for confirmation.\n       The filibuster of a judicial nomination is a very bad \n     precedent, one we suspect Democrats will come to regret, but \n     it's hard to see what choice they had. The conduct of the \n     Republican majority here is simply baffling--and the rhetoric \n     equally so. Mr. Hatch pleaded with the Senate Tuesday evening \n     to ``stop playing politics with this nomination and allow a \n     vote expeditiously''--as though he had not himself played \n     games to get Mr. Stewart nominated in the first place. Trent \n     Lott last week expressed dismay that a minority of only 41 \n     senators would be able to block a nomination. But as Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy pointed out in response, there is a deep irony \n     in fretting about the ability of a minority of 41 senators to \n     stop a nomination when Judge Paez has been held up for more \n     than three years by a tiny group of senators who do not even \n     have to give their names to keep his nomination from coming \n     to a vote.\n       Mr. Lott's other comments were worse still. He made it \n     clear that confirming judges is something he would rather not \n     do at all. ``There are not a lot of people saying: Give us \n     more federal judges,'' the majority leader said on the floor \n     last week. ``I am trying to help move this thing along, but \n     getting more federal judges is not what I came here to do.'' \n     The honesty of this comment, at least, is refreshing. But the \n     Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up \n     abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies \n     nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor \n     votes, Mr. Stewart included, should receive them immediately.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I make this heartfelt plea. I have \nmade the same plea in private to the Republican leader, the Democratic \nleader, and others. I love the Senate for what it can and should do. I \nknow that, like everybody else my time here is only as long as the \nvoters and my health allow. I also know that someday I will be gone and \nsomebody else from Vermont will fill this seat.\n  I look at the Senate as the conscience of this great Nation. It is a \nbody moving by precedence, moving sometimes by what some would say is \nan overformalized ritual, but moving in a way that the country can \nrespect and in which the best of the country can be reflected, a body \nthat is built on precedence.\n  A famous Thomas Jefferson story spoke of the Senate as the saucer \nthat allows cooling of passions, the Senate also allows us to step \nabove partisan politics because of our 6-year terms. We have not done \nthat with the judiciary. We have a duty to protect the Senate, but \nalso, because of our unique role in the confirmation process, we have a \nduty to protect the integrity and independence of the Federal \njudiciary. We are failing both in our duties\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\nas Senators and we are failing in our duty to the Federal court.\n  Let us all take a deep breath and think about that and go back to \ndoing what we should--not for this President or any past incident, but \nfor all Presidents, present and future, and for all Senates, present \nand future, and for the American people, and for the greatest Nation on \nEarth, present and future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11799-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the Communist party is celebrating the \nfiftieth anniversary of the People's Republic of China on October 1. \nUnfortunately, many Chinese people have little reason to celebrate. \nIndeed, this is not a celebration of the Chinese people but an \norchestrated celebration of the Communist party--a party of purges.\n  From the formative decade at Yenan, where the party was \nheadquartered, and Mao Tse-tung soundly crushed challenges to his \npower; to the killing of hundreds of landlords in the 1950s; to the \nanti-rightist purging of half a million people following the Hundred \nFlowers period and during the Great Leap Forward; to the Cultural \nRevolution, during which millions were murdered or died in confinement, \nto the massacre at Tiananmen Square just ten years ago--the Communist \nparty has sustained its existence not by the consent of the people, but \nthrough the violent elimination of dissent.\n  Even today, we see the party of purges in action on a daily basis. \nThe Communist party is deeply engaged in a piercing campaign to silence \nthe voices of faith and freedom--to purge from society, anyone they see \nas a threat to their power. The Chinese government continues to \nimprison members of the Chinese Democracy Party. In August, the \ngovernment sentenced Liu Xianbin to thirteen years in prison on charges \nof subversion. His real crime was his desire for democracy. Another \nDemocracy Party member, Mao Qingxiang, was formally arrested in \nSeptember after being held in detention since June. He will likely \nlanguish in prison for ten years because of his desire to be free. I \ncould go on, but some human rights groups estimate that there could be \nas many as 10,000 political prisoners suffering in Chinese prisons. The \nparty is determined to purge from society, those people it finds \nunsavory.\n  And the Chinese government will not tolerate people worshiping \noutside its official churches. So when it began cracking down on the \nFalun Gong meditation group, which it considers a cult, the government \nused this inexcusable action to perpetrate another--an intensified \nassault on Christians. In August, the government arrested thirty-one \nChristian house church members in Henan province. Henan province must \nbe a wellspring of faith because over 230 Christians have been arrested \nthere since October. Now I am concerned that eight of these House \nchurch leaders may face execution if they are labeled and treated as \nleaders of a cult. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that the eyes \nof the international community are watching. I hope that these peaceful \npeople will be released.\n  In the months leading up to this fiftieth anniversary celebration, \neverything and everyone has been swept aside to cast a glamorous light \non the Communist party. But the reality is quite ugly. Hundreds of \nstreet children, homeless, and mentally and physically disabled people \nhave been rounded up and forced into Custody and Repatriation centers \nacross the country. They are beaten, they are given poor food in \nunsanitary conditions, and they must pay rent.\n  In fact, only 500,000 people will be allowed to participate in the \ncelebration in Beijing. Non-Beijing residents cannot enter the city and \nmigrant workers have been sent home. They will not be able to see the \nCommunist Party in all its glory, as it displays the DF-31 \nintercontinental ballistic missile and other arms, nor will they see \nthe tanks rolling past Tiananmen Square. And Tibetans in Lhasa, who \ncertainly do not want to celebrate, are being forced to participate \nunder threat of losing their pay or their pensions.\n  This gilded celebration will not obscure the corrosion beneath. We \nmust recognize the nature of this regime. We must never turn a blind \neye or a deaf ear to cries of those suffering in China. We must be \nrealistic when we deal with the Chinese government.\n  So when Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin courts President Jiang \nZemin even when Time Magazine's China issue is banned, when our top \nexecutives are silent on human rights, when we put profit over \nprinciple, we are shielding our eyes from the stark reality of \npersecution in China. As Ronald Reagan said, ``. . . we demean the \nvalor of every person who struggles for human dignity and freedom. And \nwe also demean all those who have given that last full measure of \ndevotion.''\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope and desire that in the next \nfifty years, the Chinese people will truly have something to celebrate. \nI hope that they will no longer be suppressed by a regime that extracts \ndissent like weeds from a garden, but that they will be able to enjoy \nthe fruits of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11799-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1653, which would reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation. As an original cosponsor of this important legislation, I \nwould like to applaud the excellent work of Senator Chafee and the \nFoundation to conserve the fish, wildlife, and plant resources of the \nUnited States.\n  The Foundation was created by Congress in 1984 to promote improved \nconservation and sustainable use of our country's natural resources. \nSince then, it has awarded over 2,400 grants, using $101 million in \nfederal funds, which it matched with $189 million in nonfederal funds, \nputting a total of over $290 million on the ground to promote \nenvironmental education, protect habitats, prevent species from \nbecoming endangered, restore wetlands, improve riparian areas, and \nconserve native plants. The hallmark of this outstanding organization \nis forgoing partnerships between the public and private sectors--\ninvolving the government, private citizens, and corporations--to \naddress the root causes of environmental problems. This reauthorization \nwill allow the Foundation to continue its valuable work throughout the \ncountry.\n  Besides being an important link between groups with differing \ninterests in natural resources, the Foundation is an extremely \neffective tool for stretching scarce federal dollars. The Foundation \nwas created by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment \nAct, which stipulates that the Foundation must match any federal money \nappropriated to it on a one-to-one basis. The Foundation does the Act \none better. It has an internal policy of matching federal funds at \nleast two-to-one with money from individuals, corporations, state and \nlocal governments,\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nfoundations, and nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, all of the \nfederal money appropriated to the Foundation supports on-the-ground \nconservation--its operating funds come strictly from private donations. \nThe Foundation does not use federal funds for lobbying; nor does it \nsupport projects that entail political advocacy or litigation.\n  In my home state of Maine, the Foundation has invested over $3.4 \nmillion in federal funds in 109 projects, generating an additional $6.9 \nmillion in matching funds from private, corporate, and other state \nsources. Most notably, the Foundation has funded projects in Maine to \nhelp fishermen cope with the collapse of traditional groundfish \nfisheries, build a program to preserve Maine's native Atlantic salmon, \nand protect habitat for breeding Neotropical migratory birds.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this bill to reauthorize the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Year after year, the Foundation \nconsistently performs valuable conservation work, not only in my state, \nbut throughout the country. Its ability to triple the power of federal \nfunding for conservation is unique, making it one of the most effective \nmeans we have for preserving our natural resources. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting expeditious passage of this \nimportant measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11800-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11800-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of the conference on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to \nthe bill, H.R. 2084, making appropriations for the Department of \nTransportation and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2981.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to Filipino veterans; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, the Philippine Islands, as a result of the \n     Spanish-American War, were a possession of the United States \n     between 1898 and 1946; and\n       Whereas, in 1934, the Philippine Independence Act (P.L. 73-\n     127) set a 10-year timetable for the eventual independence of \n     the Philippines and in the interim established a government \n     of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with certain powers \n     over its own internal affairs; and\n       Whereas, the granting of full independence ultimately was \n     delayed for two years until 1946 because of the Japanese \n     occupation of the islands from 1942 to 1945; and\n       Whereas, between 1934 and the final independence of the \n     Philippine Islands in 1946, the United States retained \n     certain sovereign powers over the Philippines, including the \n     right, upon order of the President of the United States, to \n     call into the service of the United States Armed Forces all \n     military forces organized by the Commonwealth government; and\n       Whereas, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, by Executive \n     order of July 26, 1941, brought the Philippine Commonwealth \n     Army into the service of the United States Armed Forces of \n     the Far East under the command of Lieutenant General Douglas \n     MacArthur; and\n       Whereas, under the Executive Order of July 26, 1941, \n     Filipinos were entitled to full veterans benefits; and\n       Whereas, approximately 200,000 Filipino soldiers, driven by \n     a sense of honor and dignity, battled under the United States \n     Command after 1941 to preserve our liberty; and\n       Whereas, there are four groups of Filipino nationals who \n     are entitled to all or some of the benefits to which United \n     States veterans are entitled. These are:\n       (1) Filipinos who served in the regular components of the \n     United States Armed Forces.\n       (2) Regular Philippine Scouts, called ``Old Scouts,'' who \n     enlisted in Filipino-manned units of the United States Army \n     prior to October 6, 1945. Prior to World War II, these troops \n     assisted in the maintenance of domestic order in the \n     Philippines and served as a combat-ready force to defend the \n     islands against foreign invasion, and during the war, they \n     participated in the defense and retaking of the islands from \n     Japanese occupation.\n       (3) Special Philippine Scouts, called ``New Scouts,'' who \n     enlisted in the United States Armed Forces between October 6, \n     1945, and June 30, 1947, primarily to perform occupation duty \n     in the Pacific following World War II.\n       (4) Members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army who on July \n     26, 1941, were called into the service of the United States \n     Armed Forces. This group includes organized guerrilla \n     resistance units that were recognized by the United States \n     Army; and\n       Whereas, The first two groups, Filipinos who served in the \n     regular components of the United States Armed Forces and Old \n     Scouts, are considered United States veterans and are \n     generally entitled to the full range of United States \n     veterans benefits; and\n       Whereas, The other two groups, New Scouts and members of \n     the Philippine Commonwealth Army, are eligible for certain \n     veterans benefits, some of which are lower than full veterans \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, United States veterans medical benefits for the \n     four groups of Filipino veterans vary depending upon whether \n     the person resides in the United States or the Philippines; \n     and\n       Whereas, The eligibility of Old Scouts for benefits based \n     on military service in the\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\n     United States Armed Forces has long been established; and\n       Whereas, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs \n     operates a comprehensive program of veterans benefits in the \n     present government of the Republic of the Philippines, \n     including the operation of a federal Department of Veterans \n     Affairs office in Manila; and\n       Whereas, The federal Department of Veterans Affairs does \n     not operate a program of this type in any other country; and\n       Whereas, The program in the Philippines evolved because the \n     Philippine Islands were a United States possession during the \n     period 1898-1946, and many Filipinos have served in the \n     United States Armed Forces, and because the preindependence \n     Philippine Commonwealth Army was called into the service of \n     the United States Armed Forces during World War II (1941-\n     1945); and\n       Whereas, Our nation has failed to meet the promises made to \n     those Filipino soldiers who fought as American soldiers \n     during World War II; and\n       Whereas, The Congress passed legislation in 1946 limiting \n     and precluding Filipino veterans that fought in the service \n     of the United States during World War II from receiving most \n     veterans benefits that were available to them before 1946; \n     and\n       Whereas, Many Filipino veterans have been unfairly treated \n     by the classification of their service as not being service \n     rendered in the United States Armed Forces for purposes of \n     benefits from the federal Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, All other nationals who served in the United \n     States Armed Forces have been recognized and granted full \n     rights and benefits, but the Filipinos, as American nationals \n     at the time of service, were and still are denied recognition \n     and singled out for exclusion, and this treatment is unfair \n     and discriminatory; and\n       Whereas, On October 20, 1996, President Clinton issued a \n     proclamation honoring the nearly 100,000 Filipino veterans of \n     World War II, soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, \n     who fought as a component of the United States Armed Forces \n     alongside allied forces for four long years to defend and \n     reclaim the Philippine Islands, and thousands more who joined \n     the United States Armed Forces after the war; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and the \n     Congress of the United States during the First Session of the \n     106th Congress to take action necessary to honor our \n     country's moral obligation to provide these Filipino veterans \n     with the military benefits that they deserve, including, but \n     not limited to, holding related hearings, and acting \n     favorably on legislation pertaining to granting full veterans \n     benefits to Filipino veterans of the United States Armed \n     Forces; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Assembly transmit a copy of \n     this resolution to the President and the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-358. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to child sexual abuse; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Children are a precious gift and responsibility; \n     and\n       Whereas, The spiritual, physical, and mental well-being of \n     children is our sacred duty; and\n       Whereas, No segment of our society is more critical to the \n     future of human survival and society than our children; and\n       Whereas, Children who have been sexually abused often \n     experience health problems, eating disorders, learning \n     difficulties, behavioral problems, fearfulness, social \n     withdrawal, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts; and\n       Whereas, Psychologists, as researchers, educators, service \n     providers, and policy advocates, have played important roles \n     in advancing knowledge regarding the consequences, effective \n     treatment, and prevention of child sexual abuse; and\n       Whereas, It is the obligation of all public policymakers \n     not only to support but also to defend the health and rights \n     of parents, families, and children; and\n       Whereas, Information endangering to children is being made \n     public and, in some instances, may be given unwarranted or \n     unintended credibility through release under professional \n     titles or through professional organizations; and\n       Whereas, Elected officials have a duty to inform and \n     counter actions they consider damaging to children, parents, \n     families, and society; and\n       Whereas, California has made sexual molestation of a child \n     a felony and has declared parents who sexually molest their \n     children to be unfit; and\n       Whereas, Virtually all studies in this area, including \n     those published by the American Psychological Association, \n     condemn child sexual abuse as criminal and harmful to \n     children; and\n       Whereas, The American Psychological Association repudiates \n     and disassociates itself from any organization or publication \n     that advocates sexual interaction between children and \n     adults; and\n       Whereas, The American Psychological Association in July \n     1998, published a review of 59 studies of college aged \n     students that indicates that some sexual relationships \n     between adults and children may be less harmful than \n     believed, and that some of the college students viewed their \n     experience as positive at the time they occurred or positive \n     when reflecting back on them; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully urges \n     the President and Congress to reject and condemn, in the \n     strongest honorable written and vocal terms possible, any \n     suggestions that sexual relations between children and \n     adults, except for those that may be legal in the various \n     states under statutes pertaining to marriage, are anything \n     but abusive, destructive, exploitive, reprehensible, and \n     punishable by law; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature condemns and denounces all \n     suggestions in the recently published study by the American \n     Psychological Association that indicates sexual relationships \n     between adults and ``willing'' children are less harmful than \n     believed and might even be positive; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages competent \n     investigations to continue to research the effects of child \n     sexual abuse using the best methodology so that the public \n     and public policymakers may act upon accurate information; \n     and be if further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the majority leader of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to each Senator \n     and Representative from California in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-359.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the alternative minimum \n     tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, The federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is \n     intended to assure that wealthy income taxpayers do not avoid \n     taxation by using various credits, deductions, and other tax \n     preferences; and\n       Whereas, The AMT requires an increasing number of taxpayers \n     to calculate their taxes twice, under two different sets of \n     rules, and pay whichever tax is higher; and\n       Whereas, The AMT affected 134,000 taxpayers in 1988, it now \n     affects nearly one million and will affect five million by \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, More than 20 percent of those now paying AMT have \n     adjusted gross incomes of less than one hundred thousand \n     dollars ($100,000), and nearly 2 percent have adjusted gross \n     incomes of between thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) and \n     forty thousand dollars ($40,000); and\n       Whereas, Families in the lowest income tax bracket of 15 \n     percent who cut their tax bills by taking advantage of the \n     new tuition and child credits could be forced to pay some \n     taxes at the higher AMT minimum rate of 26 percent; and\n       Whereas, The sharp increase in the number of moderate \n     income earners affected by the AMT is attributable to \n     inflation indexing of personal exemptions, the standard \n     deduction and tax-bracket break points, while AMT exemption \n     amounts and tax brackets are not so indexed; and\n       Whereas, The AMT's inclusion of lower and lower-adjusted \n     gross incomes is exacerbated by a strong economy; and\n       Whereas, The AMT disallows many deductions, credits, and \n     other tax preferences that taxpayers could otherwise use, \n     such as state and local taxes; and\n       Whereas, The AMT distorts economic decisions, especially in \n     relation to capital formation, by raising marginal tax rates; \n     and\n       Whereas, Compliance costs related to the AMT amount to at \n     least 30 percent of its current revenue; and\n       Whereas, The inconsistent tax results between regular \n     income tax and the AMT create hidden, onerous tax choices, \n     produce conflicting goals for tax and financial planning,\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n     and vastly increase the complexity of compliance with the \n     income tax law; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That California respectfully urges the \n     Congress of the United States to index the AMT exemption and \n     tax brackets for inflation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate \n     Minority Leader, the House Majority Leader, the House \n     Minority Leader, the Chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Senate Finance Committee, the Chair and ranking minority \n     member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, and each \n     Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of \n     the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11803-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n             Rockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n             Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n             Kerrey, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n             Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n             Breaux, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Levin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Leahy, \n             Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lautenberg, \n             Mr. Byrd, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Lincoln, \n             Mr. Robb, and Mr. Inouye):\n       S. 1678.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nimplement enforcement of the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of \n1988; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 1999\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Breast \nReconstruction Implementation Act of 1999. This bill amends the \nInternal Revenue Code to require that all health plans provide coverage \nfor breast reconstruction surgery after a woman has had a mastectomy \nfor breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is a frightening disease for women. It is common: a \nvery high percentage of women who live long enough will eventually \ndevelop the disease. It is insidious: it can remain asymptomatic for \nmany years before it is discovered. It is stealthy: it can recur many \nyears after it has been thought to be cured. It is devastating: \nsurgical treatment can be not only physically mutilating but \npsychologically devastating to a woman's sense of femininity and self-\nesteem. And it is everywhere: there is hardly anyone in this country \nwho does not have a close friend or loved one who has been through an \nexperience with breast cancer.\n  Fortunately, there has been tremendous progress in the treatment of \nbreast cancer, and many women can now be cured. However, as these \nbreast cancer survivors attempt to resume their normal lives after \ntheir treatment, they can still be impacted by the physical damage that \nfollows mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy is \nthus a key part of restoring the breast cancer patient back to a \nsatisfying and fulfilling life; it is not simply a cosmetic procedure \nto satisfy one's vanity.\n  In recognition of the importance of breast reconstruction after \nmastectomy, last year the Senate passed the Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. This \nlegislation, which was signed into law by the President, amended the \nPublic Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct to require that health plans provide coverage for breast \nreconstruction after mastectomy. This coverage also includes surgery on \nthe unoperated breast, if necessary, as well as the cost of breast \nprostheses and repair to physical complications following mastectomy \n(e.g. lymphedema or arm swelling).\n  However, if we don't pass further legislation, the enforcement \nmechanisms available to the Department of Labor to ensure that health \nplans comply with the breast reconstruction requirement are generally \nlimited to requesting a court to issue an injunction. The Breast \nReconstruction Implementation Act will incorporate the breast \nreconstruction requirement into the Internal Revenue Code in order to \nenable civil monetary penalties to be imposed on violators of the law. \nPassage of this bill would continue the precedent established by all \nprevious mandates on health plans (those in the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act, and the Mental Health Parity Act), which were \nincorporated into all three statutes: Public Health Service Act, \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to finish the work that we \nbegan last year to ensure that women can be fully restored to health \nafter fighting breast cancer, and I urge them to support the Breast \nReconstruction Implementation Act of 1999 that I am introducing \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1680.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Benefits \n     Administration Improvement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs is responsible for the timely and \n     accurate processing of claims for veterans compensation and \n     pension.\n       (2) The accuracy of claims processing within the Veterans \n     Benefits Administration has been a subject of concern to \n     Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (3) While the Veterans Benefits Administration has reported \n     in the past a 95 percent accuracy rate in processing claims, \n     a new accuracy measurement system known as the Systematic \n     Technical Accuracy Review found that, in 1998, initial review \n     of veterans claims was accurate only 64 percent of the time.\n       (4) The Veterans Benefits Administration could lose up to \n     30 percent of its workforce to retirement by 2003, making \n     adequate training for claims adjudicators even more necessary \n     to ensure veterans claims are processed efficiently.\n       (5) The Veterans Benefits Administration needs to take more \n     aggressive steps to ensure that veterans claims are processed \n     in an accurate and timely fashion to avoid unnecessary delays \n     in providing veterans with compensation and pension benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESSING OF VETERANS BENEFITS \n                   CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act,\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives a comprehensive \n     plan for the improvement of the processing of claims for \n     veterans compensation and pension.\n       (b) Elements.--The plan under subsection (a) shall include \n     the following:\n       (1) Mechanisms for the improvement of training of claims \n     adjudicators and for the enhancement of employee \n     accountability standards in order to ensure that initial \n     reviews of claims are accurate and that unnecessary appeals \n     of benefit decisions and delays in benefit payments are \n     avoided.\n       (2) Mechanisms for strengthening the ability of the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to identify recurring errors in claims \n     adjudications by improving data collection and management \n     relating to--\n       (A) the human body and the impairments common in disability \n     and pension claims; and\n       (B) recurring deficiencies in medical evidence and \n     examinations.\n       (3) Mechanisms for implementing a system for reviewing \n     claims-processing accuracy that meets the Government's \n     internal control standard on separation of duties and the \n     program performance audit standard on organizational \n     independence.\n       (4) Quantifiable goals for each of the mechanisms developed \n     under paragraphs (1) through (3).\n       (c) Consultation.--In developing the plan under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall consult with and obtain the views of \n     veterans organizations and other interested parties.\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the plan \n     under subsection (a) commencing 60 days after the date of the \n     submittal of the plan under that subsection.\n       (e) Modification.--(1) The Secretary may modify the plan \n     submitted under subsection (a).\n       (2) Any modification under paragraph (1) shall not take \n     effect until 30 days after the date on which the Secretary \n     submits to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a \n     notice regarding such modification.\n       (f) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2000, and every 6 \n     months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report \n     assessing implementation of the plan under subsection (a) \n     during the preceding 6 months, including an assessment of \n     whether the goals set forth under subsection (b)(4) are being \n     achieved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1682. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nmanagement reforms of the Federal Aviation Administration, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n             air traffic management improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I came to the Senate \nfloor to talk with my colleagues in the Congress about the troubled \nstate of our nation's air traffic control system. After a long summer \nof dramatically increased congestion in the skies and delays on the \nground, I implored my colleagues to join me in putting a new and \nrenewed emphasis on aviation, and to commit ourselves to modernizing, \nreforming, and, if need be, restructuring our air traffic system in \norder to meet surging travel demands in the new millennium.\n  Today I am pleased to join with Senator Gorton in offering my \ncolleagues a first step in that process by introducing the Air Traffic \nManagement Improvement Act of 1999--a modest but meaningful bill that \nwould improve current management and operation of the system, without \nprejudging the ongoing and important debate about whether and how to \nmore fundamentally restructure the air traffic over the long term.\n  The Air Traffic Management Improvement Act of 1999 is focused in two \nkey areas--the first being internal FAA management reforms and the \nsecond being modernizing of the nuts and bolts of the system itself.\n  With respect to management reforms, this bill would create a new air \ntraffic control oversight committee, as a subcommittee of the FAA's \nManagement Advisory Committee, and a new Chief Operating Officer (COO) \nposition, with central responsibility for running and modernizing air \ntraffic control services, developing and implementing strategic and \noperational plans, and putting together a budget for air traffic \nservices. For both the COO and the FAA Administrator, the bill would \nauthorize performance bonuses in order to allow us to attract and \nretain the highest caliber leadership possible for running this \nessential national system.\n  The bill also makes clear that the Administrator should use her full \nauthority to make organizational changes to improve the efficiency of \nthe system, without compromising the FAA's primary safety mission, and \nasks the Administrator to report on and provide milestones for the \nagency's new cost allocation system.\n  With respect to air traffic modernization, the bill calls for a \ncomprehensive review and redesign of our airspace nationwide, based on \ninput from the aviation community, and provides the resources necessary \nto get the job done in a timely fashion. The bill also includes an \nemergency authorization of up to $100 million to speed up the purchase \nand fielding of modernization equipment and technologies that could \nhave made a difference in the gridlock of this past summer but have \nbeen held up by inadequate funding.\n  Finally, the bill would set up an innovative pilot program to \nfacilitate public-private joint ventures for the purchase of air \ntraffic control equipment. It would create a not-for-profit Air Traffic \nModernization Association with a three-member executive panel \nrepresenting the FAA, commercial air carriers, and primary airports. \nTen projects for modernization equipment would be selected from among \napplications made by airlines and airports, or a consortium of \ninterested parties, who are willing to share financial responsibility \nfor FAA-approved modernization equipment--and who can't and don't want \nto wait for the congressional budget process to catch up with air \ntraffic demands. In effect, the Association would leverage a relatively \nsmall amount of FAA seed money to more quickly procure and field ATC \nmodernization equipment through leasing and bond arrangements. The \npilot program allows for up to $50 million in FAA funding per project, \nwith a total cap of $500 million. It also allows a sponsoring airport \nto use a portion of a passenger facility charge to meet their \ncommitment and provides incentives for airport participation.\n  In closing, I want to say how thankful I am for the good and sound \nleadership of my friend and colleague Senator Gorton and of FAA \nAdministrator Garvey and the outstanding FAA employees who work with \nher and whose expertise, ideas, and technical assistance are reflected \nin this bill. To my mind the problems of the current system are shared \nproblems--we all bear some responsibility for them and we all need to \nstep up to the plate to do something to fix them. The FAA does a very \ncommendable job with an incomprehensibly difficult task--and they have \na terrific safety record to show for it. But the current system isn't \nworking as well as it could or should, and we can't wait to do \nsomething about it.\n  My goal in the Air Traffic Management Improvement Act of 1999 is to \ngive the FAA additional tools to get the job done in today's more \nchallenging aviation environment--and to give the Congress and the \ncountry some time to consider in a very deliberate and careful way some \nof the proposals for more far-reaching change.\n  It is our intention to offer this bill as an amendment to the FAA and \nAIP reauthorization bill, S. 82, when it comes to the Floor in the near \nfuture. I look forward to talking more about the details and great \npotential of these modest reforms at that time.

DEFINITIONS\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Transportation.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The nation's air transportation system is projected to \n     grow by 3.4 percent per year over the next 12 years.\n       (2) Passenger enplanements are expected to rise to more \n     than 1 billion by 2009, from the current level of 660 \n     million.\n       (3) The aviation industry is one of our Nation's critical \n     industries, providing a means of travel to people throughout \n     the world, and a means of moving cargo around the globe.\n       (4) The ability of all sectors of American society, urban \n     and rural, to access, and to compete effectively in the new \n     and dynamic global economy requires the ability of the \n     aviation industry to serve all the Nation's communities \n     effectively and efficiently.\n       (5) The Federal government's role is to promote a safe and \n     efficient national air transportation system through the \n     management of the air traffic control system and through \n     effective and sufficient investment in aviation \n     infrastructure, including the Nation's airports.\n       (6) Numerous studies and reports, including the National \n     Civil Aviation Review Commission, have concluded that the \n     projected expansion of air service may be constrained by \n     gridlock in our Nation's airways, unless substantial \n     management reforms are initiated for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration.\n       (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for \n     safely and efficiently managing the National Airspace System \n     365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration's ability to \n     efficiently manage the air traffic system in the United \n     States is restricted by antiquated air traffic control \n     equipment.\n       (9) The Congress has previously recognized that the \n     Administrator needs relief from the Federal government's \n     cumbersome personnel and procurement laws and regulations to \n     take advantage of emerging technologies and to hire and \n     retain effective managers.\n       (10) The ability of the Administrator to achieve greater \n     efficiencies in the management of the air traffic control \n     system requires additional management reforms, such as the \n     ability to offer incentive pay for excellence in the employee \n     workforce.\n       (11) The ability of the Administrator to effectively manage \n     finances is dependent in part on the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's ability to enter into long-term debt and \n     lease financing of facilities and equipment, which in turn \n     are dependent on sustained sound audits and implementation of \n     a cost management program.\n       (12) The Administrator should use the full authority of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration to make organizational \n     changes to improve the efficiency of the air traffic control \n     system, without compromising the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's primary mission of protecting the safety of \n     the travelling public.\n\n     SEC. 5. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM DEFINED.\n\n       Section 40102(a) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (41) as \n     paragraphs (6) through (42), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) `air traffic control system' means the combination of \n     elements used to safely and efficiently monitor, direct, \n     control, and guide aircraft in the United States and United \n     States-assigned airspace, including--\n       ``(A) allocated electromagnetic spectrum and physical, \n     real, personal, and intellectual property assets making up \n     facilities, equipment, and systems employed to detect, track, \n     and guide aircraft movement;\n       ``(B) laws, regulations, orders, directives, agreements, \n     and licenses;\n       ``(C) published procedures that explain required actions, \n     activities, and techniques used to ensure adequate aircraft \n     separation; and\n       ``(D) trained personnel with specific technical \n     capabilities to satisfy the operational, engineering, \n     management, and planning requirements for air traffic \n     control.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the city of \nPawtucket, Rhode Island's celebration of October as Polish American \nHeritage Month.\n  Famous leaders, musicians and scientists of Polish descent have made \nnumerous contributions to society. Pope John II, of Wadowice, Poland \nwas the first non-Italian Pope chosen by the Roman Catholic Church in \nmore than 400 years. Fryderyk Chopin of Zelazowa Wola, Poland is \nremembered for his unique approach to the piano and is considered one \nof the greatest composers of all time. Marie Curie, of Warsaw, Poland \nwas awarded a Nobel Prize for physics in 1903 and in 1911, a second \nNobel Prize for chemistry. Madame Curie is still the only woman in \nhistory to be awarded two Nobel Prizes.\n  The Polish heritage is so alive today because Polish Americans play \nan active role in their cities, towns and communities. Millions of \nPolish immigrants have settled in cities like Pawtucket all across \nAmerica. The Polish people brought their traditions, faith and pride to \ncommunities across the country and established schools, churches and \norganizations to help celebrate their heritage in America. With over \n47,000 people of Polish descent in Rhode Island alone, one cannot talk \nabout the history of Rhode Island or the history of America without \nrecognizing the contributions of people of Polish descent.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join with the Polish community of \nPawtucket in celebrating the city's Polish American Heritage \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11809-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11809-S11813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE 75TH BIRTHDAY OF PRESIDENT CARTER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a milestone \nin the extraordinary life of one of America's most distinguished \nstatesmen, former President Jimmy Carter, who celebrates his 75th \nbirthday today.\n  Twenty-three years ago, in the turbulent aftermath of Watergate, \nAmericans yearned for a leader of honesty and integrity who would \nsteward the country into an uncertain future. We found that man in \nJames Earl Carter, Jr., a submariner and farmer-turned-Georgia-Governor \nwho we elected our 39th President.\n  President Carter served very honorably and ably during his term in \noffice, earning distinction for diplomatic successes such as overseeing \nin the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty and the Camp David Accords. \nAnd in his 19 years since leaving office, President Carter has \ndemonstrated himself to be one of the world's great humanitarians.\n  In 1982, he founded the Carter Center--a nonprofit, nonpartisan \ncenter dedicated to promoting democracy, human rights, and conflict-\nresolution throughout the world. The center's work has been remarkable. \nIn the past two decades--whether fighting to eradicate Guinea worm \ndisease, thwarting conflict in Haiti, or helping to free political \nprisoners across the globe--President Carter has carved out a deserved \nreputation as one of the most active, humane, and accomplished ex-\nPresidents in American history.\n  President Carter talked candidly about his Presidential legacy and \nhis gratifying years after office in a profile recently written by \nWhite House correspondent Trude B. Feldman to commemorate his 75th \nbirthday. To pay tribute to one of America's eminent leaders, I ask \nthat Ms. Feldman's article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From Los Angeles Times Syndicate International]\n\n                         President Carter at 75\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       Atlanta, Ga.--Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter turns 75 \n     on October 1st and says he is in good shape and determined \n     not to let aging get the better of him.\n       In an interview to mark the milestone, he adds: ``My health \n     is fine. I've had a full and gratifying life, but now is the \n     best time of all.''\n       Does the energetic Carter feel 75 years of age?\n       ``Not really,'' he tells me. ``I feel young. I'm still \n     doing the same things I did twenty years age. I haven't given \n     up active sports, although I cut back on some. I run fewer \n     miles a day and play less tennis. In softball, my pitch is as \n     accurate as ever, but I have little power in my drives, and \n     base running is slower. Still, I don't feel tired and worn \n     out. I continue to explore new opportunities, so I don' feel \n     I'm growing old. But I do know what the calendar says.''\n       Twenty years ago when Carter turned 55, October 1st, by \n     striking coincidence, fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in \n     Judaism. Reflecting on that unusual concurrence in 1979, then \n     President Carter told me: ``Reassessment of the past and \n     plans for the future are important on one's birthday. So all \n     the more important when a birthday falls on the same day as \n     Yom Kippur--a supreme moral and spiritual moment, a time to \n     take stock of one's personal life as well as to evaluate \n     one's role in society . . . We all need a new spirit, a new \n     heart . . . and we can do better by reviewing our past . . . \n     to discover where we went wrong.''\n       America's 39th president, Jimmy Carter lost his re-election \n     bid in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, and was ``devastated, \n     disappointed and frustrated'' at not being able to complete \n     his goals.\n       Two years later, with his disappointment diverted by the \n     writing of his memoir, Carter reverted to his passion for the \n     power of positive thinking, and established, with his wife \n     Rosalynn, The Carter Center, within which he could pursue \n     some of the programs and interests that ``were interrupted \n     when I was forced into involuntary retirement.''\n       The Carter Center, located on 30 acres of a now landscaped \n     hill in Atlanta, from which General William Tecumseh Sherman \n     watched the fledgling city burn in 1864, consists of The \n     Carter Presidential Library and Museum and The Carter Center \n     in four linked circular pods. It is governed by an \n     independent Board of Trustees and yet is a part of Emory \n     University. It brings people and resources together to \n     resolve conflict, promote peace, democracy, and human rights, \n     as well as to fight disease, hunger, poverty, and oppression \n     worldwide.\n       It was at The Carter Center that President William J. \n     Clinton last month presented, separately to Rosalynn and \n     Jimmy Carter, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's \n     highest civilian honor. ``They have done more good things for \n     more people in more places than any other couple,'' Clinton \n     stated. ``The work they do through this extraordinary Center \n     to improve our world is unparalleled in our Nation's history \n     . . . Their journey is one of love and faith, and this Center \n     has been their ministry.''\n       Clinton also remarked that to call Jimmy Carter the \n     greatest former president in history, as many have, doesn't \n     do justice either to him or his work. ``For, in a real sense, \n     this Carter Center . . . is a continuation of the Carter \n     presidency,'' he said. ``The work he did in his four years \n     (1977-81) in the White House not only broke important new \n     ground, it is still playing a large role in shaping today's \n     world.''\n       In accepting the Medal, Carter told the assembled guests--\n     family and friends--that President Clinton's words made him \n     ``almost speechless with emotion,'' and he described the \n     event as ``one of the most beautiful of my life.''\n       Carter went on to say that he and Rosalynn find much \n     satisfaction in The Carter Center, and that it has given \n     them, in effect, a new life, a life of pleasure, challenge, \n     adventure, and unpredictability. ``We have formed close \n     relationships with people in small villages in Africa, and \n     those hungry for freedom and democracy in Indonesia, Haiti, \n     Paraguay, and other countries,'' he stated. ``We try to bring \n     them the blessings of America in an unofficial, but personal \n     way.''\n       He added that he and Rosalynn visited some 115 foreign \n     countries and learned about the people--their despair, \n     hopelessness and lack of self respect. ``We also learned that\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\n     close relations are necessary between governments throughout \n     the world and civilian organizations--non-governmental ones \n     like The Carter Center.''\n       During his birthday interview, I asked Carter if his 75 \n     years were his to live over (again), what would he have done \n     differently?\n       ``As for my life in the White House, the one thing I would \n     have handled differently is the hostage crisis,'' he says. \n     ``From a human aspect, it was the most infuriating experience \n     of my presidency. And had I been successful in rescuing the \n     52 American hostages in Iran, I believe I would have been re-\n     elected president.\n       ``I don't feel grieved that I lost the second term, but \n     what I would have done differently during that ordeal is to \n     send one more helicopter to the desert, one which would have \n     likely resulted in a successful rescue operation.''\n       In Nov. 1979, after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and one \n     year before Carter's defeat for re-election, radical students \n     seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took some 66 Americans \n     as hostages. Although some were subsequently released, 52 \n     were held captive for 444 days--till the end of Carter's \n     presidency.\n       On April 24, 1980, he ordered a covert snatch operation to \n     pluck them out of the embassy. During the operation, two \n     aircraft collided in a desert staging area, killing eight \n     servicemen. In Nov. 1980, the militants relinquished the \n     hostages to the Iranian government. With Algeria acting as an \n     intermediary, a deal was finally struck as \n     Carter's presidency was ending. The hostages were released \n     at noon--U.S. time--on Jan. 20, 1981, just as Carter \n     turned over the U.S. government to its 40th president, \n     Ronald Reagan.\n       When the freed hostages arrived in Wiesbaden, Germany, \n     Carter was there to greet them; and today, he still remembers \n     each of their names, knows their whereabouts and remains in \n     touch with most of them. And they still show their \n     appreciation to him, emotionally, for the political toll that \n     his ``wisdom and patience'' meant for their ultimate safe \n     release.\n       ``I often think about that ordeal,'' Carter says. ``From \n     the outset I felt responsible for their well being. And I \n     remain convinced that the wisest course for a strong nation, \n     when confronted with a similar challenge, should be one of \n     caution and restraint.''\n       As to what he would have done differently in his personal \n     life, Carter says his marriage to Rosalynn has been the best \n     thing that happened to him. ``So, even though she didn't \n     accept my first proposal, I would not have married any \n     differently,'' he adds. ``Rosalynn is the only woman I ever \n     loved. We married 53 years ago and are still bound together \n     with increasing bonds as we grow older and need each other \n     more. When we're apart for even a day, I have the same hollow \n     feeling of loneliness as when I was at sea (in the Navy) \n     early in our marriage. Now, in our golden years, our primary \n     purpose is not just to stay alive, but to savor each \n     opportunity for fulfillment.''\n       Carter admits that, yes, they still argue, but are mature \n     enough not to dwell on disputes, and after a cooling off \n     period, they either ignore their differences or reason with \n     each other.\n       They are close to their three sons, Jack, 52; James Earl 3d \n     (Chip), 49; and Jeffrey, 47; and daughter, Amy. Their ten \n     grandchildren are ``an indescribable blessing . . .''--the \n     most recent one born July 29 to Amy and her husband.\n       Carter muses: ``You remember Amy. She was like a separate \n     family for us because she was born when our youngest son was \n     15 years old. I think that made her special in the minds of \n     people around the world who knew her as a nine year old child \n     in the White House. Now they see her as a 31 year old mother \n     and realize they, too, are now 22 years older. So Amy is a \n     kind of measuring stick for about how much we all have \n     aged.''\n       Also remembered for having brought a child's book to read \n     at a State Dinner, Amy Carter told me that celebrating her \n     dad's 75th birthday means a lot to her because she looks up \n     to him as ``very special'' and one who has always been there \n     for her.\n       ``Dad has always made me feel like I was his priority,'' \n     she says. ``When we lived in the White House, there wasn't a \n     door I couldn't open or a meeting I couldn't interrupt, if it \n     was important that I talk with him.\n       ``He is also wonderful at telling people that he cares \n     about them. That trait is what I hope I have inherited from \n     him.''\n       She adds: ``I'm also grateful that when I was young, he \n     shared with me his love of books because reading has been \n     such a pleasure, and I intend to pass that on to my son. I \n     have fond memories of sitting on my dad's lap while he would \n     help me sound out words in the newspapers.\n       ``There are other nice memories, but one of the least well-\n     known things about my dad is one of the greatest--he has a \n     hilarious and unflinchingly sarcastic sense of humor . . . \n     often directed at himself. Days later, I will suddenly \n     remember something he said, and I laugh out loud. He is still \n     a lot of fun.''\n       Amy's grandmother, Allie Smith, who will celebrate her 94th \n     birthday on Christmas, has known Jimmy Carter since he was \n     born. (The Carters lived next door to the Smiths until the \n     Carters moved to a farm when Rosalynn Smith was one year \n     old.) ``I've watched Jimmy as a boy and as a man, and \n     especially when he began courting Rosalynn,'' Mrs. Smith told \n     me. ``He was a handsome midshipman, and I was pleased when \n     they married.\n       ``At first, he was pretty dominant, but over the years, he \n     and Rosalynn developed into equal partners. Now they share \n     almost everything. Watching them grow older together has been \n     a blessing to me. Jimmy is a fine son in law, just like one \n     of my own sons. He has always worked hard and has been a \n     success in whatever he did.''\n       What is it that drives Jimmy Carter to care about other \n     human beings to the extent that he now does?\n       ``What I do now is what I've done most of my life--to take \n     my talents, abilities, and opportunities and make the most of \n     them,'' he responds. ``It is exciting, challenging, and \n     adventurous. I try new things, go to different countries, \n     make new friends and take on various projects for The Carter \n     Center. I don't consider my activities a sacrifice because \n     they are all personally satisfying.''\n       Asked if the satisfactions are that good, he says, ``Yes, \n     they really are. I am not exaggerating. And what also drives \n     me to stay busy is that I know the time will come--because of \n     health reasons or because of deterioration, physically and \n     mentally--when I will have to somewhat back off. For now, I'm \n     still as aggressive, active, and innovative as I was years \n     ago, and this is the kind of life I enjoy.''\n       Rosalynn Carter, who joins her husband in most of his \n     activities and travels, and shares his work at The Carter \n     Center, says that several things drive him. ``As a boy, Jimmy \n     worked on the family farm with his father, who was a \n     taskmaster,'' she recalls. ``Later, in the Navy, he worked \n     for Admiral (Hyman) Rickover, who had a major influence on \n     him. The Admiral was a driving force, demanded long hours and \n     perfection, and wouldn't waste a moment.\n       ``With that background and the Navy discipline, Jimmy \n     always tried to make his life count for something. He has \n     been given extraordinary opportunities, and he wants to use \n     them . . . As a governor and president, he saw the enormity \n     of the world's problems, and has been driven by his faith and \n     his belief that he needs to help less fortunate people.''\n       Terrence B. Adamson, Senior Vice President for Law, \n     Business & Governmental Affairs of the National Geographic \n     Society, met Carter in 1968 when Terry was a high school \n     senior and Carter was a State Senator in the Georgia General \n     Assembly.\n       Now a close confidant, Adamson says that Carter's love of \n     humanity and of God is what drives him. ``His basic Judaic \n     Christian underpinning is at his core,'' he adds. ``Awards \n     and accolades and wealth aren't important to him. He has \n     grown comfortable with The Carter Center as his legacy--as a \n     viable ongoing institution pursuing advances in health and \n     democracy.''\n       Asked what has motivated Carter in his post presidency, \n     Adamson's response is that Carter is no different now in his \n     core beliefs and values from when he was president. ``Of \n     course, he has matured and grown wiser,'' he says. ``But in \n     1976, he was a sudden entrant on the national scene, not \n     well-known. Over the past 18 years, he has validated, by his \n     conduct, the values he espoused during his presidency. At the \n     time, they were too frequently seen by a cynical public \n     soured by the Watergate scandals as just the mouthings of \n     another politician.''\n       Perhaps Jimmy Carter, an idealist and a realist, was \n     President of the United States before his time. In his final \n     Oval Office interview in Jan. 1981, President Carter told me \n     that he agreed with President Kennedy that no matter what you \n     expect before you become president, there is nothing that \n     prepares you for the difficulties, complexities, or \n     satisfactions of the job.\n       ``Sitting and working in this office is awesome, but I \n     never felt overcome by it,'' he then said. ``I tried to \n     minimize the trappings so that people would be comfortable \n     and not intimidated. I always wanted frank assessments of \n     what was going on around me so I would be aware of the \n     attitude people had towards me and my administration. I liked \n     this job of being President. I didn't find it toilsome. I \n     discovered that when problems were the most severe, that is \n     when my advisers were most often split 50-50 with their \n     advice. And the solution was left to me, as President.''\n       Regarding the qualities a president should have, Carter \n     says: ``A willingness to work hard, a sense of the importance \n     of the office historically and a sense of the common good and \n     general welfare, above and beyond specific interests and \n     pressures.''\n       He adds that a president's responsibilities are constant \n     because something is always happening in some part of the \n     world with which he must concern himself. ``In an emotional, \n     intellectual, and, in some ways, a physical sense, the job is \n     very taxing,'' he relates. ``But so are other important, \n     worthwhile positions which involve much pressure, effort, and \n     conscientiousness.''\n       What specifically had Carter learned from his presidency?\n       ``One thing I learned is that an incumbent president \n     discovers that there are no answers which make everyone \n     happy,'' he replies. ``And sometimes there are no answers \n     that make anyone happy.''\n       Carter went on to say that, had he merely wanted to get \n     rich, he would have remained in the peanut warehouse business \n     or pursued other business opportunities.\n       ``But I've never cared about financial gain. I've always \n     cared about the people in our\n\n[[Page S11811]]\n\n     country and the world,'' he says. ``I wanted to make a \n     difference in people's lives and wanted to change--for the \n     better--the world situation.''\n       When asked how he wants history to regard his presidency, \n     Carter puts it this way: ``As one who did my best to act in \n     the long-term interest of America, and one who did so with an \n     understanding of--but without too great a consideration of--\n     whatever adverse political consequences might flow from it . \n     . .\n       ``You know, the presidency has enriched my life in that I \n     am a better man for having served. And in all humility, I \n     hope that America will consider itself a better place because \n     of my service as president.''\n       In Carter's view, what were the misconceptions of him?\n       ``First, when I was a presidential candidate, I think many \n     people underestimated my tenacity and determination,'' he \n     reflects. ``There were some formidable candidates, including \n     (former Senators) Hubert Humphrey, Henry Jackson, Mo (Morris \n     K.) Udall, Edmund Muskie, Frank Church, and Birch Bayh. They \n     too, underestimated how hard I would work and my desire to \n     win. That was one misassessment of me.\n       ``As President, some people got the impression that I was \n     weak because I didn't send armed forces into battle and \n     didn't bomb or fire missiles at anyone. When there was a \n     serious problem, I tried to work it out through negotiation \n     and mediation, and peaceful, patient policies. I spent much \n     time working on the Panama Canal Treaties, the Mid East Peace \n     process, normalizing relations with China, and helping \n     Rhodesia become an independent nation in southern Africa.\n       ``So, because I was working for peace, emphasizing human \n     rights and not launching missile attacks, the perception was \n     promoted by some that I was weak and not a strong, macho \n     president.''\n       However, former President Gerald R. Ford, who in 1976 lost \n     the Presidency to Jimmy Carter, told me that President Carter \n     had earned high marks in foreign diplomacy in his White House \n     years. ``Today, he should be highly complimented for his \n     continuing leadership in foreign policy under the auspices of \n     The Carter Center,'' Mr. Ford adds. ``America has had an \n     excellent diplomat in Jimmy Carter on a global basis.''\n       And President Clinton recently stated that Carter's \n     noteworthy foreign policy accomplishments include the Panama \n     Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords, the Treaty of Peace \n     between Egypt and Israel, the Salt II treaty with the Soviet \n     Union, and the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations \n     with the People's Republic of China.\n       ``. . . And I was proud to have Carter's support when we \n     worked together to bring democracy back to Haiti and to \n     preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula,'' Clinton \n     observed. ``I'm grateful for the detailed incisive reports he \n     sent me from his trips to troubled nations all across the \n     globe, always urging understanding of their problems and \n     their points of view, always outlining practical steps to \n     progress.''\n       Further citing Carter's influence, Clinton said, ``Any \n     elected leader in Latin America today will tell you that the \n     stand Jimmy Carter took for democracy and human rights in \n     Latin America put America on the right side of history in our \n     hemisphere. He was the first president to put America's \n     commitment to human rights squarely at the heart of our \n     foreign policy. Today, more than half of the world's people \n     live in freedom, not least because he had the faith to lend \n     American support to brave dissidents like Andrei Sakharov, \n     Vaclav Havel, and Nelson Mandela. And there were thousands of \n     less well known political prisoners languishing in jails in \n     the 1970's who were sustained by a smuggled news clipping of \n     Carter championing their cause.''\n       Rosalynn Carter concurs with her husband about the \n     misconceptions of him, namely that working for peace and \n     human rights gave the impression of weakness. ``War is \n     popular,'' she notes, ``but peace takes time, often with an \n     appearance of inaction.''\n       Another misconception, she adds, is that he was not an \n     affective president, ``But I think so much attention was paid \n     to problems that were not of his making, that people were \n     unaware of how much was accomplished,'' she says citing, for \n     instance, the oil crisis that caused the inflation that he \n     inherited and that only began to improve as he left the \n     presidency.\n       ``Yet,'' Mrs. Carter concludes, ``despite the \n     misconceptions, history will treat him well . . . as one of \n     America's best presidents.''\n       Jimmy Carter's clout continues to span some of today's \n     headlines. In the controversy surrounding President Clinton's \n     conditional commutation of the sentence of the Puerto Rican \n     activists, White House aides defend his decision by singling \n     out Carter's support of the President's clemency.\n       Carter considers the pardon a correct decision, but is \n     surprised at the attention focused on his support. He says \n     that he did not personally contact President Clinton on the \n     matter, but that 2 years ago he wrote letters about it to \n     Attorney General Janet Reno.\n       He points out that some of the interest in Clinton's pardon \n     of the Puerto Ricans has been heightened by the fact that his \n     pardon power ``has rarely been exercised'' during his \n     Presidency.\n       For some 6 years, Carter has pursued--directly with \n     President Clinton--a presidential pardon for Patty Hearst, \n     the newspaper heiress. As President, Carter commuted her \n     sentence for bank robbery to the approximately 2 years she \n     had served. But he has long believed that Hearst, who was \n     kidnapped and brutalized by radicals in 1974 as a college \n     student, should receive a presidential pardon because of the \n     ``model'' life she has led for the 20 years since her prison \n     release.\n       Of special concern to Carter today is the chaos and \n     violence in East Timor. He had traveled to Indonesia twice \n     this year, as recently as in July, to lead an international \n     delegation to observe the national election after 38 years of \n     military dictatorship in the world's most populous country--\n     striving to be the third most populous democracy.\n       He says that The Carter Center was also involved, at \n     Indonesia president B.J. Habibi's invitation, in monitoring \n     the August election on independence in East Timor. And his \n     recent personal involvement has contributed to the United \n     Nations peacekeeping mission to East Timor.\n       Even while a resident in the White House, Carter was not \n     impressed with the trappings of pomp and circumstance that \n     surrounded the presidency. He brought informality to the \n     Executive Mansion. He would often carry his own luggage to \n     and from helicopters. Also, when he saw how members of the \n     media were ``contained'' behind ropes while covering his \n     events, he would often walk over and remove the iron chain \n     or untie the ropes.\n       Yet, Carter's National Security Adviser, Dr. Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski, now Counselor at The Center for Strategic & \n     International Studies (CSIS), says that the mass media were \n     extremely unfair regarding President Carter's tenure . . . \n     his performance as former President should generate a \n     reassessment of his presidency.''\n       Thomas P. (``Tip'') O'Neill, former Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, once said that when it comes to \n     understanding the issues of the day, Jimmy Carter is the \n     ``smartest pubic official I knew--the range and extent of his \n     knowledge are astounding. He can speak with authority on \n     almost any topic.''\n       Carter, who has been knighted in Mali and made an honorary \n     tribal chief in Nigeria and Ghana, singles out international \n     human rights as his greatest foreign policy achievement.\n       ``Before I was president, the only president who had \n     emphasized human rights to any degree was Harry Truman,'' \n     Carter notes. ``Now, much attention is paid to global human \n     rights . . . so I hope my legacy as President will include \n     protection of human rights.''\n       Secretary of State Madelein Albright, who worked in the \n     Carter White House as a staff member of the National Security \n     Council, told me that President Carter created an outstanding \n     foreign policy record. ``He put human rights at center state, \n     and the principle has stood the test of time,'' she says. \n     ``Those who worked for him reflect those achievements with \n     great pride. And not only does he have the respect of \n     Americans, but of citizens throughout the world.''\n       Today, Jimmy Carter says he is convinced that he made a \n     difference--in the U.S. and abroad--a difference that is \n     reflected in the work of The Carter Center, now in 35 \n     different nations and Africa. ``In most of the 35 countries, \n     the people see America as a country that may well be on a \n     different planet--a rich, strong, arrogant, and self-\n     satisfying country,'' he says. ``I represent The Carter \n     Center at villages in backward nations in Africa and let the \n     people know that the U.S. really cares about them; that they \n     don't need to suffer from a particular disease, or that they \n     can increase their production of coal, rice and wheat, or \n     that they can find peace . . . for the first time.''\n       What difference has Carter made in Latin America, where his \n     popularity is among the highest in the world?\n       ``The primary difference is the result of my commitment to \n     human rights,'' he responds. ``If you note the history of \n     most of the Latin American countries, including Guatemala, El \n     Salvador, Nicaraqua, Panama, Columbia, Ecuador, Argentina, \n     Chile, Brazil, and Paraquay, each had military dictatorships. \n     When I became President, we impressed on the political \n     leaders and private citizens the significance of basic human \n     rights, democracy and freedom. Now, almost everyone of these \n     countries is a democracy. America's commitments, public and \n     private, are to promote human rights and demand them--not \n     only for Americans but also for others.''\n       Argentina's Ambassador to the U.S. Diego Ramiro Dueler, has \n     often publicly credited Carter for having saved his life, as \n     well as the lives of many current leaders of Argentina.\n       ``During my presidency, thousands of people in Argentina \n     were imprisoned, disappeared while in jail, or were \n     executed,'' Carter says, ``and no one yet knows what happened \n     to them.''\n       He adds that his administration put pressure on the \n     military dictators in Argentina, Chile, and others in Latin \n     America that ultimately forced them to honor human rights and \n     led to the development of democracy in the Americas.\n       ``Frequently,'' Carter humbly notes, ``someone, now in \n     business or government in Latin America, will approach me to \n     say that he owes his life to my emphasis on human rights--and \n     that's quite moving and gratifying.''\n       Robert M. Gates, former Director of the CIA under President \n     George Bush, points out in his book, ``From the Shadows'' \n     (Simon & Schuster, 1996) that Jimmy Carter's contribution to \n     the collapse of the Soviet Union\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\n     and the end of the Cold War had been under appreciated. \n     ``Carter was the first President during the Cold War to \n     challenge publicly and consistently the legitimacy of Soviet \n     rule at home,'' Gates writes. ``His (Carter's) human rights \n     policy, building on the important and then largely \n     unrecognized role of the Helsinki Final Act, by the testimony \n     of countless Soviet and East European dissidents and future \n     democratic leaders, challenged the moral authority of the \n     Soviet government and gave American sanction and support of \n     those resisting that government. . .''\n       Five years ago at The Carter Center, Richard H. Solomon, \n     President of the U.S. Institute of Peace, presented Jimmy \n     Carter its first Spark M. Matsunaga Medal of Peace.\n       The Institute recognized his ``efforts to advance the cause \n     of human rights by making it a cornerstone of U.S. foreign \n     policy'' and his ``leadership, determination, and personal \n     diplomatic skills in concluding the Camp David Accords.''\n       On a par with his human rights accomplishments, Carter \n     believes that another of his achievements was initiated at \n     Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin \n     Mountains, which he made a household name.\n       There, for 13 days and nights in Sept. 1978, Carter \n     provided the mechanism by which Israel's Prime Minister \n     Menachem Begin and Egypt's President Anwar Sadat came \n     together . . . ``to realize their own commitments and \n     hopes.''\n       The intense summit--originally suggested by Rosalynn \n     Carter--resulted in two agreements: establishing a framework \n     for peace in the Mideast; and a framework for the conclusion \n     of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Premier Begin and \n     President Sadat were subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace \n     Prize for their joint achievement.\n       Harold Saunders, then Assistant Secretary of State for Near \n     Eastern and South Asian Affairs, says that the agreement at \n     Camp David and the Peace Treaty ``could not have been \n     achieved without President Carter's tenacity, his personal \n     command of the issues and the relationships he developed with \n     the two leaders and key members of their teams.''\n       On the second anniversary (1980) of the Camp David Accords, \n     Carter told me that when the history books are written, one \n     thing he hopes to see is that he, an American President--\n     representing the United States--``contributed successfully to \n     the security of Israel on a permanent basis and to the peace \n     in the Mideast between Israel and all her neighbors.''\n       Now, as Jimmy Carter reaches his 75th, birthday, I asked \n     him about his vision for the next century.\n       ``My vision for America is that, as the only unchallenged \n     superpower in the world, it will become a true champion of \n     the moral values that have made ours a great nation--\n     involving peace, freedom, democracy, human rights, \n     environmental quality, and the alleviation of human \n     suffering,'' he tells me. ``We should be known by everyone as \n     dedicated to the peaceful resolution of disputes, both \n     involving ourselves and others. If two antagonists are \n     willing, especially among the poorer and more ignored \n     nations, we should be ready and eager to provide assistance, \n     in mediation or negotiation, and our government should reach \n     out to non-governmental organizations to help.''\n       Carter notes, for instance, what the Norwegian government \n     did with an academic group of social scientists to achieve \n     the Oslo peace agreement between the Israelis and \n     Palestinians.\n       ``America should be just as eager to promote freedom and \n     democracy among people now afflicted with totalitarian and \n     abusive regimes,'' he adds. ``This issue should be on the \n     table when our leaders have discussions with others.''\n       He adds that as a non-governmental organization, and with \n     no authority at all, The Carter Center has many such requests \n     each year, and is able to respond only to a few of the most \n     compelling.\n       Carter went on to say that the U.S. should always ``raise \n     high the banner of human rights,'' and be as consistent as \n     possible in the application of this policy.\n       ``No other nation can take an effective lead in carrying \n     out commitments made at the international environmental \n     meeting (held in Rio de Janeiro) in eradicating land mines, \n     in eliminating nuclear arsenals, in protecting the rights of \n     children, or in establishing an effective international \n     Criminal Court.''\n       He concludes: ``The most important single issue to be \n     addressed in the next century is the widening gap between \n     rich people and poor people, both within nations and between \n     the richest and poorest countries. Few Americans know that \n     all other industrialized nations are more generous than we in \n     giving development assistance to the most needy people in the \n     world. In fact, whenever a Norwegian gives a dollar, one of \n     our citizens gives a nickel. To be generous to others would \n     not be a financial sacrifice for us, but a great investment \n     that would pay rich dividends.''\n       Born James Earl Carter, Jr. of English heritage on October \n     1st, 1924 in Wise Hospital, in Plains, Ga., Jimmy Carter was \n     the first president to be born in a hospital.\n       There was no running water or electricity in his home \n     during his early childhood. At age 5, he was selling boiled \n     peanuts to neighbors and friends.\n       His father, a stern disciplinarian, often spanked him for \n     wrong doings, like taking a penny from his church's \n     collection plate, and for shooting his sister with a BB gun.\n       Nicknamed ``Hot Shot,'' and then ``Hot,'' Jimmy Carter's \n     behavior in elementary school was excellent. He was eager to \n     learn almost anything, but his interests then were history \n     and literature.\n       At age 12, when a teacher told him about a book named WAR \n     AND PEACE, he thought it was about cowboys and Indians. With \n     his mother's urging, he became a book enthusiast, and has \n     long been a speed reader.\n       While in the Navy in 1951, Carter began to work for Hyman \n     G. Rickover, who was leading America's nuclear submarine \n     fleet. Carter had responsibility for building the nuclear \n     power plant that would go into the second atomic submarine, \n     the U.S.S. Sea Wolf. ``Admiral Rickover had a tremendous \n     effect on my life,'' Carter says. ``He led the program that \n     developed the world's first use of atomic power for peaceful \n     uses, the production of electricity, and the propulsion of \n     ships.''\n       When Rickover was past 80 and still in charge of the Navy's \n     nuclear power program, President Carter awarded him the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom. And recently the Navy \n     recognized Carter, a graduate of the Naval Academy, by naming \n     a Seawolf-class submarine for him.\n       Jimmy Carter cites three turning points in his long, \n     dynamic and fruitful life: (1) In 1953, when he resigned from \n     the Navy because of his father's death and returned home to \n     run the family peanut warehouse business. (2) In 1962, when \n     he first ran for public office--the State Senate in Georgia. \n     And (3), in 1981, when he left the White House after one term \n     as President of the United States.\n       Looking back, does he still have regrets about losing his \n     re-election bid?\n       ``Well, yes, I do,'' he tells me. ``Anyone who is once \n     elected President of the U.S. certainly prefers to have a \n     second term. At first, there is the disappointment about the \n     unfinished promise of your goals. When my four years ended, I \n     was disheartened. I had not expected to be defeated and I had \n     no plans, at a relatively young age, of how to utilize my \n     time and be productive.''\n       Rosalynn Carter describes his defeat as a startling regret, \n     adding: ``Although I now know that Jimmy is pleased that he \n     had the opportunity to establish The Carter Center--because \n     through it, much has been accomplished--he also believes that \n     if he had been re-elected president, the Center, which has \n     exceeded all of our expectations, probably never would have \n     come into being.''\n       Reflecting on the changes--over the years--in his \n     philosophy, Carter says, ``I think I've become more tolerant \n     of opposing views, and I have learned to accommodate the \n     opinions of people who disagree with me. One reason is that \n     I'm not now in a competitive world. I can live side by side \n     with those who think and act differently from me. I'm not \n     competing with anyone for money, political office, or \n     publicity.''\n       Carter, a lay preacher, adds: ``I'm also more broadminded \n     about things not so narrowly defined in my religious \n     philosophy. As you know, my basic religious faith has never \n     changed. It has been fairly constant. As a Christian, I \n     remain devout, and I read and teach the Bible. I feel an \n     inner peace, an inner sense of commitment and calm that comes \n     from my religious beliefs.''\n       In 1976, then Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley remarked: \n     ``Jimmy Carter talks about true values. He also has a \n     religious tone in what he says . . . and maybe we should have \n     a little more religion in our communi-\n     ties. . . .''\n       The Rev. Billy Graham--who remembers that Jimmy Carter \n     predicted that he would be President before he even became a \n     candidate--describes Carter as ``a man of faith and sterling \n     integrity . . . who was one of our most diligent presidents--\n     persistent and painstaking in his attention to his \n     responsibilities.''\n       In his book, JUST AS I AM (Harper Collins, 1997), Rev. \n     Graham also writes that he respects Jimmy Carter's \n     intelligence and his genuine and unashamed Christian \n     commitment. ``After the disillusionment of Watergate, \n     Americans were attracted by Carter's summons to a moral \n     revival,'' Rev. Graham states . . . ``And other political \n     leaders would do well to learn from his moral and spiritual \n     ideals.''\n       Rosalynn Carter says that her husband has mellowed and is \n     now more relaxed than she has ever seen him. ``Yet,'' she \n     adds, ``I notice that he has become more concerned about the \n     various problems in the world--more so than even before he \n     was elected governor of Georgia (1970).''\n       One issue that Carter continues to be genuinely concerned \n     about is the moral and spiritual crisis that has gripped \n     America since before he was in the White House.\n       ``In today's world, the main difference is that what was \n     then referred to as `political malaise' is much worse,'' he \n     says. ``As I stated twenty years ago in a speech on the \n     crisis of confidence, that is even more relevant and \n     pertinent today. Together, we need to commit ourselves to a \n     rebirth of the American spirit. There is still a crisis of \n     confidence, a crisis that strikes at the heart and soul and \n     spirit of our national will. We see this crisis in the \n     growing doubt about the meaning of our lives and in the loss \n     of unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our \n     confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social \n     and political fabric of America.''\n       How has the presidency evolved since Carter left the White \n     House?\n       ``There are major changes,'' he emphasizes. ``The \n     presidency was once respected as a\n\n[[Page S11813]]\n\n     place of honor. I think our political community has \n     deteriorated tremendously since Gerald Ford and I served as \n     presidents, and we often talk about our concerns and those \n     changes. Rather than politics as usual, strong leadership and \n     honest answers are needed.''\n       He says that, for instance, as President, he had gotten \n     along with the Republicans in the House and Senate; that he \n     had often gotten the support of many Republicans on major \n     legislation, sometimes even better than with the Democrats. \n     ``Now, the two parties are bitterly divided, with little \n     cooperation between them,'' he adds. ``Also, nowadays, the \n     success of many political campaigns is predicated on how well \n     you can damage the reputation of your opponent. That turns \n     off the average citizen, and leads to a partisan and \n     personally destructive situation.\n       He also points out that Congress continues to be pulled in \n     all directions by well financed and powerful special \n     interests. ``But we cannot change the course until we face \n     the truth,'' he says. ``Restoring faith and confidence to \n     America is now still our most important task . . . and now it \n     is a solid, significant challenge.''\n       In recent years, Carter has given a lot of thought to the \n     virtues of aging, especially as it relates to Social \n     Security. He notes that in 1935, when Social Security \n     legislation was passed, its purpose was to give older people \n     a subsistence income.\n       ``Today,'' he says, ``because of improvements in health and \n     health care, many senior citizens are still in a position to \n     contribute to society. We elderly should be allowed to work \n     as long as we wish--or are able to.''\n       However, Carter voices concerns about the future of Social \n     Security. ``The oldest baby boomer will start to receive \n     Social Security in the year 2010,'' he notes. ``By the time \n     my newest grandson, now two months old, is a middle aged wage \n     earner, one in four Americans will be over 65.''\n       Emphasizing that our Social Security system is in trouble \n     and that something will have to change, he recalls that when \n     Social Security was established there were about 40 wage \n     earners supporting each retiree with tax contributions. ``By \n     2010, only two persons will be paying for the retirement and \n     medical expenses of one senior citizen,'' he says.\n       ``We should be more vigilant and forceful in protecting \n     those who are in need of financial assistance. Today, there \n     are numerous senior citizens who cannot afford health care \n     and many older citizens with little money, or whose savings \n     are expended before their lives end.''\n       Carter says he tries to practice what he preaches. In his \n     book, ``The Virtues of Aging'' (Times Books, 1998), he notes \n     that the virtues of aging include the blessings that come as \n     one grows older and what we have to offer that might be \n     beneficial to others.\n       ``Each of us is old when we think we are,'' he writes. \n     ``When we accept an attitude of dormancy, dependence on \n     others, a substantial limitation on our physical and mental \n     activity, and restrictions on the number of people with whom \n     we interact. . . . As I know from experience, this is not \n     tied closely to how many years we live.''\n       He cites, as one example, his mother--a compassionate woman \n     who always tried to help others. She joined the Peace Corps \n     at age 68 in 1996 and served for two years in the village of \n     Vikhroli, near Bombay, India. In Feb. 1977, Lillian Carter as \n     First Mother revisited that village when she represented the \n     U.S. at the funeral of India's President Ali Ahmed \n     Fakhruddin. And during hundreds of speeches about her \n     experiences in the Peace Corps, she encouraged others not to \n     allow old age to put a limit on their lives.\n       ``You know,'' Carter says, ``There is a huge difference \n     between getting older and growing old.'' When my father died, \n     my mother was 55 years old, past retirement age for most \n     registered nurses. Yet she continued to age for 30 more \n     years, but she never grew old. Until she died of cancer at \n     age 85, she was full of life and determined to make each day \n     a new adventure.\n       ``Mother had the most influence over me, and was an \n     inspiration for me. Except for Rosalynn, she affected my life \n     more than any other person.''\n       If there is any secret to Carter's looking and feeling \n     younger than his years, he reveals that perhaps it is because \n     Rosalynn is a stickler for nutrition and an expert on \n     ``exactly what we should or should not eat . . . and how much \n     and when. . . .\n       ``Then, I'm always exercising,'' he adds, ``and luck could \n     also be a factor.''\n       For exercise and recreation, Carter keeps fit and trim by \n     hiking, bicycling, cross-country skiing and bowling. He also \n     jogs, fly fishes, does woodworking, cabinet making and plays \n     tennis. Behind his home he built--by himself--a tennis court. \n     (It was the topic of conversation with network commentators \n     when he attended the recent Women's Finals of tennis' U.S. \n     Open in New York).\n       He also says that, so far, he and Rosalynn have been \n     blessed with good health--``perhaps because of our various \n     activities--living a diverse life, with different elements to \n     it--that kind of life is less likely to be afflicted with \n     illness.''\n       He adds: ``Today, we combine taking care of our farm with \n     other activities. One nice aspect about having been president \n     is that we have an unlimited menu because different people \n     invite us to join in their projects, and now we are free to \n     do what gives us pleasure.\n       ``We have climbed mountains in Nepal, to the tops of \n     Kilimajaro and Mt. Fuji. We visited game preserves in \n     Tanzania and have become bird watchers.''\n       And as a hunter, Carter says he still tries to harvest two \n     wild turkeys each year for his family's thanksgiving and \n     Christmas meals.\n       Jimmy Carter, the most visible member of Habitat for \n     Humanity, also says that every year he goes to a different \n     site to help build at least one house for a poor family. For \n     one week, he works with the family and other volunteers. \n     They start with a concrete slab and by week's end, they \n     complete the job as a finished landscaped house. ``Habitat \n     and I get a lot of publicity for each other even though I \n     only work one week a year,'' he explains. ``But the \n     satisfaction is great.''\n       Last year, he chose the Philippines, where he and two \n     former and a current president of the Philippines joined \n     together to build one house for a large family. In the same \n     week, 293 other houses were built in the Philippines by some \n     10,000 volunteers.\n       Asked if he considers himself a role model for other senior \n     citizens, Carter says he believes that we all can learn from \n     one another. ``With few exceptions,'' he says, ``anyone can \n     find an exciting and fulfilling life after reaching \n     retirement age. I think senior citizens who have setbacks or \n     a surprising retirement--as I had--ought to analyze what they \n     have and decide how to live a meaningful life. Sometimes, an \n     unanticipated life, one you thought would be a \n     disappointment, can turn out to be even better than the one \n     you wanted to cling to.\n       Carter sums up: ``As we get older, senior citizens need to \n     avoid mental dormancy and keep our minds occupied. Mental and \n     physical activities strengthen us and give us a foundation \n     for successful aging. Even though my health is now good and \n     I'm still active in sports, I am often reminded that I face \n     inevitable changes in health as I grow older.''\n       All in all, does aging bother Jimmy Carter?\n       ``Aging doesn't bother me--yet,'' he replies with a wry \n     smile, ``but I'm already preparing for a reduced capacity. I \n     expect to cut the time I devote to overseas work--from peace \n     negotiations; to monitoring elections; to eradicating \n     disease, to eliminating suffering . . . and then I can spend \n     more time at home in Georgia.\n       ``There is a leadership succession plan for The Carter \n     Center, but any transition is a high priority of mine.''\n       For some 17 years, Carter has been a ``distinguished \n     professor'' at Emory University, where he spends one week \n     each month during the academic year. He lectures on numerous \n     topics, including theology, medicine, journalism, creative \n     writing, business, political science, history, and \n     anthropology.\n       He also meets with undergraduate and graduate students, \n     adding a different kind of rigor to doctoral examinations. At \n     times, he deals with current history--history that he himself \n     helped to make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11813-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11813-S11814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REINSDORF STEPS UP TO THE PLATE FOR EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention \nof my colleagues to a column by Raymond Coffey which appeared in the \nChicago Sun-Times on September 30, 1999. Mr. Coffey describes the \nefforts undertaken by Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf to \nimprove literacy among children in Chicago's public schools.\n  Mr. Reinsdorf is assisting Chicago School Board President Gery Chico \nand Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas in the implementation and \nfinancing of Direct Instruction, a program that uses phonics to teach \nreading in the schools. This summer, Mr. Reinsdorf also designated \nWhite Sox manager Jerry Manuel and rookie sensation Chris Singleton to \nsign autographs for all fans donating books to Target Literacy, a joint \ninitiative by Target stores and Sox Training Centers that is seeking to \ndonate a million children's books to needy kids. Mr. Reinsdorf has also \nworked with Mr. Vallas to provide free tickets to public school \nstudents who have distinguished themselves through their academic \nachievements.\n  Mr. President, it is important to recognize individuals in our \ncommunity who go beyond the call of duty to improve the lives of people \nwho are less fortunate than them. Chicago can be proud of the winning \nefforts undertaken by Mr. Reinsdorf throughout the city. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in honoring Mr. Reinsdorf's charitable efforts by \nhaving Ray Coffey's column from the Chicago Sun-Times printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Sept. 30, 1999]\n\n                      Out To Prove Kids Can Learn\n\n                          (By Raymond Coffey)\n\n       As his ``The Kids Can Play'' White Sox close out the \n     baseball season this weekend, Jerry Reinsdorf himself gets my \n     vote as one of the most valuable players Chicago kids have \n     going for them.\n       Though they played before mostly empty seats at Comiskey \n     Park and drew little serious attention or respect, the \n     rebuilding Sox did win more games than the hapless last-\n\n[[Page S11814]]\n\n     place Cubs who, thanks to the Sammy Sosa phenomenon, set an \n     all-time attendance record.\n       More significant than won-lost and tickets-sold records in \n     my score book is what Reinsdorf, who never toots his own \n     horn, is doing for kids.\n       Perhaps most valuable is the working relationship he has \n     established with Chicago School Board President Gery Chico \n     and CEO Paul Vallas in supporting and helping finance \n     literacy programs in the schools. Reinsdorf has, as Sox \n     director of community relations Christine Makowski put it, \n     ``a genuine heartfelt belief'' that literacy is a survival \n     skill without which inner-city kids cannot succeed in making \n     their future.\n       He has worked with Vallas on pushing a program called \n     Direct Instruction--basically a way to teach reading in the \n     schools via phonics. He volunteered to serve as Principal for \n     a Day at Doolittle Middle School near Comiskey Park and \n     regularly has dispatched Sox players to the school to talk \n     with students about the value of education.\n       When Vallas wants to recognize and reward students for \n     scholastic achievement, Reinsdorf regularly arranges free \n     tickets for him to bring sizable groups of kids of a \n     ballgame.\n       Chico and Vallas are in ``constant communication'' with \n     Reinsdorf, Makowski says. ``They can call him anytime'' and \n     get help on the schools.\n       This summer Reinsdorf assigned Sox manager Jerry Manuel and \n     rookie star Chris Singleton to sign autographs for all fans \n     donating books to Target Literacy, a joint initiative by the \n     Target stores and the Sox Training Centers for youngsters to \n     donate a million children's books to needy kids.\n       Reinsdorf takes a lot of media heat for the way he operates \n     the Sox and his Chicago Bulls. And there is, obviously, some \n     self-interest in what he does for kids in connection with his \n     sports franchises and through the separate Sox and Bulls \n     Charities.\n       This season, the Sox gave away 35,000 free tickets, worth \n     about $600,000, to such inner-city social welfare \n     organizations as Boys and Girls Clubs, Mercy Home for Wayward \n     Kids, Hull House and Maryville Academy. The tickets weren't \n     selling anyway, but they went to kids unlikely to be able to \n     buy them and also otherwise unlikely to get to see a big \n     league game.\n       Reinsdorf also has donated 3,000 autographed Sox items to \n     charity raffles and auctions. Members of the current ``Kids'' \n     roster have made 60 appearances before community groups.\n       Through White Sox Charities, Reinsdorf also has distributed \n     more than $3 million to nonprofit organizations, including $1 \n     million to the Chicago Park District to refurbish and \n     maintain 800 baseball diamonds. White Sox Charities also \n     funds the Inner City Little League baseball season. And it \n     has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for cancer \n     research and treatment at Children's Memorial and \n     Northwestern Memorial hospitals.\n       Some 3,000 kids were offered baseball instruction this \n     summer at 160 weeklong camps in the Chicago area and \n     neighboring states. At Comiskey Park itself, before the Sox \n     take the field, kids can get free coaching in batting and \n     pitching cages inside Gate 3.\n       As Makowski acknowledges, Reinsdorf and the Sox franchise \n     hope the focus on kids will generate a new generation of \n     baseball fans. ``We'd like to give them their first major \n     league experience,'' she said. ``We want them to have fun.'' \n     If they go home ``a Sox fan, so much the better.''\n       Even better, they might sometime soon see that indeed ``The \n     Kids Can Play.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11814-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11814-S11815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REVISED REPORT OF EXPENDITURES OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND \n                           APPROPRIATED FUNDS\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                                     U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM APR. 1, TO JUNE 30, 1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Joseph Biden:\n    United States..........................

Res. 182\n\n       Whereas over 150 years ago, United States commemorative \n     stamps began honoring the people, places, and events that \n     have shaped our Nation's history;\n       Whereas in 1999, more than 22,000,000 Americans, including \n     children, collect and learn about our Nation through stamps, \n     making stamp collecting one of the most popular hobbies in \n     our Nation and the world;\n       Whereas as we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, \n     it is important that we pause to reflect on our Nation's \n     history;\n       Whereas stamps honor statesmen and soldiers who fought for \n     freedom and democracy, recognize our Nation's scientific and \n     technological achievements, pay tribute to our Nation's \n     artistic legacy, and celebrate the strength of our Nation's \n     diversity;\n       Whereas starting October 1, 1999, ``National Stamp \n     Collecting Month'' will transform more than 100,000 schools, \n     libraries, and post offices into learning centers where our \n     Nation's young people can honor the past and celebrate the \n     future through stamps;\n       Whereas the founders and participants of ``National Stamp \n     Collecting Month'' include millions of adult and youth \n     collectors, thousands of teachers and schools, the American \n     Philatelic Society, and the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the people, places, and events shaping America \n     today will be United States commemorative stamps tomorrow;\n       Whereas ``National Stamp Collecting Month'' will help \n     empower our Nation's children and future generations to study \n     and learn from our Nation's history; and\n       Whereas as our Nation's children learn the lessons of the \n     past, the children will be better prepared to guide our \n     Nation in the future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates October 1999 as \n     ``National Stamp Collecting Month''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11815-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11815-S11817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nBLACK CANYON OF THE GUNNISON NATIONAL PARK AND GUNNISON GORGE NATIONAL \n                     CONSERVATION AREA ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

FORMS OF ASSISTANCE FOR HURRICANE FLOYD VICTIMS.\n\n       To alleviate the conditions faced by the victims of \n     Hurricane Floyd, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) work with Congress to provide necessary funds for--\n       (A) disaster relief administered by the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency;\n       (B) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Agriculture;\n       (C) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Commerce;\n       (D) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (E) disaster relief administered by the Small Business \n     Administration; and\n       (F) any other disaster relief needed to help rebuild \n     damaged homes, provide for clean water, renourish damaged \n     beaches and protective dunes, and restore electric power; and\n       (2) prepare and submit to Congress a report that analyzes \n     the feasibility and cost of implementing a program to provide \n     disaster assistance to the victims of Hurricane Floyd, \n     including assistance in the form of--\n       (A) direct economic assistance to agricultural producers, \n     small businesses, and displaced persons;\n       (B) an expanded loan and debt restructuring program;\n       (C) cleanup of environmental damage;\n       (D) small business assistance;\n       (E) repair or reconstruction of private homes;\n       (F) repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and \n     trails;\n       (G) provision of safe and adequate water supplies; and\n       (H) restoration of essential utility services such as \n     electric power, telephone, and gas service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11818-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11818-S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want the Senate to know we are still \nworking to get an agreement to take up consideration of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We originally wanted to bring it up next \nweek on October 6. That was objected to by the Democratic leadership. \nThey indicated they thought more time was needed and they needed more \ntime designated for debate. We have now offered to begin on October 8, \nnext Friday, with debate. The debate would go up to 14 hours. We will \nconclude action on that treaty no later than the close of business on \nTuesday, October 12.\n  We are willing to agree to more time on behalf of the leader's \namendments if that is necessary. I believe the Democratic leader has \nindicated his willingness to go to the treaty debate on the 8th and be \non it the 12th and conclude it by the 12th, but we are still working on \ndetails.\n  There were statements made by the President of the United States in \n1998, I believe in his State of the Union Address, and again in 1999, \nthat he wanted the Senate to take up the treaty. I have statements from \na number of Democratic Members of the Congress calling for this to be \ndone.\n  We have said to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle we \ndon't think this is a good treaty; we think it puts safety in jeopardy; \nwe think it puts us in a weakened condition internationally; and we \nthink it is dangerous. However, since there have been calls and demands \nfor a vote, we have offered to vote, and we have offered two different \ndates. We have offered time and more time.\n  I am a little bit puzzled why the Democrats now are saying: We don't \nwant to vote. I presume they are saying it because it may fail. The \nSenate will have a debate, and the Senate will vote. If there is not a \ntwo-thirds vote, it is over; it is defeated.\n  It is hard for me to understand. Do they want it or not? Do they want \nto debate or not? Do they want to vote or not? I think it shows a \nlittle bit about what has been going on all along.\n  I want to assure the Senate, there will be some hearings in the Armed \nServices Committee with experts in this field. There will be plenty of \ninformation on the record. If they want a vote, let's vote; if they \ndon't, let's move on. I don't want to hear more about it for a while.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11819-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDATIONS TO THE PRESIDING OFFICER\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I remind Senators that on Monday, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate \nwill proceed to the Transportation appropriations conference report, \nand a vote will occur immediately on adoption of that conference \nreport, so there will be at least one recorded vote at 5:30 on Monday, \nand it is on the Transportation appropriations conference report. I \nthink a lot of credit, once again,\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\ngoes to our Transportation appropriations subcommittee members. Senator \nShelby of Alabama has done a great job with a very important bill.\n  There may be other votes. There could be a vote on or in relation to \nrelevant amendments on the FAA reauthorization bill, since that bill \nwill be debated early in the day Monday. It could be that an amendment \nor amendments will be available for consideration at that time. But I \nwanted Senators to be on notice we do have the one vote for sure.\n  Also, all Senators should be aware we will convene at 12 noon and we \nwill have a period for morning business until 12:30. We will take up \nthe FAA reform bill the remainder of that day, then, on Monday, until \n4:30, when we will go to, I believe it is, the judicial nominations \ndiscussion. We will very likely have recorded votes on Tuesday morning, \nand then we do have an agreement, I believe, to have recorded votes \nstacked on three nominations at 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue debate on the \nFAA reform bill and complete its action on Tuesday. Then we will return \nto the Labor-HHS appropriations bill and consider nominations and \nconference reports that are available. I understand that the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report will be available on \nMonday. We could have that vote Monday or Tuesday, if a recorded vote \nis necessary. We are hoping the Interior appropriations bill will be on \nthe heels of that one, and I believe we are still waiting for the \nforeign operations conference report. We will interrupt or take as \nquick action as possible on the conference reports once they are \nreceived and we get notification that we intend to have a vote.\n  I do have one further unanimous consent request. I wanted the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota to be here. We have continued \nto work to see if we can get an agreement to vote on the test ban \ntreaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11820-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11820-S11821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 6, the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of Treaty \nDocument 105-28 and the document be placed on the Executive Calendar, \nif not previously reported by the committee.\n  I should note, that is something that was requested by the Democratic \nleadership, and we think it is a reasonable request.\n  I further ask consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, October 8, the \nSenate begin consideration of Treaty Document 105-28 and the treaty be \nadvanced through the various parliamentary stages, up to and including \nthe presentation of the resolution of ratification, and there be one \nrelevant amendment in order to the resolution of ratification to be \noffered by each leader.\n  There was a request for additional time for that debate. Therefore, I \nask consent that there be a total of 14 hours of debate on the treaty \nitself, to be equally divided in the usual form, and no other \namendments, reservations, conditions, declarations, statements, \nunderstandings, or motions be in order, and that amendments be filed at \nthe desk 24 hours before they are called up.\n  I think it is fair. If we are going to have an amendment on our side \nand the other side, we need some notification of its content.\n  There was a thought we might need additional time for discussion on \nthose amendments. Therefore, I ask there be a time limitation of 4 \nhours equally divided on each amendment, in addition to the 14 hours, \nfor a total of 18 hours over a 2-day period, but spread over a period \nof time that I believe will run about 6 days.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time \nand disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nadoption of the resolution of ratification, as amended, if amended, all \nwithout any intervening action or date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nthink this unanimous consent request represents progress from the first \nrequest made by the majority leader. But I still believe this procedure \nis unfair, and I would even say dangerous.\n  This is the most significant treaty with which we will deal on \nnuclear proliferation maybe in the time that the majority leader and I \nwill be leaders. We are going to be taking this up on the Senate floor \nwithout one hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have looked \nback. We do not know when that has ever happened before, when the \nForeign Relations Committee has not acted upon a treaty, even though it \nhas been pending for 2 years.\n  We are hoping that the Committee on Armed Services will take up the \ntreaty next week, but I believe that alone is irresponsible. But we \nbelieve we have no choice. Our choice is to send the message as an \ninstitution that this treaty is not important, it does not even deserve \na hearing, or to send the message, God forbid, that the Senate would \nreject this treaty and say it was not the U.S. intention to send the \nmessage around the world that we will ban nuclear weapons testing. \nThose are the options on the negative side.\n  On the positive side, the option might be between now and October 12, \nwe can convince the necessary two-thirds of the Senate to support this \ntreaty. We still hope, we believe, that might be within our reach. But \nI know what some of the debate will be, and the Presiding Officer or \nthe majority leader will mark my words. We will hear somebody say this \ntreaty is not verifiable, in spite of the fact that expert after expert \nhas noted that it is verifiable, but there will have been no hearings \nto verify the fact that, indeed, this treaty is subject to all the \nverification elements required of a treaty of this kind.\n  We are going to hear all kinds of complaints and all kinds of \nallegations and rumors about what this treaty does or does not do, and \nwhen you do not have hearings, that is what is going to happen.\n  So we are extremely disappointed with the way this has been handled. \nAs I said, I believe it is irresponsible and dangerous. But we also \nnote this may be the best we can get, and if it is the best we can get, \nas troubled as we are, we will take it. We will have our day in court. \nWe will make our best arguments. We will let the judgment of this \nSenate prevail.\n  I am very hopeful the administration will be engaged. I am very \nhopeful those who care as deeply as we care about this issue will join \nus in making the arguments and in dealing with the issue. I also say it \nis my intention, as Democratic leader, to conduct hearings of my own as \npart of the Democratic Policy Committee to ensure that we do have \nexperts in Washington to express themselves. We will do that at the \nappropriate moment.\n  I do not object, but I must express very grave reservations.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the Chair ruled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Is there objection to the \nleader's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic leader has \nagreed to this request. We have worked back and forth now over 2 or 3 \ndays. This is a fair approach, especially with the two leaders' \namendments, if they are needed, and a guarantee we will file them in \ntime to take a look at them.\n  It is serious. I take it very seriously. I do want to make the \nSenator aware that at least one chairman has notified me he intends to \nhave three hearings before the final vote--Senator Warner of the Armed \nServices Committee, which certainly has an interest in this because of \nwhat it does involve, weapons.\n  I believe--I cannot confirm the exactness of these dates or that they \nwill be able to do them all--he is thinking in terms of hearings on the \n6th, 9th, and 12th, and that is a committee which has a great deal of \njurisdiction. I do not know yet if Senator Helms plans additional \nhearings before the 12th, although certainly that is a possibility now \nthat we have a time agreed to.\n  In addition, I understand there have been discussions with regard to \nthis treaty in the Foreign Relations Committee on February 10, 1998; \nMay 13, 1998; June 3, 1998; June 18, 1998; July 13, 1998; February 24, \n1999; and March 23,\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\n1999. Perhaps it was not a full-blown hearing just on that subject; I \ncannot say, but I refer to these dates that were included in the Record \njust yesterday by Senator Helms.\n  There will be at least a couple, if not more, hearings in the \nappropriate committee or committees prior to the final vote.\n  I see Senator Warner is here. He might want to comment on his \nthinking as to the witnesses and how he plans to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with my distinguished leader and Senator \nHelms, we met today for the better part of an hour--and through Senator \nLevin. As my colleague knows, he is absent for reasons of a personal \nneed today. We have carefully laid the foundation for a very thorough \nhearing by the Armed Services Committee. Our committee has supervision \nover the stockpile, and really the stockpile is a central body of fact \nwhich I urge each Senator to study very carefully.\n  What we have proposed to do on Tuesday of next week is to have the \nexperts from the Central Intelligence Agency, from the various \nlaboratories, in closed hearing to lay out the facts with regard to \nthis stockpile. The following Wednesday, we are going to invite the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and former \nSecretaries of Defense and former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, and \nSenator Levin, of course, will have his selection of witnesses.\n  The following day, on Thursday, we again, with the directors of the \nlaboratories and others, will cover more details about the stockpile \nissue and the efforts by this country to put in place testing to be a \nsubstitute--that is, computer analysis, and so forth, as a substitute \nfor actual testing.\n  Our committee will have a very thorough set of hearings. We will \ndistill the facts, provide them for the record, and bring them to the \nrespective leaders, and hopefully perhaps the Senate, as a whole, can \nconsider parts or all of this important testimony.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Warner for that information and for his \nplan and for his working and discussing this with Senator Helms. I \nbelieve it will add a great deal of vital and interesting information \nfor the Senate, and I am sure he will have testimony based on what he \njust said on both sides of the issue. That will be helpful.\n  I have no further business at this time.\n  Mr. President, does Senator Daschle have anything further at this \ntime?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not. I appreciate the majority \nleader yielding.\n  The majority leader made reference to meetings where the CTBT has \nbeen discussed. Certainly we were not in any way acknowledging that \nthis issue has never come up. But I think it is important for the \nrecord, once again, to say that in the time that this treaty has been \nbefore the Senate, not one hearing has been held.\n  I am grateful for the chair of the Armed Services Committee at least \ntaking this initiative, as late as the date may be. It sounds to be a \nvery comprehensive set of hearings. That will be helpful.\n  But I must say, it is equally irresponsible for us to be here at this \nmoment without 1 day where the committee of jurisdiction has held \nhearings on an issue of this import and then ask our colleagues--the \nSenate--to pass judgment.\n  The majority leader knows we have attempted to bring the Senate to \nthis point now for some time. We are pleased that we have made this \nprogress. But, frankly, this isn't the way to do it. We should have had \nhearings in the committee. We are glad we are having hearings in the \nArmed Services Committee. But to rush to judgment on an issue of this \nimportance is not the way to do business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say most respectfully to my good friend, \nthe minority leader, each year the Armed Services Committee reviews the \nstockpile issues. Each year we go through our normal oversight \nhearings. A part of it relates to the very issues that we will again \nbring to the Senate by virtue of the hearings in our committee and the \nrecord that we will put together.\n  So I must say, most respectfully, our committee annually looks at \nthese issues. So for members of our committee, and to the extent others \nhave been interested, in fact, the record is there.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond quickly.\n  I acknowledge that. But I believe there is a huge difference between \nlooking at the issue of stockpile and looking at the importance of the \ntreaty per se, at the language of the treaty, and whether or not we \nought to ratify a treaty, whether or not we ought to send the message \nto the rest of the world that we want them to ratify the treaty, \nwhether the treaty is in our long-term interests, and what the \nramifications of the treaty are. That is what I am suggesting ought to \nbe the subject of these hearings.\n  We ought to be looking at stockpiles, and we ought to be looking at \nthe ramifications of our current nuclear weaponry. And certainly the \nchairman has done an admirable job of that, as has the committee as a \nwhole, but we have not held hearings until now. I think they are long \noverdue. I think we as a Senate have made a very big mistake in calling \nthis treaty to the floor prior to the time we have had that kind of \nconsideration in the Foreign Relations Committee or, for that matter, \nin the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond on that.\n  I do think that a critical part of our decision involves the armed \nservices aspect of it. The review of nuclear weapons--what their \ncondition is, what it will be, what it means for the future--that is at \nthe heart of the concerns that a lot of Senators have, including this \nSenator. I have enough background, having been on the Armed Services \nCommittee in the House and the Senate, to be able to assess, as most \nSenators, after reading the documentation, the ramifications around the \nworld.\n\n  But if we cannot be assured of the safety and the reliability of \nthese weapons, then that goes right to the heart of the whole issue. \nBefore you get to discussion about what it means to Pakistan or India \nor North Korea, you need to know what is going to happen over a period \nof time in terms of safety, the risk to people in the areas, or the \nsurety that we will have these weapons if, in fact, we do need them.\n  I say to Senator Warner, you and I have discussed this already. I \nknow that is the crux of what you are saying.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my concern, as you have said, is a decade \nhence. Will there be some leader in the world or, indeed, some rogue or \nsome other individual who wants to challenge our country who will have \nany basis to believe we have less than 100-percent reliability in that \narsenal of weapons we will have in a decade or 15 years out? That is \nthe critical period of time.\n  I say to my good friend, Senator Daschle, everyone knows my very \nstrong opposition to this treaty. Frequently, colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle engage me in informal debate of what it is about the \ntreaty, what it is about the facts that lead me to this conclusion.\n  So, yes, perhaps we could have been more formalized at some point in \ntime. But I think it is important that we focus on it at this critical \ntime, and that we are going to have very thorough hearings in our \ncommittee. I have looked over the hearings of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee over the year and they, indeed, covered many of the subjects \nrelating to this treaty in that period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/01/senate-section/article/S11821-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
