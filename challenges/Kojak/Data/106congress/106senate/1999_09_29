Also, under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1650 is agreed to.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1650) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to permit Dr. \nJack Chow, Mr. Mark Laisch, and Jane MacDonald to be present in the \nChamber during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill on which we are now proceeding \nallocates some $91.7 billion for the three Departments--the Department \nof Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nDepartment of Labor. It is an increase of $4 billion\n\n[[Page S11586]]\n\nover the program levels for fiscal year 1999. Most of that money is \ntaken up by additional funding for the Department of Education, $2.3 \nbillion, and an increase in the National Institutes of Health, $2 \nbillion.\n  This bill is very close to the President's mark. It is within $1.4 \nbillion of the President's mark. It contains advance funding for \nprograms that are currently forward funded of some $16.46 billion.\n  Last year, the advance funding was $8.5 billion. The advance funding, \nof course, is a consistent, customary practice for the appropriations \nprocess. It is worth noting that the President's suggested mark had \nadvance funding, forward funding, in excess of some $20 billion.\n  In reporting this bill out from the Appropriations Committee \nyesterday, I thanked our distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens, and \nour distinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for the allocations \nwhich have enabled us to reach the floor. This appropriations bill is \nwithin the caps. My distinguished colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, and I \nhave cooperated on a partnership basis. Senator Harkin and I have \nworked for more than a decade as chairman or ranking member, depending \non which party is in power.\n  I learned a long time ago that if you want to get something done here \nin Washington, you have to be willing to cross party lines and work on \na bipartisan basis. When we are dealing with the two top priorities of \nthe country on the domestic scene--education and health care--in \naddition to the very important programs in the Department of Labor on \nworker safety and job training, a bipartisan approach is necessary. \nSenator Harkin and I do present this budget in a bipartisan context.\n  It is our projection, as we move down the line, to present a bill to \nthe President which will be signed. That is not an easy matter, given \nthe budget constraints, given the many different views in the Senate, \nand, quite candidly, given the differing views in the House of \nRepresentatives where we will have to go to conference. But it is our \nhope that we will present to the President a bill which will be signed. \nThat has not been accomplished in recent years. In fact, last year we \ndidn't even get to bring the bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  I think it is generally recognized that the American people are fed \nup, really sick and tired of partisan political bickering in \nWashington. If we are able to have a bill which can be signed by \nPresident Clinton, who is a Democrat, presented to him by a Congress \nwhich is controlled, both Houses, by Republicans, it will be good for \nthe country. It will be good for both parties. It will be good for \neveryone to be able to present a bill on these high priority items of \neducation and health care which can be agreed to.\n  Just a few of the highlights of this bill: The bill is more than $500 \nmillion over the President's requests on education. We think that is a \nmatter of great significance because education funding is a priority \nsecond to none. Head Start, which has been a very important program for \neveryone, but emphasized by the President--and I enumerate a number of \nitems where we have acceded to the President's priority line but, in \naccordance with the constitutional authority to the Congress for \nappropriations, we have exercised our own judgments. Senator Harkin \nwill comment on this, as we have had a bipartisan approach, which is an \napproach with Democrats--not necessarily the President's approach, but \nan approach by the Democrats--as we have put in some of our own \npriorities, as they have been reflected in requests we have received \nfrom 100 Senators and from many in the private sector.\n  We have received over 1,000 letters from Senators requesting 2,188 \nreport, bill, or number item changes. In addition, the subcommittee \nreceived over 1,000 requests from outside individuals and \norganizations. Many of those requests have come in air travel from \nWashington to Chicago and Des Moines, where Senator Harkin has been \nimportuned by his constituents, not only from Iowa but his constituents \nfrom the United States, because he is a United States Senator as well \nas a Senator from Iowa. Many of these requests have come on the \nMetroliner between Washington and Philadelphia, as people have \napproached me with their requests.\n  So that in coming to this proposal, it is a matter of establishing \npriorities. That is not easy to do. With a budget of nearly $1.8 \ntrillion, the whole budget process is priorities. We have established \nwhat we think are appropriate lines of priorities. It is worthwhile to \nnote that the President has emphasized Head Start; we have agreed with \nhim. We have a Head Start Program in excess of $5 billion, with an \nincrease of more than $600 million.\n\n  We have had requests from the President on an important program \ncalled GEAR UP, which is designed to help low-income elementary and \nsecondary school children prepare for college. My distinguished \ncolleague, Chaka Fattah, a Member of the House of Representatives from \nPhiladelphia, originated this program. The President has embraced it, \nand we have funded it this year for $120 million. The President asked \nfor an increase. Senator Harkin and our subcommittee and the full \ncommittee have increased it by 50 percent to $180 million. I joined the \nPresident in one of his weekly radio announcements and talked to him \nafterward, as I listened to his interest in this on a priority basis. \nWe have increased, as I say, funding there by some 50 percent.\n  Special education has been a matter of high priority. Now we have \nmore than $6 billion, an increase of more than $900 million this year. \nI could go over quite a number of the other lists, but the President's \npriorities have been accorded very substantial consideration and \napproval.\n  The Ricky Ray Program now has $50 million to compensate hemophilia \nvictims. On our Pell grants, in accordance, again, with the \nadministration's request, we have put in an increase to bring them to \n$3,325 on the maximum Pell grant a year. Again, on an item of \nimportance emphasized by the White House and many Senators, LIHEAP, \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance, has been funded for $1.1 billion.\n  On the health line, the subcommittee included a mark of $2 billion, \nwhich was approved by the full committee. The National Institutes of \nHealth, in my judgment, are the crown jewels of the Federal Government, \nperhaps the only jewels of the Federal Government. We are on the verge \nof phenomenal breakthroughs on many dreaded ailments.\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing on Parkinson's disease with Michael J. \nFox coming in, putting a face on that human tragedy, a person who is \nwell known and loved by so many millions of Americans as a television \npersonality. It happens to be a fact of life that when Michael J. Fox \ncomes in and testifies about his own trauma, a young man at the age of \n39, with three children, facing a very uncertain medical future--\nmedical experts testify that we may well be within 5 years of a cure \nfor Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart ailments and a long list of \nvery tragic ailments. One of the aspects of chairing the subcommittee \nhas been to be the recipient of requests from people with strange and \nrare illnesses. We have tried to raise the level of funding at the \nNational Institutes of Health so there can be maximum accommodation for \nresearch on so many lines. Even with this $2 billion increase, raising \nfrom $15.6 billion to $17.6 billion, there are many lines which we \ncannot fund totally.\n  We still have, out of every 10 doors of research, the possibility \nthat 7 will remain unopened.\n  It is my personal view that with a national budget of $1.8 trillion \nwe ought to fund all of the meritorious applications. That can't be \ndone. Many people have looked at this $2 billion increase, and have \nsaid: How can we afford it? The response that Senator Harkin, our \nsubcommittee, and the full committee have given us is: How can we not \nafford it?\n  One item we ought to be mentioning is that the language on stem cell \nresearch, which would have eliminated certain restrictions from the \nNational Institutes of Health, has been deleted. That was inserted on \nthe initiative from the leadership of the subcommittee because the stem \ncell research has such enormous potential. The stem cell research can \ngo forward now with private funding extracting the stem cells from \nembryos, and then the Federal funding coming in on the stem cells which \nhave been extracted.\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\n  It is my personal view--and the view which Senator Harkin expressed \nforcefully at the subcommittee yesterday--that some of the existing \nlimitations ought to be eliminated from this bill. The embryos which \nare involved are not embryos which would create human life. They are \nembryos which have been discarded from in vitro fertilization. The \nbill's prohibition against research on embryos will stay intact.\n  But what we had originally contemplated was to allow Federal funding \nto NIH on extracting stem cells from the embryos. But that has been \neliminated at the request of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Stevens. We have eliminated that \nbecause we never could have finished this bill by the close of business \ntomorrow had it remained.\n  Senator Lott has made a commitment that he will take up a \nfreestanding bill in February, and our subcommittee will move forward \nto extensive hearings so that everybody may be informed.\n  There is a lack of information about the importance to medical \nresearch in these stem cells and the fact that does not really impinge \nupon embryos which could produce life.\n  There are many similarities between this debate and the debate on \nfetal tissue where for a long time fetal tissue could not be used in \nresearch because of a concern that it would promote abortions, and then \nthe understanding was driven home that it would not promote abortions \nbut would only use fetal tissues from abortions which had already been \nconcluded.\n  To repeat, this will be taken up in February.\n  One other initiative which deserves attention is an initiative on \nschool violence prevention. We have seen on a recurring basis the \ntragedies of school violence. The subcommittee undertook three active \nworking sessions lasting about an hour and a half each where I presided \nin order to bring forward the experts on the working level. From that \neffort has come a program which is described on pages 6 to 14 of our \nreport.\n  We brought together ranking officials and people very knowledgeable \nfrom the field, including the Deputy Attorney General, the Surgeon \nGeneral, representatives of the Office of Management and Budget, \nrepresentatives from elementary and secondary education, from the \nDepartment's units administering safe and drug-free schools, from \nspecial education, from the Administration for Children and Families, \nfrom the National Institute of Mental Health, from Mental Health \nServices, Substance Abuse, from the Centers for Disease Control and the \nDivision of Violence Prevention, from the Office of the Victims of \nCrime, from employment and training programs from the Department of \nLabor, and from the Association of School Psychologists--all who have \nput together a comprehensive bill which essentially involves the \nreallocation of some $851 million. Not pointing the finger of blame in \nany direction but recognizing school violence as a national health \nproblem, as suggested years ago by the Surgeon General, and putting it \nunder the Surgeon General where we are coordinating with Bruce Reed \nfrom the White House Domestic Council--a program has been created which \nwe believe has long range potential. Included in the funding, in \naddition, are important programs on worker safety.\n  In the interest of time, I will not delineate all of them. They have \nbeen set forth in some detail.\n  On a personal note, I have recused myself on the funding for the \nNational Constitution Center, since my wife, Joan Specter, is director \nof fundraising for the National Constitution Center. Senator Thad \nCochran, the senior Republican on the committee, has taken over.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from me to Senator Cochran on \nthis subject, dated September 17, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad: As a precautionary matter, I think it is \n     advisable for me to recuse myself on the issue of the \n     appropriation for the National Constitution Center since my \n     wife, Joan Specter, is director of fundraising.\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would substitute for \n     me on that issue since you are the senior Republican on the \n     Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an abbreviated statement of what \nthe bill contains.\n  In the interest of moving us promptly as possible to the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, I am going to yield the \nfloor at this time and yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator \nHarkin, whom I again thank for his total cooperation and partnership \nand bipartisan approach to this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before beginning my comments, I ask \nunanimous consent that Jane Daye, a member of my staff on detail from \nHHS, be afforded floor privileges during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two of \nSenator Inouye's staff, Andrew Peters and Patricia Boyle, be given \nfloor privileges during the consideration of the bill now before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I again thank Senator Specter and his \nstaff for all of their hard work in putting this bill together. Senator \nSpecter has done, indeed, a commendable job. He has done so in a \nprofessional and bipartisan fashion under very difficult and trying \ncircumstances. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his patience, his \ngood work, and, above all, his persistence.\n  Again, my good friend, Senator Specter, spoke of the bipartisan \neffort on this, and that he is hoping the President will sign this \nbill. I will have something to say about that in a moment. But I want \nto make it clear that in no way do we want to delay this bill. We ought \nto get it up and get it through. I am just sorry that we didn't get it \nup earlier this year. I still feel compelled to say that of the 13 \nappropriations bills, this is the last one. That should not be our \npriority. Education and Health and Human Services should not be the \nlast priority. It should not be the last bill up for the fiscal year. \nIt should have been the first bill and not the last bill. But we are \nhere. The fiscal year is drawing to a close, and hopefully we can get \nthis through.\n  But I want to point out that in my role as ranking member, while I \nwill be supportive of Senator Specter in his efforts to get this bill \nthrough, I want to make sure that I protect the rights of Senators on \nthis side of the aisle to offer amendments and to debate them in a \ntimely fashion.\n  Before I say a few more words about the contents of the bill, I think \nit is important that I briefly talk about the funding of the bill and \nhow it plays into the overall budget situation.\n  First, let me repeat what I said yesterday in our committee markup.\n  I am very pleased that the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee has worked to restore a more reasonable level of funding for \nthis bill. Investments in education and health, labor, and other areas \nare key to our Nation's quality of life, our future, and our next \ngeneration of children.\n  I am concerned, however, that it now seems that the Republican \nleadership intends to simply shift the funds for the census and the \nPentagon to our bill as emergency spending when clearly they are not \nemergencies. In other words, it looks as if the leadership is going to \ndeclare the funds for the census and the Pentagon--which have been \nshifted to fund our bill--as emergency spending--emergency for the \ncensus and emergency for the Pentagon. They are not emergencies. Even \nThomas Jefferson could have told us there would be a census in the year \n2000. That is no emergency. The Republican leadership is playing a \nshell game, and the loser may be Social Security.\n  Money is being moved from one bill to another to make it look as if \nwe can fund all 13 appropriations bills with all\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\ntheir priorities and still stay within the budget caps.\n  According to CBO, the Republican leadership has already spent the \nprojected on-budget surplus for next year. About $14 billion of the \nnon-Social Security budget surplus has already been spent. In addition, \nit looks as though there has already been about another $19 billion dig \ninto Social Security.\n  Declaring the census and the Pentagon--which are clearly nonemergency \nitems--emergency spending doesn't mean anything. It means the \nRepublican leadership will dig that much further into the Social \nSecurity surplus in fiscal year 2000. Stay tuned for the next chapter \nbecause it looks as though Social Security is going to have a big bite \ntaken out. It shouldn't be that way.\n  I have drafted legislation that imposes penalties on tobacco \ncompanies that fail to reduce teen smoking. CBO has scored my amendment \nas raising approximately $6 billion in fiscal year 2000. I think that \nis better than taking it out of Social Security.\n  Before the whole process is completed--I don't mean this bill; I mean \nthe whole process this year--we will be looking for new sources of \nrevenue to offset the costs of appropriations without tapping into \nSocial Security. I believe getting this money from the tobacco \ncompanies that have already set their targets for reducing teen smoking \nand having them pay penalties is a much fairer and better way of \nmeeting our goals in our appropriations bills than tapping Social \nSecurity.\n  Having said that, there are many excellent items in this bill. In \nparticular, I commend the chairman for the $2 billion increase in NIH. \nYesterday, as Senator Specter said, there was a hearing held on \nParkinson's disease. This is a disease that causes untold human \nsuffering, a disease that scientists believe may be cured within the \nnext 10 years or drastically reduced and alleviated. Under Senator \nSpecter's leadership, we are taking another step to realize that \nresult.\n  The morning shows today were talking about the hearing yesterday. \nMichael J. Fox, the famous movie actor who testified, showed his \ntrembling hands and how Parkinson's disease was affecting him. It was \nquite a poignant representation of the ravages of Parkinson's disease. \nOf course, those who had the privilege of serving with Congressman Mo \nUdall from Arizona know how that affected him and the suffering it \ncaused him in his later years.\n  Most scientists believe one of the major steps that can be taken in \nfinding the pathways to interventions and cures for Parkinson's disease \nis through adequate funding of stem cell research. We had it in this \nbill until it was taken out in committee yesterday on a split vote. I \nthink it won by two votes, if I am not mistaken. It was a close vote.\n  The provisions on stem cell research were removed. That is a shame. \nPeople suffering from Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injuries, \nneurological problems, neurological diseases, and neurological \naccidents could have hope. For example, I think of Christopher Reeves, \nwho has been so diligent and energetic in his efforts to push for more \nresearch in finding how to repair damaged spinal cords. Here is an \navenue of research that could collapse the timeframe and lead to major \nbreakthroughs on repairing neurological damage through stem cell \nresearch. Yet because of a handful of people in the Senate or the \nHouse--I don't know where, but it comes from the Republican \nleadership--we couldn't bring this bill out with that stem cell \nresearch provision. That is a shame.\n\n  I was talking to some Senators yesterday who started talking about \npartial-birth abortion and all that kind of stuff. I said, wait a \nminute. What does that have to do with stem cell research? Absolutely \nnothing. Again, as I stated in committee, and I will state again for \nthe Record on the floor, we approve in this country--and I think all \nthe major religions and ethicists all agree--in vitro fertilization is \nnot only permissible and acceptable but a very good way for a woman who \nmay have problems getting pregnant and bearing a child to do so. In \nvitro fertilization is a widely accepted practice where the egg is \nremoved from the mother and mated to a sperm. These eggs are then \nfrozen in nitrogen and one is implanted. If it takes, a baby results, a \nchild results, and we have some very happy parents.\n  However, there are a lot of fertilized eggs still frozen in liquid \nnitrogen. That is what we are talking about. That is where they want to \nget the stem cells. It has nothing to do with partial-birth abortion or \nanything else. The Cell Biology Association says there are probably \nabout 100,000 frozen fertilized eggs in the country. That is where the \nscientists get the stem cells. These fertilized eggs will be destroyed \nanyway. They are not going to keep them forever in liquid nitrogen; \nthey will be destroyed. Scientists say, why not let scientists take the \nstem cells out to do the kind of stem cell research we need to find the \ncures for Parkinson's and spinal cord injury.\n  That is what was in our bill. Here are the restrictions we have \nplaced in our bill. First, we say the stem cell research had to be \nconducted under ethical guidelines. Second, to use any of the \nfertilized eggs to extract the stem cells, scientists must have the \ninformed consent of the donor. Third, we could only use stem cells from \nfertilized eggs that are the result of in vitro fertilization. We had \nall of these restrictions.\n  Why would we want to take that out of the bill? I understand the \nleadership says they want to take it out because it couldn't pass with \nit. Why? Because there are two or three people who have some hangup \nabout this. Perhaps they don't understand. If we could debate it and \nfully flesh it out and get it out, perhaps then people would understand \nwhat we are trying to do. I think there is a lot of information being \npromoted and bandied about on stem cell research that is totally false. \nIt prohibits Congress from doing what I think is in the best interests \nof morality, ethics, and science. So we do not have it in the bill. Now \nI hear the leadership says they are going to have hearings next year \nand bring up a separate bill in February. I will believe it when I see \nit because we cannot get it on this bill, and this is where it \nlogically belongs. This is the bill with all biomedical research funded \nby the Federal Government, with a couple of exceptions in the \nDepartment of Defense. This is the proper place for it.\n\n  I cannot see why it is going to take a long time. We have had \nhearings on it. Senator Specter has had hearings on it. We have had \nhearings on it in other committees. How many more hearings do we need? \nHow many more people have to come down with Parkinson's, die of \nParkinson's? How many more people have to linger with spinal cord \ninjuries and other neurological problems before we have the guts to do \nwhat is right around here and give the scientists the tools they need \nto do the research in stem cells?\n  So I am very upset that this was taken out--and taken out, I might \nadd, at the behest of the leadership, not the chairman of the \nsubcommittee nor the chairman of the full committee, as I understand \nit, but of the leadership of the Senate. I think it is wrong to do \nthat, coming on the heels of this very powerful hearing yesterday, with \nall the national publicity coming out, even yet today, on Parkinson's \ndisease, to say: Yes, but I am sorry, we are not going to permit nor \nfund the kind of research that would lead to a possible cure.\n  I want to make it clear, there is some stem cell research that will \nbe conducted by NIH but only from two stem cell lines from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins. These are just from two \nsources. When you have 100,000 in the United States, you can get stem \ncell lines from a lot of different sources.\n  I am trying to think of an analogy here. This is akin to doing \nresearch on cancer but saying: But you can only do research on \npancreatic cancer. You cannot do research on prostate or breast cancer \nor thyroid cancer or anything else, but you can do it on pancreatic. \nThat is all. That is all we are going to allow. That is basically what \nwe are saying on stem cell research: You can do this little bit of \nresearch, but you can't do the kind of broad research with which you \nopen the doors and find some of the answers.\n  Again, I wanted to go on a bit on this because I think it is that \nvitally important. I think it is wrongheaded--I might even have \nstronger words than that but not appropriate for the Senate floor--for \nthe Republican leadership to demand this be taken out of our bill. I\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\nbelieve the votes would be here if the Republican leadership would \nstand up for it. Oh, we would probably have a few people, misinformed, \nnot understanding the situation, who might vote against it. But I \nbelieve the provisions we had in this bill, carefully crafted to \nprovide all the protections, would have garnered an overwhelming vote \nin the Senate--were it not for the leadership's position.\n  Again, I might add, as I said, there are a lot of good things in this \nbill for which Senator Specter has fought: A billion dollars for \ncommunity health centers, a $100 million increase of vital importance \nfor low-income people who do not have insurance coverage. In fact, it \nis probably the best bulwark we have for preventive health care, \nkeeping healthy low-income people who do not have health care \ninsurance. We have $400 million for afterschool programs; that is a \n$200 million increase.\n\n  Again, I compliment Senator Specter for the anti-school-violence bill \nhe has put together, of which I am a cosponsor. As we pointed out, \nthere is a lot of talk about school violence these days. The fact is, \nschools are the safest places for our kids. Less than 1 percent of the \nviolence committed by or against kids is done in school--less than 1 \npercent. Most of the violence happens after school. That is why we need \nstrong afterschool programs. We have all these school buildings around \nthis country, we have put a lot of money in them, and at 3 o'clock in \nthe afternoon they lock the doors. What is inside? There are \ngymnasiums, there are swimming pools, there are art rooms, there are \ncomputer rooms, basketball courts, weight rooms, music rooms--all \nbehind locked doors at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. You have these kids \non the street looking for something to do, and that is when the \nviolence happens; that is when the drugs happen. What Senator Specter \nand I and others have done is increased by $200 million last year, up \nto $400 million, afterschool programs.\n  Obviously, if you are going to leave the doors of the school open, \nyou have to pay. It costs money for heating, air conditioning; it costs \nmoney for supervision, for people to run the programs. If you have a \nmusic room, maybe kids want to take up music after school; maybe they \nwant to take up theater. Maybe these young people would like to act a \nlittle bit, get into theater. You are going to have to have somebody \nthere working with them. Better we pay the cost of an art teacher, a \nmusic teacher, a phys ed instructor or whatever for the 3 hours or 4 \nhours from after school until the time for dinner at home--better we \npay that than we pay for the violence and the drugs and stuff that is \nhappening on the streets. I hope this marks a steady increase this \nyear, next year, and the year after that in afterschool programs.\n  We have $5.3 billion for Head Start, an increase of $608 million, \nagain moving toward the target of making sure that, in America, every \n4-year-old who is eligible is covered for Head Start. I am told that \nwith this increase we are getting close to 80-percent coverage of all \neligible 4-year-olds, so hopefully next year we can close that gap and \nget 100-percent coverage. We have increased the maximum Pell grants to \n$3,325, a $200 increase for low-income students to go to college. So \nthere are some good things.\n  But there are some big holes in this bill that need to be filled. One \nof those, perhaps one of the most important--and it is critically \nimportant--is the provision the Senator from Washington State, Mrs. \nMurray, I am sure will shortly be talking about. That is the issue of \nclass size reduction. Last year, we put in money for class size \nreduction. We put in $1.2 billion last year, and we hired 30,000 \nteachers around the country to reduce class size. This was a high \npriority of everyone. When you talk about bipartisanship, let me read \nwhat former Speaker Newt Gingrich said of the class size reduction \nprogram:\n\n       A great victory for the American people. There will be more \n     teachers, and that is good for all Americans.\n\n  The former Speaker, Newt Gingrich--not a Democrat.\n  House Majority Leader Dick Armey last year, on class size reduction, \nsaid:\n\n       Good for America and good for the schoolchildren.\n\n  Finally, Bill Goodling, chairman of the House Education Committee, \nsaid, referring, again, to the class size reduction program:\n\n       It is a huge win for local educators and parents.\n\n  This year, the Republican leadership is saying we have to cancel the \nprogram, cancel it--$1.2 billion. We hired 30,000 teachers, and they \nare saying this year: Fire them all.\n  Oh, yes, they are going to say: We are going to put the $1.2 billion \ninto some kind of block grant program, and then they can use it for \nthis, use it for that, and all that stuff. The priority we have heard \nfrom teachers, principals, superintendents, and from parents around the \ncountry is that we need to reduce class size. I have heard, on the \nRepublican side, talk that we need teacher qualification, teacher \nupgrading. I am all for that, but I do not care; you can give me the \nbest qualified, best trained teacher in the world, and if he or she is \nteaching a second grade class that has 35 or 40 kids in it, I am sorry, \nthey cannot handle it; I don't care how well trained they are.\n  We had a priority last year on the course of hiring an additional \n100,000 teachers to reduce class size in this country, a goal that was \nshared by the former Speaker of the House, the House majority leader, \nand the Republican chairman of the House Education Committee.\n  This year, the Republican leadership says no; because President \nClinton wants it, we are going to cut it out. Talk about \nbipartisanship. This was a bill that had broad-based support. I do not \nsee it as a Republican or Democratic provision at all.\n  I have heard from parents in Iowa about reducing class size, and they \ndid not say I am a Democrat or I am a Republican and here is what I \nwant. They said: I am a parent and my kid is in a class with 30-some \nkids and it is too big.\n  I hear from teachers. They did not tell me if they were Republican or \nDemocrat. I don't know. I did not ask. They complained to me about what \nit is like as a young teacher just out of college. They have their \nteaching certificate, and they are on their way. They want to be a good \nteacher. They want to make a good profession out of it, and they get \nstuck in a second-grade class with, I heard one of them say, 38 kids. \nTalk about teacher burnout. You can handle that for about 2 years and \nthen you are out the door. That is why we are losing so many young \nbright teachers. They want to teach. They want to get to know their \nkids and to work with those kids. They cannot do it when they have 30 \nkids in a classroom.\n  What we have is a bill that basically disinvests the investment we \nstarted last year in reducing class size. If this bill were to go \nthrough as it is, 30,000 teachers hired last year will have to be let \ngo this year. They say: We are going to put money in block grants if \nthey want to do it. I am sorry, we decided we needed to reduce class \nsizes. Let's keep our eye on the prize. Let's keep our eye on the goal. \nLet's at least accomplish one goal for our kids that we set out to do, \nand that is to reduce class size.\n  They say they are going to provide $1.2 billion for a teacher \nassistance initiative. There are two problems with this approach. \nFirst, I do not know what the teacher assistance initiative is. Maybe \nsomeone can explain it. We have not had any hearings on it. We had lots \nof hearings on reducing class size. I do not know what a teacher \nassistance initiative is. Some fancy words.\n  Secondly, when is it going to be authorized? I also serve on the \nauthorizing committee, and the bill to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act has not even been written. We have had \nhearings. We are a long way from passing this major legislation. Under \nthe existing law, even though the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct expires this fiscal year--tomorrow--under the law, we are given a \n1-year extension, a 1-year grace period. You know how the Congress is, \nMr. President. If we get an extension, we will fill up the time. Quite \nfrankly, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is not going to be \npassed this year; it is going to be passed next year.\n  For some reason, the Republican leadership wants no part of the \ninitiative to reduce class size, I guess because the President wants \nit. Well, big\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\ndeal. Last year, the Speaker of the House, the majority leader and the \nRepublican chairman of the Education Committee wanted it, too. Why is \nit just because President Clinton wants it they do not want to go along \nwith it? I do not understand that. I simply do not understand that.\n  Last night, President Clinton announced his intention to veto this \nbill if it comes to him in its current form. He will veto the bill \nbecause it does not guarantee we can continue the class size reduction \nprogram that we initiated last year.\n  I have a statement by the President. I will read it:\n\n       Today the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education appropriations committee passed a spending bill \n     that fails to invest in key initiatives to raise student \n     achievement. While its funding levels are better than those \n     of the House version, the Senate bill still falls short of \n     what we need to strengthen America's schools. It does not \n     guarantee a single dollar for our efforts to hire quality \n     teachers and reduce class size in the early grades. It cuts \n     funding for education technology and underfunds such efforts \n     as GEAR UP and after-school programs. And it does not provide \n     funding to turn around failing schools.\n       To develop world-class schools, we need to invest more and \n     demand more in return. We need accountability from our \n     schools--and from our Congress, too. . . .\n       If this bill were to come to me in its current form I would \n     have to veto it. I believe, however, that we can avoid this \n     course. I sent the Congress a budget for the programs covered \n     by this bill that provided for essential investments in \n     America's needs, and that was fully paid for. I look forward \n     to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure that \n     this bill strengthens public education and other important \n     national priorities.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President's statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                               September 28, 1999.\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n       Today the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education appropriations committee passed a spending bill \n     that fails to invest in key initiatives to raise student \n     achievement. While its funding levels are better than those \n     of the House version, the Senate bill still falls short of \n     what we need to strengthen America's schools. It does not \n     guarantee a single dollar for our efforts to hire quality \n     teachers and reduce class size in the early grades. It cuts \n     funding for education technology, and underfunds such efforts \n     as GEAR UP and after-school programs. And it does not provide \n     funding to turn around failing schools.\n       To develop world-class schools, we need to invest more and \n     demand more in return. We need accountability from our \n     schools--and from our Congress too.\n       In addition, the reduction in funding for the Social \n     Services Block Grant could severely undermine state and local \n     efforts to provide child care, child welfare programs, and \n     services for the disabled. By failing to fund the Family \n     Caregiver initiative, the bill also withholds critical aid to \n     families caring for elderly or ill relatives. The legislation \n     also shortchanges public health priorities in preventive and \n     mental health, and underfunds programs that would give \n     millions of Americans improved access to health care.\n       If this bill were to come to me in its current form I would \n     have to veto it. I believe, however, that we can avoid this \n     course. I sent the Congress a budget for the programs covered \n     by this bill that provided for essential investments in \n     America's needs, and that was fully paid for. I look forward \n     to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure that \n     this bill strengthens public education and other important \n     national priorities.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, all I can say is, I wish they could put \nSenator Specter and me in a room. I think we would come up with a good \nbipartisan bill. We have already. Because of some outside influences, \nwe are going to have some real problems. That is a shame.\n  I believe my colleague, Senator Murray, will be offering an amendment \nto authorize and fund the program as we did last year to reduce class \nsize. This amendment will ensure that school districts across the \ncountry will not have to lay off almost 30,000 new teachers hired this \nfall. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment.\n  Again, before I close, I thank Senator Specter and his staff for all \ntheir work and their willingness to work together in a truly bipartisan \nfashion to get this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, for his generous remarks. There are one or two points \nabout which I would like to comment.\n  With respect to the stem cell issue, on the merits and on the \nsubstance, I agree with what Senator Harkin said, that ultimately we \nought to reduce the limitations on the National Institutes of Health. I \nthink it appropriate to say that I took the initiative in putting that \nlanguage in the bill.\n  I also agree with Senator Harkin that this is an issue which I think \nhis position and mine can prevail when it is explained. But I disagree \nwith him on one tiny point, and that is it would not take long to \nexplain it. I think it is going to take a long time to explain it, and \na lot of people are going to want to be heard on it.\n  That is our only point of disagreement, that I don't think it \nrealistic to conclude this bill by the end of business tomorrow. I do \nnot blame him for a healthy share of skepticism, and he will believe it \nwhen he sees it. I predict he will see it. He and I have worked \ntogether, and our predictions to each other have been accurate right \ndown the line without exception.\n  Senator Harkin commented on the statement from the President which I \nhad not seen when I started my comments. I will be responding to that \nwhen we have a break in the action. We just received the statement this \nmorning, and he has made a comment that the President said he will veto \nthe bill in its current form, which surprised me on that abrupt \nchallenge. I am prepared to work through that.\n  He also said in his statement--let me read the statement \nspecifically:\n\n       If this bill were to come to me in its current form I would \n     have to veto it.\n\n  I was a little surprised to see that peremptory language without some \npreliminary consultation. But then he goes on to say:\n\n       I look forward to working with Congress on a bipartisan \n     basis to ensure that this bill strengthens public education \n     and other important national priorities.\n\n  Our objectives are the same on strengthening public education and \nother important national priorities. I am instructing my staff to start \nto work now with the Secretaries.\n  We had a hearing. I have worked closely with Secretary Shalala, \nHealth and Human Services; Secretary Riley, Education; and Secretary \nHerman, Labor. We are going to be working with them as this bill \nproceeds on the floor and also with the Office of Management and Budget \nto see if we cannot have a meeting of the minds as we work through the \nprocess.\n  I know the Senator from Washington is ready to offer her amendment, \nso at this time I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after conferring with the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa and others on the Democratic side, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to debate until 12 noon, at which \npoint we will take up the first amendment to be decided at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Washington yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the manager of the bill, so we \ndon't have to wait around until 12, I would like the opportunity--\nwhenever it is--to offer my amendment, so people don't have to continue \ncoming down here waiting to offer amendments. I am ready to offer mine \nat 12.\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, that is \nsatisfactory with me. Senator Murray had been on the floor earlier, and \nif she is prepared to defer----\n  Mr. REID. If Senator Murray wants to offer hers at noon, that is fine \nwith me, too.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill that is currently on the floor. Our colleagues, \nSenator Harkin and Senator Specter, have done a yeoman's job of trying \nto put together a bill under extremely difficult circumstances for \nsure. They have been left with their bill until last, and every other \nappropriations bill has taken funds from this appropriations item. We \nare now left with a bill that we actually don't know how it is going to \nbe funded. I have heard a lot of funding schemes, from taking money \nfrom defense, forward funding, a 13th month, to declaring emergencies. \nBasically, we are left with funding education, funding health research \nwith money that is not real, that we don't know from where it is \ncoming.\n  We don't know what budget it is coming from or whether it is actually \nthere. So I have a great concern about the reality of the funds for the \nmost important funding we do in this body, that of educating our \nchildren, that for health care.\n  Again, we are debating the appropriations bill that funds some of the \nmost important things in the lives of families across this country. \nCertainly education is a top priority of every family. They have said \nthey want us to make sure the Federal Government does its part to \nassure that every child, no matter who they are or where they come \nfrom, what their background is, what school they are in, gets a good \neducation.\n  We have fought hard in this body on the issues that make a difference \nin a child's classroom. Last year, 1 year ago, this body, in a \nbipartisan way, with the House agreed in the final appropriations bill, \nthe omnibus bill, to reduce class size. It is a major priority of this \nCongress and of this country. We appropriated $1.2 billion to reduce \nclass sizes in first, second, and third grades. That decision was \napplauded across this country by parents, by teachers, by business \nleaders, and by communities.\n  Today, those teachers, nearly 30,000 of them, are teaching in our \npublic schools. I had the opportunity last Monday to visit one of the \nclassrooms in Tacoma School District. Tacoma School District has taken \nthe class size funds we allocated and, in 57 first grade classrooms, \nthey have reduced the class size to 15. I had the opportunity to sit \ndown with those 15 children in the first grade classroom and talk to \ntheir teacher. She was ecstatic. She said, compared to a class she had \nworked in before with 27 children: I didn't know all of the kids. I \ndidn't have the opportunity on a daily basis to sit down with them to \nfind out where they were. I didn't have the opportunity as I worked \nwith them throughout the year to make sure every child was keeping up.\n\n  She said: Today, with 15 kids in my classroom, and only 10 days of \nclassroom time at the beginning of the year, I know where every child \nis. I know what their skills are. I know what they need to work on, and \nI can guarantee as a teacher that by the end of this year every child \nin my classroom will be reading, will have the basic skills, and will \nbe able to move on to second grade ready to learn.\n  That is the goal we set when we allocated those funds 1 year ago.\n  That is why I was so saddened to see, in the bill that comes before \nus, no money allocated to continue that program to reduce class size in \nfirst, second, and third grades; no money; zeroed out; no money to \ncontinue those teachers.\n  Essentially, this bill fires the nearly 30,000 teachers who have been \nhired since 1 year ago who work in our classrooms to educate our \nstudents. This is an incredible step backwards. We did agree 1 year ago \nthat we need to focus on kids in the early grades, that we need to do \nwhat we can to make sure that they learn reading, that they learn math, \nthat they learn those basic skills so they can be productive in the \noutyears.\n  We know from the studies that have been done that reducing class size \nin the first, second, and third grades works. We know students from \nsmall class sizes have enrolled in more college-bound courses such as \nforeign languages and advanced math and science. We know students in \nsmaller class sizes have higher grade point averages. We know students \nin small classes have fewer discipline problems. We know students in \nsmall classes have lower dropout rates. It makes sense for us to \ncontinue to make sure that class sizes in first, second, and third \ngrades are reduced, and that we continue the commitment we began 1 year \nago.\n  Our initial commitment was $1.1 billion. We agreed that we would add \n$200 million to that--that is the President's request--so that we can \ncontinue to expand and hire 8,000 more teachers. But under the bill \nthat is before us, there is no money to reduce class size. There is no \ncommitment to continue to hire those teachers or to retain those \nteachers.\n  Essentially, the language as written in this bill says we will fire \n30,000 teachers at the end of this school year. Not on my watch. Not on \nmy watch are we going to go back on a commitment we made 1 year ago. \nNot on my watch are we going to send a message to young students that \nwe no longer care about making sure they get the basic skills they \nneed; that no longer is this Senate going to stand behind the dollars \nand the commitments we made 1 year ago; that no longer are we going to \ntell teachers they can count on us and they can count on our word when \nwe tell them this is the commitment we are going to make to them.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk with many teachers around my State \nand around my country. These teachers have been hired. They are in our \nclassrooms. Forty-three percent of the teachers we have hired are \nteaching in first grade. Their class sizes are going to be reduced from \nan average of 22.9 to an average of 17.6 students--from 22 down to 17. \nAnd every teacher will tell you that for one less student they have in \nthe classroom, the more time they have to spend with each individual \nstudent. Twenty-three percent of the teachers are teaching in second \ngrade, and class sizes in second grades across this country are being \nreduced an average of 23.2 to an average of 18.1. Twenty-four percent \nof the teachers are teaching in third grade, and class sizes will be \nreduced from an average of 23.5 to an average of 18.3 for third graders \nin classrooms across the country.\n\n  The money we allocated last year is being spent. We are getting \noverwhelming responses from teachers, parents, business leaders, and \ncommunities that have this class size money in place and are beginning \nto see the results of it. They are ecstatic. These teachers are in the \nclassrooms. They are teaching. They are appalled that we are going to \ngo back on our word; that this money is not going to continue to be \nthere so that we continue the commitment we made 1 year ago.\n  I have numbers from many of our States across the country where class \nsize dollars have been put into place and where teachers are beginning \nto see the real results of what we did 1 year ago. I think one of the \nthings we haven't talked about is the fact that when we put this \nprogram in place, we said--unlike the block grants, unlike many other \nprograms--we want to make sure administration and paperwork are not \ngoing to hamper these dollars actually going into the classroom.\n  The class size money that we put into place last year takes one form \nfor a school district--one form, and a few minutes of an \nadministrator's time. That is all it takes for the dollars we \nallocated, the $1.2 billion going directly to hire teachers. This is \nreal money being used in real classrooms. Unlike block grants and other \nprograms that we have, we can keep track of where this money is. We \nknow the money is being used to hire teachers. We know that a portion \nof it is being used to train teachers to give them the skills they \nneed. We know the real money is being used in a way that we can come \nback and test it and hold it accountable and show that our kids are \nlearning because of something we did in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\n  As a result of the work we did a year ago, 1.7 million children are \nnow benefiting from smaller class sizes this year. More than 29,000 \nteachers have been hired with that money. Forty-three percent of them \nare teaching in the first grade, twenty-three percent are teaching in \nthe second grade, and twenty-four percent are teaching in the third \ngrade.\n  In Anchorage, AK, very far from here, they received $1.8 million \nunder our Class Size Reduction Program and lowered their average first \ngrade class from 22 to 18 by hiring 40 new first grade teachers.\n  If the District loses its funding under this bill, the 40 recently \nhired teachers will be laid off, and they will return their class sizes \nback to 22 students. And, more importantly, if it ends next year, \nlittle will have been gained.\n  According to Bruce Johnson, Deputy Commissioner of the State \nDepartment of Education and Early Development in Anchorage, a 1-year \nproject, he said, generally doesn't yield dramatic results. In Mesa, \nAR, the Mesa public schools serving 70,000 students received $1.1 \nmillion in class size reduction funds. Half of it was used to hire new \nfull-time teachers to reduce their class sizes, and the other half was \nused to provide reading instruction, an important goal for small groups \nof children.\n  Without these continued funds, we are facing a real dilemma. \nSuperintendents are under the gun to get their class sizes down. But at \nthe same time they have this concern about what will happen if they \nhire new teachers and the Federal money runs out. That is a quota, \naccording to the executive director of the Arizona school \nadministrator.\n\n  San Francisco, CA, has been working very hard to reduce class size in \nthe early grades for many years, and they requested a waiver. I say \nthat all the school districts that have requested a waiver have \nreceived one. Because they already focused their money on the early \ngrades, they were allowed the flexibility under the dollars we spent \nlast year, and want to continue to spend this year, to reduce class \nsizes up to the eighth grade.\n  With these funds, San Francisco hired 37 teachers and reduced their \nclass sizes from 33 to 22. In English and in math, they reduced their \nclass sizes to 20, and they used the funds to provide training for \nteachers on how to work effectively in smaller classes.\n  Whenever I talk to young students who are in a high school math \nclass, they tell me the most frustrating thing they do in a day is have \ntheir hand raised for an entire 50-minute period and never get their \nquestion answered.\n  California has already focused their class size reduction money on \nthe early grades. They had the flexibility under our language to reduce \nclass sizes to make gains in K through eighth. Now kids don't sit \nthrough a 50-minute period raising their hand, with no answer given, \nand they don't go home at the end of the day not understanding what \nhappened that day. That is progress because of the work we did, because \nof the flexibility we offered in this bill, and because we said our \nnational goal is to reduce class size because we know it works.\n  In Boise, ID, they received $547,000 to hire 11 teachers as a result \nof the Class Size Reduction Program. Some of the teachers will \ncirculate through 10 schools giving students extra help. We have heard \nfrom districts that it is a problem because they don't have the classes \navailable to reduce class size. We have allowed them the flexibility, \nas in Boise, ID, having teachers circulate through the schools so the \nstudents get more one-on-one with an adult. Other teachers in Boise \nwere placed in schools with high numbers of low-income students to \nreduce class size. Boise school administrators will have to lay off the \nnewly hired teachers if they do not receive targeted funding next year. \nIdaho superintendent Marilyn Howard said this returning of some of our \nFederal tax dollars to our schools will help support districts' efforts \nto create smaller classes in the critical early grades.\n  It is our hope this commitment will continue beyond the current year. \nThese teachers are in place. They are working. They are looking to \nCongress to see whether what we did a year ago was just an empty \npromise or whether we really meant it when we said that in the United \nStates of America we want our kids to get a better education and we \nbelieve an important role of the Federal Government is to provide the \npartnership and the dollars to reduce class size. It is a very \nimportant goal, one that is achievable, one in which we can help to \nmake the commitment, and one to which we can be held accountable at the \nend of the day. We know where those funds go. We know they don't go to \nadministration. We know they don't go to expensive bureaucratic work. \nWe know they don't go to a lot of paperwork. We know they go to hire \nteachers to go directly into the classrooms.\n\n  This money is helping. But in the bill before the Senate today, there \nis no money for class size reduction, no money whatever. Mr. President, \n30,000 teachers will be fired as a direct result of this bill now \nbefore the Senate. I cannot stand by and let that happen. I know a \nnumber of my colleagues will not stand by and let that happen.\n  In Boston, MA, home of Senator Kennedy, the Boston public school \ndistrict received $3.5 million in funding to reduce class size. In the \nfirst year, the school district has reduced class sizes in the first \nand second grades from 28 students to 25 by hiring 40 new teachers. If \nthe Boston public schools were to lose funding targeted to class size \nreductions, they would not be able to further reduce class sizes to 18 \nin the first and second grades and they would not be able to reduce \nclass sizes in third and fourth grades, their objective. They would \nhave to lay off all 40 teachers or make deep cuts in other areas of \neducation.\n  That is not a choice we ought to be giving them. We ought to fulfill \nthe commitment we made 1 year ago: Put the money in class size \nreduction, make the commitment to continue to work to hire 100,000 \nteachers across the country, and keep the promise everyone made that \neducation is a No. 1 priority and we are not going to underfund it.\n  I know there are other colleagues who want to do block grants. I \ncommend them for their ideas, their passion, and their commitment. If \nthere is a need for additional funds for schools in the form of block \ngrants, I am happy to hear those proposals. Yes, let's provide that \nadditional funding. However, let's not take away the commitment we have \nmade to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades. It is \na national commitment on which we need to follow through.\n  I think what we should recognize is that only 1.6 percent of the \nentire Federal budget goes to fund education. To take away this $1.2 \nbillion is not the right way to go. I know that my colleagues several \nyears ago passed a sense of the Senate which said we would increase by \n1 percent a year the amount of money going to fund education. We have \nnot done that.\n  If some of my colleagues want to offer a block grant, offer \nadditional funds to schools, that is great. However, let's not take \naway the commitment, let's not take away the promise, let's not take \naway the investment that is in place right now with teachers hired, \nwith classes being reduced, with young students in early grades across \nour country now knowing they will be able to learn to read, write, and \ndo math by the end of first and second grades because this Senate, this \nCongress, in a bipartisan manner, 1 year ago said: We are going to make \nthis happen. Let's not renege on that promise.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am also a member of the Appropriations Committee, and, \nlike the Senator, I was disappointed yesterday. We have a chance with \nthis appropriations bill to define our priority and to say to the \nAmerican people whether or not we think education is important. I was \nstartled--I think the Senator from Washington, as a former classroom \nteacher, was surprised as well--when a successful program to reduce \nclass size that put thousands of teachers in classrooms across America \nwas not funded in this legislation.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we will lose up to 1,200 teachers; \nnationwide, 29,000 teachers. It strikes me as not only odd but maybe a \nlittle bit embarrassing that we are saying to the American people as we \nstart this new century, the first thing we will do for education----\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Regular order. I do not think the Senator may be yielded \nto for a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington may yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was reaching the interrogatory phase of this statement, \nand it was just about to come to me when the Senator reminded me of the \nSenate rules. I thank him for that.\n  Here is the question: Should we in the Senate be kicking off a new \ncentury by announcing to America, when it comes to education, we will \nlay off 1,200 teachers in Illinois?\n  I will ask another question: Should we announce to America that in \nterms of education as a priority in the new century, we will kick it \noff by laying off 29,000 teachers? Would the Senator from Washington \nrespond to that question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is asking the question that \nevery Member ought to be asking. Are we, by our votes on the floor of \nthe Senate today, going to lay off nearly 30,000 teachers nationwide to \nwhom we made a commitment 1 year ago to put into our classrooms, who \nare working today, who are making a difference today, who are \nconnecting with young children one on one today? Are we going to turn \naround and say to them: Sorry, you no longer have a job?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is a former classroom teacher and follows the \ntrends in education. The question I will ask her: Is the enrollment in \nschools in America declining so that we can get by with fewer teachers, \neven if we accept larger classrooms?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. To the contrary, in answer to the Senator from Illinois. \nIn fact, projections say we will have 500,000 new students in our \nschools in the next year--500,000 new students. By firing 30,000 \nteachers, we will increase the classes most dramatically.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Washington: We are struggling to \nencourage people to become teachers because so many of our current \nteachers are retiring. Would it not be a disincentive if there were \nuncertainty about the commitment by the Federal Government for a \nprogram to reduce class size?\n  If the Republican appropriations bill on education passes and lays \noff 29,000 teachers, what kind of impact will that have on a young \nperson who is trying to decide whether to take up teaching as a \nprofession?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I think the Senator from Illinois raises a valid point. \nWe have a lot of young students today who would make outstanding \nteachers, who would be able to contribute to the future of this country \nin a very positive way by getting a teaching degree and being a teacher \nin one of our schools.\n  However, if we send the message today that teachers will be in an \novercrowded classroom, they are not going to have the support, the \nbacking of Congress and legislatures, and teachers will be sitting in \novercrowded classrooms, my guess is, we will have a decreasing number \nof students willing to work in the public education system.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Washington yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We are here now on the floor considering the Health-\nEducation-Labor appropriations bill, a very important bill. The \nquestion I have for the Senator from Washington is this. It is my \nunderstanding what she wants is a vote, up or down, on whether or not \nthis bill is going to allow the termination of 29,000 teachers or \nwhether those teachers will have jobs. Is that the question we want to \nput before the Senate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. We \nwant to be able to offer an amendment and have every Senator vote, up \nor down, whether or not they are going to continue to allow these \nteachers to be employed, to be working in our classrooms, or whether \nthey are going to say: No, sorry; not on our watch.\n  Mr. REID. I ask a further question of the Senator from Washington. It \nis my understanding the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who knows every rule of the Senate, and others who are \non this side of the aisle are going to do everything within the \nprocedural possibilities of this Senate to have an up-or-down vote on \nthis amendment on this bill; is that true?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Nevada, \nthis issue is so important to me, it is so important to the children in \nour classrooms and the families of this country, that I will continue \nto offer this amendment every single hour until the Senate is out of \nsession in November.\n  Mr. REID. I ask an additional question to my friend from Washington. \nWe have been told by the leadership on the other side of the aisle, it \nis very important to move this legislation. In fact, they have set the \ndate they want to complete it--by tomorrow night. As I understand the \nSenator from Washington, this legislation would move along very quickly \nif we had an up-or-down vote on her amendment. If we had an up-or-down \nvote on her amendment, we could go on and complete the bill very \nquickly; is that true?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Nevada is correct. To our colleagues \nwho are wondering why we are debating and not offering the amendment, \nif I offer the amendment, it will be second-degreed and our colleagues \nwill never have an opportunity to vote or make a statement whether or \nnot they want to continue the funds to reduce class sizes. We are here \nto continue to talk about the bill. I am happy to do that. I have a lot \nto say. I know a number of my colleagues do as well.\n  Mr. REID. I have a last question to my friend from Washington. My \nfriend from Washington speaks from her experience prior to coming to \nthe Senate. It is true, is it not, she was a teacher?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Nevada is correct. I have been a \npreschool teacher. I have been a school board member. I have served in \nmy State legislature, been on the education committee there, and I now \nserve on the Education Committee in the Senate. I have seen all sides \nof education. Probably most important, I have been a parent of two \nstudents in our public education system and participated in everything \nfrom PTA to all the activities that go along with being a parent.\n  Mr. REID. The question I ask to the Senator from Washington--I want \nto make sure everyone understands: We, the minority, are not stalling \nthis bill. All we want is a simple up-or-down vote on whether or not we \nare going to lay off 29,000 teachers. We believe those teachers should \nhave their jobs, should be able to keep their jobs. Is that the matter \nbefore the Senate?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if the Senator will yield for an additional \nquestion. As I understand, in the Senator's presentation, this concept \nand commitment to the smaller class size is not only based upon her own \nexperience as a teacher and as a school board member but upon very \nimportant results of studies and evaluations of what they call the \nSTARS Program in Tennessee. The results of that study indicate the \nimpact on those children was rather dramatic in math and science, in \nreading, in reduction of disciplinary problems, and also the benefits \nof that experience actually carried on through the later grades, \nthrough the eighth grade, and actually were reflected in the increasing \nnumber of students who attended college.\n  The amendment of the Senator is based upon what I imagine is rather \nintuitive understanding of education, and that is, a teacher \nunderstanding the students and knowing their needs in a small class. \nBut also, am I correct, this has been really one of the most important \nnew results of various experiments that have taken place in the several \nStates? Am I correct with that conclusion?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nEvery parent knows smaller class size is important. It is the question \nthey ask their children when they come home on the first day of school: \nHow many kids are in your classroom? They ask that question because \nevery parent knows the smaller the class, the better chance at \nlearning.\n  But the fact is, we want our Federal dollars spent in areas that will \nreally work. We have, as a Senate, looked at studies--the STARS study \nthe Senator from Massachusetts just mentioned--and the fact is, when we \nspend Federal\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\ndollars and we are partners with our local districts in reducing class \nsize, it makes a difference for our students.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, students in smaller classes \nhave significantly higher grades, as found in a STARS study that \nfollowed these kids from the early grades all the way through senior \nyear in high school. In fact, in English, smaller classes had a 76.1-\npercent average--higher than these. In math it was higher, and in \nscience it was higher. This is real. These dollars make a difference. \nIt means students will learn the skills every one of us wants them to \nlearn, and studies back them up. This money makes a difference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Am I correct also, last year when Congress went on \nrecord committing itself to at least the first year of the hiring of \nadditional teachers, it really was not a partisan issue? At that time, \nas I understand it--I am wondering whether the Senator remembers it--\nthe chairman of the House Education Committee said, essentially, on the \nproposal of the Senator from Washington:\n\n       This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but \n     more importantly a huge win for local educators, parents who \n     are fed up with Washington mandates, redtape, and regulation. \n     We agree with the President's desire to help classroom \n     teachers, but our proposal does not create a big new Federal \n     education program.\n\n  This was said last year by the chairman of the House Education \nCommittee, and similar words were used by House Majority Leader Dick \nArmey of the Republicans. Is the Senator aware that this concept was \nwarmly embraced by Speaker Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey, and \nCongressman Goodling in the final hours of the last Congress?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. I \nremember the negotiations. I remember everyone coming out in a \nbipartisan manner, in fact struggling to get their press conferences \nbefore their counterparts in the other party, in order to take credit \nfor the class size reduction.\n  Senator Gorton here in the Senate was part of those negotiations. As \nthe Senator mentioned, the House chairman, a Republican, as well as \nDick Armey, came out and said: We have made progress. We have done \nsomething that is important. We are behind the class size reduction. \nThis is a commitment we are going to make.\n  So it is very surprising to me that the House has zeroed out money \nnow and said it is no longer a priority, and here in the Senate bill we \nare doing the same thing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the understanding of the Senator that the Federal \nparticipation is very limited, what we do in terms of our contribution \nto local school budgets--perhaps 7 cents, perhaps somewhat less than \nthat if we consider actually the food? But it is a very small targeted \namount; am I correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Therefore, what the Senator is driving at is to really \ntarget scarce resources in an area of education, as I understand it, \nthat has demonstrated and proven to be, under every evaluation, \neffective in enhancing academic achievement; am I correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. What we did with \nthese dollars is, we focused them directly in an area where we know it \nmakes a difference in the learning of children. In addition, unlike \nmany other Federal programs, we made sure it was not spent on \nbureaucrats or paperwork or administration. These dollars are targeted \ndirectly to the classroom. That is why it has been so effective. That \nis why it is so well loved by so many districts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to ask the Senator whether she is aware of an \neditorial in today's St. Louis Post-Dispatch illustrating how important \nclass size is to St. Louis families. This is basically Mid-America \ntalking.\n  I ask unanimous consent the whole editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Sept. 29, 1999]\n\n                           Abandoning Schools\n\n       First in the people's hearts, last in Congress' wallet. \n     That's education. Poll after poll has confirmed that \n     improving our schools is a top priority of Americans. The \n     message has been so relentless that even Republicans (ever \n     mindful of the 2000 elections) felt compelled to rethink \n     their long-standing aversion to involving the federal \n     government in local schools. ``It's time to quit playing \n     around the edges and dramatically increase the amount of \n     money that we put in public education,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, \n     chairman of the Budget Committee, vowed last spring.\n       Translation: The check is in the mail. Reality: Uh, we \n     intended to pay for it, but now we don't have the money.\n       Why don't they have the money? Because, as Congress \n     sheepishly waits until the final minutes of the fiscal year \n     to do the unpopular work of tackling the budget, the spending \n     bill that includes education, labor and health and human \n     services was stuck last in line, where money was taken from \n     it to fund other bills. ``We've used the health and human \n     services account as an ATM machine,'' fumed Senate Minority \n     Leader Tom Daschle.\n       So many billions have been withdrawn from it that several \n     education programs are frozen and an especially important one \n     is in jeopardy.\n       Remember class size reduction? Last year there was a \n     bipartisan commitment to spend $1.2 billion to hire 100,000 \n     new teachers over a seven-year period, reducing average class \n     size to 18 in grades 1 through 3. St. Louis city and county \n     stood to gain 600 of those teachers. The current spending \n     bills being considered in both houses this week effectively \n     kill the program. So when Congress says ``seven years,'' the \n     education translation is ``until the ink on the headlines is \n     dry.'' It is, as Rep. William L. Clay of St. Louis says, ``a \n     shameful abandonment.'' Thirty thousand of those teachers \n     have been hired. Without the money that was promised, it \n     becomes questionable how many can return next year.\n       The rap on public schools is, in most cases, a valid one: \n     If your child is either ahead of or behind his peers, he's \n     going to be lost in the shuffle of 25 to 30 children. If your \n     child has some kind of learning disability, it may take years \n     to zero in on it. And if your child doesn't learn to read and \n     do basic arithmetic by the fourth grade, he'll be playing a \n     losing game of catch-up for the rest of his academic life--\n     which might not be very long.\n       It's hard to think of anything more obvious or more \n     fundamental than the need for smaller classes in the early \n     years. It's even more difficult to think of anything more \n     unconscionable than bailing out a long-range commitment one \n     step into it. Members of Congress, keep your promise. Give \n     our children schools where teachers can teach and all \n     students can learn.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to just ask the Senator to respond to this \npart of the editorial that says:\n\n       Remember class size reduction? Last year there was a \n     bipartisan commitment to spend $1.2 billion to hire 100,000 \n     new teachers over a seven-year period, reducing average class \n     size to 18 in grades 1 through 3. St. Louis city and county \n     stood to gain 600 of those teachers. The current spending \n     bills being considered in both houses this week effectively \n     kill the program.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The rap on public schools is, in most cases, a valid one: \n     If your child is either ahead of or behind his peers, he's \n     going to be lost in the shuffle of 25 to 30 children.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It's hard to think of anything more obvious or more \n     fundamental than the need for smaller classes in the early \n     years. It's even more difficult to think of anything more \n     unconscionable than bailing out of a long-range commitment \n     one step into it. Members of Congress, keep your promise. \n     Give our children schools where teachers can teach and all \n     students can learn.\n  Does the Senator find this kind of expression that comes from Middle \nAmerica, the heartland of the Nation, is really expressed in other \nparts of the country, western parts of the Nation, the great State of \nWashington which she represents, as well as in the other parts of the \ncountry?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. I have not \nseen the editorial. It does not surprise me. I have seen similar \neditorials, like in Longview, WA, a very small rural community that \nunderstands the need to educate their kids because they can no longer \nrely on the timber jobs that were there maybe even a decade or two \ndecades ago, and they know their kids need to know math and science so \nthey can attract some of the high-tech industries that are coming in \nand seeing that those kids get the education they need.\n  I have heard from schools in Yakima, WA, a farming community, \nEverett, a suburban district, right in the heartland of Seattle, \nGarfield High School, where teachers have said to me: This money is \ncritical, it is targeted, it is used for what we need to do, you can be \nheld accountable for it; don't renege on a promise.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We had some tragic experience in schools this last year,\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\nand all of us are trying to find ways of avoiding those circumstances. \nNo one pretends the answers are going to be easy and are going to be \nsolved virtually overnight. But is it the Senator's sense that by \nhaving the smaller class sizes that we not only are dealing with \nacademic achievement, but we are also dealing with some disciplinary \nproblems, and also since we are talking about K-3, we are also talking \nabout the opportunities for teachers to interact with students and \nperhaps identify some of the younger children who may be faced with \nsome tensions or some developmental difficulties early in the cycle and \nperhaps have some opportunities to address those particular children's \nneeds?\n  Does the Senator also think this smaller class size can have some \nimpact in terms of discipline and also in terms of the climate and \natmosphere which exists in schools in this country?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts brings up another \nextremely important point. I do not think there is a parent in America \nwhose heart does not stop when they see another television show about \nanother shooting and they worry about their own child.\n  The fact is, when kids are in smaller class sizes in the first, \nsecond, and third grades, their tendency toward discipline problems is \nreduced dramatically. It does make a difference.\n  More important is what a policeman told me not long ago. He said: I \nwatch these families today, and a lot of kids are home alone \nessentially in the evening. The parents may even be there, but they are \nessentially home alone. They walk to school in the morning in a \nneighborhood where the blinds are closed and the doors are closed and \nnot one adult looks out to see if they are OK. They walk to school \nwithout anyone paying attention. They get to school, where it is \novercrowded, where the only adult in that classroom never has time to \nlook them in the eye or see that they are OK.\n  This policeman said to me: These kids feel anonymous in today's \nworld. It is no surprise they act out violently in order for someone to \nnotice them.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, because there are other Senators who wish to \nspeak, we will lose some 575 teachers in my State of Massachusetts. I \nhave heard from the parents. I have heard from the school boards. I \nhave heard from those communities that say this is certainly one of the \nhighest priorities they have for this Congress.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this matter back to \nthe attention of the Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I remind my \ncolleagues that we are here today because we believe this issue is \nextremely important; that firing nearly 30,000 teachers, that reneging \non our promise to reduce class size is the wrong way to go. We want \nthis Senate to be on record, we want an up-or-down vote on this \namendment, and we want this country to know we stand behind the \ncommitment we made 1 year ago.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Washington \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was in the appropriations markup \nyesterday when the Senator from Washington was preparing to offer the \namendment she now describes on the floor of the Senate. I asked the \nquestion at that point during the discussion whether the product from \nthe Appropriations Committee that was brought to the committee \nyesterday, and now to the floor, would, in fact, require or allow or \ncause the firing of up to 30,000 teachers that had been previously \nhired under this program. I asked the question, I think, a couple of \ntimes, trying to understand, is there a deliberate effort to say we \ndon't want to have a program with national goals or aspirations to \nreduce class size by hiring more teachers; we don't want to have that \nprogram. Is that the goal, to not have that program any longer?\n  I was not able to get an answer to that. But we now have the program. \nIs it not correct we have a program in which we in Congress said we \nwill authorize and fund to try to reduce class size around this country \nin our public schools by adding some additional classroom teachers? We \nknow that works. Study after study tells us that works, that it \nimproves education. A teacher in a classroom with 30 students has \nsubstantially less time to devote to those students than a teacher in a \nclassroom with 15. We know that. We know it works in every way to have \nsmaller class sizes.\n  This Government already decided it wanted to have a program of that \ntype. We funded it and authorized it last year.\n  Unless the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington is \nadopted, is it not correct that all across this country, we will see \nthe dismissal of teachers who are now in the classroom helping reduce \nclass sizes, improving education, because the resources will not be \navailable any longer to fund that? And will that not be a significant \nstep backward in our goal to improve public education in this country?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. If my \namendment is not adopted, the result will be nearly 30,000 teachers \nnationwide will lose their jobs at the end of this year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But is it not also correct--I continue to ask a question \nof the Senator from Washington, Mr. President--when we had this \ndiscussion yesterday, there was a proposal that perhaps a second-degree \namendment would be offered, and they said: Well, we will offer some \nmoney that is in the form of kind of a block grant--they do not call it \nthat--where they send some money back to the school districts and say: \nBy the way, do what you want with this because we don't have any goals \nor aspirations with respect to how it ought to be used.\n  In other words, they say: Let us retreat from this program of \nreducing class size by hiring more teachers and improving education \nthat way; let's decide we will send money but have no national goals.\n\n  Isn't that the case with respect to what was attempted yesterday \nbefore you decided to withhold your amendment for the floor of the \nSenate, that the second-degree amendment would have said: OK, we will \nprovide some money, but we want to back away from the commitment of \nreducing class size as a part of solution to improve education?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely correct. \nWhat the other side wants to do is offer a second-degree amendment that \noffers Senators a false choice. We want to make sure we keep those \nteachers in place and continue our commitment to reduce class size.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they want to create a block grant program \nthat provides additional funds, go ahead and tell us what their goals \nare, tell us what the program is, tell us what the achievements are. \nBut right now we have in place a program we know works, we know what \nthe goals are, and we know it achieves what we want to see achieved in \nthis country, which is increasing the basic skills of our young \nstudents and giving them a chance at the economy when they graduate one \nday.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may further ask the Senator from \nWashington, this issue is not new. Is it not the case that this issue \nhas been debated for some long while? President Clinton proposed in a \nState of the Union Address some long while ago this national goal of \nimproving our country's education system by reducing class size; that \nis, reducing the number of students each teacher would have in the \nclassroom, and decided there are sort of niche funding areas where we \ncan play a role.\n  It is true that most education funding comes from State and local \ngovernments. It is the case, and always should be, that those who run \nAmerica's schools are our local school boards and those that make \neducation policy in our States are the State legislatures. That is the \ncase. No one suggests that ought to be different.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But it is also the case we can provide niche funding in \ncertain areas through national goals we establish to dramatically \nimprove education, and one of those methods is to say if we had more \nteachers, we could reduce the size of the classroom, the number of \nstudents per class. We know from study after study that dramatically \nimproves the ability of students to learn in school.\n  The recipe for a good education is not a mystery at all. You have to \nhave a\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\ngood teacher, you have to have a student willing to learn, and you have \nto have a parent willing to be involved in that student's education. \nThose are necessary ingredients for education to work.\n  What about this notion of a good teacher? You have to have a good \nteacher and put that teacher in a position of teaching well in a school \nthat is functional, not in a crumbling school or a crumbling building \nthat is in desperate need of repair, and we know of plenty of those and \nare working on that, but also in a classroom that is not overcrowded.\n  I know the Senator from the State of Washington----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is, the Senator from Washington has the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). If the Senator would withhold, the \nSenator from Washington has the floor, and she may only yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The Senator from North Dakota understands that. I \nhave been in the process of asking a series of questions. I have asked \nthe Senator from Washington several questions. I was in the middle of \nasking her another question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then the----\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding of the 12 o'clock issue is, there was to \nbe no amendment offered prior to 12 o'clock; and it is now 12 noon. But \nthat restriction has nothing to do with whether or not the Senator from \nWashington has and retains the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator may finish his \nquestion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am asking the Chair, isn't it correct----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the Senator from Washington does have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry. With 12 noon having passed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true that the hour of 12 \no'clock having passed, that prohibition against offering amendments has \nlapsed and amendments may now be offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just ask a final question of the Senator from \nWashington. I do this saying, first of all, that I have great respect \nfor the Senator from Pennsylvania. I am a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I watched what he did yesterday in the area of education \nand health care and a range of other areas, where he tried to take \nresources that were rather limited and make the right investments with \nthem. There are many areas on which I applaud the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa. I think they deserve our \naccolades and applause for their work in a number of areas.\n  The Senator from Washington, however----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish the question, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from North \nDakota that the Senator from Washington cannot yield for a statement \nbut a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand.\n  I did not expect that the Chair or the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwould have a problem with my complimenting the Senator from \nPennsylvania. But I will cease and desist that.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have a question I want to propound to the Senator from \nWashington. Isn't it the case that while in some areas there has been \nadequate funding, in this area on the major initiative dealing with \nclass size, we will have to fire classroom teachers around this country \nunless this resource is put back in the piece of legislation before the \nSenate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. Unless we dedicate this money to \nthe class size reduction bill we passed last year--that we continue \nit--those classroom teachers will be fired at the end of this year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington the \nfollowing question. It was my understanding it was the President's goal \nto try to recruit and train some 100,000 teachers across America in \norder to reduce the class size in virtually every community and school \ndistrict in need of that. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding, because of bipartisan action last \nyear--an agreement between Republicans and Democrats that this was a \ngood goal--we appropriated $1 billion or slightly more----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It was $1.2 billion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And we went on to hire almost 30,000 teachers under the \nPresident's program. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington this \nquestion. Am I correct that the Republican leadership now is suggesting \nwe abandon this program, we walk away from this program, and we lay off \n29,000 teachers across the country in terms of at the end of this \nschool year and not being retained after that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. That is what the bill \nbefore us does.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington, is this \nnot analogous or parallel to the same debate we had about 100,000 cops \non the street, where the President proposed working with communities \nand police chiefs and sheriffs so we would be able to have safer \nneighborhoods and safer schools by putting 100,000 cops on the beat?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I recall correctly--I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Washington--at one point, after many thousands of these policemen \nhad been hired and crime rates were coming down, did not the same \nRepublican Party object to extending the President's 100,000 COPS \nProgram and say we should give this money to States and they could \ndecide what to do with it?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I recall the same effort; correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington, there \nseems to be pattern: Instead of trying to meet the goals of 100,000 \ncops to reduce crime or 100,000 teachers to reduce class size, is it \nnot the case that the Republican majority, time and again, wants to \nstop the President's programs for more cops and more teachers?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  I continue to add, what we have seen is what we call block grants \nproposed under the guise of: Well, we are letting the local people \ndecide where the money is going to go. All of us want that to happen. \nAll of us want local people involved in the decisionmaking. But what I \nhave seen in the almost 8 years I have been here is that block grants \nare reduced dramatically. In fact, the title I funds, under the current \nbill--when we look in the block grants--are being reduced. So it is \npretty easy to reduce a block grant. It is a lot harder to fire 29,000 \nteachers.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to follow up on that with a question.\n  The Senator from Washington is not only a leader in education but is \na former classroom teacher. I don't know that many of us--I certainly \ncannot--in the Senate can claim to have that background when we address \nthis important issue.\n  So I would like to ask the Senator from Washington, as perhaps one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nfew, if not the only, classroom teachers on the floor of the Senate, \nwhether there is any importance to the President's priority of saying, \nwe are going to try to fund 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size, \nas opposed to some other way this money might be spent?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I say to the Senator from Illinois, my experience not \nonly as a teacher but as a parent and school board member and a State \nlegislator working on education is that this initiative has made more \nof a difference in classrooms than anything I have seen in a number of \nyears. Reality: New teachers hired; smaller class sizes; kids getting \nthe attention they deserve. The reality is that our tax dollars--the \nmoneys allocated under this program--are making a difference. They are \nmaking a difference for 1.7 million children right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true--I would like to ask further of the \nSenator from Washington--that most, if not all, of us believe there \nshould be accountability in education, accountability by students with \ntheir testing, by teachers in terms of the results, by parents in terms \nof their involvement, and that if we accept the Republican approach, \nwhich basically says, let's block grant the money, let's give it in \nlarge sums to the school districts, and not hold them accountable in \nterms of teachers and class size, we are not meeting this national \ngoal?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are not meeting the national goal. And we have no \nway, as people allocating this money, to know where it went, how it was \nspent, whether it is on paperwork or bureaucracy or administration. We \nwill not have any way to show that it makes a difference in our kids' \nclassrooms, whether it increases test grade scores--which is a goal for \neveryone--and we will not know whether this is going to make a \ndifference in a child's learning.\n  When we put these teachers in the classrooms, we can follow those \nkids in those classrooms, and we will know for sure, as the years go \nby, that these dollars make a difference. We will be able to look at \nthose kids, and we will know.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Further inquiring of the Senator from Washington, if we \nare going to talk about accountability and results in education--and we \nhave a program where school districts will be held accountable, \nSenators will be held accountable in terms of reaching the goal of \n100,000 new teachers, and we can measure how many teachers are being \nhired, we can measure class size, and results--are we not going to lose \naccountability if we accept the Republican approach of basically just \nsending the money, with no strings attached, to the school districts?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct; we will not be \nable to. If our proposal is second degreed, we will not be able to win \nmy amendment and we will not have any accountability. We will not know \na year from now how that money was used; we won't know if it made a \ndifference. We will have no accountability; and, frankly, we will not \nsee class sizes reduced in a way that we want them reduced. We know it \nis important.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The last question which I will ask of the Senator from \nWashington: Is it true, you are on the floor leading this debate \nbecause of one simple request, and that is that the Senate go on \nrecord--yes or no--with a rollcall vote printed for the Record to see \nwhether or not we are going to continue this program to move toward \n100,000 new teachers in America and lower class sizes, and at this \npoint in time--I hope it changes--there is resistance to that up-or-\ndown vote from the Republican majority?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. I want an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment. I want the Senate to be held accountable for \ntheir vote on this. I want to be assured that we actually have an \nopportunity to move to do this amendment without rule XVI applying.\n  I went to the appropriations subcommittee hearing the night before \nlast. We could not offer any amendments in committee yesterday, as the \nSenator from Illinois knows; he was there. We were unable to offer this \namendment. It was going to be second degreed. The chairman of the \ncommittee pleaded and begged that no amendments be offered, that we do \nit on the floor. Now we get to the floor. I am going to be second \ndegreed. We will never have a chance for an up-or-down vote and rule \nXVI may or may not apply. The Senate will never be on record.\n  I want our colleagues to vote. I want us on record. I want the \nAmerican public to know who wants to make sure that we continue the \npromise we made, the commitment we made 1 year ago, to reduce class \nsizes in first, second and third grades.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have one final question, if the Senator will yield for \na question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Correct me if I am wrong. The Department of Education \nhas estimated that we are going to lose 2 million teachers over the \nnext 10 years, which is 200,000 teachers a year. At the present time, \nwe add 100,000 teachers a year. So we are basically in a 100,000 \ndeficit, as I understand it, at a time when we are seeing the total \nenrollment for students increase by half a million. Is that the \nSenator's understanding as well.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we are falling further and further behind at the \nstart of this discussion and putting our children in jeopardy without \nthe amendment of the Senator from Washington. It seems to me, for the \nexcellent reasons she has outlined, in terms of quality of education \nenhancement for children in grades K through 3, that as a matter of \nnational purpose and national priority, this has a sense of urgency.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. In fact, we know \nthere is going to be a teacher shortage. We need to make sure young \npeople want to go into a career in education. If we are going to tell \nthem they are going to be in a large class, in a crumbling school, and \nwill not have the support at all levels--local, State, and Federal--we \nare going to have a hard time recruiting those teachers we drastically \nneed.\n  We do know if we tell our young people that we are going to reduce \ntheir class sizes so they can really do the professional job we have \nasked them to do, and we have a commitment that we are not going to \nrenege on every year, that we believe in this, I believe we will be \nable to recruit young, great students into the teaching profession, and \nI think we have a lot of work to do on that. Certainly this is a \ncommitment we need to make.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader has indicated that he is willing \nto discuss with us a way to move forward on this.\n  At this time, I am happy to yield the floor in order to move to that.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Before I do, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to Emma Harris, who is a \ncongressional fellow in the office of Senator Edwards, during the \npending Labor-HHS bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have heard a great deal of talk about \nclass size. There has been an absence of recognition that the bill \nprovides $1.2 billion for teacher initiatives, which may well be \ndefined as class size, where the authorizing committee works. We have \nheard a castigation about failure to fulfill a promise for the \ndischarge of teachers, which is factually untrue. There is currently \n$1.2 billion to fund class size reduction on an authorization which was \ncontained in last year's appropriation bill.\n  This year's appropriation bill includes $1.2 billion on what is \ncalled a teacher initiative. So when a number of Senators have talked \nabout the desirability of reducing class size and what that does for \neducation, that is something to which this Senator agrees. That is \nsomething the subcommittee agrees with, the full committee agrees with, \nand is not a partisan issue. It is not a matter that the Democrats say \nwe ought to have small class sizes and the Republicans say there ought \nto be large class sizes. That is not an issue at all. There is not a \ncontroversy.\n  It is not a controversy that there is any reneging on a promise to \ntake out the $1.2 billion to discharge many teachers. That is simply \nnot factually correct.\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\n  The fact is, this appropriations bill contains $1.2 billion.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Washington, in the committee, offered an \namendment for $1.4 billion. So there was an increase of $200 million, \nand the Senator from Washington offered that amendment without an \noffset. This bill is already at $91.7 billion, which is at the breaking \npoint, maybe beyond the breaking point of what this body will enact or \nwhat may go through conference. In the absence of an offset, the \npriorities are not subject to be rearranged, at least in my opinion.\n  There has been an objection made, understandably, by Senator \nJeffords, who is the chairman of the authorizing committee. That is the \nrole of the authorizing committee.\n  Yesterday, there was talk about Senator Gorton. Senator Gorton \nintroduced or was prepared to introduce a second-degree amendment, \nwhich would have appropriated the $1.2 billion, subject to \nauthorization, and if the authorization did not occur, then the $1.2 \nbillion would be given to the States. They can make a determination as \nthey see fit in a block grant concept, allocating it to class size or \nteacher initiative or whatever it is the States decided.\n  My preference is to see that the $1.2 billion stays in the area of \nclass size and teacher initiative, but that is a matter for the \nauthorizers.\n  I understand the Senator from Washington wants an up-or-down vote, \nbut the rules of the Senate permit another Senator like Senator Gorton \nto offer a second-degree amendment. When the Senator from Washington \nsays she is prepared to stay until the end of November to reoffer her \namendment, she is entitled to do that. Senator Gorton is entitled to \ncontinue to offer a second-degree amendment, if he decides to do that. \nThose are the rules of the Senate. Nobody is entitled to an up-or-down \nvote if another Senator wants to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Now, it may be that Senator Gorton and others will yield and will \nallow an up-or-down vote. I am not sure how that will work out, but it \nis not a matter of right. No Senator has a right to an up-or-down vote. \nA Senator has a right to follow the rules. Senator Gorton has a right \nto the rules, just as Senator Murray has a right to the rules.\n  It is simply not true that there is a reneging on the commitment for \n$1.2 billion. It is in the bill. It is categorized as a teacher \ninitiative. That is another way of saying class size, or it is another \nway of saying what the authorizers may do by way of specifying how the \n$1.2 billion is to be spent.\n  We have a deadline of September 30, the end of the fiscal year, to \nfinish our work. We had the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, call \nfor regular order. I called for regular order. You can articulate \nquestions which are speeches, a lot of speeches that have consumed more \nthan an hour. It is my hope that we can proceed with this bill, proceed \nwith the rules of the Senate, and move to let the Senate work its will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, who has worked so hard to bring this bill to \nthe floor. The bill has been so distorted in its presentation from the \nother side for the last hour and a half, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, in fairly quick terms, disposed of that distortion. But \nlet me reinforce the point that was made.\n  There is $1.2 billion in this bill for teachers--teacher activity. It \nis not an authorized program in the bill because this is an \nAppropriations Committee, and it doesn't authorize.\n  I find it a bit unique to hear the ranking member of the authorizing \ncommittee come to the floor and say that he wanted it as an \nauthorization on this appropriations bill when 2 weeks ago--or 5 weeks \nago now--we passed an amendment in this body which said we weren't \ngoing to authorize on appropriations bills.\n  So the chairman of this subcommittee has appropriately put the money \nin for teacher assistance--$1.2 billion. And he has not authorized, \nwhich is the proper way to proceed.\n  On the issue of class size itself, there are disagreements. Time and \nagain, we heard in the speeches from the other side how they were going \nto tell the local school districts how to run their business. There is \nno longer any sugar-coating of this issue. The fact is that the \nproposal from the other side of the aisle, which originated with the \nWhite House, is a proposal specifically directed at telling local \nschool districts how to run their local school districts. We heard \nterms such as: How can we pass the language in the appropriations bills \nwhen there are no strings attached? The Member from the other side said \nthat. How are we going to know it works if we don't put strings on?\n  Yesterday, in the committee, the junior Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, stated as a metaphor: Well, this is like a parent who gives a \nchild an allowance. If you do not tell the child how to spend that \nallowance, how are you going to know how the child spends it? She might \ngo out and buy candy instead of buying school lunches. That was the \nmetaphor used in committee yesterday.\n  I point out that the Federal Government is not the parent of the \nlocal school districts. The parent in this instance happens to be the \nparent of the kids. They are the parents. They are the ones who should \nbe making the decision as to how the money gets spent. We are not the \nparents.\n  We are not the local parents for every school district in the \ncountry, although that happens to be the view of the Democratic \nminority in this House and the White House. They are the great fathers \nfrom Washington who come down into the school districts, and say: Oh, \nschool districts. Give us your money so we can take it to Washington, \nand, by the way, spread a little bit of it out among the bureaucracy in \nWashington. And then we will send you back some percentage of your \nmoney--maybe 85 cents on the dollar, if you are lucky--and then we will \ntell you how to spend the money. That is the theory that comes from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  This class size proposal is the ultimate example of that because \nwhere do they get the money for the class size proposal? They took it \nout of special education dollars, which essentially meant that local \nmoney which was supposed to be used for local decisions--whether it was \nto add a new teacher for a school or to add a new wing to the school or \nto add a new computer program to the school--that local money was lost \nbecause it had to go to support special education needs which were \nsupposed to be supported by the Federal Government, while the Federal \nGovernment came and took the special education money and put it into a \nclassroom program and said: Here, school district. In order to get your \nmoney, you have to take our program as it is presented to you, and in \nno other way. You must accept a class size program in order to get your \nmoney back, money which you were supposed to be getting to begin with \nto help you with special education dollars, for example.\n\n  The whole theory of this class size proposal, as it comes from the \nWhite House and on the other side of the aisle, is flawed because it \nessentially is the theory that says Washington knows best. You either \ndo what Washington says or else you are not going to get your money \nback from Washington--your hard-earned dollars you sent here.\n  We, however, take a different approach on this. We suggest that when \nyou send money to Washington--unfortunately it still goes through \nbureaucracy--when you get it back, especially in the area of education, \nthe teachers, the parents, the principals, and the local school \ndistricts know best how to spend it.\n  Yes, we are going to put in some very broad parameters that basically \ngo to quality. But we are not going to exactly tell you that you must \nhire a new teacher. Rather, we have proposals such as the TEA bill, \nwhich passed the House, which I hope will pass here, which says for \nthis money--$1.2 billion--if you want to hire a new teacher, fine, but \nif you want to train your present teachers to be better math teachers, \nyou can do that, too. Or, for example, if you have a really good \nteacher, maybe in the sciences, and a lot of pressure is being put on \nthat teacher to move out of the classroom and into the private sector \nbecause they can make so much more, you can\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\nuse the money to give that teacher some sort of bonus in order to keep \nthem in the classroom where they are doing such good.\n  Give the local communities flexibility. Let's give some credibility \nto the idea that the teacher, the principal, and the parent actually \nknow what is best for the kid; that maybe the President does not know \nwhat is best for every classroom in America; that maybe the Department \nof Education does not know what is best for every classroom in America. \nMaybe it is the people in the classroom and the parents, who have a \nhuge interest in what is happening in this classroom, who know a little \nbit more about what is happening in that classroom and what the \nadequate allocation of resources should be.\n  Our proposal is that we put this $1.2 billion in the context of \nflexibility. Make it applicable to teachers, make it available for \nteacher activity, but do not say you must hire a teacher.\n  Remember that this is not a debate over money, although some will try \nto characterize it that way. In fact, this bill brought forward by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania exceeds the President's request in education \nby almost $.5 billion.\n  In this account--the issue of the teachers account--the money is the \nexact same. What the President asked for and what we have in this bill \nis $1.2 billion.\n  It is not an issue of money. It is an issue of power and who controls \nthe dollars and who makes the decision over how those dollars are \nspent. We happen to think the parent, the teacher, the principal, and \nthe school district should have the power. The other side thinks they \nshould have the power--specifically right here in this Chamber, with no \nstrings. They have to have strings attached--from that desk right over \nthere; that desk three rows up and two desks over--running from that \ndesk out to every school district in the country; thousands of strings \nall over the country running out of that desk telling Americans how to \nspend that money and how to control the classroom. Then we are going to \nreel in those strings. And when we find at the end of the string that \nsomebody did something we don't like, somebody from that desk three \nrows up and two desks over will say: You are not educating your kids \ncorrectly, and we know how to do it better. So we are going to take \nyour money away. Here, we are cutting this string right here.\n\n  That is not right. Let's send the money out to the schools. Let's let \nthe parents make the decisions. Let's let the teachers make the \ndecisions. Let's let the principal make the decisions within the \ncontext of requiring quality.\n  While we are on the subject, let's talk a little bit about this \nmythology--that is what it is, mythology--that class size isn't the \nissue. This has been polled. That is the reason this is being put \nforward. This is a polling event. It has nothing to do with the \nsubstance of the studies that have been done on the education.\n  They keep quoting the STAR study out in Tennessee. The STAR study has \nbeen reviewed by a lot of other studies, including the STAR study \nitself. The conclusion has been that it isn't so much class size that \nis important, but it is quality of the teacher that is important. One \nof the conclusions in the Tennessee study was that if you had first-\nclass teachers for 2 or 3 years, then those students' ability to do the \nwork was improved dramatically. It not only was improved dramatically \nfor the years they had first-class teachers, but it carried forward for \n3 or 4 years after they got a really good teacher. That ability of that \nstudent went up. It wasn't size of classrooms so much as quality of \nteachers.\n  That is what our proposal does, the TEA proposal that goes to the \nissue of quality teachers and trying to keep quality teachers in the \nclassroom, and letting the local school districts decide who is the \nquality teacher and who isn't.\n  It does no good to put a child in a classroom--whether it is 18-to-1, \n15-to-1, 10-to-1 or 25-to-1--if that kid is being taught by a teacher \nwho does not know anything about the subject they are teaching or who \nis an incompetent teacher. It simply doesn't do any good. The child \ndoesn't learn anything because the teacher doesn't know the subject or \nthe child isn't able to communicate with the teacher because the \nteacher doesn't have the ability to communicate effectively with \nchildren.\n\n  Class size is not the critical function. It is whether or not that \nteacher knows the subject and knows how to communicate it and deal with \nthe children. That has been the conclusion of study after study. If we \nare citing studies, there was an excellent study done by the University \nof Rochester which has led the subject for years. They looked at over \n300 other studies on the question of class size and teacher quality. \nThe first conclusion of that study by Professor Hanushek was that class \nsize reduction has not worked. The second conclusion was that Project \nSTAR in Tennessee does not support overall reduction in class size \nexcept perhaps in kindergarten. Remember, this study looked at 300 \nother studies. Third, the quality of teacher is much more important \nthan the size of the classroom.\n  That study is not unique. He looked at 300 different studies.\n  In the State of Washington, there was also a study which came to the \nexact, same conclusion. In my own State of New Hampshire we did a \nstudy. The New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies did the same \nstudy and came to the same conclusion. A study in Boston dealt with a \ncharter school and found the same. Studies have been done. The evidence \nis absolutely clear. It is not size of the classroom; it is quality of \nteacher.\n  Yes, size may play a marginal function. So we may ask, isn't it \nobvious size has an impact? We all can agree that size has a small \nimpact but size has been addressed in most States. The President's \ninitiative said we had to have an 18-1 ratio in class size. That is \nwhat his goal was. Maybe Members haven't been out of Washington to look \nat the school systems; maybe they are getting their information from \nthe Education Department or their teacher union friends. But the fact \nis 42 States have an 18-1 ratio in class size; 42 States already meet \nthe class size requirements. What those 42 States need is a better \neffort in producing high-quality teachers. What we have in this country \nis a severe lack of well-trained teachers, teachers in the classroom \nwho are not capable and not doing the job in core disciplines and in \nareas of education communication. That is where we need help. That is \nwhere our teachers need help.\n  More than 25 percent of the new teachers entering our schools are \npoorly qualified to teach; 1 out of every 4. Mr. President, 12 percent \nof the teachers entered without any prior classroom experience; 14 \npercent of the teachers entered our Nation's schools having not fully \nmet the State standards. In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent of the \nincoming teachers failed the basic licensing exam; 96 percent of those \nwho retook the exam failed again.\n  The issue is not numbers in the classroom. The issue is quality of \nthe teacher, how to get a good teacher into the classroom. This is \nespecially true in mathematics and science where we have a dearth of \nthe talent we need because the teachers are not being adequately \ntrained and science moves so quickly they can't stay up with the \nscience. Forty percent of the math teachers in this country do not have \na major or a minor in the field in which they teach.\n  Tell me how it will help a student to be in a classroom with a \nteacher who has not had algebra, who has no major in algebra, maybe \ndidn't even take algebra? How does it help a student, whether there are \n10, 15, or 20 students in the classroom, if the teacher doesn't \nunderstand the subject matter? Clearly, we are not going to help the \nstudent no matter how many kids are in the class.\n\n  The issue is not class size. The statistics prove it is not class \nsize. Studies show it is not class size. Even the Tennessee study \nreferred to by the Senator from Massachusetts shows it is not class \nsize. The issue is quality. Yet the President's program and the program \nof the junior Senator from Washington says to the States: States must \nreach this ratio, and if they don't reach this ratio, we will take your \nmoney away to some other account. And you must hire a teacher to get \nyour money back--the money you sent to begin with.\n  We say that is foolish. It is intuitive. It is obvious if you have a \nschool district with parents involved, teachers involved, principals, \nand school boards\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\ninvolved, they will know whether they need another teacher or they will \nknow whether they need another classroom or they will know whether they \nneed another computer science lab or they will know whether they have \nto send some of their teachers to educational classes that might help \nthem in their capacity to handle certain subjects, or they will know if \nthey have a teacher about to leave whom they think is good and they \nwant to teach. The local school district will know these things. These \npeople are not out there committing their lives to education in order \nto bring down education. These people are well-intentioned, well-\npurposed, well-meaning, sincere, hard-working individuals who work in \nour schools. Yet we treat them, as the Senator from Washington \ndescribed yesterday in committee, as if they were children getting an \nallowance.\n  It is insulting to them, No. 1. No. 2, it doesn't work. Obviously, \nthese folks who are running our schools should be given the flexibility \nto make the decisions within certain parameters so they can do what \nthey think is best for the school district. The parameters we laid out \nare quality parameters set not by the Federal Government but set by the \nStates. We say: State, you can have this money, but you have to meet \ncertain quality standards and you set those quality standards and test \nfor the quality standards. When you fail to meet the quality standards, \nyou have to take action to correct it. If you don't correct it, then \naction can be taken by the Federal Government, but not until the local \ncommunity has had a chance to meet its decisions in the context as to \nwhat it sees as its problems. That is a much more logical approach to \nall of this.\n  I know the Senator from Arkansas is one of the leaders on this \nsubject and wants to speak. I could go on for quite a while because I \nfind the arguments on the other side to be so outrageous and so \narrogant in their viewpoint which is: We know best for school districts \nof America. We know best because we happen to be elected to the Senate \nor elected President of the United States. We know what is best at the \nlocal school districts.\n  That is outrageous. This is not about money. The money is in the \nbill, $1.2 billion. It is there. The Senator from Pennsylvania has been \nextremely aggressive in funding education. We have on all sorts of \naccounts exceeded what the President requested. This is about power and \nthe fact there are interest groups in Washington, specifically major \nlabor unions and the education bureaucracy, who want to control the \ncurriculum and the school activities and the educational structure of \nour elementary schools across this country. They don't want to give up \nthat control. Every time they create a new program, it is directed at \ncontrol from Washington, telling the local districts how to spend their \nmoney. That is what it is about.\n\n  We put forth proposals which are aggressively funded which do the \nopposite: We empower the parent; we empower the teacher; we empower the \nprincipal; we empower the local school district. That is the way it \nshould be done and that is the way we improve education.\n  This is a debate which I enjoy engaging in because I believe it is \nfairly obvious that proposals from the other side are misdirected and \ndo little to improve education--maybe a lot to improve the power of the \nlocal unions, the national unions, and the national education lobby, \nbut they do nothing for local education, whereas our proposal does a \ngreat deal to help the local school districts help their kids get a \nbetter life, a better education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I certainly associate my remarks with \nthose of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire who truly has \ndisplayed not only great leadership but great expertise on this whole \nsubject area, and who, I think, very eloquently and very articulately \nexplained the differences in philosophy and approach, and while \nsincere, the misguided efforts of the proponents of this amendment.\n  I take a few minutes to make a couple of observations about what the \nother side said about their amendment and then will outline my \nobjections and what I think are the flaws in the approach advanced by \nthe Senator from Washington. Certainly, I think Senator Gregg was \nright. The Republican approach is superior because it emphasizes the \nqualities of the teacher, not simply putting more teachers out there.\n  I recall very well, in the third grade, when there was an \noverabundance of third graders in a small rural school in Arkansas that \nI attended, we were placed in the second grade class. There were 7 \nthird graders placed in the second grade class. Our teacher, Mrs. \nHare--I remember her well--had 30 students in her class: 23 second \ngraders and seven third graders. It was not an ideal situation by any \nmeans. It was not what anybody desired. We would have liked it if they \nhad smaller classes. But I will tell you this: I am glad I had a \nquality teacher and that quality teacher was able to turn what would \nhave been a disadvantage in having a combined class into an advantage \nfor every student in that classroom. It is far more important that we \nhave good teachers, qualified teachers, and teachers who have a heart \nfor those students than it is for us, with a command-and-control \napproach from Washington, DC, to simply put more teachers out there and \nhire more teachers at the Federal level.\n  It struck me that the Senator from Washington, in her arguments on \nbehalf of her amendment, wanted to have it both ways. In one breath she \nsaid: The Class Size Reduction Program was dramatically effective, so \neffective that we had to continue it. In virtually the next breath she \nsaid: Yes, it is impossible in 1 year to judge the effects of the \nprogram; therefore, we need to fund it again so we can give it time to \njudge its effectiveness.\n  You cannot have it both ways. So I think, as in many of the sincere \narguments from the other side, they are, in fact, quite misguided.\n  Let me outline a few of my concerns. Senator Gregg rightly pointed \nout it is a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a command-and-control \neducational system in which the Federal Government micromanages what \nthe local school districts can and should be doing. It is highly \ninflexible.\n  Lisa Graham Keegan, from the State of Arizona, who is one of the \ngreat education reformers in this country, stated recently that:\n\n       President Clinton made it abundantly clear that he decided \n     smaller class sizes are a good thing, even though research \n     has provided no clear indicators of the impact that class \n     size has on a child's ability to learn.\n\n  Time and time again, I heard the other side say they have lots of \nconclusive studies, that reduction of class size inevitably improves \neducational achievement. But I have heard very few studies cited, other \nthan one, in fact, from the State of Tennessee.\n  She continued:\n\n       Nevertheless, because [smaller] class size had been a good \n     thing in some of the classrooms the President had visited, \n     then smaller class sizes had to be a good thing for every \n     classroom in America.\n\n  There, I think, is the flaw in the argument. Because it helps in some \nsituations does not necessarily mean it is the panacea for educational \nreform across this country.\n  Second, I believe the approach cited by the Senator from Washington \nwill reward States that have failed to address this issue. Education is \nprimarily a State and local issue. Most States now address class size. \nIn fact, 25 States have had class size reduction initiatives: \nCalifornia, Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and on and on. \nTwenty-five States have already addressed this. Yet this Federal \nprogram, in which we fund from the Federal level 100,000 new teachers, \nbasically says that failure to act will be rewarded by the Federal \nGovernment stepping in and assisting States. So it has a negative \nincentive. It rewards States that have failed to address this issue.\n\n  Third, it creates either a new entitlement program or an annual \nbattle such as we have now had for two successive years in the \nappropriations process, pulling the rug out from under school districts \nthat have hired teachers based upon this Federal program. It is a Band-\nAid approach to a more systemic problem. It will either create a new \nentitlement which we feel obligated to keep funding year after year \nafter year because school districts have acted on\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\nthe basis of this Federal program, or we will go through this annual \nexercise, the schools never knowing for sure whether or not there is \ngoing to be this Federal program, and therefore we would be accused of \npulling the rug out from under them.\n  The Democrats keep mentioning we need to fulfill the promise we made \nlast fall in the omnibus appropriations bill, which funded the Class \nSize Reduction Program at $1.2 billion. I simply ask the question: What \nhappens if we do it this year and next year? At the end of the 7 years, \nwhat happens?\n  I will tell you what will happen. Every school district that has \nacted on the basis of this program will be saying: Reenact it, keep on \nbecause we are now dependent on this Federal program for the hiring of \nteachers.\n  As usual, in Federal education programs, it will continue to grow \nfrom year to year. It will become a new restrictive program that places \nmore regulations on the localities and further contributes to Federal \noversight of a local issue. Many school districts in Arkansas have \ndeclined to participate simply because of the amount of red tape and \nbureaucracy involved in the program. In fact, it feeds Federal \ndependence. It encourages those schools to look to Washington for \nfunding. It encourages schools into a kind of Federal dependency.\n  No. 5, needy, small districts oftentimes do not even qualify for one \nsingle teacher. I think one of the saddest results of this legislation \nwas that some of the neediest school districts, because of their size, \nwere unable to qualify for even one. They were unable to form the \nconsortia required to allow them to receive even partial funding for \nadditional teachers. So in a State like Arkansas those schools that are \nthe neediest are those that are least able to avail themselves of this \nprogram.\n  I might add, we have heard time and time again from the other side \nthat failure to pass the Murray amendment will result in the firing of \nthousands of teachers across this country. That is not the case. Funds \nare only now flowing into the school districts from last year's Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. It is for this school year the teachers who have \nbeen hired are already funded, all the way through to the end of this \nschool year. The way this should be addressed is through the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, which the education committee is \naddressing, and they will be bringing forth a reauthorization bill. \nThat is the proper way for this issue to be addressed. But the issue of \nfiring teachers, that is an absolute red herring; no teacher will be \nfired by the passage or failure of the amendment before us today.\n  I might add also, listening to the other side, you would think when \nthe $1.2 billion, 1-year appropriation for this program was enacted \nlast year, that there was bipartisan, universal consensus that this was \nwhat we ought to do. That was far from the case. It is a revision of \nhistory. The fact is, when the Murray amendment was offered last year, \nit was defeated on the floor of the Senate, and it was only in the huge \nomnibus appropriations bill at the end of the session that, in order to \nreach an agreement with the President to prevent a Government shutdown, \nthere was a resolution of the issue by a 1-year funding of the program. \nBut there was not a 7-year authorization under ESEA, nor was there ever \nany consensus of this body that this was a proper Federal approach.\n\n  The sixth reason I think this is a flawed approach is, while it is \nvery expensive, it will make minimal difference in academic \nachievement. We have already discovered decreased class size oftentimes \ndoes not result in any marked improvement in achievement. Between 1955 \nand 1997, school class size has dropped from 27.4 students per \nclassroom to 17 students per classroom, according to the National \nCenter for Education Statistics. The number of teachers has grown at a \nfar faster rate than the number of students.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the distinguished Senator from Arkansas yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 1 p.m. Senator Murray be recognized to offer an \namendment relevant to additional teachers, and following reporting by \nthe clerk, the amendment be laid aside, and Senator Gorton be \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the time between 1 p.m. and 4 \np.m. today be divided equally for debate on both amendments, and the \nvote occur on or in relation to the Gorton amendment, to be followed by \na vote on or in relation to the Murray amendment, at 4 p.m., and any \nrule XVI point of order be waived with respect to these two amendments \nonly.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in \norder to either amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when Senator \nHutchinson concludes, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I only have a few more remarks.\n  The point I was making, my sixth point, is why I think theirs is a \nflawed approach. The evidence is very clear that a simple reduction in \nclass size does not improve academic achievement. In Arkansas, we have \nseen enrollment decrease from 1970 to 1996 by only 1.3 percent, but \nthere has been a reduction in the number of students.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would like to yield, but I have a number of points \nI want to make before I wrap this up.\n  Mr. REID. We want to clear up who controls the time on this side so \nthere is no confusion later. Can we do that quickly?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Time will be controlled by Senator Murray on this side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Acceptable.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if I may return to the State of \nArkansas where we had a reduction in the number of students by 1.3 \npercent over the 25 years from 1970 on; the number of teachers grew by \n17,407 in 1965 to almost 30,000 in 1997. That is an increase of 70 \npercent in the number of teachers, while we saw a decrease in the \nnumber of students. That is dramatic class size reduction.\n  Unfortunately, we have not seen a comparable increase in academic \nachievement. I believe, if you look nationwide, that will be the story \nin State after State. While student-teacher ratios have decreased, we \nhave not seen a comparable increase in academic achievement. Why would \nwe then put this huge investment, dictating from Washington what the \nsolution should be?\n  If I were to make no other point in these remarks, it would be this \nseventh concern, that a one-size-fits-all approach from Washington will \nactually have a negative impact on the poorest students in this \ncountry. It will actually penalize poor children in districts across \nthis country.\n  The L.A. Times, in an editorial entitled ``Class-size Reduction \nDoesn't Benefit All; Quality Teachers Gravitate to Upper-Income School \nDistricts, While Inner-City Students Lose Out''--it is an interesting \nphenomenon. Because of the influx of Federal funds to hire teachers, \nthe result has been inner-city schools and poor school districts that \ncan compete less effectively with larger and more affluent schools are \nactually penalized under this proposal.\n  The L.A. Times editorial said it very well:\n\n       A substantive reduction in the size of classes in the lower \n     grades for virtually every one of California's \n     public elementary schools triggers a frenetic stirring \n     among the existing teacher force. Schools post job \n     openings for the newly created classrooms. Teachers apply \n     to multiple sites, some more attractive than others. The \n     more attractive schools--those in middle to high-income \n     communities--receive stacks of applications along with \n     well-honed cover letters. The least attractive schools--\n     poorly performing schools in high poverty areas--scrape \n     far fewer applications from their mailboxes.\n\n  That is the phenomenon. As so often is the case when we have a \nfederally initiated program trying to decide in Washington, DC, what is \nbest for local school districts all across this country, we have \nunintended consequences, and\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\nthe tragic unintended consequence of this program has been that the \npoor school districts, the inner-city school districts, are those that \nhave been penalized while the more affluent and middle-class \ncommunities have prospered under this program.\n  Randy Ross, vice president of the Los Angeles Annenberg Metropolitan \nProject, in testifying before our health committee in the Senate, noted \nthis phenomenon. He said:\n\n       One would think [that] . . . a policy that benefits all \n     teachers would benefit all children--rich and poor. But for \n     reasons that are all too clear, such is not the case with the \n     wholesale reduction in class size. . . . I believe the \n     federal government ought to take the moral high ground to \n     insure that government spending helps poor children, and \n     never, ever hurts them.\n\n  That has been the tragic result of this program, that poor children \nare the ones, in fact, who are penalized.\n  Senator Gregg rightly said the issue is not money. There is $1.2 \nbillion set aside in this bill for teacher initiatives, including the \nhiring of additional teachers, if that is what is necessary. That is \nthe better approach, where the local authorities have an option as to \nhow those Federal funds should be spent.\n  Frankly, in the area of IDEA, we have made an enormous commitment, \nbut we have failed to meet that commitment with adequate funding. My \nsister Jeri who teaches in Reagan Elementary School in Rogers, AK, \nknows very well that if the local needs were best met, it would be in \nproviding additional help in special education.\n  Why shouldn't the local authorities have the right and have the \noption of determining whether or not hiring more classroom teachers \nfills the greatest need or whether spending that money to better meet \nthe needs of special ed students would be the better use of local \nmoney?\n  I suggest our approach is far superior, that while very sincere, \nSenator Murray has brought forth, once again, a flawed approach in the \narea of this Class Size Reduction Initiative. I think we should meet \nthe responsibilities that we have already assumed in the area of IDEA \nbefore we create a new commitment and new responsibility that we are \nunprepared and unable to meet.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been in conference this morning on \nother matters, but I did hear the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, discuss the situation in Alaska and \nparticularly Anchorage.\n  Anchorage did receive $1.8 million last year and reduced class size \nfrom 22 to 18. The Senator from Washington indicated if her amendment \nis not adopted that the Anchorage School District would lay off those \nnew teachers.\n  I asked my staff to get in touch with the school district. I have to \npoint out it is 4 hours earlier in Alaska, and we had to wait a little \nwhile. I have come now to report the conversations that have taken \nplace with the Anchorage and Alaska entities that would receive moneys \nunder this bill.\n  I want to make it very plain that the Alaska position is, we want no \nstrings on these block grants. We contacted the Anchorage School \nDistrict superintendent, for instance, Bob Christal. He told my staff \nto tell me, without any question, they prefer this block grant money \nwithout any strings. But he said if Anchorage did receive the block \ngrant, they would use the money to keep the teachers who were hired and \nfor other purposes.\n  We also contacted the Deputy Commissioner of Education, Bruce \nJohnson. He said the Alaska Department of Education encourages the \ngreatest amount of flexibility for small districts. There is no \nquestion that Alaska wants flexibility in this money. He also indicated \nthere has been no contact with him about this prior to our call this \nmorning.\n  The superintendent of the Fairbanks School District, Alaska's second \nlargest city, Stewart Weinberg, said he much prefers the flexibility of \na block grant. He would like to use a portion of the money that would \nbe received for staff development by hiring mentor teachers to help \nother new teachers.\n  There is no question that is the Alaska situation. I know of schools \nin our State where the school population is going down so far that they \nare in the situation of maybe having to close schools. We are not \ntalking about an across-the-board concept of money to reduce class \nsize. We want money that can be used to meet the needs of the \nparticular school district.\n  In some school districts, because of the very unfortunate \ncircumstance of fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effect in Alaska, \nwe need teachers' assistants. There ought to be flexibility to use this \nmoney so it can meet the needs of the particular school district.\n  I want to make it very plain in voting, and I intend to vote on the \nMurray amendment, I will vote to support the position of the educators \nin Alaska who want this money without strings attached. They want to \nmeet the needs of their districts and they do not want the Federal \nGovernment dictating how the money must be spent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the previous order, we are now in \n3 hours of debate, equally divided, beginning with the presentation by \nthe Senator from Washington?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Washington is now recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1804\n\n(Purpose: To specify that $1.4 billion be made available for class size \n  reduction programs consistent with the provisions of Section 307 of \n                                105-277)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 1804.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 54 strike all after ``Act'' in line 18 through page \n     55 line 5 and insert the following: ``$3,086,634.000, of \n     which $1,151,550,000 shall become available on July 1, 2000, \n     and remain available through September 30, 2001, and of which \n     $1,439,750,000 shall become available on October 1, 2000 and \n     shall remain available through September 30, 2001 for \n     academic year 2000-2001: Provided, That of the amount \n     appropriaed, $335,000,000 shall be for Eisenhower \n     professional development State grants under title II-B and up \n     to $750,000 shall be for an evaluation of comprehensive \n     regional assistance centers under title XIII of ESEA: \n     Provided further, That $1,400,000,000 shall be available, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of federal law, to carry \n     out programs in accordance with Section 307 of 105-277, the \n     class size reduction program.\n       ``Further, a local education agency that has already \n     reduced class size in the early grades to 18 or fewer \n     children can choose to use the funds received under this \n     section for locally designated programs--\n       ``(1) to make further class-size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, including special education classes:\n       ``(ii) to reduce class size in kindergarten or other \n     grades, including special education classes; or\n       ``(iii) to carry out activities to improve teacher quality, \n     including recruiting, mentoring and professional \n     development.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if my colleague desires to speak and use \nsome of her time before I actually offer my amendment, I will let her \ndo so. I will seek recognition when she has completed her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \ncorrects a major flaw in the appropriations bill that is currently \nbefore the Senate.\n  Last year--1 year ago--in a bipartisan way, Members of the Senate, \nfrom both parties, and Members of the House, from both parties, agreed \nto fund an initiative called Reducing Class Size in the first, second \nand third grades. This is a commitment we made to hire 30,000 new \nteachers across the country in the early grades to make sure that these \nkids learn the basic skills that are so important to them as they begin \ntheir education.\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\n  We did this as a national commitment because we understand that the \nfunds that are directly targeted to the classroom, directly to hire new \nteachers, directly makes a difference in children's lives, and will \nmean that we, as Federal partners in providing funds for education will \nbe doing something concrete to make the education of every child in \nthis country better off. It was a bipartisan commitment by both \nparties.\n  Unfortunately, in the bill that is currently before us, the money \nthat was to be allocated for class size reduction has been put into \nsomething called a teacher assistance program that has not been \nauthorized. Unless it has been authorized, the $1.2 billion will be \nlost. Essentially, what that means is that the newly hired 30,000 \nteachers who are in their classrooms--one on one, working with young \nstudents--at the end of this year will be laid off, if the current bill \nmoves forward as we now have it in front of us.\n  My amendment corrects that flaw. It recommits the Senate, it \nrecommits the Congress to doing what we said was the right thing to do \na year ago, and that is reducing class sizes in first, second, and \nthird grades.\n  This idea of reducing class sizes did not come from some bureaucrat \nin Washington, DC. It came from grassroots organizations across the \ncountry, from parents who know that if their child is in a classroom \nwith 30 students throughout the year, they are not going to get the \nattention they need to have a good education.\n  It came from teachers who told us they were teaching in overcrowded \nclassrooms, with young students coming to them with problems that none \nof us probably have experienced in our lives but who are in their \nclassrooms, and the teachers do not have the time to deal with those \nproblems when there are 25 or 30 students.\n  As professionals and as educators, they told us that what we could do \nthat would make a difference would be to target money across the \ncountry, to add new teachers to lower class sizes which would give them \nthe opportunity to do what they have been educated to do--to teach our \nyoung children.\n  This came to us from community leaders who saw the increasing \noccurrences of violence in youth across their communities, who are \nsaying to us: We want you to do something that makes a difference, that \nis a reality, where our tax dollars can be held accountable, where we \ncan see a real difference occur because we see too many young people \nwho do not receive any adult attention, who are in overcrowded \nclassrooms, in neighborhoods where no one pays attention to them. They \ncome from families that, for many varied reasons, do not give them the \nattention they deserve. Reduce class sizes so there is one adult in \ntheir lives, in those early grades, who pays attention to them, works \nwith them one on one, and makes a difference.\n\n  This idea of reducing class sizes came to us from parents and \nteachers and community leaders who knew that the role of the Federal \nGovernment was to be a partner with their State legislature and their \nlocal school district to do the right thing for our young students.\n  We did not just pull this out because we imagined it may make a \ndifference. We knew from the studies that have been conducted that \nreducing class sizes in first, second, and third grades makes a \ndifference. It makes a difference in the learning of our young \nchildren.\n  We knew, in fact, that students in smaller classes had significantly \nhigher grades in English, math, and science. This came from a STAR \nstudy, a scientific study that took young kids in first, second, and \nthird grades, put them in smaller classes, and then followed them \nthroughout the next 10 years of their education. As they went on, these \nstudents, who had been in smaller class sizes to begin with, had \nsignificantly higher grades in English, math, and science. They were \nable to do what all of us want them to do, and that is to learn.\n  So this idea to reduce class size was backed up by science. It was \nbecause of studies similar to the STAR study that we knew that putting \nour Federal resources into hiring teachers was going to have an outcome \nthat actually made a difference in the education and learning of \nstudents across this country. It is real and it is there.\n  This is the result of the work we did a year ago. We currently have \nalmost 30,000 teachers now teaching in our classrooms that would not be \nthere if we had not begun this approach a year ago. We need to make \nsure we follow up on that commitment.\n  How can anyone turn around and now say: Well, what we did a year ago \nwas an empty promise at the end of the year. We got tied up in a budget \nnegotiation. We did not mean it.\n  How do you say to the teacher that I met in Tacoma a week ago--with a \nclass of 15 first graders as a result of what we did--that it was just \nan empty promise, that we did it on a whim, that we had to do it? We \nneed to say to that teacher: We meant it then and we mean it now. We \nknow that having 15 first graders in your classroom is going to make a \ndifference. We agree with you as a professional, with you as a teacher, \nwhen you look me in the eye as a legislator and say: These kids are \ngoing to get an education this year.\n  She said to me: I want you to make sure you continue this program so \nit isn't just a 1-year program, that every child in the first grade in \nthe United States of America knows that they are going to learn to \nread, that every parent who sends their child to a first grade \nclassroom will have the commitment from us that we are doing something \nin reality that makes a difference for their classrooms.\n  I know that we are going to be second-degreed. I know another \namendment is coming that will block grant these funds and say: Sure, \nthis money is still going to go out to the districts, but that does not \ntouch what parents are asking us to do, that does not touch what \nteachers are asking us to do.\n  They said: You as a Federal Government, you as our national leaders, \nhave said that reducing class size is a priority and you are behind it. \nTell us that is true, and follow through on that commitment. Don't let \nit get lost in the bureaucracies of block grants. Don't let it get lost \nin the politics that happen between where you are and where we are. \nPlease make sure that the money stays there for our teachers.\n  This is a program we know works. We know that in a lot of block \ngrants the money gets lost in administration and bureaucracy and \npaperwork. When we passed this legislation to reduce class size, we did \nit in a way that makes sure the paperwork is minimal. In fact, it is a \none-page form that school districts fill out. It takes an administrator \n10 minutes--no bureaucracy involved. That class-size money that we \nbegan a year ago--$1.2 billion--gets directed all the way into a \nclassroom.\n  The money doesn't go to bureaucracy and paperwork. It goes to a \nteacher in a classroom with young kids, giving them time, one on one, \nto be together and to learn and to be educated.\n  That is what we all want. That is what is important for our country's \nfuture. That is what is going to make a difference 15 years from now \nwhen those young kids graduate. Instead of being a dropout, instead of \nhaving discipline problems, instead of not going on to college, we know \nfrom studies we have seen that these children have a much higher rate \nof being successful.\n  Our economy will be better because these children have had that kind \nof attention. Our education system will be finally working, and we can \nsit back--15 years from now, 12 years from now--and take credit for \ndoing something that is real. If we block grant this money and send it \nout there, none of us can say we made a difference. We won't know. But \nwe do know because it is something that is wanted by parents; it is \nwanted by teachers; it is wanted by community leaders; it is wanted by \ngrassroots people who are in the classroom working with our young \nchildren, and it is part of what we have a responsibility to do at the \nFederal level.\n  We spend only 1.6 percent of the Federal budget on education. That is \nappalling. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to add \na block grant fund that adds to what we have done in the past, I am all \nfor it. I want to hear about it. I want to hear what it is targeted \nfor. I want to hear what its purpose is. I want to know it is going to \nmake a difference in education. I am delighted to join in that \ndiscussion.\n  But to rob from the Class Size Initiative to add a new program they \nhave developed, I say that is wrong. We know the class size money we \nput into\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\neffect a year ago is in the classrooms and working. We know a year from \nnow we can be held accountable for that. We know there are 1.7 million \nchildren today who are in a smaller class size, getting the skills they \nneed and being taught what they need, having an adult pay attention to \nthem and whom we won't be able to look at if this bill follows through \nand takes away the Class Size Reduction Initiative we began 1 year ago.\n  This is an important commitment. It was an important promise a year \nago. It is an important promise today. I hope this Senate will step \nback and say we have a responsibility as Federal legislators to work \nwith our States, to work with our local governments, to reduce class \nsize, and we are going to ante up our part. We are going to put the \nresources behind our rhetoric. We are going to put $1.4 billion into \nclass size reduction, keep those 30,000 teachers we have hired, add \n8,000 new ones, and, a year from now, know we can look back and say we \nhave made a difference--we have made a tremendous difference. We have \ntold a lot of kids, probably more than 2 million, a year from now, if \nwe do this right, that we care about them; that we want them to have \nthe attention they deserve; we believe their education is important; we \nbelieve it is more important than just words and rhetoric and empty \npromises; we are going to live up to the commitments we have given. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment before us.\n  We have a number of Senators who are going to come and debate this \namendment. We will be talking about this for the next several hours. I \nwill retain the remainder of my time at this point and allow the \nSenator from Washington to send his amendment forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1805\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1805.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        On page 55, line 2, strike all after ``Provided further,'' \n     to the period on line 5 and insert the following: \n     ``$1,200,000,000 is appropriated for a teacher assistance \n     initiative pending authorization of that initiative. If the \n     teacher assistance initiative is not authorized by July 1, \n     2000, the 1,200,000,000 shall be distributed as described in \n     Sec. 307(b)(1) (A and B) of the Department of Education \n     Appropriation Act of 1999. School districts may use the funds \n     for class size reduction activities as described in Sec. \n     307(c)(2)(A)(i-iii) of the Department of Education \n     Appropriation Act of 1999 or any activity authorized in Sec. \n     6301 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1999 or \n     any activity authorized in Sec. 6301 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act that will improve the academic \n     achievement of all students. Each such agency shall use funds \n     under this section only to supplement, and not to supplant, \n     State and local funds that, in the absence of such funds, \n     would otherwise be spent for activities under this section.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the bill that is before us today, an \nappropriations bill for a wide range of subjects, including education, \nincludes just four lines on this subject:\n\n       $1,200,000,000 shall be for teacher assistance to local \n     educational agencies only if specifically authorized by \n     subsequent legislation.\n\n  Now, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, described this money in this fashion because the chairman \nof the HELP Committee, the committee in charge of education in this \nbody, has conducted a long series of detailed hearings on education in \nthe United States toward the goal of renewing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Sometime next month or, at the latest, in January or February, the \ncommittee chaired by Senator Jeffords will report that Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act to the floor for debate. I will be surprised if \nthe debate on renewing our most fundamental educational bill does not \nlast at least a week. But it is simply because these issues are so \nvitally important and so key to the future of educational quality, so \nkey to the achievement of our students, so key to their performance in \na 21st century world, that it is not a debate that should be conducted \non an appropriations bill in a 3-hour period.\n  I must, incidentally, say that this is 3 hours more than was devoted \nto the subject last year, when the first installment of this 100,000 \nteachers program was authorized. It was authorized as a part of that \nmassive, overweight, end-of-session proposal that included at least \nhalf a dozen appropriations bills and hundreds of pages of authorizing \nlanguage, the content of which most Members were entirely unaware when \nthey voted on it.\n  The amendment of my colleague from the State of Washington is, at the \nvery least, premature. She presents issues that are significant and \nimportant. They do deserve debate. I think there is a considerably \nbetter way. The way we wrote it last year created some overwhelmingly \nsignificant problems. It created, first and foremost, in the State of \nWashington, our own State--and I suspect in every other State in the \nUnited States--a situation in which a very large number of school \ndistricts got too little money to hire a single teacher. Slightly over \n50 percent, slightly over half, 154 of the school districts in \nWashington State, didn't get enough money out of this program to hire \none teacher, already distorting the priorities set forth in the bill.\n  Interestingly enough, I don't think this is a debate that ought to \ndivide liberals from conservatives, much less those who believe in a \nFederal role in education from some, though I know of very few, who do \nnot.\n  In the course of the last year, after the passage of that bill, I \nhave been working with some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and with many on my own side of the aisle to come up with a set \nof ideas as to how we provide more trust in the people who have devoted \ntheir entire lives to education as teachers and principals and school \nboard members and, for that matter, parents. We have heard from various \nof the academic organizations and think tanks, both on the liberal side \nof this spectrum and on the conservative side of the spectrum.\n  Interestingly enough, a paper was recently published on this field, \nauthored by Andrew Rotherham of the then Public Policy Institute, a \nvery liberal think tank. Here is what he said in the section of his \npaper on the subject of teacher quality, class size, and student \nachievement:\n\n       Now a part of Title VI of ESEA, President Clinton's $1.2 \n     billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, \n     illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense \n     of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound \n     policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable \n     and essential. However, mandating localities do it by \n     reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and \n     unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.\n\n  That describes perfectly the proposal before us right now: \nWashington, DC, knows best. This criticism was written by a scholar at \na liberal think tank on education. But, interestingly enough, that \nscholar has now left the Public Policy Institute and works as President \nClinton's Special Assistant for Education Policy today. His study is on \nour side of this issue, not on the side of this issue presented by the \nprevious amendment.\n  I was disturbed by the way in which the bill came before us because \nessentially the bill says that if we don't pass authorizing legislation \nfor this particular program, the schools lose the $1.2 billion. I \nbelieve, as does the committee that reported this bill, we should be \nproviding our schools all across the United States with more means to \nprovide quality education for their students.\n  So I really think in the debate over my amendment that at least we \nought to secure a unanimous vote, whatever the views of Members on the \namendment by my colleague from the State of Washington, because the \namendment that is now before you, which I have offered, simply says \nthat if Congress does not authorize this program by June 30 of next \nyear, the schools will get the money anyway for any valid educational \npurpose, and they will get it in exactly the same dollar amount in \nevery single school district in the country that they would have gotten \nhad the Murray amendment passed and\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\nhad we authorized the program she proposes.\n  But what is the big difference? The big difference is that in the \nMurray amendment we are telling every one of 17,000 school districts in \nthe United States that we know better than they do what they need in \norder to provide education for their students. Somehow or another, an \nimmense ray of wisdom has descended on 100 Members of this body who \nknow more about the needs of a rural district in North Carolina, more \nabout the needs of New York City, more about the needs of 256, I \nbelieve it is, school districts in my own State, more than the men and \nwomen who have been elected school board members in each one of those \nschool districts, more than the superintendents they have hired to run \ntheir schools, and more than the principals who preside over each of \ntheir schools or the teachers in those schools or the parents in those \ndistricts.\n  That is not a supportable proposition. That is not a supportable \nproposition.\n  Obviously, the needs of school districts vary from place to place \nacross the country. Obviously, there are thousands of school districts \nthat already have ideally low class sizes and have other urgent needs \nfor the improvement of the performance of their students.\n  I am convinced that when we get to the debate over the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we are going to make profound changes in an \nact that has had wonderful goals for decades and has largely failed to \nmeet those goals. I am convinced that one of the principal reasons \nthose goals have not been met to anything like the extent we would wish \nis the fact that we are telling all of the school districts how to \nspend the money on literally hundreds of different programs.\n  I have a better idea, I am convinced, than even this amendment I \nproposed here today--the idea that we allow States to take a large \nnumber of these Federal programs and spend the money as they deem fit, \nwith just one condition, that one condition being that the quality of \neducation be improved as shown by testing students by their actual \nperformance.\n\n  Let me go back again to this critique by Mr. Rotherham: ``Illustrates \nWashington's obsession with means at the expense of results''--``means \nat the expense of results.''\n  In one amendment here today, we are saying to every school district \nin the United States: Here is what you have to do with respect to the \nstructure of your schools. We are telling them nothing about what they \nhave to do from the point of view of the performance of their students. \nBut when we get to the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, we will have that opportunity to go from a set of Federal programs \nfor which the school district becomes eligible by filling out forms and \nmeeting requirements set out here by the Congress of the United States \nor the U.S. Department of Education to one that says: Use your money to \nimprove student performance, and if you do, if you keep on using it \nthat way, you can keep on using it that way, but that is the only \ncondition--provide a better education.\n  As an interim step, my proposal says if we don't agree on some of the \nproposals here, we are still going to trust you, Mr. and Mrs. member of \nthe school district boards, and all of the professional educators, all \nof the men and women, the hundreds of thousands, millions of men and \nwomen in the United States who are dedicating their entire careers to \neducation to being able to do the job.\n  Earlier this spring, when we came up with the proposition--that we \npassed last year without debating it--of a program that created a \ntremendous amount of awkwardness in half of our school districts \nbecause they couldn't hire a single teacher with the money, the \nassociate executive director of the State school directors association \nin my State of Washington wrote this to us:\n\n       At some point elected officials in Washington, DC, simply \n     must trust local education officials to do what is in the \n     best interests of the kids in their community. We all have \n     their best interests at heart.\n\n  Yesterday and this morning, all we heard from the other side of the \naisle was that if we don't pass that previous amendment from my \ncolleague, the 30,000 teachers who have been hired in the last year \nwill all be fired and they will all be out on the street. We heard that \nfrom Member after Member on the other side.\n  If we do it my way, each of these schools districts will have the \nsame number of dollars. Are they going to hire teachers with it? Do we \nhave so little confidence in the ability of our schools to set their \nown priorities that 30,000 teachers will be out on the street? If we \ndid, it would be because it was the unanimous opinion of school \ndistricts across the country that this wasn't the right way to spend \nmoney on improving education.\n  I expect that most of the money will continue to be spent on \nteachers--a very large amount. But it will be a little more in one \ndistrict and a little less in another because each one of them will \nhave different needs and different priorities.\n  No. Between these two ideas this is a great gulf. Each of us, I \nguess, has a strong ego, and humility is not a virtue widely practiced \nin the Congress of the United States. However, it doesn't take a great \ndeal of humility to say maybe the teachers in my State know more about \neducation than I do; maybe our principals and superintendents know more \nabout running their school districts than we do; maybe the elected \nschool board members who run for just that office and are in the \ncommunities and are working with the parents know a little bit more \nabout what their schools need in 17,000 different school districts \nacross this country than do 100 Members of the Senate.\n\n  Members who vote for that other amendment will be saying: We know \nwhat's best; you don't. We know what's best. Do it our way. It's the \nonly way to do it.\n  Those who take a different philosophical point of view will say: \nLet's provide our schools with the tools to do the job, but let's let \nthem determine how to do the job.\n  Beyond that, my own amendment ought to unite us. We certainly ought \nto assure the money goes to the schools, and then when we have that \nweek-long or 2-week-long debate this winter and decide how much Federal \ncontrol we are going to impose, whether we are going to begin to \nprovide more trust, the money will be there; it will be guaranteed to \neach of the school districts. But we don't need to do it here and now \nin a relatively brief debate. We do not need to say we know better than \nthey do what their students need.\n  Guarantee the money for our schools through this amendment, guarantee \nour schools can set their priorities through their own professional \neducators, through their own parents, their own often amateur members \nof the school board, without our having to tell them how to spend every \ndollar.\n  I believe we should vote in favor of this amendment and against the \nother.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, be added as a cosponsor, and I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington, Senator Murray, is a no-brainer. I want to say \nwhy I believe it is a no-brainer and why I believe it is prudent for \nthe Senate to move ahead with it and approve it today.\n  The Federal share of elementary and secondary education in this \ncountry has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent of the share \ngoing to schools in 1998. Let me say this another way. Back in 1980, we \nfunded 14 percent of elementary and secondary education needs; in 1998, \nwe funded 6 percent of those needs.\n  Essentially what Senator Murray is trying to do is raise the \nappropriation level by $200 million and say let's go do it.\n  What does she want to do? She says, let's reduce class size. What \ndoes that mean? In 1999, we spent $1.2 billion on the first installment \nof hiring 100,000 new teachers all across this great country. The \nUnited States could hire 30,000 teachers under that appropriation; my \nState, California, could hire 3,322 teachers. President Clinton's \nrequest for this year, FY 2000, was $1.4 billion. That meant the United \nStates could\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\nhire 8,000 teachers to continue that and California could hire an \nadditional 1,100 teachers.\n  The recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a \nmember, is $1.2 billion. How the money would be used is not specified. \nThe legislation reads that it is for ``teacher assistance'' and that it \ncan only be appropriated if it receives the authorizing legislation.\n  Senator Murray's amendment adds $200 million and deletes the \ncontingency language. Therefore, with the passage of this amendment, \nthe United States could hire 8,000 new teachers all across this great \nland. For my State, California, that means 1,100 additional teachers. \nThat is important. Class size reduction is important.\n  I think there are three things that can be done to improve education:\n  One, elimination of the practice of social promotion, under which \nyoungsters are promoted from grade to grade even when they fail, even \nwhen they don't show up in class, even when there are major \ndisciplinary problems and youngsters are not learning. But they are \nstill promoted. This has come to denigrate the value of a high school \ndiploma all across this great land.\n  We also have large class sizes. California has some of the largest \nclasses in the Union. I have been in elementary schools, K through 6, \nwith 5,000 students in the school. In California, in some schools, \nstudents speak 50 different languages, which adds additional burdens on \nthe teachers. No one can learn adequately in overcrowded classes with \noverburdened teachers.\n  Because of the challenge of diversity, of the need for additional \nEnglish training, of the challenge of tightened core curriculum \nstandards, smaller class sizes across this land makes sense. I don't \nthink there is anyone in the Nation who has a youngster in public \nschool who wouldn't say: My youngster can learn better in a class size \nthat is smaller.\n  That is what this money will go to--reducing class size. Class size \nreduction, school size reduction, elimination of social promotion, and \nmore qualified teachers across this land can make a huge difference in \nthe accountability and excellence of education for our youngsters.\n  My State has 6 million students, more students than 36 States have in \ntotal population. We have one of the highest projected enrollments in \nthe United States. California will need 210,000 new teachers by 2008--\n210,000 new teachers. How could I say, let's wait and authorize this \nsome other time? We don't even know whether there will be an elementary \nand secondary education bill this session. We have an opportunity to \naddress a big problem in education right now. I would hazard a guess \nthat States such as that of the Presiding Officer, Ohio, could also \nbenefit from small class size reduction.\n\n  The Murray amendment essentially provides $200 million in additional \nfunds and specifically says the funds will go for class size reduction \nand the hiring of this additional increment of teachers. That is why I \nsay it is a no-brainer. The need is there; the need is clear. Every \nparent knows their child is better educated in a smaller setting than a \nlarger setting in elementary school. Why not do it?\n  California needs to build six new classrooms a day--$809 million a \nyear just in our State--to be able to meet demand. It is a huge \nobligation. Our teachers are actually spending $1,000 a year out of \ntheir own pockets to pay for books, Magic Markers, scissors, and other \nschool supplies. Our needs are huge.\n  I think reducing class size, increasing the amount of Federal dollars \nthat go to the schools for education, is something we should do, and \nsomething we should do forthwith. We should do it because we face an \nemergency in our schools.\n  I commend Senator Murray for her effort in this. Mr. President, $200 \nmillion more dollars can help get the job done. We have an opportunity, \nand we should use it.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, as well as the \nchairman of the full committee and the ranking member. I actually think \nthis is a good bill in terms of dollars. It has at least $2 billion \nmore for health research. This bill probably includes the largest \nsingle priority bill of the American people. I compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. I compliment the ranking member, the Senator from Iowa. \nWe may have some differences over how the money should be spent, we may \nhave some differences over stem cell research or some of the specific \nwording of the bill, but the bill does provide many of the necessary \ndollars.\n  I will speak at a later time on the health aspects of the bill. I ask \nunanimous consent I be afforded 15 minutes after this vote on the \namendment to be able to speak on the health aspects of this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have a \ntime agreement now until 4 o'clock, where we have two votes. After that \ntime, we are going to be moving on to another amendment, I think, of \nthe Senator from Nevada. But I expect at some point we could \naccommodate the request by the distinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, technically I do object, not knowing \nwhere it is going to come. Let us see if we cannot work it out. Let us \nnot have an agreement at this moment as to time, and I will consult \nwith Senator Reid, who is managing the time for that side, and we will \ntry to find the time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that. I withdraw the request.\n  How much more time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes requested by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I wanted to \ntake a few minutes to share with my colleagues the very clear, \noverwhelming message I received as I traveled over the State of \nMissouri and met with teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, \nand school board members. They asked me a very simple question: Why is \nit the people in Washington know so much more about our needs than we \ndo? How are you, in Washington, DC, so smart, to know that what we \nreally need is more teachers?\n  I can tell you instance after instance where, for example, they say: \nLook, we are in a small school. We only have so many classrooms. We \ncannot put another teacher in those classrooms. What we need is more \nequipment. Do not give us the money for a teacher for whom we do not \nhave a classroom, or do not give us more money for another teacher when \nour salaries are so low we have to raise all the teachers' salaries in \norder to make sure we keep good people in teaching. It is not just \nquantity. In a lot of these areas it is getting the money to pay for \nquality teachers. That is why I believe the Gorton proposal is the way \nto go.\n  I have talked to those in small school districts who say: Do you know \nwhat we would get? We would get .17 of a teacher, 17 percent of a \nteacher. That makes a pretty poor teacher, when you have only 17 \npercent of the teacher. They have not quite figured out how to usefully \nemploy seventeen one-hundredths of a teacher.\n  But that is the extreme case. The real case, time and time again, is \nthat this is viewed in school districts around my State, and I suggest \nit would be viewed that way in your own States if you asked them, that \nWashington is not so smart as to know what each district--whether it is \nNorth Callaway or the Scotts Corner or the Martinsburg-Wellsville-\nMiddletown School District needs another half a teacher, or a teacher-\nand-a-half. Those decisions should be made by the school boards that \nrepresent and serve the parents of the district who employ the \nsuperintendents and the principals and the teachers.\n  I proposed something called a direct check for education, which is \nmolded on the work of my colleague, Senator Gorton. That has had \noverwhelming support from people who actually do the job of teaching \nour students. We entrust the future of our students to these people. \nThen we come in from Washington, DC, and say: We are a lot smarter; we \nknow what you need in the\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\nschool district. One size does not fit all. Washington's solution is \nnot right in every school district. I can assure you of that. I can \nassure you the people who are responsible, the people who are elected--\nusually by the constituents in that district, the patrons of the school \ndistrict--want to see the best for their children.\n  Do you know what bugs them? Do you know what is causing them \nproblems? It is all the time and energy they waste in filling out the \nforms on how they used that 17 percent of a teacher. Filling out those \nreports, sending them to Washington to keep more bureaucrats busy, does \nnot educate a child or teach the child to read. It doesn't help that \nchild figure out multiplication or division or even to learn about \nscience and history. We need to get the Federal redtape and regulations \nand misdirected priorities off the backs of the schools that are \nlaboring to teach our kids.\n  If you have any confidence at all in public education, public \neducation in America today is, and must be, controlled at the local \nlevel. Yes, it is a national priority. It must be a national priority.\n  I commended President Bush when he set out to start the work of \nraising the standards and the expectations for everybody in America to \nimprove our education system. That is a national priority. But it is a \nlocal responsibility. Let us not impose our will on local officials, \nschool board officials, parents, principals, and the teachers on how to \nspend that money.\n  I think this is a clear-cut case where we want to trust the people \nwho teach our kids. They know the kids' names, they know the kids' \nproblems, and they know the kids' opportunities.\n  I urge support of the Gorton amendment. I reserve the remainder of \nthe time and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Levin be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield such time as he may use to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will use 10 minutes, Mr. President.\n  What we have heard from the other side in this debate today is a \ntechnique which is sometimes used in this body. But the people who are \nwatching this debate ought to understand it. Those listening to it \nought to understand it. It is a familiar technique; that is, not to \ndescribe what the amendment is and then to differ with it. That is what \nwe have seen.\n  With all respect to the Senator who recently spoke about all the time \nthat is necessary in order to make the application--here it is: One \npage, to make an application. One page for the local school community \nto make the application.\n  Let's come back a step and understand the Federal role in education \nand what this program is basically all about. There is not anyone who \nis serious about education policy who believes with the 6 or 7 cents \nout of every Federal dollar that the Federal Government is going to \ncontrol local decisions on education, not a serious educator. There may \nbe Senators who would like to misrepresent what they understand would \nbe the results of any particular amendment, but that does not stand. I \nthink it is basically intuitive to understand when we are only \nproviding the 6 or 7 cents out of every dollar, basically it is a \nmodest opportunity for local communities to take advantage of these \nprograms.\n  Second, so we have made a commitment to what? Smaller class size, \nwhich is the debate now, ensuring we are going to have a quality \nteacher in every classroom, that we are going to take advantage, later \non in these debates, of afterschool programs which have proven \neffective and which people desire. We are going to have an opportunity \nto address those issues. But it is all within that 7 cents.\n\n  To listen to our friends on the other side, you would think this is \nbeing jammed down the throats of the various school districts. What is \nin this amendment of the Senator from Washington? It is $1.4 billion to \nprovide for the hiring of various teachers. I have listened to the \nother side, the Senator from New Hampshire and other Senators, talking \nabout how this is going to threaten local education, how the heavy hand \nof the Federal Government is going to come down and dictate to every \nlocal school community.\n  This is what it says. Section 304:\n\n       Each local education agency that desires to receive the \n     funds under this section shall include in the application \n     required. . . .\n\n  If they so desire to participate--completely voluntary. Do we \nunderstand that on the other side? This is voluntary. This says, if \nyour parents, your local teachers, the local school boards, want to \nparticipate under this, if there is enough resources and the Murray \namendment is accepted, then they can voluntarily participate. Do we \nunderstand that on the other side? Voluntary.\n  Then the question is, all of this Federal bureaucracy, here it is--\none page. I wish those who comment on the Murray amendment would at \nleast extend the courtesy to the Senator from Washington to actually \nunderstand, to read the amendment and understand what it does. Here it \nis.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record, the one-page \napplication for local communities to apply for these teachers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                             iii. budget plan\n\n       1.

Mr. President, with all respect to the Senator from the \nState of Washington, Mr. Gorton, under his particular provisions it \nwould put $1.2 billion in a title VI block grant program that allows 15 \npercent to be used for administration, reducing the funds to schools.\n  How hollow it is for those on the other side to talk about how we are \nnot getting the bang for the buck when virtually 100 percent of this \ngoes to the local school boards for them to make the judgment in hiring \nthose teachers. Our Republican friends, under title VI, spend 15 \npercent in administration of it.\n  Let's get real about this. Please, let's get real on it. Let's debate \nit on the merits. I would be tempted, if the Senator from Washington, \nMr. Gorton, wants to put this as an add-on, to perhaps support it. But \nthat is not what we have here. It is a substitute saying that their \nprogram is better than this particular program that has been tried, \ntested, accepted, and working, and improving the quality of education \nfor children and, importantly, there is a desire for it to be \ncontinued.\n  We have heard again from our good friend from New Hampshire about how \nthis is basically robbing the funding for IDEA, the disability program \nin education. We should not hear that anymore from that side of the \naisle, and I am going to tell you why. When we had the major tax \nproposal under the Republicans, we had an amendment on the floor of the \nSenate that the Senator from Washington supported and which I \nsupported, the Senator from Minnesota supported, and others supported, \nthat said: Let's take the full funding of IDEA for 10 years and carve \nthat out of the tax bill; let's carve it out and fully fund it for 10 \nyears.\n  It would have amounted to a one-fifth reduction in taxes. That was \nthe key vote in terms of IDEA. That was the key vote in terms of \npriorities for disabilities. Every single Member of the other side of \nthe aisle voted against it--every single one of them.\n  Let's not come to this Chamber in the afternoon and say: Look what is \nhappening with the Murray amendment; they are trying to take the money \nfrom scarce resources.\n  We had the opportunity to do that, and they said no. That was a \nserious debate at that particular time. Perhaps maybe even the \nPresident's position on the tax bill might have altered or changed--\nmight have, maybe not--if we were going to have full funding of IDEA. \nBut absolutely not and not a single one supported that particular \nproposal.\n  I do not often differ with the chairman of our Appropriations \nCommittee, but he suggests we reserve $1.2 billion subject to \nauthorization, and if the authorizers choose to authorize class size, \nfine, and if not, it can be a block grant for the States to choose. \nThat is the whole problem. We have not been given the opportunity to \nauthorize that. We have been denied, on each and every opportunity, as \nthe Senator from Washington has pointed out, doing that.\n  The fact is, last year on the appropriations bill, they in effect \nauthorized it and Republicans supported it. All we are asking is to \nextend it, like we did last year.\n  I mentioned earlier, and it continues to echo in my ears, what the \nRepublicans said about this very program. It is a shame this issue has \nsomehow developed into a partisan issue because last year, with the \nMurray amendment, it was widely embraced by the Republicans.\n  Listen to what Congressman Goodling, the chairman of the Education \nand Workforce Committee, declared about this program, the Murray \namendment:\n\n       . . . a real victory for the Republican Congress . . .\n  That is fine with us. As long as we can get the substance, as long as \nwe get teachers, if Congressman Goodling wants to declare that, fine.\n\n       . . .but more importantly--\n\n  Thank you--\n\n       it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are \n     fed up with Washington mandates, red tape, and regulation. We \n     agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, \n     but our proposal does not create big, new federal education \n     programs.\n\n  Mr. Armey:\n\n       We were very pleased to receive the President's request for \n     more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way \n     to pay for them. And when the President's people were willing \n     to work with us so we could let the state and local \n     communities use this money--\n\n  That was always the intent, and not only the intent, but specifically \nthe language of the Murray amendment.\n  He continues:\n\n       . . . make these decisions, manage the money, spend the \n     money on teachers where they saw the need, whether it be for \n     special education or for regular teaching, with freedom of \n     choice and management and control at the local level, we \n     thought this was good for America and good for \n     schoolchildren. We were excited to move forward on that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  Senator Gorton said this about the class size:\n\n       On education, there's been a genuine meeting of the minds \n     involving the President and the Democrats and Republicans \n     here in Congress. . . . It will go directly through to each \n     of the 14,000 school districts. . .and each of those school \n     districts will make its own determination as to what kind of \n     new teachers that district needs most, which kind should be \n     hired. We never were arguing over the amount of money that \n     ought to go into education. And so this is a case in which \n     both sides genuinely can claim a triumph.\n\n  What in the world has happened in the last 10 months to those \nRepublican leaders who were enthusiastic about this program 10 months \nago and now discard it? What is it? We have not heard it in the Senate; \nwe have not heard it from one single speaker. We hear generalities; we \nhave rhetoric, but there has not been a specific reason for opposition.\n  In conclusion, the results of that investment show the children are \nbenefiting from the Murray amendment every single day they are in those \nsmaller class sizes.\n  I hope this body will accept the Murray amendment and do something \nthat is important for local schoolchildren all across this Nation.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the beginning of his remarks, the \nSenator from Massachusetts said the Senator from Missouri, not having \nread the Murray amendment, made a factual error. I regret to say the \nSenator from Massachusetts, obviously, has not read my amendment when \nhe stated it allows 15 percent to be used for administration and not go \nto teachers. In fact, the distribution formula under the Gorton \namendment is identical to the distribution formula under the Murray \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I also note the Senator from Massachusetts must not have \nheard my speech because I outlined specific reasons why class size is \nnot as important as quality of education and quality of teachers. Isn't \nit true the quality of the teachers is what is the key here, and the \namendment of the Senator from Washington will go to allowing schools to \nimprove quality of education and quality of teachers?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Hampshire, in 30 seconds, is \nprecisely correct. He summed up the entire debate. I yield 5 minutes, \nor such time as he may use, to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we should step back from the rhetoric for a \nmoment and calmly ask the question: What is this debate all about? It \nis about two simple ideas. They are competing ideas, and neither one is \nnecessarily a bad idea. The question is which one is better.\n  On the one hand, we have an idea that comes from Washington, DC. It \nis not a bad idea. It comes from very smart people. The idea is that a \nlot of school districts in this country could benefit by having the \nmoney to hire more teachers. There is nothing wrong with that. \nWashington, DC, has a lot of bright people, and sometimes some good \nideas come from them.\n  But every school district in this country is different. What the \nKennedy-Murray amendment will provide for is only one program, only one \nidea, and that is that Federal money would be available for one purpose \nand one purpose only: the hiring of more teachers.\n  As I said, it is a fine idea; it is good for many but not all. That \nis where the other idea comes into play. The other idea is that the \nsame amount of money should be made available to the local school \ndistricts to be used not just to hire more teachers but for any other \nlegitimate purpose which they believe would best meet the needs of \ntheir students based upon their circumstances.\n  It is a matter of choice. A school district may well decide that what \nthey need more than anything else is to get new books for their library \nor new computers for the kids or to develop a new reading program; \nmaybe, in view of what is happening to some schools around the country \ntoday, to make sure their schools are safer, to provide new antidrug or \ndrug education programs in the schools.\n  We believe strongly that every parent and child in this country \nshould be guaranteed a safe and drug-free, quality education for \nthemselves or their children. What that means in a school district in \nBrooklyn, NY, may be very different from what it means in a school \ndistrict in rural Arizona, for example.\n  So what the amendment propounded by Senator Gorton says is: Let's let \nthe local school districts decide what to do with this money. The \npeople in Washington may well be right that it ought to be used to hire \nteachers, but maybe the local folks have a better idea for their school \ndistrict as to what they think that money should be used for.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side, what is the matter with \nchoice? Why wouldn't you want to give the local school districts the \nchoice over how to use that money? I think the answer is: Well, because \nthat is not our idea. We in Washington have a better idea. We know \nwhat's best.\n  The presumption is, we know what is best for every school district in \nthe country. But that isn't true. It is the folks who know the kids' \nnames, who are right there in the local community, who understand what \nthey need most. If they could use that money for purposes other than \nhiring a new teacher or to better the education of their kids--because \nmaybe they have enough teachers--then why shouldn't we give them that \nchoice? It is a very simple proposition--two competing ideas: \nWashington knows best or letting the school district decide.\n\n  There is another potential problem with the Murray amendment. Perhaps \nthose more familiar with the funding could speak to this issue, but I \nthink there is a significant likelihood that with $200 million more in \nmoney under the Murray amendment, the forward funding concept being \nproposed here would result in that money coming from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. If there is any chance of that happening, I must \nsay, we should be firmly and unequivocally in opposition.\n  We should not be here today making decisions which--maybe not next \nyear but the year after--could result in taking money from the Social \nSecurity trust fund, even to fund something as beneficial as education. \nThere is plenty of room in the non-Social Security budget for all of \nthe things we need to do. Remember, this year we have a surplus. The \nPresident just announced the size of that surplus--well over $100 \nbillion. Much of that is in the non-Social Security side of the budget.\n  A surplus, by definition, means that after we have paid for \neverything else we need, we have money left over. So we are not talking \nabout not being able to fund what we need to fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. May I ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, is there another \nspeaker on our side who wishes to speak next or would we go to the \nother side?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We should alternate to the other side of the aisle. Then \nwe have Senator Jeffords after that.\n  Mr. KYL. Fine. I will take just another minute and a half of the 2 \nminutes of which I asked.\n  Just to summarize the point here, there are a lot of good ideas that \ncome out of Washington, DC. We provide money for them. But we should \nnot presume that everything we come up with here fits every single \nschool district in the country. There may be needs in one area that are \nnot shared in another area; whereas one school district may need \nteachers, another school district may say, down the road we may need to \nhire more teachers, but what is more needed is a better math program or \na better history program or whatever it might be.\n  We ought to give them that chance--that is all the Gorton amendment \nsays--instead of saying they can only spend the money on one thing. The \nGorton amendment provides that they can spend the money on a variety of \nthings. The application is simple. They simply set their goals, and a \nyear later they demonstrate whether they have met their goals. If they \nhave, they can re-up for the money. If they have not, they cannot. So \nit is a very goal-oriented program, and they are the ones who set the \ngoals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment to the Murray \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that Ann Ifekwunigwe, a fellow \nin my office, be given floor privileges during the consideration of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone be added \nas a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to Senator Wellstone 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, I ask unanimous consent that an intern, \nJonathan Wettstein, be granted floor privileges during the duration of \nthis debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, and, for that matter, to the people in our \ncountry who are watching the debate or those who are writing about this \ndebate, that if Republicans want to block grant an additional $1 \nbillion or so, having some sense of what it will be for, above and \nbeyond the commitment we have made to our school districts--which has \neverything in the world to do with not only what teachers but students \ntell me they really need, namely, more teachers for smaller class \nsizes--we might be for it.\n  But that is not what this is about. I have been in a Minnesota school \nabout every 2 weeks for the last 9 years. I was\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\nat Centennial High School just 2 days ago--on Monday. We were talking \nabout education, I say to my colleague from Washington.\n  I always say to students: You are the experts. Tell me, given your \nexperience--they were juniors and seniors, from a very good school--\nwhat works? What are the things you think work best? Also, tell me \nwhere you think the gaps are, where you think the weaknesses are. The \nfirst thing students talk about is smaller class size. That is the \nfirst thing they talk about.\n  We have used this commitment from the President and what Democrats \nhave pushed through for this last year to hire an additional 519 \nteachers in the State of Minnesota. That makes a difference to our \nState. I do not want to see these 519 teachers who are adding--not \nsubtracting, but adding--to the education of young people in our \nschools in Minnesota receive pink slips, to be without work. I do not \nwant to see that happen. I do not want to see us retreat from the \ncommitment we have made.\n  A lot of people back in our States are fairly cynical about what we \nare doing or what we are not doing in the Nation's Capital, what we are \ndoing or not doing in the Congress.\n  One of the programs that people really respond to is sort of the way \npeople view the Cox program, this initiative we have taken, which is \nworking. What infuriates school districts, what infuriates the \neducation people, who we should be supporting in all our States, is \nwhen we go down the road of a commitment, we come up with something \nthat is not bureaucratized, we come up with an initiative that makes \nall the sense in the world, that speaks directly to the challenges we \nare faced with in our schools, that provides the funding for school \ndistricts to hire more teachers so they can reduce class size, which is \nreally appreciated, which really makes a difference, all of a sudden we \ngo back on that commitment. That is what this is all about.\n  This amendment, on the part of Senator Gorton from Washington, is an \neffort to essentially negate the commitment we have made, which is what \nSenator Murray and Senator Kennedy and all of us are speaking for.\n  As I listened to my colleagues on the other side speak, I think there \nis also a philosophical difference. It is not true that we in the \nCongress do not or should not think of our country as a national \ncommunity. We should. We are a national community. There are certain \nkinds of values that inform us.\n  Sometimes we come to the floor and support legislation, and hopefully \npass legislation, that says to every child in America, no matter where \nhe or she lives, no matter what State, no matter what district, no \nmatter rural or urban or wealthy school district or low-income school \ndistrict, we are going to do everything we can to make sure that child \nhas an opportunity to do well. That is a commitment we make for our \nnational community. We are going to say this is a priority. We are \ngoing to focus on this priority. We are going to fund this priority.\n  What Senator Murray has said is, we have made that commitment. The \npriority that we have outlined is that we make the commitment to \nprovide the funding for the school districts, if they want, so they can \nuse that funding to hire more teachers to reduce class size. We know \nthis is important, important to the students in this country, important \nto the students in Minnesota, important to the students of Illinois or \nWashington or Massachusetts. That is what we have done. That is what \nthis debate is all about.\n  The Republicans on the other side of the aisle want to basically go \nback on this commitment. They want to say no, we don't want to do that. \nWe are simply going to undercut the commitment. They haven't authorized \nit yet.\n  Let me tell Senators, there are a lot of us who would like to have a \nlot of substantive debate about education, including authorizing this \nbill in committee, getting it out on the floor. That can't be used as \nan excuse.\n  What we have from Republicans is a counterproposal which essentially \nmeans that we go back on this commitment and we block grant this money. \nWe wipe out this program. We wipe out this commitment. We wipe out this \npriority. We no longer say that as a Federal Government, as a Congress, \nas a national community, we are committed to getting more resources to \nschool districts so they can hire more teachers and reduce class size.\n  If my colleagues on the other side think there isn't a lot of support \nin their States for this initiative, they are making a big mistake.\n  What my Republican colleagues want to do is say: We will just block \ngrant this. The money can be spent however it can be spent. We don't \nestablish the priorities. We don't think of this as a national \ncommunity. We don't think of this effort to reduce class size as an \nimportant enough priority that we should continue to fund it.\n  That is an outrageous proposition. All of us will be held accountable \nfor our vote.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will make one more point, unless there are any \ncolleagues on the floor who need to speak right away.\n  I think there is a kind of difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans, a difference above and beyond a philosophical question, \nwhich is that we are prepared to say this is a priority and stand by \nthis priority, and we are not prepared to walk away from the commitment \nwe have made to school districts or a commitment we made to children or \na commitment we made to teachers or a commitment we made to education. \nWe are not going to walk away from that commitment. Our Republican \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle want to.\n\n  The other problem is this pattern of funding. Here is a Republican 5-\nyear history of cutting education funding: I remember the 1995 \nrescission, a cut of $1.7 billion. That was a House bill. Fiscal year \n1996, $3.9 billion below 1995, House bill; fiscal year 1997, a cut of \n$3.1 billion; fiscal year 1998, $200 million less than the President's \nproposal; fiscal year 1999, $2 billion below the President's proposal.\n  It is incredible to me. I was on the floor with Senator Boxer, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Durbin--there were a number of Senators \ninvolved. We were saying: Wait a minute; we now see an effort on the \nfloor of the Senate to feel so sorry for these big oil companies that \nhave been caught cheating; they ought to pay their fair share of taxes, \nbut some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were right \nthere for these oil companies. They wanted to make sure they got their \nbreaks, wanted to make sure they didn't have to pay their fair share, \nwanted to make sure they got this benefit. That is a priority. You can \nbe for big oil companies or you can try to work out deals for this \nspecial interest or that special interest.\n  We are arguing that children and education is a special interest. We \nare arguing that this is a special program. We are arguing this is a \nspecial program that has worked very well. We are arguing that we made \na commitment to our school districts to continue this funding. We are \narguing that it would be simply unconscionable, indeed, unacceptable, \nfor this Senate to now abandon that commitment after 1 year of a \nsuccessful program.\n  We speak against it. We fight against it. We are proud to vote for \nthe Murray amendment. All of us will be held accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Washington. I appreciate his \nleadership and commitment to education. He is an excellent spokesman on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, my daughters have graduated from public schools. My \nwife and I have graduated from public schools. We want to strengthen \nour public schools. We want to improve schools; certainly, we do.\n  What we really want to do is improve public education. We want to \nmake it better. I believe that so strongly. It is curious to me that \nthere are some in\n\n[[Page S11611]]\n\nthis body who think there is only one way to do it--to spend an extra \nbillion or so--and that is to spend it on 100,000 teachers, which I \nsuppose is an issue that somebody poll tested and ran surveys on and \nthought that sounded like a good political way to fix education. We \nhave to be responsible. We have to think these thing through.\n  The Gorton amendment says, OK, we want to do more than we have done. \nThe Senator from Washington says, I will sponsor an amendment that \nspends more for education than the President has requested. But he \nwants to give the local school systems the ability to decide how to use \nthat money.\n  As I travel around my State having town meetings in every county in \nmy State, almost every meeting I have the local superintendent of \neducation comes up and we talk about education. I am not hearing them \ntell me they want more micro-managed, targeted assistance from \nWashington, more regulations, more paperwork to fill out, and more \ncontrols on how they are operating to improve their education. They are \nnot asking for that.\n  What they are saying is--and this is happening all over America; \nschool systems are in intense self-study; Governors are in intense \nstudy of their education situation--we have to do better about how we \ndo education. Just to say we need more teachers and that is all you can \nspend this money for does make good sense.\n  It is not being against education; it is not being against learning; \nit is not being against schools, to say we ought not to target this \nmoney for one use only. We need to be flexible.\n  What we do know is this: Class size in America is down. As a matter \nof fact, it has been reported that 42 States already meet the goal of \n18 students per teacher; 42 States are already doing that. What is \ntroubling--and I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New \nHampshire, has talked passionately about this so often--is our \nachievement numbers are still going down.\n  When you get at the level of 16, 17, 18, 19 students per teacher, \nwhat do we know from scientific study and analysis? It is not whether \nit is 19 or 17 in a classroom that is key. It is the quality of the \nteacher, the learning environment that occurs there. Do they have the \nkind of textbooks and equipment needed? Do they have the resources from \nwhich that teacher can draw? Is there discipline there, or are there \nFederal rules and regulations hampering a teacher's ability to maintain \ndiscipline and to remove students who are disruptive from the \nclassroom?\n  Aren't those the things my colleagues hear when they talk to \nteachers? That is what they are telling me.\n  I agree with the Gorton amendment, to allow the school systems to use \nthis money--more money in this amendment than asked for by the \nPresident for education--as they see fit but without the restrictive \nrules and regulations and controls.\n  Why isn't that what we ought to be doing? Why is it that some people \nin this body have their own idea about how they have to improve \neducation and only their way is the way to have it done? I would just \nsay that this is a mistake. I believe it very strongly. We are all \nunited together in our concern to improve education. But how we do it \nis the question.\n  My wife taught for a number of years. I taught for a year. We both \nwere in the PTA. She was a volunteer teacher in the classroom to help \nteachers teach on a daily basis. I think that helps. Perhaps a program \nthat will allow local schools to help parents to participate more \ndirectly as aides to teachers on a volunteer basis may be of far more \nbenefit than adding 1 more teacher to a classroom and getting that \nnumber down from 19 to 18. Who knows for sure?\n  We know this: There is an intense reevaluation of education in \nAmerica today. There are a lot of things we don't know. But our \nsuperintendents, our principals, our State school boards, and our \nGovernors are having to answer to the American people about why they \nshould continue to give more and more money to the system when progress \nis not occurring and in fact we are showing a decline in so many \ndifferent areas in our education achievement.\n  We know that among the industrialized nations, the United States \nfinished 19th recently out of 21 countries in mathematics and lower in \nscience and technology. Something is afoot here. Mandating teachers \nwithout giving school systems a choice to improve education and \nlearning is a big mistake. I certainly share that.\n  I would like to mention a few other things we ought to think about as \nwe go through this debate.\n  The ``Washington knows best'' attitude is wrong. The federal \ngovernment funds 7 percent of the money for education in America. While \n93 percent comes from the States and local governments. That is what we \nhave always believed was correct. We have always believed that we don't \nwant a central state government educating all our children. We want our \nchildren to be educated by people we know, people who know our \nchildren's names. For the most part, that happens in America today. And \nwe ought to enhance that.\n  But what we have found is that there are 778--get this--778 Federal \neducation programs in existence today. That is a lot of programs. That \nis why the education systems are telling me: Jeff, we have to have a \nfull-time person just to fill out the paperwork in order to comply with \nthe federal regulations. This amendment by Senator Murray would add \nnumber 779, I suppose. And before the education bill goes through, we \nmay even try to add a bunch more in addition to that. But we never go \nback and eliminate those that are not proving to be effective.\n  We have also found that today only 65 cents out of every dollar we \ndedicate to education from Washington actually gets to the classrooms \nwhere the kids are and the teachers are. To me, that is not acceptable. \nIt is simply not acceptable. Too much of it is kept in Washington. That \nwhich gets down to the schools and the classrooms has so many strings \non it and regulations and so much paperwork that it is not as effective \nas it ought to be.\n  I just say this: We have 50 States in this Nation that fund 93 \npercent of the cost of education in their States. Most of these \nGovernors have made education a top priority. More and more, are doing \neverything possible to fix education in their states. We ought to give \nthem some freedom and flexibility to be innovative, creative, to fix \nand improve education, and not try to run it from up here. There is \njust no doubt about that in my mind.\n  I know we can do a better job with education. I know we can improve \nthe quality of American life. I know this for a fact: We would have \nbetter education if the Federal Government gave more money to the \nschool systems with fewer strings, fewer regulations, less redtape, and \nless bureaucracy.\n  Somewhere, some way, we need to enhance that magic moment that occurs \nin a classroom, that sublime moment when a child learns, when that \nteacher and child communicate and good things happen. Just having 789 \nprograms instead of 788 I don't believe is the right direction.\n  Slade Gorton's amendment would allow the school system to use it for \nteachers, computers, textbooks, or whatever they need. It would be \navailable for that in the same proportion the proponents of the \namendment would require. It would go to schools in the same fashion. \nBut they would be able to use it for teachers or any of the other \nthings you can imagine that would be necessary.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Gorton for his dedication and his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think one of the great things about the class size initiative that \nis so important to remember is that this money goes directly to the \nclassrooms, with no bureaucracy and one piece of paper. There is \nessentially no paperwork. This money is allocated directly. There is no \nbureaucracy and no administration cost. This money goes to the teachers \nin our classrooms. That is what so many of us believe is the right way \nto spend our Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Durbin, \nTorricelli, Mikulski, John Kerry, Boxer, Sarbanes, and Johnson be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes for the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for her very strong \nleadership on this important issue.\n  We just heard the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, talk about 779 \ndifferent programs. My friends in the Senate, we are not talking about \n779 different programs. We are talking right now about a very important \nissue. It is one issue. It is one program. It is a program that has \nplaced 29,000 teachers across this country in schools.\n  We have a bill before us that would end that program. That is what \nthe Senator from Washington State is doing. It is bad. It is bad on the \nmerits. It is bad in terms of the whole issue that has been raised here \nabout us moving forward and then turning our back on a program we just \nbegan. It is bad for the children. It is bad for these teachers.\n  If I were the Senator from Alabama, I wouldn't feel so good about \nhaving a vote that is going to result in teachers getting their pink \nslips in his State and in every State in the Union. In my particular \nState, we are talking about 4,000 teachers being given pink slips.\n  A lot of us like surprises. We like nice surprises. We don't like bad \nsurprises. This Republican bill has a surprise for the children of this \ncountry. Surprise: Many of you are going back into large classes after \nyou have spent a year getting the attention you deserve, because that \nis the impact of the Gorton amendment, and everybody on the other side \ntries to cover it up by saying: Oh, no; Senator Gorton is merely trying \nto make this thing a block grant package. It doesn't matter.\n  The Murray amendment is a fight with Senator Gorton about whether or \nnot we are going to live up to our promise. The Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, said it is a very simple form to fill out. I \nhave the form here. You have seen it before. It is a one-page form.\n  I hope no one on the other side of the aisle gets up and says what \nbureaucracy this is. They talk about 779 programs. But this is one \nprogram, one sheet of paper, a program that was praised by Republican \nDick Armey, the Majority Leader over in the House. It was praised by \nthe Republican chairman of that committee. They took all kinds of \ncredit for it. We said: Great; take credit for it. Now they are going \nto end it right here in the Senate. I have a problem with that.\n  I also have a problem with the way the bill was put together. I have \na chart. I am going to try to explain what has happened with this bill.\n  The Republicans promised to have their appropriations bills ready in \ntime. Wrong. What do they do? They left Health and Human Services, \nwhich includes education, for the last appropriations bill. I find that \ninteresting since they often say education is the highest priority. \nWhen they wrote this bill, they were short $11 billion for education.\n  We had been saying on the floor we need to make education a priority. \nDesperately, they looked around and came up with the all-time gimmick \nof the year. They said: Let's take two issues which we can argue later \nare emergency issues.\n  One is the census. I find it interesting to declare that an emergency \nsince we have known it was coming since the founding of the \nConstitution. Be that as it may, they called it an emergency. Then they \nsaid: We can say the defense budget is an emergency even though we have \nalready funded it as a nonemergency.\n  So they took the $11 billion from defense and they put it over to \neducation. Now they had a bit of a problem. They were short $11 billion \non this side of the chart. How would they replace it? Guess what, \nfolks. Social Security--Social Security had that $11 billion. They \ndecided to declare defense and the census emergencies; they took the \nmoney, by declaring them an emergency, out of Social Security and put \nit in defense. Then, something they promised they would never do \nbecause this was supposed to be locked up, we have an $11 billion IOU \nin the Social Security trust fund.\n  This was quite a maneuver, going against what the Republicans said \nthey would not do. In order to get this money, they steal from here; in \norder to get this money, they steal from there; and Social Security, \nwhich they were not going to touch, will now be owed $11 billion \nbecause that is where the emergency spending comes from. I think it is \ntime we used a little fiscal discipline and paid for things as we go. I \nthink that is the right way to go.\n  Some Members say one good thing about this, they do have $11 billion \nfor education. I say right, but even within that, they zero out the \nteachers in the school program. They have the money now, but they take \nit away, and in their appropriations bill they set up a whole new \nprogram that no one has ever heard of called teachers assistance. We \ndon't know what it is or what form it will take. We don't know if it \nwill be authorized.\n  The Senator from Washington says if it isn't authorized, we will \nfigure a way to give the schools a block grant. This is an important \nissue. The Senator from Alabama gets up and says: I don't understand \nhow we in the Federal Government know what people want.\n  Maybe he doesn't know what his people want, but I know what my people \nwant. I ran two tough elections for the Senate. One of the biggest \nissues was education; within that, putting more teachers in the \nschools, afterschool programs, and school construction. My Republican \nopponent was against me on every single issue. My election was based on \nissues.\n  I say to my friend from Alabama, yes, I know what the people in my \nState want. I am proud to know that. I didn't come here to give my \nresponsibility to someone else.\n  Today, in the Public Works Committee we honored a great President, \nDwight Eisenhower. We named a building after him. I was thrilled to \nvote for it. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, the first \nPresident to say there is a function and a role for the Federal \nGovernment in public education. He outlined it in the National Defense \nEducation Act. It amazes me when Republicans stand up and say this is \nsome radical idea. It came from one of their leaders whom I greatly \nadmire. We are doing too little for the schools, not too much.\n\n  I don't want to be a party to children in school being told they have \nto leave a class of 15 or 20 and return to a class of 35 or 40. That is \nwhat will happen with the Gorton amendment. Senator Murray is right on \ntarget in her fight. It stuns me that we are dealing with this \nsituation. As Senator Kennedy said, all the Republicans, a year ago \nwhen we funded this program, not only praised it but took credit for \nit.\n  I ask, is anyone writing to complain about this program? No. The \nlocal districts want this program to continue. They want the certainty \nof this program to continue. They want the smaller class sizes to \ncontinue. Even with this $11 billion that they will eventually take out \nof Social Security and place in here, they ignore teachers in the \nclassroom. They underfund afterschool programs by $200 million under \nthe President's proposal. That will leave a lot of children out in the \ncold, tens and tens of thousands. I will have an amendment on that.\n  The crumbling schools initiative is as if every school is beautiful. \nI have been to schools where the tiles are falling off the ceilings. \nYes, they put in the $11 billion, but they are not spending it in ways \nthat the people in our country want Congress to spend it. Education is \na priority. We all say it; we ought to mean it.\n  In conclusion, my friends talk as if the schools are forced to apply \nfor this program. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not \na mandate to put teachers in the school. This is Congress responding to \na request to help put more teachers in the school. It is a one-page \nform. With one vote, we can do away with a great program. I hope we \nwill follow the leadership of Senator Murray and Senator Kennedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Jeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Gorton amendment \nNo. 1805; there is also pending the Murray amendment. There are two \namendments pending.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, everyone should realize \nthis is\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\nthe year we start reevaluating the educational programs of this \ncountry. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for \nreauthorization. This is most comprehensive. It is the one bill we look \nat to try and get guidance from the Federal Government in the area of \nelementary and secondary education.\n  There are many things we must be concerned about. One of those has \nbeen raised by the Senator from Washington--class size. There are many \nother issues to be involved. In addition, this is an attempt to \nauthorize on an appropriations bill. It is not the time. The time is \nwhen we take up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have \nbegun doing that. The committee has been very active. We held over 20 \nhearings on what should be done to make the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act more successful.\n  This Nation, as everyone has articulated, is in an educational crisis \nsituation. We have many wonderful schools and many wonderful teachers, \nbut relative to our competition in other areas of the world, we could \nbe doing much better. The question is, What do we do and how do we do \nit? On the 23rd of June this year, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee held a hearing on the class size proposal. We have \nhad this under review. Statements were heard from an expert panel of \nwitnesses who offered an array of views on the merits of creating a \nFederal program that mandated local communities use funds to lower \nclass sizes.\n  We examined important issues, including the impact of reducing class \nsize on student achievement and other factors impacting student \nachievement; the tension between quantity and quality with respect to \nhiring teachers; whether large class sizes are the biggest obstacle to \nimproving student achievement; and the value and role of schoolteachers \nin making decisions for providing the best education to young people in \ntheir schools.\n  What did the witnesses who came before the Committee have to say? Dr. \nEric Hanushek, a respected professor at the University of Rochester \nstated, for the record:\n\n       a move to mandate smaller classes . . .  is misguided and \n     could even hurt students and student achievement; . . .  the \n     accumulated evidence on the impact of reduced class size on \n     student performance gives no reason to expect that the \n     current wave of class size reduction will have an overall \n     effect on student achievement; and that class size is very \n     expensive and takes resource and attention away from \n     potentially more productive reform efforts.\n\n  He based his views on extensive research and historical evidence. In \nU.S. history, between 1965 and 1995, pupil-teacher ratios have fallen \nfrom 25:1 to 17:1 yet performance on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress (NAEP) has remained roughly constant. That \nproduces no evidence that class size makes a difference. He noted that \nwhile pupil-teacher ratios are defined somewhat differently than class-\nsize, the two measures do move together. International comparisons \nsuggest no relationship between pupil-teacher ratios and student \nperformance. So in Europe their studies show the same as reported in \nours: It doesn't make a difference. In looking at some 300 advanced \nstatistical studies, the studies show an equal number of studies that \nsuggest positive improvements as suggest negative effects.\n  We also heard from Dr. Randy Ross, who spoke not from a research-\nbased perspective but from the heart and common sense. He has witnessed \nthe results of class size reduction efforts in California first hand \nand is concerned about what he saw. He stated:\n\n       A wholesale reduction in the sizes of classes in schools \n     throughout a state predictably nibbles away at the chances \n     that students in poor, inner city neighborhoods will get a \n     better education.\n\n  He watched the better teachers in low-income neighborhoods be lured \naway to higher paying suburban schools, leaving the inner-city schools \nto fill vacancies which those individuals that did not make the cut in \nother school districts. It is a policy that has hurt students, not \nhelped them.\n  At this same hearing, we talked at length about the Innovative \nEducation Program Strategies, or title VI of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. Witnesses on that panel told us how states and \nlocal education agencies are improving student achievement by investing \nin reform efforts, education technology, professional development, \nschool library activities, and support for at-risk students. I would \nargue that investing in any one of these activities may have a more \nprofound and significant impact on helping students achieve at higher \nlevels than mandating that a local school hire one more ``teacher''--\nqualified or not.\n  Let's not forget our common sense in this debate. My common sense \nsays the quality of the teacher does matter. Common sense tells me that \nlocal leaders in schools across the country have the student's best \ninterest at heart and must have a say in implementing programs that \nwill provide the greatest benefit to their students. If class size \nreduction is the greatest need in a community, we can all rest assured \nthat local leaders throughout the country will direct their portion of \nthe $1.2 billion made available in this bill to that effort. There is \nno need for my colleagues to worry.\n  If on the other hand, local leaders have other ideas for ways to \nvastly improve the educational opportunities of young people in their \ncommunities, in their classrooms, I think we should provide them with \nsome flexibility to do what is best for the student, and what is best \nin accordance with that community.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd \nand Senator Harkin be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kelly Green \nKahn, a fellow in my office, be given the privilege of the floor during \nthe remainder of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin my brief remarks by commending \nour colleague from the State of Washington for her leadership on this \nissue once again. She has, on numerous occasions over the last few \nyears, raised the issue of class size as one critical to improving the \nquality of public education in the country, and she is doing so again \nthis afternoon with the introduction of this amendment. I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor and hope we can build strong bipartisan support for it.\n  There is no question that the size of a class, the number of students \nin a classroom, and academic performance bear a correlation. My State \nof Connecticut has one of the lowest ratios between teachers and \nstudents in the United States. The most recent statistics indicate that \nclass size in Connecticut hovers just over 20 students per class. A \ncouple of States actually are lower, but the national average is around \n25--about 5 additional students per class.\n  Also, we in Connecticut make other investments in education. We pay \nour teachers well. We also have led the nation in the adoption of high \nstandards for student performance measured with the Connecticut Mastery \nTest and with support for whole school reform. I note this, because it \nis these investments that have shown such dividends in Connecticut. It \nis no mystery that we end up, in national surveys, at the top in the \ncountry in academic performance.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues this morning noted in the \nWashington Post an article entitled ``Students Weak In Essay Skills.'' \nThe top State in performance was Connecticut, by a margin of some 12 \npercentage points, in essays by 4th graders, 8th graders, and 12th \ngraders.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 29, 1999]\n\n                     Students Weak in Essay Skills\n\n                         (By Kenneth J. Cooper)\n\n       Three-quarters of the nation's school-children are unable \n     to compose a well-organized, coherent essay, a skill \n     frequently demanded in the modern workplace, according to \n     results of a federally sponsored writing test released \n     yesterday.\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\n       Most students tested last year managed to get across their \n     main, simple points in the short essays they were asked to \n     write, but their writing did not have the sophistication to \n     meet the standard for proficiency set by a national board of \n     educators, state officials and business leaders.\n       The test results from a representative sample of 60,000 \n     students in the fourth, eighth and 12th grades provided \n     another source of concern about the condition of the nation's \n     schools and follows similar results showing students falling \n     short of new academic standards in the states.\n       ``The average, or typical, American student is not a \n     proficient writer. Instead, students show only partial \n     mastery of the knowledge and skills needed for a solid \n     academic performance in writing,'' said Gary W. Phillips, \n     acting commissioner of education statistics.\n       The testing found that girls wrote better than boys in each \n     grade, in keeping with the outcome of earlier, less demanding \n     versions of the test. The gender gap in writing skill was \n     large: Twice as many girls reached or exceeded the standard \n     for proficient writing.\n       There was also a gap in the performance of different racial \n     and ethnic groups, with white and Asian students writing \n     better than African Americans, Hispanics and Native \n     Americans. That gap was narrower in schools on military \n     bases, where African American and Hispanic students scored \n     higher than their counterparts elsewhere. Analysts suggested \n     minority students benefited from an equitable distribution of \n     resources at the Defense Department schools and the financial \n     security of military families.\n       For the first time, it was possible to make comparisons of \n     writing skill in the states. Of 35 states where 100,000 \n     additional eighth-graders were tested, Connecticut led the \n     nation, followed by Massachusetts, Maine and Texas. Virginia \n     was one of eight states above the national average, while \n     Maryland fell slightly below average. The District had the \n     lowest score of any jurisdiction except the Virgin Islands.\n       Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional Education \n     Board, suggested that Virginia did well in writing because a \n     large percentage of the state's students attend solid \n     suburban schools in Northern Virginia, and state residents \n     have above-average income, an advantage shared by many \n     high scorers.\n       Top scorer Connecticut has the highest per capita income in \n     the nation and has tested students in four grades in writing \n     since 1985. ``What you test is what you get,'' said Marilyn \n     Whirry, a high school English teacher in California.\n       Musick and Whirry are members of the board that governs the \n     National Assessment of Educational Progress, a \n     congressionally mandated series of tests that provides the \n     best measure of student achievement in the country. Last \n     year's writing test had a higher standard than one \n     administered in 1992, making comparisons between them \n     unreliable, testing officials warned.\n       Students had 25 minutes to compose one of three different \n     types of essays--narrative, informative, persuasive. The \n     expected standard of proficiency was reached by 22 percent of \n     fourth-graders, 26 percent of eighth-graders and 21 percent \n     of high school seniors.\n       In an example of proficient writing by a senior, a girl \n     told an imaginative story about falling in love and marrying \n     another Italian immigrant who died after the birth of their \n     four children. ``As I gaze out my window, I turn look at my \n     hand still wearing that same gold ring from so many years \n     ago. I smile because I know I don't need to bring him back. . \n     . . I never really lost him,'' the girl concluded the five-\n     paragraph essay.\n       The National Center of Education Statistics said her essay \n     was well-organized ``and shows good command of stylistic \n     elements and control of language.''\n       Whirry said seniors ``had the most trouble with persuasive \n     writing . . . a serious problem because persuading a reader \n     to take a course of action or bring about a certain change is \n     enormously important, not just to get ahead on the job, but \n     also to make sound decisions in our democratic society.''\n       Most students demonstrated basic writing skills--able to \n     make simple points but not put together sophisticated \n     sentences. Writing at this level were 61 percent of fourth-\n     graders, 57 percent of eighth-graders and 56 percent of \n     seniors.\n       Incomprehensible essays were produced by 16 percent of \n     fourth- and eighth-graders and 22 percent of seniors.\n       In each grade, 1 percent of the students were writing at \n     the highest level.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This news follows on reports earlier this year that \nindicate Connecticut students lead the nation in reading performance \nand in math and science.\n  In my state, we have invested in class size, we have invested in \nteachers. As a result of that, we are getting this kind of academic \nperformance. Not everywhere in the state, performs at these high levels \nand frankly even in the most affluent parts of my state, too many \nchildren fail to reach the advanced levels of performance that we know \nwill be needed to succeed in the next century.\n  What we are suggesting today is, if this works for children, and all \nthe studies as well as the experiences of states like mine suggest, \nthen we should be helping all communities to achieve these smaller \nclass sizes that will help their children succeed.\n  If this amendment is defeated and this appropriations bill is passed \nwithout the inclusion of the Murray amendment, it is tantamount to this \nbody giving a pink slip to 29,000 teachers in America. Pay attention to \nthis debate today. We will vote at about 4 p.m. If this body rejects \nthis amendment, then 29,000 teachers will know, as of this date in \nSeptember, their services are no longer needed in the classrooms of \nAmerica.\n  If anyone believes that by having more students and fewer teachers, \nwe are going to improve the quality of public education in this \ncountry, they are living in a dream world. That is not the way we are \ngoing to raise the level of excellence, whether it is essay writing, \nmath performance--all the academic criteria we seek to improve.\n  One thing is for certain. If we continue to have fewer teachers and \nlarger classes, we can almost guarantee the results. We will have \ndeclining academic performance.\n  Clearly, there are other important issues in education. We are not \narguing that we do not need high quality teachers--in fact, this is \nwhat this amendment supports, or that after school and other efforts \nare not needed. But the central component of education is what happens \nin the classroom. And any teacher in any school in this country will \ntell you that if they have to manage 20, 23, 25, 30, 35 students in a \nclassroom, they cannot teach. I don't care how good you are, you cannot \nmanage 25 or 30 students in a classroom. You cannot teach young \nchildren the fundamentals of reading, math and science if forced to \ndeal with this number of children.\n  So this amendment, the Murray amendment, is critically important if \nyou care about this issue. You cannot go around and say, I care about \neducation, I am a strong supporter of it, and then walk away from class \nsize as an issue. I hope when this amendment comes for a vote, people \nwill get behind it.\n  By the way, about block grants, we have been down this road in the \npast. Suggesting somehow if we throw it in a block grant program, it \nwould suddenly all work. I hoped we would have learned the lesson by \nnow. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. There is no \naccountability for how federal dollars are spent; too often in the \npast, we have found these dollars ending up in athletic programs, in \nadministrative accounts and in other such expenditures. State and local \ndollars are not targeted to areas with great need unlike federal \ndollars. Block grants don't work because the politics are not there for \nit at the state and local level or else the states would already be \nspending their dollars this way.\n  So, yes, we bear a national responsibility. We are a national \nlegislature. We try to speak for our country on these issues. I am from \nConnecticut. Maybe I should not care what happens in Mississippi, \nAlabama, or New Mexico, but I do. I do not think I am wrong because I \ndo care. I think if a child in Mississippi or Alabama is in too large a \nclass, I suffer, my constituents in Connecticut suffer.\n  The idea that somehow we are 50 disparate States and we do not have \nto worry about it, we hope each State chooses the right priorities, is \nducking our responsibility as a national legislature. When a crying gap \nexists in an area such as this, we bear a collective responsibility to \naddress it and a block grant program just does not do it.\n  So I hope that we can all join together to support the Murray \namendment and this flexible program that supports high quality \nteachers, targets lowest income areas and sends all the money down to \nthe local level. It is what parents across the country are calling for \nand voters support and I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  This amendment is just the first of several efforts we will have \nduring the next hours and days to improve the quality of the bill \nbefore us. While there are certainly things to be praised in the \nefforts of Senator Harkin and Senator Specter, this bill falls short in \nother ways. Even as we debate it, I understand that exactly how it is \npaid for is still unclear--we know there will be significant advance \nfunding, potentially additional Defense items will be\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\ndeclared emergencies freeing up more budget authority and outlays.\n  One of the most disturbing offsets contained in the bill is the \nreduction in the Social Services Block Grant, Title XX, which is \nslashed almost in half. This flexible program supports local efforts \nlike meals on wheels, child care, adult day care, foster care, child \nabuse protection, programs for those with disabilities and other local \nefforts to respond to the neediest in our communities. How does it make \nsense to cut this program to pay for other programs for those in need?\n  I believe we should also do better by way of funding for afterschool, \nliteracy training, school construction and child care. On this last \nitem, later in the day, Senator Jeffords and I will be offering an \namendment on the Child Care Development Block Grant Program to increase \nfunding for this critical program funding to $2 billion. My colleagues \nhave been so good on this issue over the last year. We have had \noverwhelming votes on this question over and over again this year.\n  Clearly we know child care is grossly underfunded. Many States have \nresponded to this underfunding and set very low income eligibility \nlevels: Two-thirds of the States have income levels of $25,000 or less; \n14 States, $20,000; 8 States are even more stringent. Wyoming, Alabama, \nMissouri, Kentucky, Iowa, South Carolina, and West Virginia cut off \nsubsidies for child care for families earning more than $17,000. I do \nnot know how a family earning $17,000 a year can afford child care, \nwhich for an infant or toddler can run nearly half of that amount. And \nthis program is not just about child care for young children; nearly 30 \npercent of these funds go to support afterschool programs.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues, when that amendment is raised, will be \nsupportive of it. They have been helpful in the past. I apologize for \ncoming back to the issue. We had a good provision adopted in the tax \nbill, but it was dropped in conference, and the bill was vetoed. I \napologize for coming back to child care over and over, but we have as \nyet been able to adopt the provisions my colleagues voted for on \nnumerous occasions. I hope they do so again when Senator Jeffords and I \noffer the amendment.\n  But let's move forward, Mr. President. Let's consider and adopt the \nMurray amendment. Let's move on to hopefully improve this bill. But \nlet's get on with the people's business.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 1 additional minute and yield to my colleague \nfrom New Jersey for any comments he may have.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator 3 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  On the question of education in America, there are both those \nexhilarated by our progress and those who are frustrated by our \nfailures. It really is a tale of two cities: America has the finest \nuniversities in the world, the best colleges, proof that we know how to \neducate and build institutions. However, we have secondary and grade \nschools which simply, by any accounting, are not making the grade.\n  Forty percent of our fourth graders failed to attain basic levels of \nreading; 40 percent of eighth graders could not attain basic levels of \nmath; and 76 percent do not even reach proficiency levels.\n  The fact is, we are not meeting an international standard. We are \ndebating the fact that there is an educational crisis, but, if \nunaddressed, it will in our own generation become an economic crisis.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is correct: There are schools in my \nState of New Jersey for which I have enormous pride. Many are \nsucceeding. But in the world in which we live today and our economy, if \nschools are failing in Alabama or California or New York or some \ndistant community in New Jersey, it is as much your problem as it is \nmine. It is an economic difficulty, a social difficulty, at some point \nin our country's history, even a political difficulty if unaddressed.\n  The truth of the matter is, our country suffers some from a false \nsense of complacency. Parents come to me and say: Senator, I don't \nunderstand your concern. The schools are as good as I remember them 40 \nyears ago. Or, I think the schools in my community are as good as the \nschools in the community that is next to us.\n  That, I say to my friends, is not the point. The point is whether our \nschools are as good as countries halfway around the world.\n  A national education testing service recently concluded that in math \nand science our students were 19 out of 21. We do not need to compare \nour schools with ones we remember as children. We need to compare them \nwith schools in Germany and Japan, and we are not meeting that \nstandard.\n  I know every Senator has a different idea about what we should do \nabout American education, and the truth is, they are all right. There \nis no one answer. Senator Coverdell and I had an innovative program to \nbring private money to help private and public schools. There are \nothers who have a variety of different answers. They are all part of \nthe solution. But no one can construct a solution that does not involve \nthe hiring of teachers. Your ideas may be right, but this idea is \ncentral.\n  The Department of Education estimates we will need 2 million new \nteachers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Department of Education estimates we will need 2 \nmillion new teachers in the next decade. In my State of New Jersey, \nthat is 109,000 teachers currently in shortage. When schools started \nthis year in the city of Newark, there were 200 classrooms without \nteachers available. You can have your idea about American education, \nbut the debate starts here. Empty classrooms, overcrowded classrooms, \nretiring teachers are not part of the formula for American educational \nor economic success.\n\n  The fact is, if we did not have massive retirements, if there were \nnot already shortages, we would still need Senator Murray's amendment.\n  The Department of Education in May 1998 also concluded that the one \nprincipal variable that we know in improving education in America is \nclass size. Educational Testing Services found that smaller class sizes \nraised achievement from fourth to eighth grade students, it reduced \ndrop-out rates, and increased performance. It is the one variable we \nknow that works.\n  The strange thing about this debate, as the Senator from Connecticut \nhas pointed out, is that a year ago, as Democrats and Republicans on \nthis Senate floor, we accepted these arguments and we endorsed this \nprogram. For the last year, Democrats and Republicans, with pride, have \nnoted that we spent $1.2 billion hiring 29,000 teachers to begin \ndealing with this educational crisis. You were proud of it, and we were \nproud of it.\n  I have not heard a single Senator come to this floor and say: You \nknow those 29,000 teachers, they failed. They did not show up to work, \nthey were not trained, the teachers did not perform, the students did \nnot perform. No evidence, no argument, not even a contention, because \nit was not a failure. It worked.\n  But is this the extent of our national commitment? We deal with an \neducational crisis, and every Member of the Senate knows the greatest \nvariable in America's economic future is the quality of education, and \nthe sum total of our commitment as a Senate is 1 year for 29,000 \nteachers in a nation of a quarter of a billion people. That is quite a \ncommitment, and now we are going to abandon the effort.\n  The strange thing about this is, this is not the first time the \nUnited States has had an educational crisis. One of the proudest things \nI know in the 20th century history of this country is that between 1890 \nand 1920, the United States of America opened a new high school every \nsingle day. That is a commitment. We did it through war, depression, \nrecession, and stagnant economic growth.\n  Now the United States is experiencing the greatest economic growth in \nour Nation's history, nearly full employment and a budget surplus, and \nthe response of this Congress is a 1-year\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\nprogram of $1.2 billion to hire 29,000 teachers, and a year later we \nare going to fire them. Quite a commitment; quite a source of pride.\n  I know the alternative program is to return, instead, to block \ngrants. Never in my experience has so much authority been given to \npeople. I came to the Senate to deal with issues and national problems, \nnot to give that authority to somebody else.\n  There is a national educational crisis. It requires the hiring of \nteachers on a national scale, and that is our responsibility. If the \njudgment of this Senate is simply to send money to the States and let \nthem decide whether they want new football teams, more buses, athletic \nfields, or science teachers, hire an accounting firm and get rid of the \nCongress, not the teachers. That is not why I came to the Senate.\n  Senator Murray's amendment is not the end of the debate on education \nquality in America. It is not the completion of a national program, it \nis the defense of a national program that started last year. It should \nbe continued. And for her leadership on this issue, the Senator from \nWashington has both my respect and admiration. I urge the Members of \nthe Senate to follow her lead.\n\n  Education should not be a partisan issue in the United States. Every \nschoolchild in America would benefit in a competition between Democrats \nand Republicans for educational leadership. I do not want to see that \nceded to my party. Indeed, I hope we can all join in it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, those of us who strongly supported an \nincreased Federal investment in education should be celebrating this \nlegislation, not criticizing it. Let's look at the numbers.\n  The committee's appropriation for total education spending is $1.9 \nbillion more than for fiscal year 1999. It is a half billion dollars \nmore than the President's request. Let me repeat that because I think \nthat has been lost in this debate. The fact is, the Appropriations \nCommittee has increased total education funding in this bill by a half \nbillion dollars more than President Clinton requested.\n  Similarly, the committee has increased spending for Pell grants--an \nessential program that I strongly support--for title I, for special \neducation--I could go on and on.\n  So it is clear that this debate is not about money. What is it about? \nIt is about power. It is about command and control. It is about who \nwill be making the decisions and where they will be made.\n  Let's look at the language of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Washington, Mr. Gorton. It says: School districts may use the \nfunds for class size reductions or for any other authorized activity in \nthe ESEA that will improve the academic achievement of our students.\n  Who could be opposed to that? Isn't that the bottom line? Isn't that \nwhat we want--improved academic achievement, better results for our \nstudents?\n  So the question before the Senate is whether we should continue with \nthe Washington-knows-best, arrogant attitude or whether we should \nrecognize that our local school boards, our principals, our teachers, \nand our parents are best able to determine what local students need to \nimprove their performance.\n\n  The question--the bottom line--should be: What have our students \nlearned? Have they improved? It should not be: How did you spend your \nFederal grant? Did you fill out the paperwork correctly?\n  In some school districts, smaller class size may be what is needed. \nBut in others, we may need to upgrade the science lab or institute a \nprogram for gifted and talented students or hire more teachers. The \nneeds vary as much as our schools vary. A one-size-fits-all approach \nsimply does not work.\n  The Senator from Connecticut mentioned an article in today's \nnewspaper which has the startling results that nationally three-fourths \nof the students cannot compose an organized essay. I am pleased to note \nthat my State of Maine ranks near the top--No. 2 only to Connecticut--\nin performance on this test. But nationwide, three-quarters of the \nstudents failed this simple test.\n  Is the answer the same in every State? I do not think so. In some \nStates, improved professional development for the teachers may be the \nkey to reversing these test results. In other States, it may be smaller \nclasses. Yet in another State it may be another technique or method or \nsolution that is required.\n  The point is that we do not know here in Washington what the best \napproach is in the thousands of school districts across this country. \nAll we are saying is, let the local school districts decide what they \nneed to do to improve student achievement.\n  There is nothing in Senator Gorton's amendment that prohibits the \nschool district from using the money to reduce class size if that is \nwhat is needed. But that may not be what is needed. Indeed, 41 States \nalready exceed the ideal teacher-student ratio.\n  What we need to do is to trust local people to make the decisions \nthat are going to help bring out the best in the students in our \ncommunities across the United States. That is exactly what Senator \nGorton's amendment would do.\n  This is not a debate about money. All of us agree that we want to \nincrease the Federal investment in education. It is the best investment \nof our money we can make. The issue is about who is making the \ndecision.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we pointed out earlier, this \nlegislation is a voluntary program. Each local education agency that \ndesires to receive the funds shall include the application. So it is \ncompletely voluntary. I know it has been repeated time and time again \nthat the Federal Government is imposing this on the local school \ndistricts. But it is the local school district who has to make the \njudgment, who has to fill out the application. All the money goes to \nthe local school district. Under the Gorton amendment, 15 percent goes \nto the bureaucracy. So let's be accurate in our description of this \nproposal.\n  Then let's also be accurate that this concept was basically endorsed \nby all the Republican leadership in the last Congress. Congressman \nGoodling, Congressman Dick Armey, and Senator Gorton claimed credit for \nthis proposal. We understand that. They claimed credit for the Murray \namendment when it was accepted in the last Congress.\n  Just a final point I want to make. I think it is fair to say: One, if \nthey want to do all the things the Senator from Maine has pointed out \nand you want an additional block grant, I agree with the Senator from \nMinnesota, if they want to get additional funds, I will vote for it. If \nthe State of Maine wants to do it, that is all well and good. We are \ntalking about limited resources targeted on national needs.\n  The question is whether this program works. The Senator from \nWashington has said time and time again that it does. And with all the \nresponses on the other side, no one has questioned the various reports \nthat demonstrate that children have made progress--no one, none; \nsilence.\n  You can give all the cliches about one size fits all and all the \nrest, but just respond to the various STAR report conclusions, such as: \n7,000 students in 80 Tennessee schools. Students in small classes \nperformed better than students in large classes in each grade from \nkindergarten through third grade.\n  Talk to Maria Caruso, an elementary school teacher in Lawrenceburg \nElementary School in Lawrenceburg, TN, who talks about what a \ndifference it makes in all the years that she has been teaching, having \nthe smaller class size, what a difference it has made in the quality of \nthe education for the children in the Lawrenceburg Elementary School. \nOr talk to Jacqueline van\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\nWulven a veteran teacher from the Cole Elementary School in Nashville, \nTN, who said:\n\n       These students come into third grade far more advanced \n     academically than any other third grade class I have taught. \n     There were very few behavior problems with a small class. The \n     students worked well together, and I was able to provide many \n     different learning experiences because I did not have to \n     spend so much time disciplining the class.\n\n  Sandy Heinrich from Granbery Elementary School in Davidson County, \nTN: ``I have been a teacher for 29 years and have never had an \nexperience like I have had with the smaller class size.'' These are the \nteachers. Respond to these teachers.\n\n  All we are saying is, if the local community wants to try and \nreplicate what has been tried and tested and demonstrated to produce \nenhanced academic achievement and accomplishment, that is the Murray \namendment. They are already doing it in communities across the country, \nbased upon last year's commitment. All we are saying is, let's continue \nit.\n  Two million teachers will be needed over the next 10 years. We are \ngetting 100,000 teachers a year normally. We need to recruit an \nadditional 100,000, to handle rising enrollments. The Republicans say, \nno, no, to the additional teachers. With their proposal, they will \neliminate close to 30,000 school teachers across this country. Does \nthat make any sense at all? It does not.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program \nis helping to reduce class size in grades K to 3 in low-income. A study \nfound that the students in smaller classes had significantly greater \nimprovements in reading and math and language than students in bigger \nclasses.\n  In Flint, MI, efforts over the last three years to reduce class size \nin K-3 have produced a 44 percent increase in reading scores, an 18 \npercent increase in math scores.\n  This issue is not about power. It is about partnership, partnership \nbetween the local communities, the States, and the Federal Government. \nWe should insist on the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted with the debate thus far because it \nreally does come down to some pretty important concepts as to how we \nbest approach a problem that I believe is the most threatening we have \ntoday, as we look into the decade, the next century; that is, the \neducation of our children.\n  As has been said again and again, we are failing. We are absolutely \nfailing today. If we look at our education for kindergarten through the \ntwelfth grade, statistics have been given. Let me review those. This is \nthe fourth grade. This is the eighth grade. This is the twelfth. This \nlooks at just mathematics. We could put science, math, reading, \nEnglish, any number of things in these columns.\n  Each of these green bars--it is hard to read--is a country. The red \nbar is the United States of America. That is our performance in the \nfourth grade in mathematics compared to Singapore, South Korea, Hong \nKong, Austria, Slovenia, Ireland, Australia. You can see in the fourth \ngrade, we are at about that level, about seventh or eighth.\n  In the eighth grade--the longer you stay in school--in mathematics, \nwe drop further. And by the time you get to the twelfth grade--the \nblack line is the average--you can see we fall below the average in the \neighth grade. In the twelfth grade, we are down further.\n  People agree with the data. That is the good thing about this debate. \nOn both sides of the aisle we have come forward and said we have to \nact. Indeed, there are things we do have a Federal responsibility to do \nin education; that is, to reverse these trends in this global \nmarketplace. These are our children; these are our investment in the \nfuture.\n  The difference is in approach. It is very important the American \npeople understand the difference in approach. It boils down to these \ntwo amendments. On the one hand, we have an amendment which says we \nhave a new program, a new answer, a program we need to grow that will \nmake a big difference with the resources we provide.\n  On our side of the aisle, Senator Gorton has basically said, that is \none approach, but why not take essentially the same resources and \nrecognize that every school is going to have a different problem, maybe \neven every classroom a different problem. It is absurd for us to think \nthat in Washington, DC, we can dictate what is needed in a rural school \nin Alamo, TN, or an urban school in Memphis or in Nashville.\n  Let's take the same resources and instead of telling them they need \nmore teachers, say take those same resources; maybe you need better \ntrained teachers or maybe you need to hook a computer up to the T-1 \nline outside or maybe you need to buy computers or more textbooks. You \ndecide. Maybe you need more teachers. Use the money for that. Two \ndifferent approaches.\n  This is what we have today, and it is failing. We all recognize it is \nfailing. These are the Government programs, the Federal Government \nprograms on the outside. The Department of Health and Human Services \nhas education programs aimed at the beneficiaries of our school system \ntoday--at-risk and delinquent youth is one group; young children is \nanother group; teachers. You could put any number of groups. The school \nis down here. Any number.\n  The point is, we have heard the figure 480. It might be 250; it might \nbe 300. The point is, we have hundreds of these Federal programs all \naimed at different populations, and it is not working. It is failing.\n\n  What our side of the aisle says is that we can identify the problems, \nbut with 87,000 different schools out there, let's let that school, \nthat schoolteacher, that superintendent, that principal, those parents \ncome to the table and say this is what we need and, with the resources \nwe make available through the Gorton amendment, use those resources. It \nmight be more teachers. It might be better prepared teachers. It might \nbe an afterschool program. It might be hooking up a computer or it \nmight be better textbooks. They decide at the local level. That is the \ndifference between our side of the aisle and the other side. The \nRepublican, the Gorton approach is basically saying, identify the needs \nlocally and come together and decide.\n  The Murray amendment says more teachers. Indeed, we have made \nprogress. In 1970, we had 22 pupils per teacher. In 1997, it is 17 \npupils per teacher nationwide. That is some progress. Again, I am not \ngoing to diminish the importance of that. What I do want to say is that \nlocal identification of needs, that local flexibility is more likely to \ngive you the answer to better education than us telling a community \nwhether or not they may need a teacher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment and \ndefeat the Murray amendment for the reasons of flexibility and \naccountability at the local level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington \nhas 13 minutes 49 seconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 30 minutes \n44 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend our colleagues who are \nconcerned about bureaucracy. That is one of the great things about the \nclass size initiative. It was passed in a bipartisan manner last year. \nOne form, one page takes one administrator a few minutes to fill out, \nand the class size money goes directly to hire teachers. Our Federal \ntax dollars go to pay for the teacher in the classroom--no bureaucracy, \nno big charts. The money goes to make a difference. That is why we \nbelieve it is the right way to go.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Murray, who has done such a great job on this issue, for \nyielding time. I rise in strong support of her amendment.\n  My State and our Nation are on the verge of an education crisis. At \nthe end of the last school year, test scores showed that half of New \nYork's fourth grade students could barely handle basic written and oral \nwork.\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\n  If you look at the studies, what is one of the best ways to remedy \nthat? It is the method of the Murray amendment--to reduce class size. \nIf her amendment is not passed, in New York State, 3,497 teachers in \nthe next fiscal year will get pink slips. Why are we doing that?\n  We have a program that works. It is reducing class size. The same \nthings were said about the Cops on the Beat Program, the 100,000 \npolice, that it wouldn't work or needed targets or would create \nbureaucracy. It has helped bring crime rates way down.\n  Now we have a chance to do the same thing for education. It makes \nsuch eminent sense to support a proposal that is aimed at the heart of \nthe problem: too many students; not enough teachers.\n  Instead, what the alternative amendment proposes, the Republican \namendment, is a block grant. Instead of saying make sure the money goes \ninto the classroom, it says, if the local school board wants to fritter \nit away on something that is much less necessary than good, new \nteachers, let them do it.\n  I have never understood the zealotry on behalf of block grant \nproposals.\n  It is classic good sense to say when you take the people who tax you \nand the people who spend the money and separate them, money is going to \nbe wasted. When the taxing authority is separated from the spending \nauthority, the people spending it didn't have to go through the sweat \nof bringing those dollars in, and they waste it. Every block grant \nprogram we have seen, when audited, shows huge amounts of waste. \nCertain school districts will use that money for all sorts of programs \nthat are not necessary. Some, I argue, would be laughed at.\n  Then we will hear people from both sides of the aisle come back and \nsay: Oh, we should cut this program because it is wasteful. To start \nout with, let's make it work. If you ask educators what is the No. 1 \nplace to put dollars, it is teachers.\n  I would like anyone on the other side to tell me what is more \nimportant than teachers. Why give the local authority the ability to \ntake money away from teachers and give it somewhere else--to \nbureaucracy, or to waste, or to things that might be necessary but not \nas necessary as teachers?\n  There will be 3,497 teachers in New York State who will get pink \nslips if the Murray amendment does not pass. The number is \nproportionate in your own States.\n  How are you going to look teachers and, more importantly, young \nstudents in the eye and say, ``Well, I had this ideological concept, \nand the teacher is going to be fired?''\n  Yes, we must spend more on education. I am completely sure of that \nview. But we must spend it intelligently. We must spend it rigorously. \nWe must spend it with standards. To just throw money at the problem, as \nwe have learned in school district after school district, will not \nsolve the problem.\n  The wisdom we have accumulated about education goes into the Murray \namendment because we know that smaller class size increases reading \nscores and increases math scores.\n  We hear a lot of criticism. I heard my good friend from Tennessee \ncriticize the education system. Then he is giving money to the same \npeople who are being criticized for not doing a good enough job.\n  Are we going to have leadership? Are we going to show America that we \nknow what needs to be done, or are we going to hide behind the \ndefensive measure that nobody really has any heart for, which will not \nmaximize our bang for the buck?\n  There is, indeed, an educational crisis in America. There is, indeed, \nan anxiety among the people of our great land that our educational \nsystem doesn't measure up to the 21st century. Last year, in a \nbipartisan way this Congress had the courage to begin to address that \nissue at its core: Too few teachers for a growing number of students. \nLet us not take a step backward and reverse that. Let us support the \nMurray amendment.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, some of you will not \nthink what I am going to tell you is even possible. But, believe it or \nnot, before I went to law school, I was a schoolteacher. I taught \nmathematics in junior high school in the public school system. I loved \nit. I had a class in the morning that was made up of half the students \nwho didn't know how to add 6 and 6--they were in the eighth grade--and \nhalf the students who were ready for geometry.\n  I guarantee that if the U.S. Government, back when we were trying to \nteach in Albuquerque, NM, in Garfield Junior High, said, We want to \ngive you the same program as we give a junior high school in New York \nCity, do you think I would have jumped to it and said, Give it to me? \nOf course I would not have. I would have said, What is it for? Then I \nwould have said, Won't you let me use it for what I know the kids need \nor are you going to tell me what they need?\n  In essence, that little classroom and that little example is a \nmicrocosm of this issue. This issue across this land is whether or not \nthe U.S. Government can help a failing education system with more \ntargeted programs--more programs that say, use it our way in every way \nor you don't use it. It is a presumption on our part that it is the \nvery best way to use the money and it is the best way to make our \nstudents achieve more--none of which is true and none of which will \nbear out in the marketplace of educating young people.\n  What we have today is an effort to use $1.2 billion of education \nfunding by authorizing on an appropriations bill a way of spending that \nis not now authorized in the law. We will not even wait for a couple of \nmonths for the committee that has been having hearing upon hearing to \ncome forth with a bill that puts everything into some perspective as to \nthe small Federal Government's share--and small it is; 7 percent of \npublic education is the U.S. Government. And that is found in this \nbill, 7 percent.\n  Some people talk as if we are the driving force of education. We \nwould have to be miracle workers for our 7 percent to really make \nschools get significantly better. But they would take $1.2 billion that \nis here to be used in a new way under a new law, and they would say: We \nknow best; spend it for more teachers in every school in America.\n  Frankly, it was also said on the floor that every superintendent \nwanted it that way. I only had a chance to call four--Belen, Artesia, \nCloudcroft, Capitan. None of them thought that more teachers was the \nbiggest priority for their school systems and their problems. Some said \nthey would improve themselves with alternative learning. Some said they \nwould improve themselves with math and science. One said they would \ndramatically improve themselves in science.\n  Frankly, that is what this is all about. Under the guise of saying we \nknow best and, please, under the guise of saying more teachers must be \nmet for everybody, we are going to spend $1.2 billion of hard-earned \ntaxpayers' money by mandating that you use it for more teachers or you \ncan't use it.\n  I would just suggest that in my home city school district--where I \ntaught school years ago when I taught mathematics in the junior high--I \nam not at all sure they would take this money and put it in more \nteachers if you gave them the option. They are having a crisis in the \nschool system there. But I don't believe they would be saying the thing \nthey need the most is more teachers. They might need bonuses for good \nteachers. They might need some bonuses for teachers who are indeed \nexcellent and can't make ends meet because we can't pay enough. They \nwould find all kinds of things and put them on the table. Ask them.\n\n  If you really said--let's just pick a number, the $20 million you \nwill get, or the $50 million you will get--Albuquerque, you can use it \nall for teachers or in enhancing the opportunity for achievement, which \nis our goal, you can use it in other ways and be accountable for it, I \ndoubt very much if they would in my home State all choose more \nteachers.\n  Don't anybody miss the point. If you vote against Senator Murray's \namendment, you still vote for the $1.2 billion\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nto go to our States in the appropriate formula, which nobody is arguing \nabout, to be used where they think it is best to enhance the \nachievement level of our public school students.\n  There is much that could be said. When the debate ensues on the major \nAmerican overhaul of education, we will all be here talking about some \nnew reform. But for now, I think in my 5 minutes I have expressed my \nviews as best I can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, our side yields up to 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is remarkable how a relatively short \namendment and even debate can be misconstrued.\n  The amendment we have before us that will be voted on in about 30 \nminutes is less than 10 full lines long. Twice, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts has said that it authorizes the States to take 15 percent \nof the money for administrative purposes, in spite of having been \ncorrected after the first mistake.\n  In fact, in clear English, it states that the distribution will be \nfor school districts in exactly the same form as would be the \ndistribution under Senator Murray's amendment. I don't believe Senator \nMurray's amendment allows 15 percent to be taken out by the States for \nadministrative expenses. Neither does mine. That is one point that has \nbeen made on the other side during the course of the debate.\n  Another--very recently by the junior Senator from New York, and by \nothers--speaks of the tremendous waste and abuse in the use of this \nmoney for football teams and the like, which seems to be the inevitable \nconsequence of trusting elected school board members to manage their \nown schools.\n  A few years ago when we began this debate I made a remark that I \nrepeat now. How is it that voters who are so wise as to choose us to \nrepresent them in the Senate will be so foolish and so stupid as to \nchoose school board members in their own communities who will take any \nmoney we give them and throw it away on frivolous, noneducational \npurposes if we allow them to run their own schools?\n  No one has answered that question. Yet this entire debate on the \nother side of the aisle has been taken up by Members who either \nimplicitly or often explicitly, as is the case with New York, are \nwilling to state that they know more not only about the schools in \ntheir own States but the schools in the other 49 States as well, and \nunless we tell every one of the 17,000 school districts in the United \nStates of America precisely how to spend their money, they will waste \nthat money.\n  More than 90 percent of the money spent on schools in the United \nStates is spent by States and local school districts. Unless the \nproposition is that all of that money is wasted, that our whole system \nis so dysfunctional that we should abolish school districts, abolish \nelected school board members and simply run all of our schools from \nWashington, DC, unless that is the argument, the proposition on the \nother side arguing against my amendment simply falls by its own weight.\n  As I said earlier, I think the proposition proposed in the Murray \namendment is clearly debatable. It wasn't debated last year. It was \npoked in a huge omnibus bill at the end of the session, unknown to most \nof the Members of both Houses of Congress. It has been debated for a \ntotal of 3 hours today. It needs to be debated against other competing \nideas of at least equal and I think greater merit when we debate \nrenewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act sometime during \nthe winter of next year. Perhaps by that time, with various ideas \nspread out, we can do a better job.\n  The Murray amendment, in order to breach one of our rules, has had to \nbe written in an awkward fashion. It is an authorization but it is an \nindirect authorization. It deserves much more serious consideration \nthan we are giving it this afternoon. It deserves debate against much \nmore serious and broad ranging ideas.\n  It does seem to me, however Members vote on it--and Members who don't \ntrust local school districts and think superintendents are incompetent, \nwho believe that principals and teachers don't have the interests of \nthe kids they are educating in mind, can certainly vote to tell them \nexactly how to spend this money by voting for the Murray amendment--\neven those Members ought to vote for my amendment because mine simply \nsays if we don't adopt the Murray amendment or don't adopt something \nsimilar to the Murray amendment between now and the 30th of June of \nnext year, the school districts will get the money in any event, and it \nis only in that ``any event'' they will be able to use it for any \neducational purpose they deem appropriate for the improvement of their \nstudents. If both amendments are defeated, the schools may forfeit the \nmoney entirely.\n  I trust Members on the other side will at least be objective enough \nto agree to the proposition that we ought to adopt my amendment \nunanimously and then determine whether or not this is the time, without \nany real debate, to say we have to have one more program added to the \nliterally hundreds we already have on the statute books of the United \nStates, all of which are for precise, single purposes, each of which \nimplicitly or explicitly says we don't trust our professional educators \nand our parents to know how to set the priorities for their own \nschools.\n\n  I firmly believe in the proposition we should provide that trust \npermanently through the amendment I offer. My amendment doesn't do that \npermanently; it only uses it as a backup. We will debate a more \nsophisticated version of it later this year or early next year. Between \nsides, there is a great gulf. That gulf is between those who believe \npeople at home are professional educators, are elected school board \nmembers who do care about the kids they are teaching and do know what \nthose kids need, and those who believe, unless we operate as a super \nschool board, unless we adopt the assumption we know far more than they \ndo about education, that education will not be provided.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent Senators Landrieu and Reed from \nRhode Island be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. I support her \namendment.\n  The basic issue is this: Will we give the pink slip to 29,000 \nteachers at the end of this school year, teachers who were hired to use \ntheir professional skills, to have reduced class size which helps kids \nalong in kindergarten, first, and second grades?\n  The Republicans say yes; the Democrats say no. The Republicans say: \nGive them the pink slips. Give the money to the school districts. Let \nthem do with it what they like.\n  I think Senator Murray, in supporting this amendment which I support \nas well, is supporting a concept that is tested and proven.\n  During the course of this debate, we have been visited in the \ngalleries by many students--hundreds of them, perhaps. I think if you \nask each of them whether it was a better classroom experience when they \nwere in a small class where they got to know the teacher and worked \nwith them or in some large study hall with 200 or 300 students, the \nanswer is obvious. It is obvious on this side of the aisle but, \nunfortunately, not on the other side of the aisle.\n  The chart the Senator from Tennessee brought up must be passed to \nevery Senator when they are elected. It shows how bad America's schools \nare and compares various grade levels of different nations and the \nUnited States. I have seen the chart over and over again. It is a chart \nthey use to rationalize vouchers, taking money out of public schools \nand giving it to a few kids to go to private schools. It is a chart \nthey use to say public education doesn't work in America today.\n\n  There is something fundamentally flawed in that presentation. \nVirtually every other country we are compared to uses a selective \nsystem of bringing kids to school. But not in America. Our schools are \nopen to everybody regardless of color, regardless of economic \ncircumstance, regardless of whether you are gifted or have a learning \ndisability. Yes, some of our test scores are\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\nlower because our school doors are open to everyone. Some of the other \ncountries, which the Republicans point to with pride, are very \nselective. There is the class that will become the leaders and the \nclass that will always be the lower-class workers. That is not America. \nI hope it never is.\n  This commitment to this amendment is a commitment to public \neducation, to 90 percent of the kids in America who go to public \nschools. I went to private schools, parochial schools, as did my kids, \nbut I believed my first obligation in my community and in the Senate \nwas to public education. That is why I support Senator Murray.\n  For those who say we don't care about or don't trust local \neducational officials, nothing could be further from the truth. Despite \neverything we do in this appropriations bill, 93 percent of the funds \nspent on local schools will come from local sources and will be \nadministered by local officials, as it should be. The question that \nSenator Murray poses with this amendment is whether the Federal \nGovernment will continue to show leadership in certain areas where we \nhave had proven success.\n  Looking back we can see it: vocational education, the School Lunch \nProgram, title I for kids falling behind, the IDEA program for kids \nwith disabilities, the National Defense Education Act, the Pell grants \nand others for higher education. We pick and choose those things that \nwork at the Federal level and do our level best to work with local \nschool districts to use them at the local level. That is what the \nMurray amendment is all about.\n\n  Yes, we trust local officials, but we want to make certain they are \nheld accountable to produce the teachers and reduce the class sizes \nthat we know has proven results.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington, who offers an alternative: Have \nfaith in the public school system, please. Have faith, if teachers are \nin the classroom with a smaller number of students they can succeed; \nkids that might otherwise fall behind have a fighting chance.\n  I close by saying it is sad, in one respect, that this is what the \neducational debate in Washington, DC, comes down to, a matter of 29,000 \nteachers. The No. 1 issue for families across America deserves a bigger \ndebate and a lot more attention from the Federal Government. So far, \nthis Congress, as we have seen in previous Congresses under Republican \ncontrol, has continued to shortchange education. We cannot do that \nexcept at our own national peril. I support the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we have had a very solid, \nconstructive debate this afternoon. The Murray amendment seeks to deal \nwith class size, which I believe is a very laudable and praiseworthy \nobjective. A difficulty I have with the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington is that it adds some $200 million to the bill, which is \nalready, in my judgment, at the maximum level. It now calls for $91.7 \nbillion; $16 billion is forward funded. Last year $8 billion had been \nforward funded. This bill has been crafted by the subcommittee, then \naccepted by the full committee, after 17 hearings, after having more \nthan 2,000 requests from Members, more than 1,000 letters, 1,000 inputs \nfrom the citizenry. Our subcommittee, a group of experts on staff, sat \ndown and crafted this bill which was then approved by Senator Harkin, \nthe ranking Democrat, and myself. We have some 300 items which we have \nweighed and evaluated. We have allocated $1.2 billion to the \ngeneralized subject of teacher initiative, which is perhaps the same as \nclass size. When I say perhaps the same as class size, I say that \nbecause the determination of precisely how that money is to be used is \nup to the authorizing committee.\n  For those watching on C-SPAN II, if anyone, a word of explanation \nmight be in order; that is, we appropriate. We put up the money. But we \nhave another committee, headed by Senator Jeffords, which decides \nauthorization, as to how the money is to be spent. That is the way we \ndo business in the Senate.\n  Last year, in order to move through the process--and occasionally we \ndo legislate on an appropriations bill--we did legislate, for 1 year, \non class size. The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington was \nsubject to challenge under rule XVI and could have been defeated \nbecause it is legislation. We decided not to do that in order to give \nthis issue a thorough airing on the merits.\n  Frankly, I would like to add $200 billion--million--maybe Freud would \nsay I would like to add $200 billion. I am not sure. But we have a \ncouple of problems. One problem is we have to pass this bill. On my \nside of the aisle, we are at the breaking point. I may be wrong about \nthat, we may be beyond the breaking point. I am lobbying my colleagues \nin the Cloakroom that $91.7 billion ought to get their affirmative \nvote. They raised questions about the size of the amount. Then we have \nto go to conference and we have to produce a bill which will be \naccepted by our House colleagues, who have a little different view. \nThey want to spend substantially less money.\n  I am aware the object, the end process is to get the bill signed. \nUnder our Constitution, it is not enough for the Senate to vote, for \nthe House to vote, for the conference committee to vote. It has to be \nsubmitted to the President. He has to agree with it. We are very close \nto the President's figure.\n  He asked for $1.4 billion for class size, and I am not saying in the \nend we might not be there on a compromise, at the very end of the \nprocess, if we make some other adjustments. But there is a limit as to \nhow much I can get my Republican colleagues to vote for.\n  One of my colleagues just entered, came to the floor, and said, \n``That's right.'' I have been lobbying him very hard in the Cloakroom. \nWe have to get 51 votes for this bill; that is not easy to do, at $91.7 \nbillion.\n  So as we look at the overall structure, and we have 300 programs--the \nSenator from Washington did not make a suggestion as to where she would \nlike to cut $200 million. We have a structure that is not subject to \nthe Budget Act because it is advanced funding.\n\n  I believe our bill, at $91.7 billion, is within the caps, and I am \nconfident it does not touch Social Security. But that is a complicated \nsubject because some of the money has been borrowed from defense. There \nare a lot of factors at play here. Senator Domenici and Senator Stevens \nand I and others have been working to be sure we are within the caps \nand we do not cut Social Security. I have been told if we spend $200 \nmillion more on the amendment of the Senator from Washington, we may \ninvade Social Security--that we will invade Social Security. I am not \nprepared to make that argument because I do not know whether it is true \nor not. But I do know every time we add money, we come very close to \nthat and there is, not a consensus--there is unanimity not to touch \nSocial Security, not to do that, and to allow room for Medicare.\n  In the debate earlier, I heard the Senator from Connecticut talk \nabout adding $2 billion to another program that I like very much, but I \nam not prepared to spend $2 billion more on this bill and eliminate any \nchance at all I can get 51 votes on this side of the aisle.\n  So it was with great reluctance that I am constrained--and I voted \nagainst very little, in the 19 years I have been here, against \nincreased education funding. If somebody wants to spend more money on \neducation, almost always I have said yes. The authorizers may come back \nand may do exactly what the Senator from Washington wants, put it on \nclass size. That is a laudable, praiseworthy objective. But there are \nother objectives as well. That has to be decided by our authorizing \ncommittee, under our rules.\n  So it is with reluctance that I vote against the Senator from \nWashington because I do not like to vote against money for education. \nBut we have not just been fair; we have been very generous. This bill \nis an increase of $2.3 billion over last year. It is more than $500 \nmillion more than the President wanted. We have worked hard to craft \nthis, among 300 programs. Agreeing to the amendment offered by Senator \nGorton does not rule out class size on two grounds: One is, it could be \nclass size if the local districts say so, or it could be class size if \nthe authorizers say so.\n  So Senator Gorton's amendment is not inconsistent with the objectives \nof the Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\n  Chairing this subcommittee has been fascinating, and trying to put \nall the pieces together is really a challenge. Voting against education \nis something I do not like to do, to be misconstrued in a 30-second \ncommercial, but I think the interests of American children and public \neducation, of which I am a product, are best served by keeping the bill \nas it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to say by voting for the Gorton \namendment we are voting for education. In voting against the Murray \namendment you are not voting against education, you are voting for \nallowing--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 4 minutes off \nthe time of the proponents of the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will yield him that time. That is the \nway we do it, as opposed to unanimous consent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Gorton amendment is a pro-education amendment, if \nyou believe people in the local school districts know what they need. \nMaybe they need more teachers. Maybe they need more computers. Maybe \nthey need to enhance the benefits for teachers that are there so they \ncan keep them there.\n  Maybe they need it for recruitment. Let's give them the flexibility.\n  I, along with several other Senators, met with some Governors and \nasked them what they wanted, and they said they wanted flexibility and \nthey wanted Congress to help them meet the unfunded obligations of \nIDEA. I said: What about this proposal that some people have made that \nsays let's have 100,000 new teachers paid for by the Federal \nGovernment? That was not their request.\n  They said: No, just give us flexibility; there are hundreds of \nFederal programs, some of which work, some of which do not work, a lot \nhave mandates; give us the flexibility to work on those programs; give \nus some of the money without the strings attached; you do not need to \ntell us we have to hire so many teachers.\n  Frankly, they do not have to hire teachers and have them paid for by \nthe Federal Government. Some States have already taken significant \naction to reduce class size. I compliment them for it. Some are way \nahead of others. Should we punish those States that have moved ahead \nearlier than other States? I don't think so.\n  How in the world do we in the Federal Government have that kind of \nknowledge that allows us to dictate, to mandate that we need 30,000 \nteachers, or 100,000 teachers? In my State, it comes to 348 teachers. \nWe have 605 school districts, so each school district gets half a \nteacher. Nationwide, there are 14,000 school districts, so I guess we \nget 2 teachers for each school district. Some people are saying that is \nthe solution for better education, for the Federal Government to hire \ntwo teachers for each school district? That is ridiculous.\n  We have a lot of programs. The Senator from Pennsylvania has already \nmentioned there is a significant increase for education. Let's allow \nsome flexibility, as proposed by the Gorton amendment, by people who \nrun the schools who know--the local school boards and the States--what \nthey need most. Let them make that decision. Maybe it is four more \nteachers. Great, I am all for it. Maybe it is for retention of \nteachers. That is fantastic. Maybe it is for computers. Let's have them \nmake the decisions and not dictate that Washington, DC, knows best.\n  I reiterate, a vote for the Gorton amendment is pro-education, and a \nvote against the Murray amendment, in my opinion, is pro-education if \nyou happen to believe people on the local school boards and the PTAs \nwithin the States have an interest in improving the quality of \neducation and might know better than some bureaucrat in the Department \nof Education.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Three minutes 30 seconds for \nthe proponents of the amendment, and 5 minutes 36 seconds for the \nopponents.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Murray's \namendment to provide funding for the class size reduction initiative.\n  Last year, the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, made a down payment \nto help communities hire 100,000 teachers so they could reduce class \nsizes to an average of 18.\n  As Tennessee's efforts with class size reduction show, qualified \nteachers in small classes can provide students with more individualized \nattention, spend more time on instruction and less on other tasks, and \ncover more material effectively, and are better able to work with \nparents to further their children's education.\n  The class size reduction initiative is flexible, and communities are \nusing innovative locally-designed approaches to give children the \nindividual attention they need.\n  Every state is using the funds, and every state that needed a waiver \nto tailor the class size reduction program to its specific needs or to \nexpand class size reduction to other grades, received one.\n  1.7 million children are benefitting from smaller classes this year.\n  29,000 teachers have been hired with FY99 Class Size Reduction funds.\n  1,247 (43 percent) are teaching in the first grade, reducing class \nsizes from 23 to 17.\n  6,670 (23 percent) are teaching in the second grade, reducing class \nsize from 23 to 18.\n  6,960 (24 percent) are teaching in the third grade, reducing class \nsize from 24 to 18.\n  2,900 (10 percent) are in kindergarten and grades 4-12.\n  290 special education teachers were hired.\n  On average, 7 percent of the funds are being used for professional \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, the debate is not a simple either/or proposition on \nclass size versus teacher quality. We need to do both. That is why last \nyear on an overwhelming bipartisan vote we passed a new teacher quality \ngrants program as part of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. \nIndeed, those who claim they support improvements in teacher quality \nhave a clear chance to do so when Senator Kennedy and I offer an \namendment to fully fund the teacher quality grants at $300 million.\n  We must continue to meet the bipartisan commitment we made on class \nsize reduction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment to do just that \nand reject the Gorton amendment which could result in children being \nforced to return to larger classes and the firing of 29,000 newly hired \nteachers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of this debate. \nEverybody needs to step back and remember why we are here, and that is \nthat 1 year ago, in a bipartisan manner, both Houses--the Senate and \nthe House--agreed to work toward funding 100,000 new teachers in the \nearly grades, first through third grades.\n  Everybody took credit a year ago. In fact, I have a copy of the \nRepublican Policy Committee, ``Accomplishments During the 105th \nCongress.'' This is what they put out, and right on the second page, \nthey take credit for the 30,000 new teachers we funded with the $1.2 \nbillion. They take credit and say: This is one of their \naccomplishments. They say:\n\n       This omnibus FY 1999 funding bill provides $1.2 billion in \n     additional educational funds, funds controlled 100 percent at \n     the local level--\n\n  Despite the rhetoric you have heard today--\n\n     to recruit, hire, train, and test teachers. This provision--\n\n  They said a year ago--\n\n     is a major first step toward returning to local school \n     officials the ability to make the educational decisions for \n     our children, rather than the bureaucrats in Washington.\n\n  I did not say that; our Republican colleagues said that a year ago \nwhen they passed the $1.2 billion with us to reduce class sizes.\n  In the past year, we have put 30,000 new teachers into our \nclassrooms. Why was that an initiative that we all felt was important? \nBecause we know it makes a difference. We know that students in smaller \nclass sizes enroll in more college-bound courses, they have higher \ngrade point averages, they have fewer discipline problems, and they \nhave lower drop-out rates.\n  The commitment we began last year is making a difference for our \nstudents,\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nit is making a difference in our classrooms, and it will make a \ndifference for our economy and for this country's future. It is a \nprogram that is working.\n  I ask my colleagues: Why have so many people opposed it today when 1 \nyear ago they said it was a major accomplishment in turning money back \nto local school districts? Why are they opposing it?\n  Perhaps they do not want any Federal involvement in our education. I \ndisagree. The Federal Government is a partner. They are a partner with \nour State and local governments, with our teachers, our students, our \nfamilies. We made a commitment a year ago, and we are about to renege \non that right now. If my amendment is not agreed to, and a year from \nnow 30,000 teachers get their pink slips and we have students, 1.7 \nmillion children, who are returned to larger classrooms, everyone in \nthis Congress will have failed to do the right thing for our children.\n  The Class Size Reduction Initiative was the right thing to do a year \nago. Everyone said so. It is still the right thing to do today. It is a \ncommitment we have made to the families in this country that, yes, we \nwill live up to what their expectations are of us, that education is a \npriority, that we are willing to put our money behind our rhetoric.\n  My colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, has offered an \nalternative, and I say to my Republican colleagues, if they want to \nintroduce a new block grant program and tell us what it is, perhaps we \nwill be willing to help them. But we are not willing to take 30,000 \nteachers out of our classrooms, and we are not willing to say to the \nfamilies in this country that we are not with you in making sure that \nevery child in this country, no matter who they are or where they come \nfrom, will learn. We are willing to do our part.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment and oppose the \nGorton amendment and do the right thing for children and families in \nthis country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes 36 seconds to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington so he can conclude the debate in support of his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment that I have before you and \nwhich will be voted on in a few minutes is extraordinarily simple both \nto understand and in its undertaking. It says that the $1.2 billion the \nchairman of the subcommittee and his ranking member have generously put \nin this bill, subject to the authorization of a specific teachers \nprogram, will nonetheless be available to the school districts of the \ncountry if we do not come up with a specific authorization of that very \nspecific and prescriptive program, one, the merits of which as against \ntrusting school districts, I find somewhat dubious.\n  It should be a slam-dunk vote for every Member of this body, and yet \nimmediately after I last spoke on this issue, the senior Senator from \nIllinois said if we do not adopt the Murray amendment, 27,000, 29,000, \n32,000 teachers who have been hired under the teachers program in the \nlast year will all get pink slips. It is hard to think of a more \nbizarre argument.\n  Under my amendment, every school district will get every dollar it \nhas gotten in the present year that is used to hire teachers. The only \nrationale for firing a single one of those teachers would be that the \nteacher was unneeded but that the school district had the money, could \nnot use it for any other purpose because of the wisdom of the Members \nof the Congress of the United States and felt that there was an \ninfinitely more important use for that money.\n  If that is the case, if thousands of teachers are going to be fired, \nit shows that the program was the wrong program in the first place and \nshould never have been passed.\n  If the teachers program is justified, the teachers will stay on the \npayroll whether Senator Murray's amendment is adopted or not as long as \nmy amendment is adopted.\n  They are on the horns of a dilemma: either they pass a foolish and \nunneeded program that would otherwise be rejected by every school \ndistrict in the country, or they can reach their goals through my \namendment, as well as through their own, and then debate at a later \ntime under more thoughtful circumstances, as both the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont pointed out, the whole idea \nof how much direction we must impose on our school districts when we \ndeal with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 2, 3, or 4 months \nfrom now.\n  But the fundamental difference between these two approaches is very \nsimple. Their approach is: The people who run our schools don't know \nwhat they are doing and will waste money and will do it wrong unless we \ntell them, down to the last detail, how to set their own priorities. \nTheir belief is that parents and teachers and principals and \nsuperintendents--those three sets of professionals who have devoted \ntheir entire lives to the education of our kids--and elected school \nboard members, who go through campaigns, the way we do, because they \ncare about their schools, do not really care or are too stupid to know \nwhat their students need and that one set of rules, applicable to New \nYork City and the most rural district in South Carolina, is the only \nway we can provide appropriately for the education of our children. \nThat is an argument that is not only perverse; it is false and \nerroneous on its face.\n  Let us admit that there may be people in the United States who know \nmore about the education of their own children in their own communities \nthan do 100 Senators. We should adopt the amendment that I have \nproposed. We should defeat the Murray amendment.\n  We should have the debate on a broader scale at a later, more \nappropriate time, not in connection with an appropriations bill that \nurgently needs to be passed by tomorrow so we can actually get this \nmoney to the schools so they can educate our children and do a better \njob in the future even than they have done in the past.\n  I guess I cannot yield back the remainder of our time. It is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of the \nSenator from Nevada, Mrs. Boxer, and Senator Kennedy.\n  A woman by the name of Karen Daly was stuck by a contaminated needle \nwhile working as an emergency room nurse in Massachusetts. As a result \nof her being inadvertently, accidentally stuck with a needle she was \nusing on a patient, she was infected with both HIV and hepatitis C. She \nhad worked as a nurse for 25 years. She, of course, can no longer work \nas a nurse. She loved her job. She has become, I believe, the Nation's \nmost powerful advocate for our need to do something to prevent people \nfrom being accidentally stuck with needles from which they become sick.\n  Her story is really heart-rending. She says:\n\n       I can't describe for you how that one moment--the moment \n     when I reached my gloved hand over a needle box to dispose of \n     the needle I had used to draw blood--has drastically changed \n     my life. Since January of this year, I have had to come to \n     terms with the fact that I am infected with not one but two \n     life-threatening diseases.\n\n  The tragic part of this story is, like Karen, so many other people \ncould have had this accidental stick prevented. Karen Daly is one of \n800,000 accidental sticks every year.\n  In Reno, NV, there is a woman by the name of Lisa Black, a 21-year-\nold registered nurse, a single mother of two, who has also learned the \ndevastating impact of a needle stick. In October of 1997, 2 years ago, \nshe was nursing a man who was in the terminal stages of AIDS when a \nneedle containing his blood punctured her skin. Today, she is infected \nwith hepatitis C and HIV. She takes 22 pills a day to keep her HIV \ninfection from progressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects \nof hepatitis C which is an incurable liver disease.\n  Lisa Black's needle stick could have been prevented if hospitals had \nwidespread use of safe needles and needleless devices. I repeat, \n800,000 needlesticks and sharps injuries each year. That is more than \nis really imaginable, but it is true.\n\n  There are pages and pages of incidents I could report of people who \nare stuck with these needles. The nursing profession is mostly women, \nso most of the people who are injured are women.\n  I will talk about a couple of others.\n  Beth Anne. She graduated with a nursing degree less than a year \nbefore she got hurt. She says:\n\n       Life for me was just starting. Having graduated from \n     college that year, I had planned to specialize in critical \n     care, emergency services, and flight nursing. I was engaged \n     to a wonderful and supportive engineer whom I had met when we \n     were students on the same university campus. We were planning \n     our wedding. Suddenly, everything seemed uncontrollable. The \n     illness and the response from my employer seemed out of my \n     control. . . . The severity of the illness threatened my \n     life. . . . Wedding plans were postponed indefinitely.\n\n  Here is how she describes her injury:\n\n       I pulled the needle out. As the needle tip cleared the \n     skin, the patient swiped at my right arm, sending the needle \n     into my left hand. ``I forgot about the shot,'' the patient \n     said. ``I thought it was a mosquito biting at my hip.''\n\n  Beth Anne says:\n\n       The injury I sustained is now preventable. . . . I injected \n     the needle into her hip with my right hand, aspirated to \n     assure placement, and pushed the plunger. The patient did not \n     flinch. I pulled the needle out. As the needle tip cleared \n     the skin, the patient swiped at my right arm, sending the \n     needle into my left hand. ``I forgot about the shot,'' the \n     patient said. ``I thought it was a mosquito biting at my \n     hip.'' There [are] now syringes that automatically retract \n     the needle into the syringe before the syringe is pulled away \n     from the patient's skin. . . . The cost difference between \n     this safe syringe and the one that infected [this lady] is \n     less than the cost of a postage stamp. The cheaper syringe \n     has cost [this woman and her employer] much more than this, \n     in many ways.\n\n  She has been very sick and has been in and out of hospitals. Hundreds \nof these patients die each year from these injuries. Moreover, these \nstatistics account for only reported injuries. The 800,000 are only \nthose that are reported. There are a lot more that are not reported.\n  Lynda.\n\n       On September 9, . . . I sustained a needlestick while \n     starting an intravenous\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\n     line at a small community hospital in Lancaster, Pa. I was a \n     23-year-old registered nurse working in the ICU.\n\n  The reason I go over these stories is these are not negligent nurses. \nThey have not done anything wrong.\n  What happened is on one occasion there was a needle in a wastepaper \nbasket. She stuck her hand in it. Needles are not supposed to be put \nthere.\n  On another occasion, a patient, very sick, not thinking well--\nsenile--swiped at a person's hand, thinking it was a mosquito.\n  In this instance, I repeat, she was a 23-year-old registered nurse.\n\n       At my hospital I had received in-depth training and had \n     attended in-service sessions about safety and technique. \n     Although I was complying with all recommended precautions at \n     the time my needlestick occurred, these precautions were not \n     enough to prevent the injury. While removing the needle \n     from the patient's vein, he suddenly moved his arm and \n     knocked mine. The motion forced the bloody exposed needle \n     directly into my left palm. It punctured my latex gloves. \n     . . .\n       It was here that my worst fears were confirmed. The patient \n     had AIDS and was in the final stage of the disease.\n\n  She said:\n\n       I began the 1-year wait to discover if I had become \n     infected. At 3 weeks after my needlestick I was sent to a \n     family practitioner because of a rash, sore throat, and \n     fever; I was prescribed some topical ointment for the rash \n     and sent home.\n       . . . I received the results of my 6-month antibody test \n     and got the most devastating news of my life: I was HIV \n     positive. I do not think that words can accurately describe \n     my emotions at this time. I felt suffocated, desperate, \n     fearful, dirty, contaminated, and confused. Nothing in my \n     education, on-the-job training, or critical care course could \n     have prepared me for the experiences and emotion that lay \n     ahead.\n\n  I have only recounted a few of these. Nurses badly need this \nlegislation. There are all kinds of things that can be done to protect \nthese people who are being stabbed inadvertently. There are needles \nthat retract. Too many of our front-line health care workers contract, \nas I have indicated, these debilitating and often deadly diseases as a \nresult of these on-the-job needlestick injuries.\n  Those at risk for needlestick or sharp injuries include anyone who \nhandles blood, blood products, and biological samples, as well as \nhousekeeping staff and those responsible for the disposal of \ncontaminated materials.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, we have only a few of \nthe reported sticks each year; 800,000 people have reported \nneedlesticks and sharps injuries. There are many more who do not \nreport.\n  We do not actually know the number of needlestick injuries.\n  Over 20 different diseases--including HIV, hepatitis B and C, and \nmalaria--may be transmitted from just a speck of blood.\n  This amendment that has been offered would ensure that necessary \ntools--better information and better medical devices--are made \navailable to front-line health care workers in order to reduce injuries \nand deaths that result from these needlesticks.\n  What would my amendment do?\n  It would amend OSHA's--that is the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration--blood-borne pathogens standard to require that \nemployees use needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps \nprotections to prevent the spread of blood-borne pathogens in the \nworkplace.\n  Second, create a sharps injury log that employers would keep \ncontaining detailed formation about these injuries that occur.\n  And finally, it would establish a new clearinghouse within the \nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, to collect \ndata on engineered safety technology designed to help prevent the risk \nof needlesticks.\n  In the House of Representatives, this legislation is sponsored by 136 \nof their Members. Protecting the health and safety of our front-line \nhealth care workers should not be a partisan or political issue. We \nneed something done.\n  I have been told that the chairman of the committee, the junior \nSenator from Vermont, is aware of the problem in this area and has \nindicated a willingness to work to come up with regulations that we can \nwork with the administration on or legislation, if in fact that is \nnecessary--which I think it is--to prevent these needlestick injuries--\nand they are preventable, and we as a body need to do something about \nit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the distinguished Senator would yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Jeffords would be willing to work with the \nSenator from Nevada on a bipartisan approach to needlestick prevention. \nI have not heard the issue broached at the hearings, but I will urge \nSenator Jeffords to include that in working with the Senator from \nNevada. The issue poses a problem on the appropriations bill. This is \nauthorization on an appropriations bill, and it is subject to our rule \nXVI which precludes that. But more fundamentally, it has not been aired \nwith many of the interested parties. I am sympathetic to what the \nSenator from Nevada seeks to accomplish. I think there are problems. I \nfound out about it for the first time yesterday, and I say that in no \nway to be critical. That is what happens here. When we take it up, we \nhave heard rural hospitals would find it difficult in its present \nposture. I am told by CBO that there is a substantial cost figure \ninvolved. I don't cite it with any authority, but they are talking \nabout $50 million. I don't quite see that, but that has been reported \nto me.\n\n  I compliment Senator Reid for calling attention to the issue, for \nfocusing on it, for raising it and taking a big step in having \nconsideration by the authorizing committee. I will urge Senator \nJeffords to include hearings as well as a cooperative approach to try \nto work it out.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the manager of the bill, I appreciate his \nstatement. I understand rule XVI. It was my initial idea because I \nthink this is so important. Every nurse in America, every day they go \nto work, is concerned about whether or not they have a needlestick. \nNurses all over America favor this. It was my original intention to \nmove forward and see if we could get enough votes to surmount the \nproblem with rule XVI.\n  I think we have the opportunity to do something on a bipartisan \nbasis. I do not believe something this important should be done on a \npartisan basis. I think we should make this a bill both Democrats and \nRepublicans support. I have spoken to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, who has worked on this with me from the very beginning. She is \nsomeone who feels very strongly about this issue. I have spoken to the \nother sponsor of the legislation, Senator Kennedy. They acknowledge the \nneed for this and also the fact technology now exists to protect health \ncare workers from needlesticks, but only 15 percent of those hospitals \nare using safer needle devices such as retractable needles.\n  Having said that, I am not going to call for a vote at this time. It \nis my understanding Senator Jeffords has agreed to do hearings. I am \nsure I can confirm that with a phone call with him. At this stage, what \nI am going to do is speak no more, talk to Senator Jeffords, and then I \nwill withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for both \nfocusing the attention of the Senate on this issue and for agreeing to \nan orderly process, which has been outlined, for expediting the \nprocessing of the bill by, as he says, withdrawing the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in closing, I understand there might be \na cost involved. CBO has indicated to the manager of the bill $50 \nmillion. I think it would be a fraction of that, but we need not get \ninto that today. For any one of these women I talked about today who \nhave been inadvertently stabbed with one of these needles, their \nmedical bills are huge. There isn't a single one of these women who \ndoesn't have medical expenses less than $100,000. When added up, it \ncomes out to a tremendous amount of money that could be saved, \nnotwithstanding the pain and suffering of these individuals and their \nfamilies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to withdraw the amendment at this time. I am \ngoing to talk to Senator Jeffords, make sure we will have a hearing \nsometime within the reasonable future. I have been advised by staff he \nhas agreed to that, so I am sure there will be no problem.\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\n  I say to the Chair, I have no objection to my amendment being set \naside and moving on to other business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on our sequencing, the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, has an amendment to offer at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1808\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate regarding the Brooklyn Museum of Art)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1808.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Sec.   . It is the sense of the Senate that the Conferees \n     on H.R. 2466, the Department of Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, shall include language prohibiting funds \n     from being used for the Brooklyn Museum of Art unless the \n     Museum immediately cancels the exhibit `Sensation,' which \n     contains obscene and pornographic pictures, a picture of the \n     Virgin Mary desecrated with animal feces, and other examples \n     of religious bigotry.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first, I thank my \ncolleague, the manager, Senator Specter, and the Democratic side for \nagreeing to my amendment. It is my understanding there is no \nopposition. I will be very brief in my remarks.\n  The amendment is very simple, as was read by the clerk. It says that \nunless the Brooklyn Museum of Art, about which we have been reading, \ncancels the exhibit Sensation, it will no longer receive Federal funds \nthrough the National Endowment of the Arts. An article in today's \nWashington Times describes this exhibit ``called art''--I use that term \nloosely--as including a picture of the Virgin Mary decorated with \nelephant feces and pornographic pictures. It also contains a picture, a \nphotograph of the Last Supper with a naked woman presiding, presumably, \nas Christ. It also depicts a sculpture of a man's head filled with the \nartist's frozen blood.\n  As I say, I use the term ``artist'' loosely. I am reading from the \narticle. This is called ``art.''\n  Mr. President, we do live in troubled times. You would think with the \nconstant barrage of violence and sex and death and blasphemy that maybe \nsomehow everybody would get to the point where enough is enough. I \nthink that is where I am with this particular piece of art, so-called. \nYet this painting of the Virgin Mary covered in feces and surrounded by \npornographic pictures is particularly shocking. It is irreverent; it is \nsacrilegious; and it is disgusting; but it is not art, for goodness' \nsake. People can do what they want to do. We do have the first \namendment. They can draw what they want to draw.\n  But I will say one thing: The taxpayers of the United States \nshouldn't fund this garbage. Everyone here knows how I feel about the \nfunding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I had an amendment \nrecently that lost overwhelmingly to defund the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  At that time, we were told all of these things were in the past. \nThere were no more Mapplethorpes. And as someone spoke to me on the way \nin, we went from Christ on the crucifix immersed in urine to the Virgin \nMary now with animal feces. That is where we have gone with the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  I think it is time we dismantled the National Endowment for the Arts \nbecause I am sick and tired of hearing about these so-called art \nprojects. How many times do we have to hear the NEA has cleaned up its \nact, and how many times do we have to hear that it has not? That is the \nbottom line.\n  This amendment doesn't defund the National Endowment for the Arts. It \nsays, very simply and very clearly, it is the sense of the Senate that \nthe conferees on the Department of the Interior, where NEA is funded, \nshall include language prohibiting funds from being used for the \nBrooklyn Museum of Art, unless the museum immediately cancels the \nexhibit Sensation, which contains obscene and pornographic pictures, a \npicture of the Virgin Mary desecrated with animal feces, and other \nexamples of religious bigotry.\n  Basically, Mayor Giuliani has said the same thing, that he doesn't \nwant any of these funds going to the museum for it either. I think if \nwe are going to fund the arts, we owe it to the taxpayers to exercise \ndiscretion. The Brooklyn Museum of Art is upset that Mayor Giuliani is \nthreatening to withdraw the $7 million subsidy the museum gets from the \ncity, but the mayor is right.\n  The people of New York City shouldn't have to spend their hard-earned \ntax dollars to pay for this trash, nor should the people of New \nHampshire, or California, or Iowa, or Idaho, or any place else. \nDefenders of the NEA always say this is creativity. According to the \npromotions for this exhibit in New York, they have a warning poster \noutside the display in the museum that says: This exhibit causes \n``shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, and anxiety.''\n  The Brooklyn Museum of Art has received just over the last 3 years at \nleast $500,000 worth of taxpayer dollars--at least. You could employ a \nlot of homeless veterans for $500,000. You could take a lot of them off \nthe streets for $500,000.\n  If we are going to give money to museums, we ought not to include \nthose that are this irresponsible. Give me that $500,000, and I will \nfind homeless veterans in San Francisco, in Los Angeles, and \nWashington. Every day when I come to work, I see homeless veterans on \ngrates in this city. Let me have that money, and I will get them off \nthe grates. But I will be doggone if I am going to give it to the \nBrooklyn Museum of Art or any other museum with this kind of trash \ncalled ``art.'' It is wrong.\n  Every time I take the floor and talk about it--and others before me, \nand Senator Helms who is a leader on this--we always hear that they \nhave cleaned up their act, it is not going to happen anymore, and we \nare not going to hear any more about these horror stories. But here we \nare with this money. We just passed it--$99 million worth for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. I lost my amendment, and here goes \nsome of that money right smack into the Museum of Art in Brooklyn.\n  If a student wants to say a prayer over his lunch or if a teacher \nholds a moment of silence, it is Government sponsorship of religion. \nJudge Roy Moore of Alabama could go to jail for putting the Ten \nCommandants on his wall because somehow we are afraid of the separation \nof church and state. But this kind of stuff can go on, and nobody stops \nit.\n  The ACLU liberals are all too willing to persecute people for \nlegitimate religious expression if it takes place in a public building. \nThen they defend the desecration of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ \nand call it art? What is happening to this world? Can somebody figure \nthis out?\n  We have a public museum, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars \nof Federal taxpayer dollars, spending these dollars on religious \nbigotry. So the American taxpayer has to pay for art that degrades and \nblasphemes against their own religion. But if their child wants to say \na prayer over lunch, we have to get the lawyers out. Welcome to \nAmerica. It seems that anti-Catholic bigotry is coming back into vogue. \nNot only that, it is celebrated as art, and it gets Federal dollars to \ndo it.\n  This guy needs a psychiatrist for putting this thing together. He \ndoesn't need Federal money. You get publicity-craving artists who go to \nany length to create controversy. And he has it. I am giving him plenty \nof publicity. He is probably very happy. I will give him the publicity, \nbut let's not give him the money. I imagine those who created this \nmonstrosity are watching right now on C-SPAN and are cheering away: \n``There is Smith out there giving us all this attention.'' Give him the \nattention, but let's take the money away.\n  It is not the so-called ``artists'' who are responsible. They are \ndoing their job as they see fit. They should not do it at taxpayer \nexpense. Those who run public museums ought to know better. We \nshouldn't have to hang parental warning signs on public art museums\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\nsaying that children under 17 shouldn't come in.\n  Mayor Giuliani gave the museum an opportunity to end this controversy \nby removing certain exhibits, and the museum rejected his offer. Let's \nreject the money. As far as I am concerned, this was a statement by the \nBrooklyn Museum that this is the kind of art they think is appropriate \nto fund with taxpayer dollars. Until they change their mind, I think \nthe taxpayers' money would be better spent elsewhere. I would be happy \nto pick homeless veterans if somebody wants to give me the $500,000 to \ndo it.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is appropriate to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  We have an agreement on the amendment. So we don't need the yeas and \nnays. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has \nbroached a great many complex issues in his presentation. The question \non school prayer is one of the most complex constitutional issues the \nSupreme Court has faced. And I do not believe those analogies are \nparticularly apt here. I am certainly opposed to religious bigotry in \nany form whatsoever. When you deal with the issue of restraints on art, \nagain, there are complex first amendment questions.\n  I learned of the amendment earlier this afternoon and do not have a \ntotal grasp of the issues on this particular display at this particular \nmuseum.\n  This amendment, while it may be offered on this bill, under our rules \nis not germane to the bill on Labor-HHS. We have decided to accept the \nmatter with no assurance as to how hard we will pursue it in the \nconference, to put it mildly. But in the interest of moving the bill \nalong, I think the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has made \nhis point. I do not think it has become the law of the land. In the \ninterest of moving this bill, not contesting it in a long debate and \nhaving a rollcall vote, which takes time, we will simply let the matter \ngo through on a voice vote, as Senator Smith suggested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1808) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to send \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. I understand we \nmay be in virtual agreement on it. I will call for the question after \nthe amendment is read.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I sent the amendment to the desk and asked \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is an objection until we see the \namendment by the Senator from California. The issue is now on whether \nwe are going to agree to set aside. I am not prepared to agree to that \nuntil we have had an opportunity to study the amendment. We have not \nseen it until this moment. We need to see what the amendment says. We \nhave no objection to having the clerk report the amendment, but we are \nnot prepared to set aside anything to take up the amendment at this \ntime, but we will do so promptly after we have a chance to look at it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that happened an hour ago. We have \nbeen waiting to offer it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from California saying she thinks we had \nit an hour ago?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As of 5 minutes ago, I was told we didn't have it. We \ncan straighten this out in the course of a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of Senator Reid from Nevada.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the Reid amendment be set aside.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nspeak for up to 3 minutes as in morning business, and that at the \nconclusion of my remarks the quorum call be reinstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to the most urgent of matters \nabout which I can be succinct. There has arisen in New York City the \nquestion of the propriety of a museum exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. \nThe city government has contested this, and the museums of the city \nhave, in turn, raised objections.\n  Floyd Abrams, who is perhaps the most significant first amendment \nlawyer of our age--I should correct myself to say he is the most \nsignificant first amendment lawyer of our age--is taking this case to a \nFederal district court, urging that a first amendment issue is involved \nand that the proposed measures of the City of New York are in violation \nof the first amendment and cannot be allowed to stand.\n  In that circumstance, I should think any Member of this body ought to \ndefer to the courts before which this issue is now being placed. \nClearly this amendment by Senator Smith will not become law.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial which \nappeared this morning in the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 1999]\n\n                     The Museum's Courageous Stand\n\n       The Brooklyn Museum of Art announced yesterday that it will \n     stand by its plans to open the exhibition called \n     ``Sensation.'' It also began litigation to prevent Mayor \n     Rudolph Giuliani from fulfilling his threat to withhold \n     financing and possibly take over the museum board. This is \n     unequivocally the right action, one that deserves the support \n     of all of New York's cultural institutions. The Mayor's \n     retaliatory announcement that the city will immediately end \n     its subsidy of the museum is an authoritarian overreaction \n     that deserves a swift hearing and repudiation by the courts.\n       Meanwhile, the heads of many of New York City's most \n     important cultural institutions, public and private, have \n     also released a joint letter to Mayor Giuliani. The letter, \n     which ``respectfully'' urges the Mayor to reconsider his \n     threat, is signed by people whose respect, in this instance, \n     seems partly forced by the financial hammer the Mayor wields \n     and by the aggressive personality that leads them to believe \n     he might use it, on the Brooklyn Museum if not necessarily on \n     their own institutions.\n       The joint letter makes all the right points. The Mayor's \n     threatened actions, including taking over the board of the \n     Brooklyn Museum, would indeed be a dangerous precedent. Even \n     a mayor who is not busy playing constituent politics in a \n     Senate race, the way Mayor Giuliani is, might find it \n     tempting to intervene in cultural policy from time to time. \n     But one of the cardinal realities of New York City is that \n     this is a place where artistic freedom thrives, where \n     cultural experimentation and transgression are not threats to \n     civility but part of the texture and meaning of daily life. \n     The letter to the Mayor speaks of the chilling effect his \n     actions against the Brooklyn Museum might have. That is an \n     understatement. A threat as blunt and unreasoned as the one \n     the Mayor has leveled at the Brooklyn Museum promises to \n     begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs, at least \n     until Mr. Giuliani leaves office.\n       The museum directors who have signed the joint letter have \n     made a politic appeal to Mr. Giuliani. It was not the forum \n     in which to lecture him on the nature of artistic freedom and \n     the subtleties of public financing of the arts. But no matter \n     how you assess the art in ``Sensation'' or the motives of the \n     Brooklyn Museum or even the fatigue that the thought of \n     another skirmish in the culture war engenders--a rock-hard \n     principle remains. Public financing of the arts cannot be a \n     pretext\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\n     for government censorship, not on behalf of Roman Catholics \n     or anyone else. The Brooklyn Museum and its lawyer, Floyd \n     Abrams, have found a fittingly aggressive way to make this \n     point in the face of Mr. Giuliani's unremitting attack. Their \n     suit argues that no one can be punished for exercising First \n     Amendment rights. The courts should respond by affirming that \n     those rights belong to the museum and the people of New York \n     no matter how deeply the Mayor is mired in constitutional \n     error.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Now I request, as I believe I said, the quorum call be \nreinstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has suggested the absence of a \nquorum. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Reid amendment \nbe laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1809\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funds for the 21st century community learning \n                            centers program)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. BOXER], for herself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Johnson, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1809.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n\n                21st century community learning centers\n\n       Sec.   . In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this title to carry out part I of title X of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8241 et \n     seq.), $200,000,000 which shall become available on October \n     1, 2000 and shall remain available through September 30, 2001 \n     for academic year 2000-2001.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, simply put, what we do is we add another \n$200 million to afterschool programs. We believe it is very important \nto do this. I have a number of cosponsors.\n  This would take the funding to the President's requested level of \n$600 million. It would enable us to take care of another 370,000 \nchildren.\n  I ask that the Senate support this.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1810 To Amendment No. 1809\n\n (Purpose: To require that certain appropriated funds be used to carry \n     out part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1810 to Amendment No. 1809.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment proposed strike the ``.'' and \n     insert the following: ``(which funds shall, notwithstanding \n     any other provision of this title, be used to carry out \n     activities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) in accordance with the \n     requirements of such part, in lieu of being used to carry out \n     part I of title X)''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the \namendment offered by the Senator from California. What this amendment \nsays is, rather than taking the $200 million, which is new money, brand \nnew money, to be advance funded into next year, and therefore it would \nbe a credit against the 2001 budget--rather than taking that money and \nputting it into a program which the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nalready increased by $200 million, and which has been aggressively \nfunded, before we start out with an additional doubling of that amount, \n$200 million, that we begin the process of fulfilling our commitment to \nthe special ed funds.\n  As I have said almost ad nauseam now on this floor, the Federal \nGovernment agreed to fund special education, when the bill was \noriginally passed, at 40 percent of the cost of special ed. \nUnfortunately, as of about 4 years ago, the percentage of the cost of \nspecial ed which the Federal Government paid was only 6 percent. Over \nthe last 3 years, as a result of the efforts of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the majority leader, and a number of other Senators, that \nfunding has increased dramatically. In fact, the funding for special \neducation in this bill is up by almost $700 million over the last 4 \nyears. If you include this bill, the funding will be up more than 100 \npercent over that time period.\n  But there is still a huge gap between what the Federal Government \ncommitted to do in the area of special education and what we are \npresently doing. Thus, before we begin down the road of a dramatic \nincrease on top of another dramatic increase in funding for the \nafterschool programs, recognizing there is already $200 million in this \nbill for afterschool programs, an extremely generous commitment made by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and by the majority party, I believe we \nshould take any additional funds that are going to go on top of that \n$200 million and put them into the special ed accounts, which is where \nthe local schools really need the support.\n  It may be when the local school districts get this additional $200 \nmillion for special ed, which will free up $200 million at the local \ndistrict, that the local school district may make the decision with \ntheir freed up money, which was local tax dollars, to do an afterschool \nprogram. That may be very well what they decide to do with that. They \nalso may decide to add a new teacher so they can address the class size \nissue. Or they may decide to put in a computer lab. Or they may decide \nto put in a foreign language program. Or they may decide to buy books \nfor the library. But it will be the local school district which will \nhave that flexibility, because they will have had the Federal \nGovernment at least add $200 million more into the effort to fulfill \nthe Federal Government's role in special ed.\n  This is a very important issue. It is one which I have talked about, \nas I said, innumerable times on this floor and raise again with this \nsecond-degree amendment. I think the issue is prioritization.\n  If we are going to start throwing money or putting a great deal of \nadditional money into the Federal effort in education, my view is the \nfirst effort, the first priority is that we fulfill the obligations and \ncommitments which are already on the books which the Federal Government \nhas made to the local school districts. The biggest commitment we made \nto the local school districts which we presently do not fund is the \ncommitment in special education.\n  One can go to almost any school district in this country and ask them \nwhat the biggest problem is they have in the Federal Government's role \nin education, and they will tell you the Federal Government refuses to \nfund its fair share of the cost of the special education child.\n  The effect of that, of course, is we pit the special education child \nagainst parents of children who do not have special education children \nin an unfair way. It has disadvantaged the parents and the special ed \nchild because they are now competing for local resources which should \nbe used for general education activities because those local resources \nhave to be used to replace the Federal obligation which is not being \nfulfilled.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says before we start another $200 \nmillion on top of $200 million for a new program, a program which is \naggressively funded already under this bill, let's do what we have \nalready put on the books as our commitment, which is fund special ed \nwith any additional money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Gregg \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I commend our friend \nand colleague from California, Senator Boxer, for advancing this very \nimportant amendment. It is obviously an improvement over what the House \nof Representatives did, and it is an improvement over the Senate bill.\n  The Senate bill falls short in some important areas in which I \nbelieve we should address if we are going to advance academic \nachievement and accomplishment. We attempted, under the outstanding \nleadership of Senator Murray, to help communities reduce class size and \nnow with Senator Boxer's amendment, we want to help communities expand \nafterschool programs.\n  Tomorrow, there will be an effort by Senator Harkin and Senator Robb \nto address school modernization and construction, and to help more \ncommunities improve the quality of teachers entering the classroom.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership of the issue of after-\nschool programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program has \nbeen vastly popular. Over 2,000 communities applied, but there was only \nenough funding to grant 184 awards.\n  We all have our own experiences with afterschool programs. We have an \nexcellent program in the city of Boston under the leadership of Mayor \nMenino. It is not only an afterschool program, it is also a tutorial \nprogram for children. Most of the afterschool programs have tutors \nworking with children to help them do their homework in the afternoon, \nso that in the evening time, the children can spend quality time with \ntheir parents. That has been enormously important.\n  Secondly, there have been other programs initiated outside the direct \nacademic programs involved in school such as photography programs and \ngraphic art programs where members of the business community work with \nchildren to enhance their interests in a variety of subject matters \nthey might not be exposed to and provide training in specific skills.\n  What every educator involved in afterschool programs will tell you \nis, with an effective afterschool program, we find a substantial \nimprovement in the academic achievement and accomplishment of these \nstudents.\n  In Georgia, over 70 percent of students, parents, and teachers agree \nthat children receive helpful tutoring through what they call the 3 \no'clock Project, a statewide network of afterschool programs. Over 60 \npercent of the students, parents, and teachers agree that children \ncompleted more of their homework and homework was better prepared \nbecause of their participation in the program, and academic achievement \nand accomplishments have been enhanced.\n  What we have seen over the course of the day under Senator Murray and \nnow under Senator Boxer are amendments to support proven effective \nprograms, programs which have demonstrated that they improve academic \nachievement and accomplishment. We simply want to target resources to \nthese successful programs. In Manchester, NH, at the Beach Street \nSchool, the afterschool program improved reading and math scores of the \nstudents. In reading, the percentage of students scoring at or above \nthe basic level increased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third, 33 \npercent, in 1997. In math, the percentage of students scoring at the \nbasic level increased from 29 percent to 60 percent. In addition, \nstudents participating in the afterschool program avoid retention in \ngrade or being placed in special education.\n  There will be those who will say: That is interesting, but they made \nthat decision at the local level to do that. The federal government \ndidn't decide that.\n  If communities want to take advantage of this program, they can apply \nand compete for funding. No one is forcing any particular community to \ntake part in this program. No one is demanding that every school \ndistrict in America accept it. But what we are saying is that there \nwill be additional resources for communities across this country to \ninvest in after-school programs that are improving students' academic \nachievement and accomplishment.\n\n  Afterschool programs also help reduce juvenile crime, juvenile \nviolence, and gang activity, generally preventing adverse behavior of \nstudents.\n  What we see in this chart is that juveniles are most likely to commit \nviolent crimes after school. As this chart shows, which is a Department \nof Justice chart, the time after school, between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., is \nwhen youth are most likely to commit or be victims of juvenile crime.\n  If you talk to our Police Commissioner Evans in Massachusetts, he \nwill tell you one of the best ways of dealing with violent juveniles \nand with the gang problems we have in my city of Boston is effective \nafterschool programs. We know anywhere between 6 and 9 million children \nare at home unsupervised every single day, every afternoon between the \nages of 9 and 15.\n  We are trying to offer children opportunities for gainful activities \nto, one, enhance their academic achievement and accomplishment; and, \ntwo, reduce the pressures that so many young people are under that lead \nto bad and negative behavior.\n  This amendment, again, is talking about an additional $200 million in \na total budget of $1.700 trillion--$1.700 trillion, and we are talking \nabout adding just $200 million. A nation's budget is a reflection of \nits priorities, and we believe that in after-school programs should get \nhigh priority.\n  Finally, we must do far better than the House bill in after-school \nprograms, where they came in $300 million below the President's \nrequest, and in many other education priorities that the House \ndrastically cut. We want to raise the funding levels of the Senate bill \nso that Members going to conference will be able to report out a strong \nafter school program.\n  I thank the Senator from California, again, for making such a \ncompelling case for increased investments in afterschool programs. She \nhas been involved in this issue for years, and she is our real leader \nin the Senate on this question. It is a pleasure to be a cosponsor of \nthe amendment. I thank her for her courtesy in permitting me to speak \nat this time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after consulting with the majority \nleader, if we could come to an agreement on our proceedings for the \nremainder of the evening and tomorrow morning, I would be in a position \nto announce, on behalf of the majority leader, that there would be no \nmore votes tonight.\n  Would the Senator from California and the Senator from New Hampshire \nbe willing to enter into a time agreement to conclude this evening and \nto have two votes scheduled tomorrow morning, first on the Gregg \namendment and then on the Boxer amendment?\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to get a full and complete answer for you, I \nsay to my friend. We are hopeful we will have an agreement. We are \nwaiting to see the final form of that agreement.\n  I would recommend that perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, could make some comments. And then I have a feeling we will then \nhave reached an agreement. I am sure he would pause in his remarks to \naccommodate our making such an announcement. I do not think we have a \nproblem. I think we are going to resolve this very well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, so if I may direct the question through \nthe Chair to the Senator from California, the Senator is not prepared \nnow to enter into a time agreement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct, because I have not seen the actual time \nagreement. I am waiting to see it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have not drafted it yet. It is my suggestion we agree \nto, say, 45 minutes equally divided to conclude the debate on the Gregg \namendment and on the Boxer amendment, and to agree to a half hour \ntomorrow morning, again equally divided, and to vote at 10 o'clock on \nthe Gregg amendment and then on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would yield, I am not sure why we would \nvote on the Boxer amendment if the Gregg amendment survived.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A Boxer second degree. So we can have a straight up-or-\ndown vote.\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We understand if the Gregg amendment prevails, there \nwould be a second-degree amendment by the Senator from California--\nanother Boxer amendment; the same amendment--with a 2-minute speech, \nand then have a second vote tomorrow morning shortly after 10, giving \nthe Senator from California a vote on her issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I would say, with the clear understanding it is a \nBoxer second degree to Gregg, that is quite acceptable. Two minutes to \na side would be good.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may propound the unanimous consent agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the debate this evening on the Boxer \namendment and on the Gregg amendment be concluded in 45 minutes, with \nthe time equally divided, and that tomorrow morning the debate resume \nat 9:30, again equally divided, until 10 o'clock, when there is to be a \nvote on the Gregg amendment; and if the Gregg amendment prevails, then \nthe Senator from California can offer a second second-degree \namendment--which is her current amendment--with 2 minutes of debate, \nand the vote to follow shortly after 10 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object. In fact, I would object to \nthat. I am not sure who else may want to second degree my amendment. I \nam not sure what the proper order will be for recognition relative to \nsecond degreeing my amendment.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the Senator is trying to do is reach an agreement. I \nwould reach an agreement if I knew we would have a vote on my second \ndegree. If you object to Senator Specter trying to be accommodating, \nthat is your choice.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is exactly what I am doing at this time. So I suggest \nwe go forward with Senator Kerry and discuss this further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from New Hampshire repeat the last \nstatement?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would suggest that we allow Senator Kerry to speak and \nthen we can discuss this.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me make one more effort.\n  I have since been handed a document in writing. On behalf of the \nleader, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to \nthe pending Gregg amendment at 10 a.m. on Thursday, and immediately \nfollowing that vote, if agreed to, Senator Boxer be recognized to offer \na second degree, the text of which is amendment No. 1809, and there be \n2 minutes for debate to be equally divided prior to a vote in relation \nto the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object to that at this time, until I have a chance to \ntalk to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. For purposes of a unanimous consent request, so we can \nallow Senators to go home, I think we have a formula worked out.\n  On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on \nor in relation to the pending Gregg amendment at 10 a.m. on Thursday; \nthat immediately following that vote, if agreed to, Senator Boxer be \nrecognized to offer a second degree, the text of which is amendment No. \n1809, and there be 2 minutes for debate to be equally divided prior to \na vote in relation to the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Further, I ask unanimous consent that the debate on the \npending Gregg and Boxer amendments be concluded within 45 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask my friend how much more time he will take \nso I will know how much time I have to speak on this.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I didn't understand there was a time \nlimitation on this component.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Forty-five minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I reserved the right to \nobject previously when the time limit was in. I had understood with the \nsecond offering there was no time limit. I will object to a restraint \nat this time on the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask my colleague, tell us how much time you need, \nand then we will adjust accordingly.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could say to my good friend from California, I am not \nspeaking from prepared text. I would like to just speak my mind.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do you think about 15 minutes would do it?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am sure I could complete it in that period of time, and \nI don't want to shortchange the Senator because it is her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could ask my friend if he will allow us to add a \nlittle bit more time and have an hour equally divided, after the \nSenator finishes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will accept that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in light of that agreement, I am \nauthorized to say on behalf of the majority leader that there will be \nno further votes this evening. The next votes will occur in back-to-\nback sequence at 10 a.m. on Thursday. The Senate will reconvene at 9:30 \na.m. on Thursday, with an additional 30 minutes for closing debate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from the \nSenator from California. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania that \nif at some point in time he needs to proceed forward on a unanimous \nconsent request, I would be happy to accommodate.\n  Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from California is an \nextraordinarily important amendment for a lot of different reasons. I \nshould like to share some thoughts about that with my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  It is perhaps a propitious moment for the Senator from Oregon to \nassume the chair because he has joined me in an effort to try to change \nthis very debate that we are having right now on the floor of the \nSenate, where we have already had one series of votes that have been \npredicated essentially on the same old breakdown of communication with \nrespect to how we are going to deal with education. It was a pretty \nmuch party-line vote. It was a vote that reflected an effort to try to \nblock grant money so States could have adequate flexibility to be able \nto make choices, but on the other hand it did not target it \nsufficiently and clearly enough for those on the Democrat side, and \nthere was no real meeting of the minds.\n  So once again, the Senate--on the subject most important to \nAmericans--talked past each other, and we wound up with a fairly rote, \nvery clearly partisan vote that takes us nowhere.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, and I have obviously \ntried to suggest to our colleagues that there is a different way to \napproach this question of education, and that, in fact, most of us are \nnot that far off. We are sort of fighting at the margins, when the real \nfight is in the center over how best our children can be educated.\n  I do not believe that it is impossible for us, as Members of this \ngreat deliberative institution, to be able to come to agreement on \nthings that are best for children.\n  We are not trying to build a system for adults. We are not trying to \nperpetuate a system that serves the administrators or just the teachers \nor just the principals; it is the children this is about. It seems to a \nlot of us here in the Senate that there are some better ways to come at \nthat.\n  The specific amendment of the Senator from California is to fund the \nafterschool programs to the level that the President requested.\n  I find that there is a great circularity in the arguments of our \ncolleagues on the Senate floor that somehow misses the mark, even when \nyou are talking about this amendment of the Senator from California.\n  We often hear from colleagues: Well, we want the local communities to \nbe\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nable to do these things and make up their minds about them. The fact \nis, local communities all across this country have made up their minds \nabout afterschool programs.\n  I think it is about 95 percent of the local communities in this \ncountry that would like to put an afternoon program into their school \nstructures, but they cannot. Here it is: 92 percent of Americans favor \nafterschool programs. I am saying that I believe if you ask the \nadministrators in any particular school district, they will leap at an \nafterschool program. Give us an afterschool program. They plead for it. \nTheir teachers plead for it. Why? Because kids are going home from \nschool to apartments or houses where there is no adult. As an \nalternative to the afterschool program, they turn on the TV, if they \nare lucky, if they have a TV. Other kids are hanging around in a \ncourtyard with other kids playing various kinds of games, often getting \ninto trouble, sometimes being sucked into gangs or other kinds of \nactivities.\n\n  The fact is, most mayors in the country, most school boards in the \ncountry are trying to put together afterschool programs. So what is the \nhangup? The hangup is, far too many urban centers and rural settings in \nAmerica simply can't afford to put in the programs because their \nschools are paid for from the property tax. The schools are set up, as \nschools were originally designed, to essentially follow the old \nagrarian pattern. You go to school early in the morning; you get out in \nthe afternoon; you work in the fields. That was the original concept.\n  That is not what happens in America anymore. Every day we turn out 5 \nmillion of our children who go back to homes and apartments where there \nis no adult, sometimes until 6 or 7 in the evening. About 8 or 10 years \nago, the Carnegie Foundation told us the hours of 2 to 6 in the evening \nare the hours when most children get into trouble. They get into \ntrouble with the law or they get into trouble with value systems, when \nthey do things such as having children that children are not supposed \nto have, age 13, 14, 15. Most of the unwanted pregnancies in this \ncountry, according to the Carnegie Foundation study, occur during those \nhours when parents aren't there. Then we wind up with a whole host of \nsubsidiary problems as a consequence of that.\n  Our colleagues are absolutely correct, at least in this Senator's \njudgment. We don't want the Federal Government telling us precisely \nwhat to do. We don't need the Federal Government telling us what kind \nof afterschool program works best. But if in countless numbers of \ncommunities they simply can't afford to even do what they want to do, \nwhat they think is best, do we not have a fundamental responsibility to \ntry to step up and help to bridge that gap? Hasn't that been a \ntraditional effort of the Federal Government throughout the years in \nthe Federal, State, and local partnership? The answer is resoundingly, \nyes.\n  For years, countless lives in the United States of America have been \nmade different and better, and we have fulfilled the promise of \nopportunity in this country because the Federal Government was prepared \nto help local communities be able to make ends meet. Countless \ncommunities in this country can't do it. Every one of us has a \ncommunity like that in our State.\n  We have too many of them in Massachusetts. You can go to Lowell, \nLawrence, New Bedford, Fall River, Holyoke, Springfield, countless \nother cities, old urban centers; they don't have the tax base. They \ncan't raise the property tax. They can't and don't want to properly \nraise taxes on their citizens. Yet here we are with a surplus, with a \n$1.7 trillion budget, with no greater priority in our country than \nraising the standards of education, and we are struggling over $200 \nmillion.\n  Again, we hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle: \nWell, a lot of these problems that the Democrats want to try to cure \nare problems that families ought to take care of or that responsible \nchildren ought to somehow be able to solve by themselves. Once again, \nthat is a circular argument. Every single one of us in this Chamber \nknows that almost 50 percent of the children of this Nation are being \nraised in single parent situations. Because we properly passed a tough \nwelfare bill a few years ago that changes the culture in this country \nabout work, we now require parents, single parents, to be working, and \nwe should. But we have to understand the consequences of that.\n\n  The other part of the circular argument is that we are always hearing \nfrom people on the Senate floor about personal responsibility and the \ncapacity of local communities to solve these problems. If you analyze \nthe reality of that situation, based on what I said about the change in \nthe American family, the requirements of a single parent to be working \nand the lack of adequate child care, the lack of adequate safety places \nfor children, the fact is the absence of afterschool programs, in fact, \nwinds up costing us a huge amount of money. Children who are \nunsupervised wind up not having their homework done, getting into \ntrouble, being less capable of learning, maybe repeating grades, \ncertainly some of them entering that zone of chronic capacity for \nunemployment. In fact, we wind up raising the cost to the taxpayer in \nthe long run for the lack of willingness to invest in the short run.\n  I guarantee my colleagues that what I said is not rhetoric. We can go \nto countless afterschool programs in this country and talk to the \nstudents who are in those programs. They will tell us the difference it \nmakes in their lives.\n  Two weeks ago I went to Lawrence, MA, to a program called Accept the \nChallenge. This is an afterschool program where they go into the high \nschool and interview kids. They find kids who want to accept the \nchallenge of going into this afterschool program, which is tough. It is \nrigorous.\n  I will tell you something. I met the brightest group of kids who want \nto achieve, who want to go to college, who want to live by rules, who \nare gaining enormously in their educational capacity as a result of \ntheir participation in the program.\n  What was interesting is, I even heard from one kid--a Hispanic \nchild--who said he was always talking Spanish in school because they \nhad a bilingual program. He hung around with his friends, he then went \nhome, they spoke Spanish at home, and he wasn't learning English. But \nhe went into the Accept the Challenge Program, an afterschool program. \nIt required that he speak English, interacting with the other students, \nlearning in English. The result was that he himself said: I am proud \nnow, the way I can speak English, and I am far better equipped in my \ncapacity to go beyond, to college, to take the SATs, and to get a good \njob.\n  So there you are--an afterschool program providing the kind of \nstructure that kids need. Ask any child psychologist, or any \npsychiatrist, or any child interventionist. Every single one of them \nwill tell you, as most wise parents will tell you, children need \nstructure, children need a certain amount of guidance.\n  We historically have always looked to college as the first moment \nwhen kids kind of break away and begin to learn how to live without \ntheir kind of structure. Some kids can make it sooner. Some kids can go \nto college. It is extraordinarily hard in the first moments of college, \nwithout the structure, to be able to make ends meet. Some kids flounder \nin that atmosphere. Some kids go to college with more structure, or \nless structure.\n  Why is it, when we know this so well, that we adults allow our school \nsystem to institutionalize the lack of structure in children's lives by \nletting them go home and letting them out of school knowing they are \ngoing to come to school the next day without their homework done and \nwithout the capacity to be able to meet the standards of the school? I \ndon't understand it. I don't think most Americans understand the \nreluctance for accountability.\n  Here we are debating whether or not we are going to put $200 million \ninto afterschool programs that provide structure and guidance and \nsafety for children--safety; I underscore that. An awful lot of kids in \nthis country go back to situations after school where it is chaos; you \ncouldn't do your homework if you were trying to.\n  We ought to be more concerned about that. We have an opportunity to \nbe. General Colin Powell--there is not a more respected figure in the \nUnited States--is struggling trying to make what is called ``America's \npromise'' a reality, struggling to try to leverage the private sector's \ncapacity to help\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\nmake a difference in the lives of our children.\n  You can go into countless numbers of those efforts, whether it is a \nboys and girls club, Big Brother, Big Sister, YMCA, YWCA, the City Year \nprograms, or countless numbers of programs, and you will find the kids \nwho are in them are thriving and the kids who are outside of them are \ngenerally challenged and having difficulties or where you find the kids \nwho are having difficulties, they tend to be the kids who are outside \nof it.\n  In countless numbers of these programs, there are waiting lists that \nare absolutely mind-boggling, with hundreds of kids waiting to get in \nwith the few kids who are on the inside. And the question is, Why? Are \nwe such a poor country that we don't have the ability to offer \nsanctuary in afterschool programs to every child who needs it or \ndeserves it?\n\n  That ought to be the goal of the Senate. We ought to declare that \nevery single community in this country, with a combination of \ncorporate, local, State, and Federal effort, is going to be able to \nprovide sanctuary, safety, and structure for children in an afterschool \nsetting. That is the great challenge of the Nation.\n  We are going to have a vote tomorrow morning where we are going to \nhave people come to the floor and kind of play a game. They are going \nto suggest, gee, we ought to really fully fund IDEA so we take care of \nthat program the Federal Government already mandated, and we are going \nto strip it away from here.\n  I agree. We ought to fully fund IDEA. We ought to vote if we are \nreally going to have a first-class education system in this Nation. \nFrankly, I think we can do both. But the question will be put to the \nSenate ultimately at some point in time as to whether or not we are \nprepared to do that or whether we just want to play these games that go \nback and forth and in the end do not ultimately reform our education \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me say I am convinced there is a \ncapacity to build a bipartisan compromise on education. I think we all \nhave to begin to look for a different way of doing that from that which \nwe have allowed ourselves to embrace over the course of these past \nyears. If all we do is come to the Senate floor and debate whether or \nnot we are going to have vouchers versus school construction or one \nparticular program versus another, then I think we are going to be \nguilty of perpetuating the crisis of education in America.\n  If, on the other hand, we try to be holistic--looking at the whole \nquestion of the education system, respecting the capacity and desire of \nlocal communities to be able to make their decisions, but empowering \nthem to be able to do so by leveraging the specific kinds of things \nthey would like to do by placing large sums of money at their disposal \nto be able to do it with a strict accountability for the back end--not \nfor the micromanagement of how they go about doing it but to the back \nend--that we measure at the end whether or not whatever route they \nchoose to undertake is in fact educating their children when measured \nagainst the rest of the children in the country, that then we could \nbegin to have accountability in those schools that are failing, I \nbelieve we could marry the best programs of what the Republican Party \nhas offered in their ``Straight A's'' and the business of what the \nDemocrats are trying to achieve in the various proposals we have put \nforward.\n  I hope that ultimately the Senate is going to come to recognize that \nthat is the only way we are going to solve this problem.\n  You could give a voucher to every kid in America. But the bottom line \nis, they have nowhere to go. Take that voucher. Where are you going to \ngo? There are limited seats at the parochial table. There are limited \ncharter seats. There are clearly limited private seats because a lot of \nprivate schools don't want 90 percent of the kids who go to the public \nschool system.\n  Ultimately, there is only one way to fix the education system of \nAmerica. That is to fix the place where 90 percent of America's \nchildren go to school; that is, the public school system.\n  Every time we have something like a voucher program come along, we \nare basically offering America a kind of ``Schindler's List'' for \nschoolchildren. We are saying to them: If you have money, you can buy \nyour way out of your predicament, but we are only going to take so many \nof you. For the rest of you, you are stuck.\n  That is what happened. Some may not think the analogy is accurate. \nBut I will tell you, for those kids stuck in some of those schools \nwhere they don't have opportunity and they don't have progress, it is a \nkind of living death because they are condemned to the lower standards \nof our economy, to the lower opportunities, to the lower pay scales, \nand in many cases, unfortunately, because of other things that happen \nto them, to prisons or even sometimes to violent death in the streets \nof this country.\n  We can do a lot better than that. It is very clear to me that a \ncountry that produced generations that won World War I and World War \nII, that took us through the remarkable transition of the cold war--\nmost of those leaders coming out of public schools and most of this \ncountry's core citizenry coming out of public schools is evidence of \nwhat those schools can be. That evidence is everywhere in this Nation. \nWe have great public schools in places where people are lucky enough to \nhave broken out or to have put together the ingredients of that great \nschool.\n\n  The Senate needs to embrace those things that have allowed those \nschools to be what they wanted to be, to adopt the best practices of \nany other school in the country and to allow them to have the kinds of \naccountability that will lift the entire system. That is the only \ndebate we ought to be having--not saving part of it but saving all of \nit.\n  What the Senator from California is trying to do with this amendment \nis to recognize one critical component of that, one of the most \nimportant components. It is absolutely vital.\n  There are four critical ingredients of educating. One, we continue to \nhave standards. Mr. President, 49 States have now adopted standards or \nare about to adopt standards. Those standards will make a difference.\n  Two, we have to permit our teachers to teach to the standards which \nrequire quality of teaching, ongoing teacher professional development, \nmentoring, higher pay, more teachers, less class size, all of the \ningredients of being able to teach to the standards.\n  Three, we need to provide an opportunity for the children to learn to \nthe standards. That means afterschool programs, the opportunity for \nremedial work, the opportunity for the kind of teachers and other \nefforts that make a difference in their education.\n  Four, we need strict accountability. That means the capacity to be \nable to fire people who don't perform, to be able to help people to \nperform, the capacity to be able to improve our ability to attract a \nbroader cross section of people into the great challenge of teaching, \nand to respect those who are there doing the enormous job they are \ndoing.\n  I hope we can engage in that larger and real debate sometime over the \ncourse of the next few days. I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia. This amendment embraces one of the single most important \nconsiderations of how we will protect our children to learn and how we \nwill provide schools with the capacity to be able to live up to the \nstandards we all want.\n  I congratulate the Senator for this fight. I hope our colleagues will \njoin in a vote for the protection of the children of this country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee and I have discussed the progress of the bill. It is our \nhope, perhaps our expectation, that we can finish this bill tomorrow. \nWe have a fair number of amendments listed so far. We think some can be \nworked out. Others may evaporate, requiring relatively few roll call \nvotes.\n  After consulting with Senator Harkin, I ask unanimous consent all \namendments be filed no later than 12 noon tomorrow.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in light of the objection which has been \nraised, we will renew this request when the Senate reconvenes tomorrow \nmorning at 9:30 when Senators have an opportunity to consider it. If we \nare able\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\nto proceed to complete the bill by the close of business tomorrow, \nthere are substantial benefits for all Senators--although I can't make \nany commitment as to what will be scheduled on Friday. We will renew \nthe request tomorrow morning at the start of the consideration of the \nbill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I support the chairman in \nthat.\n  I understand now because it is late in the day, and evidently it has \nbeen hotlined there are no more votes today, Senators have taken off, \nwithout knowing that we have a deadline at noon tomorrow. They may not \nknow until tomorrow morning.\n  Now that I understand that, I guess it is reasonable we hold off \nuntil tomorrow when we come in. I think tomorrow when we come back, the \nchairman is right, that would be the time to again make that motion to \nhave a time certain when we will have all the amendments in.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains under the \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 30 minutes and the \nproponents, 30 minutes; 30 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Did the unanimous \nconsent agreement start to run at the time it was entered into?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It started after the Senator from \nMassachusetts completed his remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield such time as the Senator from Georgia desires.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Gregg \nof New Hampshire amendment, the second-degree amendment to the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from California.\n  To put this in context, in 1975, the Congress embraced a very \nlaudable idea to assure the appropriate education of students who had \nspecial education needs. It was recognized at the time that this would \nbe a very costly proposal, so the Federal Government agreed to pay 40 \npercent of the costs, the States were to pay 40 percent, and local \njurisdictions were to pay 20 percent.\n  Guess what. From 1975 to 1999, the Federal Government has essentially \nreneged on the deal and has forced the local governments to bear the \nentire costs. Visit any school superintendent, any school board \neducation member, and the first thing they will talk about is the \neffect of this mandate. It is a handcuff on them in terms of dealing \nwith the multiple requirements of funding education in their local \ndistrict. They resent, rightfully so, the fact the Federal Government \nhas not fulfilled its promise.\n  Right now the Federal Government provides 11.7 percent of the \nNation's special education costs. That is about 29 percent less than \nthe original deal. It amounts to an impact on local schools of about \n$10 billion a year.\n  The essence of the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire--and \nhe has said this since he has been in the Senate--is that we have to \ncorrect this problem and that the funding should have a priority over \nvirtually all new programs. Until we fulfill this agreement, we should \nnot be imposing new program after new program after new program on \nlocal governments.\n  When I visit with my superintendents, they don't ask for new \nprograms. They ask for relief from this huge financial burden that has \nbeen impounded upon them by the Federal Government so they can free up \nresources to do the things they think are important in their school \ndistrict. They don't call for a new master principal in Washington to \ntell them what they need to do in their school district. They are \nsaying, do what we promised to do, which will allow them to do the \nthings they need to do.\n  Since President Clinton came to office in 1993, he has never made \nthis special education funding one of his top priorities. Since the \nRepublicans have been in the majority, we have more than doubled the \nPresident's request each year to fulfill this promise. In many years he \nhas not requested any increases that would keep the program in line, \neven with inflation. Most years, the President has asked for no more \nthan a 5-percent increase. This year, in this budget, he asked for less \nthan 1 percent.\n  Meanwhile, from the other side, for laudable reasons, it is: Let's \nadd another program. We will just slip that check over on the side and \nput it in the desk and come with another program. We will just let the \nlocal governments work it out on their own.\n  The real philosophical divide here is that we are saying let's \nfulfill the Federal promise. It is a huge obligation. If we fulfilled \nit in its entirety, we would free up $10 billion locally to allow those \nlocal school boards and local communities to do the things, as I said a \nmoment ago, they believe are important.\n  Right now, what we have done is reneged on the promise, choked the \nfunds at the local level, and have just come on, year after year, with \neither another mandate or another idea from Washington about what is \nbest in a local community. So this debate we are having on the \namendment of Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, as a second-degree \namendment to that of Senator Boxer from California, is a very crucial \nand symbolic example of the differences we have been debating here all \nday.\n  Earlier it was the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, who was \ngoing to mandate that a certain amount of funds be used to hire x \nnumber of teachers, and Senator Gorton from Washington was saying no, \nthe funds should be flexible so the local community could decide what \nis best. It is the same issue on these amendments. We are voting on \nexactly the same kind of question here.\n  So I speak loudly as a proponent for Senator Gregg's second-degree \namendment, which I expect to prevail. And then I will oppose the \nforthcoming amendment from Senator Boxer on the grounds we need to free \nresources at the local level and let local board members decide what is \nneeded in those local districts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I assure my friends I do not intend to \ntake the full time I have allotted to me. That will make the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania very happy. Maybe he might even vote for this \namendment if I keep it very brief.\n  I do thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. I may \ndisagree, we did not get enough for after school, but I have to \nacknowledge, we did get an increase in after school. For that, I am \nvery pleased. But I really do think we need to do more.\n  I think this chart explains it all. You could not find a simpler \nchart. All it says is ``370,000.'' I say to my friend, Senator Specter \nfrom Pennsylvania, and my friends on the other side of the aisle, this \nrepresents the number of children who would be served if my amendment \nwere to pass, an additional $200 million which we forward fund in the \nbill.\n  I think this is a very important number when you stop and think about \nwhat it would mean if 370,000 additional children had the opportunities \nwe are giving at this point to about 1 million--an additional 370,000. \nThat is 370,000 kids who are going to get help with their homework. \nThat is 370,000 kids who will stay out of trouble. That is 370,000 \nchildren who may just get really excited about something such as \ncomputers because they have them in this afterschool program. That is \n370,000 kids who may get excited about becoming a policeman, a fireman, \nor doctor because the community comes into these programs.\n  I know the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees that these programs are \nvery laudable. I just hope at the end of the day, tomorrow at least, by \n10, we could agree to add this $200 million, forward fund it, and it \nwould bring it up to the level President Clinton requested for this \nprogram.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Following the practice I have heard earlier today, I \nwill preface my question with a statement. I do not think anybody will \ncall for regular order.\n  When the distinguished Senator from California says perhaps if her \nspeech is short enough, I might vote for her amendment, that is \nentirely possible. If the speech did not exist, which would imply the \nwithdrawal of the amendment, I would support her position.\n  But the question I have is: We have added $200 million in this bill \nto afterschool programs.\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Harkin, the distinguished ranking member, has \nbeen very supportive of that. We added that money in on the Juvenile \nViolence Prevention Program because, as Senator Harkin has said, the \nsafest place for children is in school. This is one facet on the \ndirection of $851 million to prevent school violence, so we added the \n$200 million.\n  The question arises, after we have stretched on this budget to $91.7 \nbillion, which has gotten the concurrence of a very strong pro-\neducation, pro-health care, pro-worker-safety Senator --the ranking \nmember has accepted that as the maximum amount we could get.\n  When I went to law school, there was a course in legislative process. \nThat course ``ain't learning nothing yet'' compared to what it is in \nreal life to find a bill that Republicans in the Senate will vote for, \nthat can pass conference, and be acceptable to the President.\n  I have a feeling, regardless of how much money would have been added, \nSenator Dodd would have come forward with a request for $2 billion \nmore, Senator Murray with a request for $200 million more.\n  The question I have for the Senator from California: If we had \nincluded $400 million more for afterschool programs, would the Senator \nfrom California have offered an amendment to increase it even more?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have strongly supported, for a very long time, the \nPresident's request--$600 million--I say to my friend. Not only that, \nhe did join me in an amendment I offered earlier on that point. Six \nhundred million dollars is where we ought to be now. To answer my \nfriend, this is not a frivolous amendment by any stretch. The $600 \nmillion is the amount we believe we need. There is a backlog existing. \nThese are real children waiting in lines to come in.\n  Let me assure my friend, I do appreciate the fact that we have gone \nup to $400 million for after school. Believe me, I am very pleased \nabout that. But I do believe, since we all know this is a proven \nprogram, and my friend shares enthusiasm for it, since we know 92 \npercent of the people in the community support it, since we know the \ncrime rate goes up exponentially at 3 o'clock--and the Police Athletic \nLeague has told us how important this is; this is just a list of some \nof the law enforcement organizations that support this--we ought to go \nto the $600 million level.\n  That is the reason I am offering this amendment. It is not to be \ndifficult. It is not to be ungrateful.\n  I want to make a point to my friend. The committee worked very hard. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa did. They added \n$700 million, is my understanding, for IDEA. That is the additional for \nIDEA--$700 million additional.\n  Senator Gregg is just putting another $200 million in. It may pass. \nThat would be an additional $900 million for IDEA. I am for it. I am \nfor it. It is important to take care of kids with disabilities who need \nthe help. We promised the local districts. I am for it. We are also for \nthis.\n  I think it is not out of the question, when we support the money for \nIDEA, we also support the funding for afterschool programs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from California yield for one more \nquestion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When Senator Harkin and I have taken the principal lead \nin crafting this bill, 300 programs, making allocations as we have, \nafter a lot of hard staff work and a lot of hard thinking, the Senator \nfrom California says if we had added $400 million, she would not have \noffered this amendment. What is the reason, what is the rationale, for \n$400 million extra being sufficient?\n  The Senator from California says there are these children waiting. \nBut even after the $400 million would be added, had we done so, would \nthere not be other children waiting? And wouldn't the nature of the \nadd-on process have led to more?\n  Essentially, my question is, to focus it specifically, what are the \nfacts that say $400 million will be sufficient to solve the problem----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Four hundred additional.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Four hundred additional.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I repeat to my friend and colleague, a real leader in \nthis area, this number was not pulled out of a hat. This number comes \nfrom the President's request. The President's request has a \nrationality.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Where did----\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I can make my point. I am happy to yield to my friend, \nnoting I am using my valuable time which I promised I would not use up. \nThe fact is, the President, in his budget request, studied the number \nof applications that were coming in from the districts all across this \nNation and looked at the backlog.\n  It is amazing what we have done. Since my friend has been chairman--I \nneed to compliment him--we went from $40 million for afterschool \nprograms under his leadership and the leadership of the Senator from \nIowa and the President to $200 million. Together we went from $40 \nmillion to $200 million, and now my friend is suggesting we go to $400 \nmillion.\n  What I am suggesting to my friend is there are culled applications \nsitting at the Department of Education--Senator Kennedy pointed them \nout in his remarks; I refer my friend to his remarks--so we know what \nthe backlog is.\n  We know that 184 afterschool applications were funded and 2,000 \napplied. I am not suggesting that every one of those 2,000 is \nmeritorious, but I say to my friend, out of the 2,000 that applied and \nonly 184 were funded, we know there are a lot of good schools in \nPennsylvania and California and Iowa and all over the country. What we \nare saying is, we could probably fund far more than the $600 million, \nbut we believe to ratchet up the program in the right fashion, to get \nit done right that $600 million would be appropriate. It is supported \nby Secretary Riley; it is supported by the Clinton administration, in \naddition to the President himself. I say to my friend, 370,000 more \nchildren would have the opportunity to participate in afterschool \nprograms.\n  Let me one more time show a chart which I showed previously. We see \nwhat happens after school. We see exactly what happens after school \nwhen kids have no place to go: The crime rate goes through the roof. It \nis only as the children return home that the crime rate dissipates. \nThat is why the Police Athletic League is one of the strongest \nsupporters of this amendment. We have a letter from them. It is very \nclear. They say they are working on behalf of the Police Athletic \nLeague to endorse and express our support for the afterschool education \nand anticrime amendment. This one was written when we offered it to the \nEd-Flex bill.\n  I do not need to prolong this debate. Members want to either come to \nthe floor and talk about something else or conclude tonight. I want to \nclose by saying this: I appreciate the fact that the committee, with \nall the demands on it, did increase this program. I am very pleased to \nsee it at $400 million. However, I truly believe if we are to do right \nby our children, funding 184 afterschool programs, when 2,000 applied, \nis not meeting a need.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are continually making the \npoint that we do not want to force this on our local communities. \nBelieve me, we are not forcing this on them at all. What we are \nessentially saying is it is here for you, and they have overwhelmingly \napplied for these funds.\n  When I make my closing argument--I will have 60 seconds tomorrow \nmorning--I am going to show one of my favorite charts, and that is a \npicture of children, an actual photograph of children in an afterschool \nsituation--the look on their faces, the excitement.\n  What an incredible thing for them rather than, A, going into an empty \nhouse and being alone, not being safe; and, B, going out on the corner \nto find out who else is standing on the corner. In the old days, kids \nstood on the corner, and it was not that bad. Today, unfortunately, \nthey get into worse trouble. In the old days, the trouble they got into \nwas not as bad as today.\n\n  We do not want our children to have nothing to do after school. We \nknow when they are idle, bad things can happen, such as getting into \nalcohol problems, getting into drug problems, joining a gang, just \nbecause they are lonely.\n  I look at some of our pages who work so hard and what a good job they \ndo.\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\n They sit here, and sometimes it is hard. They are occupied, and they \nare learning. They listen when we speak. They are picking up things. \nThey are kept busy. Their minds are working.\n  Every child deserves a chance to get that mind going and keep that \nmind going in a positive way. Our children are our future. Every one of \nus gets up and says that day after day. If you mean it, I am giving you \nan opportunity to vote for an amendment that will allow 370,000 kids--\nand let's hold that number up one more time--370,000 kids, and I put \nthat number up because it is a huge number--370,000 more kids under the \nBoxer amendment, under the Clinton administration request, will be \ntaken care of. Think about the range of that number. Think about how \nmany moms and dads will be relieved to know their children were being \ntaken care of.\n  My hat is off to the ranking member, Senator Harkin, and the \nchairman, Senator Specter, but I still believe in my heart of hearts \nthat we should move up to the President's request. It is the right \nthing to do. If Senator Judd Gregg can find another $200 million for \nIDEA--terrific--using the same forward-funding approach we are using, \nthen Senator Gregg ought to also support this afterschool amendment. We \ndid a good thing. We want to make it even better.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and allow the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, without interruption, to wind up his \nargument, and I will see him back on the floor tomorrow morning at 10 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did I understand the Senator wanted to reserve \n1 minute of her time for tomorrow?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, just 1 minute in the morning, which I already have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I shall not ask unanimous consent so the \nSenator from California will not interrupt me. The rules permit her to \ndo so, and I do not want to deprive her of that opportunity.\n  I had posed a question to the Senator from California as to whether \nany amount would be enough. When the Senator from California cites the \nstatistics of 2,000 applications and 184 were granted, and it may be \nthat some were not meritorious, but in order to have funding of all the \napplications or most of the applications, all of them would be 11 times \nthe amount. So from $200 million, say, 10 times the amount would be $2 \nbillion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did not say that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from California is saying she did not say \nthat.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I should have yielded him an opportunity to ask a \nquestion. My friend did not hear me finish my point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not yield for a question, but I \nwill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. He is so kind to me. What I said \nwas, there are many more applications than were funded. I did not \nsuggest that we fund all 2,000.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Why not?\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I said was I felt the program should be ratcheted up \nin a logical fashion, and that we are at the point where the Department \nof Education, Secretary Riley, has stated that $600 million is what he \nneeds and what he can now handle to ratchet up the program.\n  Eventually, I hope my friend shares the view that this ought to be a \nmuch bigger program than it is now. But we cannot go 1 day from $200 \nmillion to $2 billion. No, I do not support that, and I think my \nfriend's attempt to make it look as if I do is simply not correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from California for that comment. I \ndo understand her point of saying that you cannot go that far, but in \nextrapolating and projecting where we would be on the total number of \napplications--as I say, some are not meritorious--one could come up 10 \ntimes the figure of $200 million, which we had. Ten times would be $2 \nbillion, or if you project it a little differently on $200 million and \n$900 million worth of applications were filed, it would be 4\\1/2\\ times \nthat, which would be $900 million.\n  The point I am making is that regardless of what the committee comes \nup with, there is going to be an add-on. When this program was started \nback in 1994, the last year when the Democrats controlled the Congress, \nand there was an extraordinarily competent chairman of this \nsubcommittee, the figure was $750,000 for afterschool programs.\n  It could be said that the social climate of the country disintegrated \nin the intervening time--which was a jocular comment made while we were \nchatting about this. But from $750,000--the last year the Congress was \ncontrolled by the Democrats--the figure then moved to $1 million in \n1997, and then to $40 million in 1998, and to $200 million in 1999, and \nthen doubled for the next fiscal year to $400 million.\n  When the Senator from California said that I had supported her in the \npast on afterschool programs, she is correct, I have. I think \nafterschool programs are vital and necessary. But when Senator Harkin \nand I constructed a budget of some 300 items--and figured that $91.7 \nbillion was the maximum we could stretch it--we left some money for the \nNational Institutes of Health, for drug-free schools, for worker \nsafety, and for many other programs.\n  That is why, much as I dislike doing so, I have to oppose the \nadditional $200 million. In the 19 years I have been here, when \nprograms such as this have been offered, by and large, I have supported \nthem. But when this kind of an enormous effort is made to accommodate \nto the maximum extent possible this important objective of afterschool \nprograms--and it is not enough--I come back to the suggestion I made \nthat no figure we would have reached would have been enough.\n  I think we are about to see that with the balance of the amendments \nwhich are going to be offered, notwithstanding the very large figure \nSenator Harkin and I have come up with, more funds will be added in \nmany lines, which will require a lot of very tough votes that I do not \nlike to cast to oppose those amendments.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 18 minutes \n15 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator is yielding the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 15 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who is controlling the time?\n  I don't know who is controlling the time. If I am on my side, I will \nyield myself a couple minutes.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Is there time on this side remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time on the amendment. The Senator \nfrom California was controlling the 15 minutes 20 seconds remaining. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania is controlling 18 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry. Didn't the Senator from \nCalifornia yield back her time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When she concluded, yes, she did yield back \nthe remainder of her time.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then are we under a time constraint right now? The \nSenator from Pennsylvania has some time left on this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Iowa 5 minutes \nof my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Whatever it takes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized on the \ntime of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  I want to take a few minutes, as I do every year when the debate \ncomes up on IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to \nset the record straight.\n  There is hardly anyone left on the floor but my two good friends, the \nSenator from California and the distinguished chairman, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. But I want to make clear that IDEA, the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, is not a Federal mandate. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire keeps talking about it as a Federal mandate. But \nsaying it does not make it so.\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights \nbill. It is a bill that basically helps the States meet their \nconstitutional obligation. In the early 1970s, there were two court \ncases in which the courts said that if a State chooses to fund public \neducation, then children with disabilities enjoy a constitutional right \nto a free and appropriate public education. A State, if it wanted to, \ncould say: We are not going to fund any public education, and they \ncould do so.\n  But if a State provides a free public education to its children, it \ncannot discriminate on the basis of race or sex or national origin. And \nas a result of these two cases that came up in the early 1970s, they \ncannot discriminate on the basis of disability, either.\n  So as long as a State provides a free public education to its \nchildren, it cannot say, yes, for non-disabled students; but no to kids \nwith disabilities. Constitutionally, they have to provide that free, \nappropriate public education to all kids.\n  In 1975, the Congress said: Look, this is going to be a burden on the \nStates, so we will help. We will help the States with some funding to \nmeet their constitutional obligations. It is not a Federal mandate. So \nwe set up this law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nand we said: OK, we will provide you some funds to help you out if you \ndo these certain things, meet these certain guidelines.\n  No State has to take one penny of IDEA money. We do not force it on \nthem. We do not say: You have to take it. We say: Look, because of the \ncourt cases, you have to provide a free, appropriate public education \nto every child with a disability. What we are saying at the Federal \nlevel is: We are going to help you do that. But, if you want our help \nhere are the guidelines. Follow them and you get the money. That is the \nbasis of IDEA. It is not a Federal mandate.\n  We also keep hearing that somehow we guaranteed to help the States \nmeet 40 percent of the cost of educating the kids with disabilities. \nThat is not so.\n  The maximum award to any State under IDEA would be 40 percent of the \nnational per-pupil expenditure per year for education, not 40 percent \nof the cost of educating the kids in their State with disabilities. We \nsaid the maximum grant would be 40 percent of the national average cost \nof educating every child. That, right now, if I am not mistaken, is \naround $6,850. So $6,850 is the national per pupil average that we \nfunded out of the Federal Government in 1998. The IDEA funding formula \nis 40 percent of the per pupil average or $2,750, give or take a few \ndollars. I am not going to figure it to the exact dollar. Under the \nlegislation we have right now, it is about 11.7 percent. With the \nincrease, it gets it up to about 15 percent. So we do have a ways to go \nbefore we reach the maximum of 40 percent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for a couple more minutes, and then \nI will wrap it up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to make it clear, do I support the goal of getting \nup to 40 percent of the national per pupil expenditure up to $2,750 per \nstudent? I do. But I don't believe we ought to do it at the expense of \nafterschool programs or out of Head Start or anything else. That is \nwhat I dislike about the Gregg amendment. If he wants to come up with \nmore money for IDEA, fine. I will be glad to support him. But to take \nit away from other kids who have needs, I think, is not the way that we \nought to proceed. Quite frankly, I don't know anyone in the disability \ncommunity who would say, yes, take it away from those kids and give it \nto ours. They would say, look, fund the disability programs, fund IDEA, \nbut fund afterschool programs, fund breakfast programs, fund Head Start \nprograms, because these are all our kids and they all have needs. We \nought to appropriately fund all of education.\n  If this Congress gave the same priority to education as it does for \nthe Pentagon, we wouldn't have to make these types of choices. There \nwould be enough for both.\n  We added $4 billion to the Pentagon's budget over what they asked \nfor. When will we ever see the day when we would add $4 billion over \nwhat the Department of Education requested?\n  Those were the basic points I wanted to make. IDEA is not a funding \nmandate. We need afterschool programs. We need IDEA also. I don't agree \nwith stripping funds from one important program to fund another. That \nis why I believe Senator Gregg's amendment has deficiencies.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it has been a good debate, I think.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the pendency of the \nSmith amendment No. 1808, the vote on the amendment be reconsidered and \ntabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated September 17, 1999, from me to Senator Cochran be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad: As a precautionary matter, I think it is \n     advisable for me to recuse myself on the issue of the \n     appropriation for the National Constitution Center since my \n     wife, Joan Specter, is director of fundraising.\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would substitute for \n     me on that issue since you are the senior Republican on the \n     Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin for their hard work on this bill. Although \nit's far from perfect, it's a big improvement over the House version, \nand I know Senators Specter and Harkin have worked diligently to fund \ncritical education and health priorities within the constraints they \nhave faced.\n  I intend to support this bill, Mr. President. But I also need to \npoint out that it's apparently part of a broader plan that would lead \nto using Social Security surpluses. And I think that would be a \nmistake.\n  The additional money for this bill has come by shifting allocated \nfunds from the Defense Appropriations bill. But rather than finding \nsavings in military spending, the leadership intends to declare much of \nthe extra spending as an emergency.\n  What we have here, Mr. President, is a shell game. The Republican \nplan may succeed in circumventing the discretionary spending caps, as \nthey are trying to do. But it doesn't get around another critical \nproblem. It still leaves us on course toward using Social Security \nfunds to run the government.\n  Mr. President, for many months now, we've heard our Republican \nfriends declare their commitment to protecting Social Security funds. \nThey've put together a Social Security lock box in an effort to appear \ncommitted toward that goal--though, I must add, it's a lock box with a \nhuge loophole, and one that does nothing for Medicare.\n  But while declaring their commitment to protecting Social Security, \nMr. President, the Republicans are actually moving to spend Social \nSecurity surpluses. At their current rate, they're going to spend \nroughly $20 billion in Social Security surpluses. And that total could \nwell go higher.\n  Mr. President, I know that many people around here privately believe \nthat there's no alternative to spending Social Security surpluses, and \nwe need that money to fund government adequately. But that's just \nwrong.\n  There's a better alternative. If we simply ask the tobacco industry \nto fully compensate taxpayers for the costs of tobacco-related \ndiseases, we almost certainly could avoid spending Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  Every year, Mr. President, tobacco costs taxpayers more than $20 \nbillion. To its credit, the Justice Department is trying to recoup \nthese costs through civil litigation. But that could take years. \nMeanwhile, Congress can act now to make taxpayers whole. And we should.\n  Mr. President, I've heard Republicans argue for months that pursuing \nmore tobacco revenues is just, and the word they usually use is, \n``unrealistic.'' It's a clever way to avoid responsibility. It's as if \nsome force outside themselves\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nis preventing Congress from asking anything of the tobacco industry. \nBut that's obviously wrong.\n  If the Republican leadership simply decided to ask Big Tobacco to \ncompensate taxpayers, they could do it. It's completely realistic, if \nthey just summon the will to do it.\n  Now, given the close relationship between the Republican Party and \nthe tobacco industry, I realize that's not a politically easy decision \nfor them.\n  But this is a different world than last year, when the tobacco \nlegislation went down.\n  Now we have a Republican Congress about to embark on a money grab of \nSocial Security funds. Compared to that, asking the tobacco industry to \npay their fair share should be less difficult.\n  In any case, Mr. President, it seems clear that the real debate this \nfall is going to be between tobacco and Social Security.\n  And if we end up using Social Security funds to run the government, \nit will because the Republican Congress put Big Tobacco first, not \nSocial Security. I think the American people would be outraged at that. \nAnd that's why I'm hopeful it won't happen.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, and \nchoose Social Security over Big Tobacco. Let's end this money grab, \nreduce youth smoking, and protect Social Security.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year, up to 1 million nurses and \nother health care workers are accidentally stuck by needles or other \nsharp instruments contaminated by the blood of the patients they care \nfor. More than 1,000 of these health care workers will contract \ndangerous and potentially fatal diseases as a result of their injuries. \nThe Reid amendment is very important--it will require hospitals to use \nsafer devices, and it will provide more effective monitoring of \nneedlestick injuries, so that we can take additional steps to deal with \nthis danger.\n  Karen Daley, of Stoughton, MA, is one of those whose lives have been \nforever changed by disposing of a used needle.\n  Karen is a registered nurse and president of the Massachusetts Nurses \nAssociation. In July 1998, as an emergency room nurse at the Brigham \nand Women's Hospital in Boston, she reached into the box used to \ndispose of a needle, and felt a sharp cut. By the end of the year, \nKaren had been diagnosed with HIV and Hepatitis C. I would like to read \nfrom a statement she recently delivered at the Massachusetts State \nHouse, where a bill has been recommended by the relevant committees:\n\n       I have been a practicing nurse for over 25 years. I love \n     clinical nursing and have felt privileged to care directly \n     for thousands of patients over the years. . . . I have \n     developed expertise in my practice over the years that has \n     allowed me to have a significant impact not only on the \n     quality of care my patients receive, but also in the growth \n     and professional development of less experienced colleagues . \n     . . Since January of this year, I have come to terms with the \n     fact that I am infected with not one, but two potentially \n     life-threatening diseases. . . . I have had to have weekly \n     blood tests drawn--over 90 tubes of blood since January. . . \n     . Experience to date is that treating a person infected with \n     both HIV and Hepatitis C is extremely difficult and that each \n     infection makes it more difficult to successfully treat the \n     other.\n       That one moment in time changed many other things. In \n     addition to the emotional turmoil that it has created for \n     myself, my family, my friends, my peers--it has cost me much \n     more than I can ever describe in words. I am no longer a \n     practicing health care provider--I made the decision to not \n     return to my clinical practice setting where I have worked \n     for over 20 years. In the process, I have abruptly been \n     forced to leave many colleagues with whom I've worked for \n     many years and who are as much family as peers to me. The \n     harder decision for me has been the decision I've made not to \n     return to clinical nursing.\n       This injury didn't occur because I wasn't observing \n     universal precautions that are designed to reduce health care \n     workers' exposure to blood-borne pathogens. This injury \n     didn't occur because I was careless or distracted or not \n     paying attention to what I was doing. This injury and the \n     life-altering consequences I am now suffering should not have \n     happened . . . and would not have happened if a safer \n     needlebox system had been in place in my work setting.\n\n  Karen Daley is now battling against two devastating diseases. And it \ndidn't have to happen. Unfortunately, this scene is repeated more than \n1,000 times a year--in communities across the country.\n  Lynda Arnold, a 30-year-old registered nurse and mother of two \nadopted children, is now HIV-positive as a result of a needlestick \ninjury she received in an intensive care unit in Lancaster, PA, in \n1992. She has started the Campaign for Health Care Worker Safety. Lynda \nwrites,\n\n       I no longer work in a hospital. I no longer involve myself \n     in direct patient care. I do not dream of growing old with my \n     30-year-old husband or dancing with my son at his wedding.\n\n  These cases are tragedies, and there are many more. At least 20 \ndifferent bloodborne pathogens can be transmitted by needlestick \ninjuries, including HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.\n  The average cost of followup for a high-risk exposure is almost \n$3,000 per incident--even when no infection occurs. The American \nHospital Association estimates that a case can eventually cost more \nthan $1 million for testing, medical care, lost time, and disability \npayments.\n  Up to 80 percent of needlestick injuries could be prevented with the \nuse of safer needle devices currently available. However, fewer than 15 \npercent of American hospitals use these products. The primary reason \nfor not adopting steps to create a safer workplace is the cost. But the \nconsequences are severe.\n  Safer needle devices do cost approximately 25 cents more than a \nconventional syringe. But the net savings from avoiding the excessive \ncosts associated with workplace injuries are also significant. \nHospitals and health care facilities in California are expected to \nachieve annual net savings of more than $100 million after implementing \na proposal similar to the one now under consideration.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The companion bill in the House has \nalmost 140 cosponsors--including more than 20 Republicans from across \nthe political spectrum.\n  Similar bills have recently passed in California, Texas, Tennessee, \nand Maryland, and have been introduced in more than 20 other States.\n  These protections have the strong support of the American Nurses \nAssociation, Kaiser Permanente, the American Public Health Association, \nthe Consumer Federation of America, and many, many other groups that \nrepresent nurses, doctors, and other health care workers. In addition, \nthe Massachusetts Hospital Association and other State level \nassociations have supported these bills at the State level.\n  There is no excuse for inaction. Time is of the essence. Every day \n3,000 more accidental needlesticks occur. We need to act as soon as \npossible. We owe prompt action and greater protection to those who \ndevote their careers to caring for others.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in my 11 years in the U.S. Senate I have \nrarely seen such an opportunity to fight against big Government and \ndefend local decisionmakers like parents and teachers.\n  The Democrats are signaling their intent to hamstring local schools \nby commanding them to focus their efforts on issues which are deemed \nimportant inside the Capital Beltway, not within their homes and \ncommunities. I feel Montanans know what is best for Montana; we don't \nneed Washington to tell us how to teach our children.\n  Congress should reject a one-size-fits-all approach to education and \nlocal schools should have the freedom to prioritize their spending and \ntailor their curriculum according to the unique educational needs of \ntheir children.\n  For too long, Washington has been part of the problem with education, \nenacting many well-intentioned programs that result in more redtape and \nregulation. Though Washington accounts for only seven percent of \neducation funding, it accounts for 50 percent of the paperwork for our \nteachers and principles. It is time for Washington to lend a helping \nhand to our states.\n  Unfortunately, right now many of our Federal education programs are \noverloaded with so many rules and regulations that states and local \nschools waste precious time and resources to stay in compliance with \nthe Federal programs. It is obvious that states and local school \ndistricts need relief from the administrative bourdons that many \nfederally designated education programs put on States, schools, and \neducational administrators.\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\n  I feel strongly and deeply that Montanans need to be in control of \nMontana's classrooms. I can not vote for anything that does not have \nlocal school control. I will continue to resist the attempts to take \naway your control of your child's schools.\n  Our goal on the Federal level is to help States and local school \ndistricts provide the best possible first-class education for our \nchildren that they can. We need to get the bureaucratic excess out of \nthe face of the local educators so that they can do their jobs more \nefficiently and effectively.\n  Mr. President, we need to fix the problem of Federal controls in \neducation. We need to allow the decisionmaking to be made by the people \nthat we trust to educate our children. That is what really counts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11637-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, the Energy & Water Appropriations \nConference Report for Fiscal Year 2000 passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming vote of 96-3 yesterday. I thank my friend and colleague, \nthe senior Senator from new Mexico and chairman of the subcommittee, \nfor his excellent work in negotiating this bill and bringing back a \nvery strong conference report. I'd also like to commend our \nextraordinarily talented and creative staff, Alex Flint, David \nGwaltney, and Lashawnda Leftwich without whom we could no have finished \nthis bill.\n  There are three programs I would like to highlight. First, the \nconferees have provided $98.7 million for biomass research. Last week, \nthe Subcommittee held a hearing on biomass and heard testimony about a \nproposal by Sealaska Corporation to produce ethanol using surplus wood. \nI urge the Secretary to take a careful look at this project and support \nit within the funds provided.\n  Second, with respect to the wind program, the conferees funded it at \n$31.2 million, an increase over the House level. Over the past few \nyears, the Department has supported the Kozebue wind demonstration \nproject, the only wind generation system in my state. According to the \nNational Weather Service, the windiest cities in the country are in \nAlaska. If the Kotzebue project proves to be cost efficient, wind may \nbecome a major source of electrical power in my state where electric \nrates are as much as ten times the rate in the lower 48: 55 cents per \nkilowatt hour in Alaska versus 5 cents per kilowatt hour in states like \nIdaho. I urge the Department to continue its support of the Kotzebue \nwind project.\n  Lastly, the managers agreed to language urging the Department of \nEnergy to evaluate nuclear medicine technology known as Positron \nEmission Technology or PET.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes strong language \ndirecting the Department of Energy to report back to the committee on \nwhat steps it can take to give immediate support to a new laboratory at \nthe University of California--Los Angeles which will develop pioneering \nnew molecular-based treatments for disease.\n  These new treatments will use genetically engineered mouse models of \nseveral human diseases and track progress with a miniaturized version \nof positron emission tomography (PET) called Micropet.\n  While scientists and clinicians have been able to diagnose and stage \nhuman illnesses, including most types of cancer and other diseases such \nas Parkinson's and Alzheimers' using pet imaging, the UCLA research \npromises to expand the examination of the biologic basis of disease \ninto new treatment of the molecular disorders that scientists now \nbelieve are the cause of disease.\n  I understand that the new laboratory at UCLA will need at least $2 \nmillion in Federal funds during fiscal year 2000 from the other office \nat the Department of Energy, and I hope that the Department will make \nevery effort to provide the needed funds to bring this critical project \non line at the earliest time it can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11637-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11637-S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRACY ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nintroduced by my colleague, the distinguished Senior Senator from \nMississippi, Thad Cochran, and myself earlier this week, the Education \nfor Democracy Act, which will continue successful efforts to enhance \ncitizenship among our nation's youth.\n  Over the last decade, there has been much discussion about the \npurposes, successes and failures of American schools. We talk about how \nschools hold in trust our nation's future--the next generation of \nworkers, parents and artists. One of the most important, and perhaps \nleast mentioned, roles that today's students will play tomorrow is as \ncitizens. Yet, in too many schools citizenship education is an \nafterthought to an American history or government course.\n  The Education for Democracy Act will reauthorize a highly successful \nprogram established by Congress in 1985 that helps meet these needs. \nThe We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution program has \ndemonstrated its effectiveness in fostering a reasoned commitment to \nthe fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy \namong elementary and secondary education students. Now in its twelfth \nyear, this program has provided 24 million students with instruction \nand learning opportunities that enable them to meet the highest \nstandards of achievement in civics and government and that encourages \nactive and responsible participation in government.\n  Studies have shown students benefit across the board from their \nexposure to this powerful program. An Educational Testing Service study \nfound that students at upper elementary, middle and high schools levels \nsignificantly out performed comparison students on all topics studied. \nEven more impressive were the results of a comparison of a random \nsample of high school students in the program with a group of \nsophomores and juniors in political science courses at a major \nuniversity. The We the People . . . high schools students outperformed \nthe university students on every topic tested. Finally, an analysis of \nstudent voter registration at\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\nthe Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada revealed that 80 \npercent of the seniors in the program registered to vote compared to a \nschool average among seniors of 37 percent.\n  Many of us here in this chamber are fortunate to have experienced \nfirst-hand the quality of this program. Each spring, outstanding \nclasses of students from the around the country come to Washington to \nparticipate in the final round of national competitive hearings on the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. While these students' knowledge of \nthe Constitution is impressive, what is most striking is the students' \nexcitement about the Constitution and their government.\n  This legislation would assure that students across the nation will \ncontinue to have access to this quality program. In addition, it would \nassure all of us of a stronger foundation for our country's future. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nforward and would urge others to join us as sponsors of this important \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11638-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

GRANT TO TRIBAL COLLEGES\n\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Lilly \nEndowment for their exceptional contributions on behalf of educational \nopportunities for minorities. In particular, I would like to commend \nthem on their recent announcement awarding $30 million to the American \nIndian College Fund. These dollars would be used to replace buildings \nat 30 tribal colleges on reservations in the West and Midwest.\n  It is important that we continue to support ways to maintain \neducational opportunities for tribal colleges, who receive a \nsignificantly lower level of funding per student than mainstream \ncommunity colleges. Because of these scarce resources, and the need to \nmaintain and increase academic standards, capital improvements have \nbeen forced to the bottom of the priority list.\n  This private donation from the Lilly Endowment is the largest ever \nmade to a Native American organization. These funds will be used to pay \nfor much needed construction of modern classrooms, labs and libraries. \nThis extraordinary contribution will allow these colleges to give their \nstudents the best educational opportunities possible.\n  It is critical that Tribal colleges have the resources to provide a \ncombination of traditional academics and Native American culture for \ntheir students. American Indian students who attend tribal schools are \nfar more likely to succeed at four year institutions. More Native \nAmericans have been attending college, but still at a far lower rate \nthan members of other minority groups. We need to ensure that they are \nhelped to reach their full potential.\n  As a Senator for a state with 7 tribal colleges, I understand the \nimportant role they play in the Tribes' hopes for future generations. \nAcademic success is key to raising the standard of living and quality \nof life for all tribal members.\n  Mr. President, I feel we need to do everything in our power until we \nare successful in addressing the many challenges facing the education \nneeds of our American Indian population. I salute Lilly Endowment's \nincreasingly generous efforts towards this goal.\n  During my time in the Senate I have fought, and will continue to work \nto help make education accessible and affordable to all Montanans. \nTribal colleges are a priority to me. I will continue to look for ways \nto increase federal spending at these institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11638-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting withdrawals \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11638-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                    enrolled joint resolution signed\n\n  At 1:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nAlbania; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        REMOVAL OF ALBANIA FROM JACKSON-VANIK TRADE RESTRICTIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the President to grant permanent Normal Trade Relations \nstatus to Albania, overcoming the so-called Jackson-Vanik restrictions \nin Title IV of the Trade Act. This legislation is urgently needed so \nthat when Albania joins the World Trade Organization later this year, \nthe United States can enter into full WTO relations with this market-\noriented country in the Balkans.\n  Mr. President, I offer this legislation and seek the support of my \ncolleagues for three reasons: First, the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik \nrestrictions are no longer relevant for Albania. We should free our \nrelations with Albania from restrictions applied to communist \ncountries. The Jackson-Vanik restrictions applied to countries with \nnon-market economies which limited emigration. Albania now has a market \neconomy which some may argue needs more regulation. Albanians are now \nalso free to emigrate, sometimes much to the chagrin of Albania's \nneighbors. The President certified Albania to be in compliance with the \nJackson-Vanik requirements in January 1998 and has continued to report \nthat Albania remains in compliance. The certification process is simply \na relic of the Cold War.\n  Second, granting Albania permanent Normal Trade Relations, or NTR, \nstatus through the WTO will encourage and support Albania's free-trade \norientation and integration into the global trading system. Little more \nthan a decade ago, Albania was closed off from the rest of the world by \na severely Stalinist regime. Today, all major political forces in \nAlbania--including the governing Socialist Party and the opposition \nDemocratic Party, which led the first post-Communist government--\nsupport democracy, free trade and integration with the West. A \ndelegation from Albania's Parliament made clear the breadth and depth \nof support for Albania's WTO membership. Albania has enacted virtually \nall the necessary legislation and implementing regulations necessary to \nmeet WTO standards and will implement the rest prior to its WTO \naccession. They will not even require a transition period. We should \nreward this tremendous positive change by welcoming Albania into the \nWTO and opening our markets to Albanian goods on a fair basis \nnegotiated through the WTO.\n  Third, this bill will benefit U.S. firms by securing Albania's \ncommitment to WTO standards and giving the United\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\nStates access to WTO dispute settlement mechanisms with regard to \nAlbania. The annual certification requirement under existing law would \nrequire the United States to demur from entering into full WTO \nrelations with Albania when that country becomes a member later this \nyear. Thus, without the enactment of this legislation, we will not have \naccess to WTO dispute settlement mechanisms and will only be able to \nengage in economic relations with Albania on a bilateral basis.\n  Mr. President, for the reasons I have outlined--moving beyond the \nCold War, supporting development of a market economy and democracy in \nAlbania, and providing WTO protection of market access for American \nbusinesses--I hope the Congress will enact this legislation. The United \nStates has been a leading advocate for Albania's accession into the \nWTO. We should continue that support by passing this legislation. I \nwould ask the Finance Committee and the full Senate to act \nexpeditiously so this bill can be signed into law before Albania \nbecomes a WTO member.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Albania has been found to be in full compliance with \n     the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the \n     Trade Act of 1974.\n       (2) Since its emergence from communism, Albania has made \n     progress toward democratic rule and the creation of a free-\n     market economy.\n       (3) Albania has concluded a bilateral investment treaty \n     with the United States.\n       (4) Albania has demonstrated a strong desire to build a \n     friendly relationship with the United States and has been \n     very cooperative with NATO and the international community \n     during and after the Kosova crisis.\n       (5) The extension of unconditional normal trade relations \n     treatment to the products of Albania will enable the United \n     States to avail itself of all rights under the World Trade \n     Organization with respect to Albania when that country \n     becomes a member of the World Trade Organization.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO ALBANIA.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extensions of \n     Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et \n     seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Albania; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Albania, proclaim the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On or after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Albania, \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to apply to \n     that country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1658. A bill to authorize the construction of a Reconciliation \nPlace in Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                  Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the request of tribal leaders \nthroughout my state, today I am introducing legislation to establish \nthe Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place in Ft. Pierre, South Dakota.\n  This history of South Dakota is carved with the rich cultural \ntraditions of numerous Sioux tribes who lived on the plains for \ncenturies and inlaid with the stories of immigrants who came during the \nlast two hundred years to settle the towns, plow the earth, shepherd \nlivestock and mine gold. The story of that settlement, and the mingling \nof Indian and non-Indian people, has not always been a peaceful one, \nand today in South Dakota we continue to face the challenges of \ndisparate communities of Indians and non-Indians living side-by-side, \noften imbued with misunderstanding and mistrust. As a result, there is \na growing recognition of the need for reconciliation between Indian and \nnon-Indians.\n  It is my hope that through the establishment of a Reconciliation \nPlace, we can promote a better understanding of the history and culture \nof the Sioux people and by doing so, achieve better relations between \nIndian and non-Indian peoples. The Reconciliation Place will provide a \nhome for a center of Sioux law, history, culture, and economic \ndevelopment for the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes of the upper \nMidwest, and thus will help preserve the strong and unique cultural \nheritage of the Sioux.\n  The Reconciliation Place will enhance the knowledge and understanding \nof the history of the Sioux by displaying and interpreting the history, \nart, and culture of the tribes of this region. It will also provide an \nimportant repository for the Sioux Nation history and the family \nhistories for individual members of the tribes, and other important \nhistorical documents. The majority of the historic documents and \narchives of this region are kept in government facilities that are \nscattered across the West and are almost inaccessible to the people of \nthis area. The Reconciliation Place will provide a central repository \nfor these important elements of Sioux history, allowing easy access to \ntribal members interested in exploring their past.\n  By empowering the Sioux tribes to establish their own Sioux Nation \nSupreme Court, the bill will help achieve greater social and economic \nstability in Indian Country. Moreover, the court will bring the legal \ncertainty and predictability to the reservations necessary for \nbusinesspeople to have the confidence to make investments in tribal \nenterprises. This, in turn, will generate the economic infrastructure \nneeded to create more jobs on reservations.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a Native American Economic \nDevelopment Council to assist the Sioux tribes by providing \nopportunities for economic development and job creation. Specifically, \nthe council will provide expertise and technical support to Indians to \nhelp gain access to existing sources of federal assistance, while \nraising funds from private entities to match federal contributions. \nFunding obtained by the Council will be used to provide grants, loans, \nscholarships, and technical assistance to tribes and their members, for \nbusiness education and job creation.\n  Mr. President, the need for this Reconciliation Place is clear. It \nwill provide a focal point for public and private organizations to \nbetter assist Native Americans to protect their past, strengthen their \npresent, and build a bright economic future. The Reconciliation Place \nwill respect and compliment the government-to-government relationship \nestablished between the tribes and the United States. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the establishment of this Reconciliation Place \nand am hopeful that this legislation can be enacted in the near future. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of \nsupport by tribal leaders from South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska \nto the Wakpa Sica Board of Directors be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is a continuing need for reconciliation between \n     Indians and non-Indians;\n       (2) the need may be met partially through the promotion of \n     the understanding of the history and culture of Sioux Indian \n     tribes;\n       (3) the establishment of a Sioux Nation Tribal Supreme \n     Court will promote economic development on reservations of \n     the Sioux Nation and provide investors that contribute to \n     that development a greater degree of certainty and confidence \n     by--\n       (A) reconciling conflicting tribal laws; and\n       (B) strengthening tribal court systems;\n       (4) the reservations of the Sioux Nation--\n       (A) contain the poorest counties in the United States; and\n       (B) lack adequate tools to promote economic development and \n     the creation of jobs; and\n       (5) the establishment of a Native American Economic \n     Development Council will assist in promoting economic growth \n     and reducing poverty on reservations of the Sioux Nation by--\n       (A) coordinating economic development efforts;\n       (B) centralizing expertise concerning Federal assistance; \n     and\n       (C) facilitating the raising of funds from private \n     donations to meet matching requirements under certain Federal \n     assistance programs.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to convey the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project, \nthe Savage Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, and the \nIntake Irrigation Project to the appurtenant irrigation districts; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Projects title Transfer\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that helps a large number of family farms on the border of \nMontana and North Dakota. The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Projects \nTitle Transfer moves ownership of these irrigation projects from \nfederal control to local control. Both the Bureau of Reclamation and \nthose relying on the projects for their livelihood agree that there is \nlittle value in having the federal government retain ownership.\n  The history of these projects dates to the early 1900's with the \noriginal Lower Yellowstone project being built by the Bureau of \nReclamation between 1906 and 1910. Later, the Savage Unit was added in \n1947-48. The end result was the creation of fertile, irrigated land to \nhelp spur economic development in the area. To this day, agriculture is \nthe number one industry in the area.\n  The local impact of the projects is measurable in numbers, but the \ngreatest impacts can only be seen by visiting the area. About 500 \nfamily farms rely on these projects for economic substance, and the \nentire area relies on them to create stability in the local economy. In \nan area that has seen booms and busts in oil, gas, and other \ncommodities, these irrigated lands continued producing and offering a \nfoundation for the businesses in the area.\n  As we all know, agriculture prices are extremely low right now, but \nthese irrigated lands offer a reasonable return over time and are the \nfoundation for strong communities based upon the ideals that have made \nthis country successful. The 500 families impacted are hard working, \nhonest producers, and I can think of no better people to manage their \nown irrigation projects.\n  Everyday, we see an example of where the federal government is taking \non a new task. We can debate the merits of those efforts on an \nindividual\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\nbasis, but I think we can all agree that while the government gets \ninvolved in new projects there are many that we can safely pass on to \nstate or local control. The Lower Yellowstone Projects are a prime \nexample of such an opportunity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nseeing this legislation passed as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1661. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide \nthat certain voluntary disclosures of violations of Federal law made as \na result of a voluntary environmental audit shall not be subject to \ndiscovery or admitted into evidence during a judicial or administrative \nproceeding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the environmental protection partnership act of 1999\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lott, \nI am introducing the Environmental Protection Partnership Act of 1999. \nBy introducing this bill, I am suggesting that the Federal Government \ntake a cue from the States regarding environmental protection. Many \nState governments have passed laws that allow for voluntary audits of \nenvironmental compliance. These laws encourage a company to conduct an \naudit of its compliance with environmental laws. By conducting the \naudit, the company determines whether it is in compliance with all \nenvironmental laws. If it is not, these state laws allow the company, \nwithout penalty, to correct any violations it finds so it will come \ninto compliance.\n  What the bill does is let the Federal Government do the same thing. \nIt lets the Federal Government say to companies all over America, if \nyou want to do a voluntary audit for environmental compliance, we are \ngoing to let you do that. We will encourage you but not force you to do \nit. And we are not going to come in and threaten you with the hammer of \nthe EPA if you, in fact, move swiftly to come into compliance when you \nfind that you are not in compliance.\n  I believe this is the most effective way to clean up the air and \nwater. Our air and water are invaluable natural resources. They are \ncleaner than they have been in 25 years, and we want to keep improving \nour efforts to guarantee their protection. This bill will ensure this \nprotection, in the same fashion as many States have done. It does not \npreempt State law. If State laws are on the books, then the State laws \nprevail. But this offers companies all over our country the ability to \ncomply with Federal standards in a voluntary way, to critically assess \ntheir compliance and not be penalized if they then take action to \nimmediately come into compliance.\n  My bill will ensure that we continue to increase the protection of \nour environment in the United States through providing incentives for \ncompanies to assess their own environmental compliance. Rather than \nplaying a waiting game for EPA to find environmental violations, \ncompanies will find--and stop--violations. Many more violations will be \ncorrected, and many others will be prevented.\n  Under the bill, if a company voluntarily completes an environmental \naudit--a thorough review of its compliance with environmental laws--the \naudit report may not be used against the company in court. The report \ncan be used in court, however, if the company found violations and did \nnot promptly make efforts to comply. By extending this privilege, a \ncompany that looks for, finds, and remedies problems will continue this \ngood conduct, and protect the environment.\n  In addition, if a company does an audit, and promptly corrects any \nviolations, the company may choose to disclose the violation to EPA. If \nthe company does disclose the violation, the company will not be \npenalized for the violations. By ensuring companies that they will not \nbe dragged into court for being honest, the bill encourages companies \nto find and fix violations and report them to EPA.\n  This does not mean that companies that pollute go scot-free. Under \nthis bill, there is no protection for: willful and international \nviolators; companies that do not promptly cure violations; companies \nasserting the law fraudulently; or companies trying to evade an \nimminent or ongoing investigation. Further, the bill does not protect \ncompanies that have policies that permit ongoing patterns of violations \nof environmental laws. And where a violation results in a continuing \nadverse public health or environmental effect, a company may not use \nthe protections of this law.\n  Nor does this bill mean that EPA loses any authority to find \nviolations and punish companies for polluting. EPA retains all its \npresent authority.\n  At the same time that EPA retains full authority to enforce \nenvironmental laws, I propose to engage every company voluntarily in \nenvironmental protection by creating the incentive for those companies \nto find and cure their own violations. This frees EPA to target its \nenforcement dollars on the bad actors--the companies that intentionally \npollute our water and air.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Lott, Senator \nHatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as well as the rest of my \ncolleagues in the Senate on this bill, which will pave the way to \nincreased environmental compliance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grams, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 1662. A bill to grant the President authority to proclaim the \nelimination or staged rate reduction of duties on certain environmental \ngoods; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     tariffs on environmental goods\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, since the end of the Second World \nWar, the United States has led the world in establishing an open, rule-\nbased trade system. I believe it is very important that we continue to \nprovide this leadership. We can only do this if we maintain a domestic \nconsensus on trade policy.\n  The United States has also provided strong international leadership \non environmental protection. I have long been a strong proponent of \nboth open trade and environmental protection. I have a foot in both \ncamps. So today I am proud to introduce a bill which addresses both \ntrade and the environment. I am joined in this effort by Senators \nGrams, Murray, and Wyden.\n  I know people in the trade community who assume that anything good \nfor the environment must be bad for business. They believe that \nprotecting the environment means more government restrictions, higher \ncosts, and lower profits. This logic is flawed.\n  I also know people in the environmental community who assume that \nanything good for trade must be bad for the environment. They believe \nthat more trade means more growth, and that more growth means more \ndamage to the environment. This logic is flawed, too.\n  We can take measures which benefit both trade and the environment. I \nam proposing one such measure today: eliminating import duties on \nenvironmental products as part of a multilateral agreement. This enjoys \nwide support from American environmental technology companies, as well \nas from members of the environmental community.\n  Mr. President, let me recall a bit of recent trade history. During \nthe Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the United States participated \nin a number of sectoral tariff initiatives. They were known as ``zero-\nfor-zero.'' Countries agreed to reciprocal tariff elimination, saying \n``I'll put my tariff at zero, if you'll do the same.''\n  The Uruguay Round Act gave the President the authority to eliminate \nU.S. tariffs in these ``zero-for-zero'' sectors. But in several \nsectors, the negotiators did not reach agreement. The President retains \ntariff authority in these sectors. Examples are products like furniture \nand paper. Some of these sectors are once again under discussion in the \nWTO.\n  In addition to these unfinished Uruguay Round sectors, the United \nStates launched other zero-for-zero initiatives. This work began in the \nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and then moved to the \nWTO. One of the sectors under discussion is environmental goods.\n  Environmental goods cover a wide range of products made in America to \ncontrol air, water and noise pollution, as well as solid and hazardous \nwaste. These products include equipment for recycling and for renewable \nenergy.\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\n They include technology for remediation and cleanup. Environmental \ngoods also include scientific equipment for monitoring and analysis. \nAll told, U.S. firms sell somewhere between $20 and $40 billion abroad \nannually. They could sell more if other countries would eliminate trade \nbarriers, including tariffs.\n  In my home state of Montana, businesses which export environmental \nequipment could expand their operations if they faced fewer foreign \nbarriers. I have heard from one company, SRS Crisafulli, which is \nworking in Latin America markets. Tariffs on their dredging equipment \nraise their sales price substantially. The inexorable law of the market \nis that higher sales prices mean lower sales.\n  As my colleagues know, the United States maintains the world's most \nopen market. Our tariffs are generally low. They are especially low on \nenvironmental goods, where U.S. import duties average less than 2%. \nThis bill I am introducing today would eliminate these small tariffs--\nnuisance tariffs, really. In return, other countries would abolish \ntheir import duties on American-made products. Their tariffs can be \nthree or four times higher than ours. That's a good deal for us, and a \ngood deal for world trade.\n  It's also a good deal for the environment. The biggest importers of \nthese products are the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin \nAmerica. Expanding the use of environmental technology will help limit \nor remedy environmental damage. It will have a positive impact on \npublic health and the quality of life.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing preserves Congress' \nconstitutional role in foreign trade. It requires the President to \nconsult with us before implementing any environmental tariff cuts. And \nI would like to put our trade negotiators on notice that we expect them \nto bring to us a proposal with broad coverage, rapid staging and \nlimited exceptions.\n  I am particularly concerned about the scope of the agreement now \nbeing negotiated. I understand that some of our trading partners in \nAPEC were unwilling to classify certain products as ``environmental \ngoods'' because they are ``dual use.'' A hydraulic pump, for instance, \ncan be used for either a sewage treatment plant or a microchip plant. \nWe should press other countries to adopt a broad definition of \n``environmental goods'' to encourage dissemination of technology.\n  Mr. President, ever since environmental tariff elimination surfaced, \nthe U.S. told our trading partners not to worry that the President \nlacks tariff-cutting authority in the sector. When the time comes, we \nsaid, Congress will grant the necessary authority. I believe this \neffort merits the same kind of support from the Senate that it has \ngained support among the trade and environmental communities. It is \nparticularly important that we show this support now, as the United \nStates prepares to host the WTO Trade Ministers Meeting in Seattle. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to provide this support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. BENNETT:\n\n  S. 1664. A bill to clarify the legal effect on the United States of \nthe acquisition of a parcel of land in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in \nthe State of Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         red cliffs desert reserve land acquisition legislation\n\n  S. 1665. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to release \nreversionary interests held by the United States in certain parcels of \nland in Washington County, Utah, to facilitate an anticipated land \nexchange; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 land exchange facilitation legislation\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am introducing two bills which \naddress minor technical issues in Washington County, Utah. Given the \nnon-controversial nature of these bills, I am hopeful they will be \ngiven quick consideration.\n  The first bill deals with a land exchange between the city of St. \nGeorge and the BLM to facilitate a Washington County, Utah habitat \nconservation plan for the desert tortoise. The parcel of land at issue \nwas once used as a landfill. The BLM is interested in acquiring the \nland in an exchange, but it is reluctant to accept liability for any \nunknown toxic materials that may be in the landfill. The bill would \nleave liability for the landfill in the hands of the city. Both the BLM \nand the city of St. George are in favor of this legislation.\n  The next bill deals with an exchange between the State of Utah and a \nprivate party. This exchange would facilitate additional protection for \nthe endangered desert tortoise. The parcels of land that the State \nwants to trade were given to them pursuant to the Recreation and Public \nPurposes Act and consequently have a BLM reversionary clause clouding \ntitle to the property. This bill would remove those reversionary \nclauses so that the State could pass clear title in the land exchange.\n  I appreciate once again the leadership of Chairman Hansen on the \nHouse Committee on Resources in taking the lead on these bills in the \nother body and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nSenate Energy Committee to move these bills quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. \n        Helms):\n  S. 1666. A bill to provide risk education assistance to agricultural \nproducers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      farmers' risk management act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp our nation's farmers cope with the risks inherent in production \nagriculture.\n  My colleagues are familiar with the challenges facing American \nfarmers. Prices are down world-wide. Exports are lower than expected, \nin large part due to the economic problems in Asia. Weather problems, \nfrom droughts to floods, have plagued large portions of our country.\n  The Senate has passed, and a conference committee is considering, an \nagricultural appropriations bill that contains emergency provisions to \ndeal with these immediate needs. For the intermediate and long term, \nthe Congressional budget resolution contains $6 billion for use in \nfiscal years 2001-2004 that can be used as direct payments or to help \nfarmers manage risk. Given these available funds, the question for \npolicymakers is how best to help farmers manage the risks that they \nface.\n  Some suggest that the entire $6 billion should be used to alter the \nsubsidy structure of the federal crop insurance program. I believe that \nrisk management is broader than crop insurance alone. To keep U.S. \nagriculture competitive, farmers will have to consider a variety of \npractices including: engaging in sophisticated marketing practices; \nreducing debt; considering alternative crops; and purchasing crop \ninsurance. An approach to risk management that focuses on the crop \ninsurance program's subsidy structure is too narrow to address the many \nrisks faced by farmers.\n  In crafting my own risk management bill, I was guided by four \nprinciples. First, the greatest possible amount of the $6 billion \nshould go directly to farmers. In the crop insurance program, private \ninsurers receive substantial compensation for selling and servicing \nmulti-peril policies on the government's behalf. Overall, the insurance \ncompanies receive about one-third of the federal financial support of \nthe program. Farmers get the remaining two-thirds. In my view, farmers \nshould receive more of the new federal spending.\n  Second, the $6 billion should be provided in such a manner so that it \ndoes not distort planting decisions. Leading economists believe that \ncrop insurance encourages the planting of crops on marginal and \nenvironmentally challenged acreage. Federal risk management spending \nshould not inadvertently subsidize overproduction when world-wide \nagricultural stocks are already large. Subsidizing overproduction \npostpones the day when agricultural prices will rebound.\n  Third, the $6 billion should be distributed equitably among farmers \nand among regions. In terms of eligible 1998 acres insured, farmers' \nparticipation by state ranges from a low of 4 percent to a high of 93 \npercent. Clearly, farmers in some parts of the country do not view crop \ninsurance as a useful risk management tool. By spending the bulk of the \nincreased federal assistance on crop insurance, we are denying farmers \nin\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\nsome parts of the country risk management help.\n  Fourth, farmers should be encouraged to pursue a variety of risk \nmanagement strategies, including, but not limited to, crop insurance. \nWithin broad parameters, farmers should be able to choose the risk \nmanagement strategy that best meets their needs.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today complies with my four \nprinciples. First, of the $6 billion in available new spending, over $5 \nbillion is sent directly to farmers. Second, because the money is sent \ndirectly to farmers and is based on historical production, it is far \nless likely to distort planting decisions. Third, because it is not \nlimited only to one form of risk management--crop insurance, it is more \nequitable among regions. Fourth, in order to better meet farmers' \nindividual needs, it lets farmers choose risk management strategies \nfrom a menu of options.\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, for the 2001-2004 \ncrops, to offer to enter into a contract with a producer in which the \nproducer receives a risk management payment if the producer performs at \nleast 2 of the following risk management practices each applicable \nyear:\n  1. Purchase Federal or private crop insurance (e.g., private crop \nhail) that is equivalent to at least catastrophic risk protection, for \nat least one principal agricultural commodity produced on the farm for \nwhich federal crop insurance is available.\n  2. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk by entering into at least \none standard exchange-traded contract for a future or option on a \nprincipal agricultural commodity (crops or livestock) produced on the \nfarm.\n  3. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk on at least 10% of the \nvalue of a principal agricultural commodity produced on the farm by \npurchasing an agricultural trade option.\n  4. Cover at least 20% of the value of a principal agricultural \ncommodity (crops or livestock) produced on the farm with a cash forward \nor other type of marketing contract.\n  5. Attend an agricultural marketing or risk management class. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, a seminar or class conducted by a \nbroker licensed by a futures exchange.\n  6. Deposit at least 25% of the risk management payment into a FARRM \naccount, or a similar tax deductible account.\n  7. Reduce farm financial risk by reducing debt in an amount that \nreduces leverage, or by increasing liquidity.\n  8. Reduce farm business risk by diversifying the farm's production by \nproducing at least one new commodity on the farm, or by significantly \nincreasing the diversity of enterprises on the farm.\n  A producer's annual risk management payment will be based on his or \nher Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) average actual production \nhistory (APH) established for the 2000 crop for each Federally \ninsurable agricultural commodity grown by the producer. Under existing \nFCIC procedures, the average APH for a commodity for crop year 2000 is \nbased on a producer's documented production and acreage history from at \nleast 4 of the 10 immediately preceding crop years.\n\n  Let me give a hypothetical example of how this would work at the farm \nlevel. Suppose a farmer produces corn, soybeans, and apples for the \nfresh apple market on a total of 525 acres somewhere, let's say, in the \neastern half of the country. Corn and soybeans are federally insurable \nthroughout the country and apples are federally insurable in most areas \nthat have significant apple production. Let's further suppose that this \nhypothetical producer has never purchased federal crop insurance \nbefore.\n  Under my bill, this grain and apple farmer would be eligible for risk \nmanagement payments for each of the 2001 through 2004 crops based on \nhis average actual production history for corn, soybeans, and apples \nfor the four crop years covering 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. He could \ndocument more than four years of production history, but FCIC \nprocedures require a minimum of four consecutive years. Let's suppose \nthe producer's average production is 30,000 bushels of corn based on \n250 acres; 10,000 bushels of soybeans based on 250 acres; and 11,548 \nbushels of apples based on 25 acres. The producer's average APH would \nbe valued at the 1997-1999 average FCIC established price level for \neach crop. This price is $2.38 per bushel for corn and $5.80 per bushel \nfor soybeans. The apple price varies by region. For this example, I \nwill use a fresh apple price of $4.17 per bushel (42 pounds/bushel) \nwhich would be the applicable price for fresh apples in one of the \neastern region's major apple-producing states. At these prices, the \nvalue of the producer's average APH across all crops (rounded to the \nnearest dollar) would be $177,554.\n  The amount of the producer's annual risk management payment would be \nbased on a percentage payment rate determined by the Secretary of \nAgriculture based on $1.275 billion for each of the 2001 through 2004 \ncrops for a cumulative total of $5.1 billion. Preliminary estimates \nsuggest that the payment rate will be somewhere between 1 percent and 2 \npercent of production value if 100 percent of the eligible farmers sign \nup for risk management payments. Thus, a reasonable estimate is that \nthe percentage payment rate will come out at 1.5 percent of production \nvalue. If this estimate turns out to be correct, our hypothetical grain \nand apple farmer's annual risk management payment (rounded to the \nnearest dollar) would be $2,663. The 2001 payment would be available to \nthe farmer on or after October 1, 2000, approximately one year from \ntoday.\n  In order to qualify for his risk management payment each year, the \nfarmer would have to certify with the Agriculture Department that he \nhad obtained or used 2 of the 8 risk management practices each year. He \ncould do this in a large number of ways. For example, he could qualify \nby purchasing crop multi-peril crop insurance on his 2001 corn or \nsoybean production and cash forward contract at least 20 percent of the \n2001 corn or soybean crop. Alternatively, he could qualify by entering \ninto a marketing contract with a buyer for at least 20 percent of his \n2001 apple production and purchase exchange-traded options to hedge \nprice risk on his 2001 corn or soybean crop.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nsummary of my bill be printed in the Record. I encourage my colleagues \nto study my bill and to talk it over with farmers in their own states.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Farmers' Risk Management Act of 1999--Section by Section Summary\n\n\n                   TITLE I--RISK MANAGEMENT PAYMENTS\n\n     Section 101. Definitions\n       Defines terms used in this title.\n     Section 102. Risk management contract\n       Subsection (a) Offer and Consideration. Directs the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, for the 2001-2004 crops, to offer \n     to enter into a contract with a producer in which the \n     producer receives a risk management payment if the producer \n     performs at least 2 qualifying risk management practices in \n     an applicable year. A producer's annual risk management \n     payment will based be on his or her FCIC average actual \n     production history (APH) established for the 2000 crop for \n     each Federally insurable agricultural commodity grown by the \n     producer. Under existing FCIC procedures, the APH for a \n     commodity for crop year 2000 is based on a producer's \n     documented production and acreage history from at least 4 of \n     the 10 immediately preceding years (1990-1999). A producer \n     may elect to receive a risk management payment directly or \n     have an equivalent amount credited to the premium owed by the \n     producer for Federal crop insurance coverage.\n       Subsection (b) Qualifying Risk Management Practices. \n     Describes the 8 qualifying risk management practices:\n       1. Purchase Federal or private crop insurance (e.g. private \n     crop hail) that is equivalent to at least catastrophic risk \n     protection, for at least one principal agricultural commodity \n     produced on the farm for which federal crop insurance is \n     available.\n       2. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk by entering \n     into at least one standard exchange-traded contract for a \n     future or option on a principal agricultural commodity (crops \n     or livestock) produced on the farm.\n       3. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk on at least 10% \n     of the value of a principal agricultural commodity produced \n     on the farm by purchasing an agricultural trade option.\n       4. Cover at least 20% of the value of a principal \n     agricultural commodity (crops or livestock) produced on the \n     farm with a cash forward or other type of marketing contract.\n       5. Attend an agricultural marketing or risk management \n     class. This includes, but is not limited to, a seminar or \n     class conducted by a broker licensed by a futures exchange.\n       6. Deposit at least 25% of the risk management payment into \n     a FARRM account, or a similar tax deductible account.\n       7. Reduce farm financial risk by reducing debt in an amount \n     that reduces leverage, or by increasing liquidity.\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n       8. Reduce farm business risk by diversifying the farm's \n     production by producing at least one new commodity on the \n     farm, or by significantly increasing the diversity of \n     enterprises on the farm.\n       Subsection (c) Determination of Risk Management Payment. \n     The amount that is available for risk management payments for \n     each of the 2001 through 2004 crops is $1.275 billion (a \n     total of $5.1 billion). A producer's risk management payment \n     is calculated (for each Federally insurable commodity of a \n     producer) by multiplying:\n       (1) the average APH established for the 2000 crop (meaning \n     documented production and acreage history from at least 4 of \n     the 10 immediately preceding years covering 1990-1999) for \n     each Federally insurable commodity of a producer;\n       (2) the 1997-1999 average of the FCIC price level \n     established for each commodity (i.e., $2.38/bu. for corn, \n     $5.80/bu. for soybeans, $3.60/bu. for wheat, 68 cents/lb. for \n     upland cotton and $9.50/cwt. for rice); and\n       (3) a payment rate determined by the Secretary in \n     accordance with the total amount available for the year.\n     Section 103. Administrative provisions\n       Risk management payments for each of the 2001 through 2004 \n     crops will be paid in one or more amounts as of October 1 of \n     the crop year. A payment for the 2001 crop could be paid as \n     early as October 1, 2000. A producer must certify with the \n     Secretary which qualifying risk management practices were \n     used on the farm by filing a form with the local FSA office. \n     Qualifying risk management practices used for the 2001 crop \n     would have to be reported by April 15, 2002. A producer \n     choosing to receive a credit for a crop insurance premium \n     will receive the benefit at the time payment of the premium \n     is due (after harvest). Should a producer accept a risk \n     management payment but not perform at least 2 qualifying risk \n     management practices in the applicable year, the producer \n     will be required to repay the full amount of the risk \n     management payment with interest.\n     Section 104. Termination of authority; funding\n       Terminates the authority and funding for risk management \n     payments and qualifying risk management practices as of \n     September 30, 2004.\n\n\n                        title ii--crop insurance\n\n     Section 201. Sanctions for program compliance and fraud\n       A producer who provides false or misleading information \n     about a crop insurance policy may be assessed a $10,000 civil \n     penalty for each violation, or debarred from all USDA \n     financial assistance programs for up to 5 years, depending on \n     the severity of the violation. Agents, loss adjusters, and \n     approved insurance providers who provide false or misleading \n     information about a policy or the administration of a policy \n     or claim under this Act may be subject to civil fines up to \n     $10,000 per violation, or debarred from participating in \n     insurance programs under this Act for up to 5 years, \n     depending on the severity of the violation. The same \n     penalties may apply to agents, loss adjusters, and approved \n     insurance providers who have recurrent compliance problems.\n     Section 202. Oversight of loss adjustment\n       Requires the Corporation to develop procedures for annual \n     reviews of loss adjusters by the approved insurance provider, \n     and to consult with the approved insurance provider about \n     each annual evaluation.\n     Section 203. Revenue insurance pilot program\n       Extends the authority for certain revenue insurance pilot \n     programs through the 2004 crop.\n     Section 204. Reduction in CAT underwriting gains and losses\n       Reduces the potential for underwriting gains or losses \n     associated with catastrophic crop insurance (CAT) policies \n     for the 2001 through 2004 reinsurance years.\n     Section 205. Whole farm revenue insurance pilot program\n       Establishes a pilot program for the 2001 through the 2004 \n     reinsurance years that guarantees farm revenue based on the \n     average adjusted gross income of the producer for the \n     previous 5 years. Covers crops and livestock.\n     Section 206. Product innovation and rate competition pilot \n         program\n       Establishes a pilot program for the 2001 through 2004 \n     reinsurance years that allows private insurance companies to \n     develop and market innovative insurance products, to compete \n     with other companies regarding rates of premium, and to allow \n     a company that has developed a new insurance product to \n     charge a fee to other companies that want to market the \n     product.\n     Section 207. Limitation on double insurance\n       Prohibits purchasing insurance for more than 1 crop for the \n     same acreage in a year, except where there is an established \n     history of double-cropping on the acreage.\n\n\n                         title iii--regulations\n\n     Section 301.

A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodation in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    WORKPLACE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bipartisan \nbill, together with Senator Brownback of Kansas. This is the Workplace \nReligious Freedom Act of 1999.\n  This bill would protect workers from on-the-job discrimination \nrelated to religious beliefs and practices. It represents a milestone \nin the protection of the religious liberties of all workers.\n  In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require \nemployers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or \nobservance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the \nemployer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has \nbeen interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint \non an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious \naccommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended \nand help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to \nreasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices.\n  The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many \nreligiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to \ncarry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from \nemployers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small \nminority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for \nemployees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees \nwho must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for \nemployees to wear clothing that meets religion-based modesty \nrequirements.\n  The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide \nreasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a \nform of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in \n1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously \nas any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and \nequal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all \nmembers of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, \nwill be protected from an invidious form of discrimination.\n  It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the \nreligious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers \nfrom an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only \nif their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for \nthe employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in \nthe ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' and has worked well in that \ncontext.\n  We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it \nsimply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, \nstrengthening the required standard for employers. This bill does not \ndeal with behavior by State or Federal Governments or substantively \nexpand 14th amendment rights.\n  I believe this bill should receive bipartisan support. This bill is \nendorsed by wide range of organizations including the American Jewish \nCommittee, Christian Legal Society, Family Research Council, General \nConference of Seventh-day Adventists, National Council of the Churches \nof Christ in the U.S.A., and the Southern Baptist Convention.\n  I want to thank Senator Brownback for joining me in this effort. I \nlook forward working with him to pass this legislation so that all \nAmerican workers can be assured of both equal employment opportunities \nand the ability to practice their religion.\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to stand with \nconcerned colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as \nconcerned citizens, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs \namong many other faiths. We come together in support of a simple \nproposition. America is distinguished internationally as a land of \nreligious freedom. It should be a place where no person is forced to \nchoose between keeping their faith and keeping their job. That is why I \nam joining\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nwith Senators Kerry, Hutchinson, Lieberman and Mikulski in introducing \nthe Workplace Religious Freedom Act.\n  This legislation provides a skilled reconciling of religion in the \nworkplace. It recognizes that work and religion can be reconciled \nwithout undue hardship. Americans continue to be a religious people, \nwith a deep personal faith commitment. With this commitment comes \npersonal religious standards which govern personal activity. For \nexample, some Americans don't work on Saturdays, while others don't \nwork on Sundays. Not because they're lazy or frivolous, but because \ntheir faith convictions call for a Sabbath day, requiring a day to be \nset aside as holy.\n  Similarly, some Americans need to wear a skullcap to work, or a head \ncovering, or a turban. As a nation whose great strength rests in \ndiversity, surely we can protect such diverse yet simple and \nunobtrusive expressions of personal faith. Surely we're still generous \nenough, and God-respecting enough as a nation, to support others in the \ngenuine expressions of their faith. I am particularly anxious for the \nreligious minorities, for the Muslims and the Jews and the others who \nare very small in number but great in conviction. In our increasingly \nsecular society, many remain among us who still hold by ancient, heart-\nfelt principles governed by a deep personal belief. I submit to you \nthey deserve the decency of respect which includes our protection in \npreserving their peaceful religious expressions. This is a core \nprinciple which cannot be compromised, because it speaks to the essence \nof who we are as a people committed to preserving freedom.\n  In this land of religious freedom, one would hope that employers \nwould spontaneously accommodate the religious needs of their employees \nwhenever reasonable. That is, after all, what we do here in Congress. \nFor example, we don't conduct votes or hearings on certain holidays so \nthat Members and staff can observe their religious holy days. While \nmost private employers also extend this simple but important decency to \ntheir workers, others unfortunately do not.\n  Historically, title VII of the Civil Rights Act was meant to address \nconflicts between religion and work. On its face it requires employers \nto ``reasonably accommodate'' the religious needs of their employees as \nlong as this does not impose an ``undue hardship'' on the employer. The \nproblem is that our federal courts have essentially read these lines \nout of the law by ruling that any hardship is an undue hardship. This \nis not right, nor does it hold with the spirit of this great nation \nwhich was founded as a refuge for religious freedom.\n\n  Thus, a Maryland trucking company can try to force a devout Christian \ntruck driver to take a Sunday shift. A local sheriff's department in \nNevada can tell a Seventh Day Adventist that she must work a Saturday \nshift if she wants to continue with them.\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act will re-establish the principle \nthat employers must reasonably accommodate the religious needs of \nemployees such as these. This legislation is carefully crafted and \nstrikes an appropriate balance between religious accommodation, while \nensuring that an undue burden is not forced upon American businesses. \nIt is flexible and case-oriented on an individual basis. Thus, a \nsmaller business with less resources and personnel would not be asked \nto accommodate religious employees in exactly the same fashion as would \na large manufacturing concern.\n  I am proud of the fact that this is a bi-partisan effort, I am proud \nthat this legislation is supported by such a broad spectrum of groups \nranging from the Christian Legal Society and the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations, to the Family Research Council, the National \nCouncil of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim Women, and \nthe American Jewish Committee.\n  America is a great nation because we honor the free exercise of \nbelief, which includes the very precious, fundamental freedom of \nreligion. This liberty, known as the ``first freedom,'' is worthy of \nour continued vigilance. it properly demands support from all quarters, \nboth the public and private sectors. It properly finds it here in this \nlegislation which re-establishes the right balance between the \ncompeting concerns of business and faith.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators \nBrownback, Kerry, and others in introducing this important legislation \ntoday. America is a deeply religious nation, and fostering a society in \nwhich all Americans can worship according to the dictates of their \nconscience has been of prominent importance to this country since its \nbeginning. Indeed, the Founders of this great Nation saw preserving \nAmericans' ability to worship freely as so important that they \nenshrined it in the Bill of Rights' very first amendment.\n  Unfortunately, a number of Americans today are not able to take full \nadvantage of America's promise of religious freedom. They are instead \nbeing forced to make a choice no American should face: one between the \ndictates of their faith and the demands of their job. Whether by being \nforced to work on days their religion requires them to refrain from \nwork or by being denied the right to wear clothing their faith mandates \nthey wear, too many Americans of faith are facing an unfair choice \nbetween their job and their religion.\n  This legislation would provide much needed help for those confronted \nwith that choice. It would require employers to provide reasonable \naccommodations to an employee's religious observance or practice, \nunless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. The \nbill would not, it is worth emphasizing, give employees a right to \ndictate the conditions of their job, because it does not demand that \nemployers accede to unreasonable requests. Instead, it requires only \nthat an employer grant a religiously based request for an accommodation \nto an employee's religious belief or practice if the accommodation \nwould not impose significant difficulty or expense on the employer.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. I hope that we can \nsee it enacted into law soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url":

COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Dodd, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 57\n\n       Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996, \n     Congress, by concurrent resolution, declared that it holds \n     the Government of Iran responsible for upholding the rights \n     of all its nationals, including members of the Baha'i Faith, \n     Iran's largest religious minority;\n       Whereas Congress has deplored the Government of Iran's \n     religious persecution of the Baha'i community in such \n     resolutions and in numerous other appeals, and has condemned \n     Iran's execution of more than 200 Baha'is and the \n     imprisonment of thousands of others solely on account of \n     their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas in July 1998 a Baha'i, Mr. Ruhollah Rowhani, was \n     executed by hanging in Mashhad after being held in solitary \n     confinement for 9 months on the charge of converting a Muslim \n     woman to the Baha'i Faith, a charge the woman herself \n     refuted;\n       Whereas 4 Baha'is remain on death row in Iran, 2 on charges \n     on apostasy, and 12 others are serving prison terms on \n     charges arising solely from their religious beliefs or \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to deny individual \n     Baha'is access to higher education and government employment \n     and denies recognition and religious rights to the Baha'i \n     community, according to the policy set forth in a \n     confidential Iranian Government document which was revealed \n     by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1993;\n       Whereas Baha'is have been banned from teaching and studying \n     at Iranian universities since the Islamic Revolution and \n     therefore created the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education, \n     or Baha'i Open University, to provide educational \n     opportunities to Baha'i youth using volunteer faculty and a \n     network of classrooms, libraries, and laboratories in private \n     homes and buildings throughout Iran;\n       Whereas in September and October 1998, Iranian authorities \n     arrested 36 faculty members of the Open University, 4 of whom \n     have been given prison sentences ranging between 3 to 10 \n     years, even though the law makes no\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\n     mention of religious instruction within one's own religious \n     community as being an illegal activity;\n       Whereas Iranian intelligence officers looted classroom \n     equipment, textbooks, computers, and other personal property \n     from 532 Baha'i homes in an attempt to close down the Open \n     University;\n       Whereas all Baha'i community properties in Iran have been \n     confiscated by the government, and Iranian Baha'is are not \n     permitted to elect their leaders, organize as a community, \n     operate religious schools, or conduct other religious \n     community activities guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights;\n       Whereas on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights published a formerly confidential Iranian \n     government document that constitutes a blueprint for the \n     destruction of the Baha'i community and reveals that these \n     repressive actions are the result of a deliberate policy \n     designed and approved by the highest officials of the \n     Government of Iran; and\n       Whereas in 1998 the United Nations Special Representative \n     for Human Rights, Maurice Copithorne, was denied entry into \n     Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) continues to hold the Government of Iran responsible \n     for upholding the rights of all its nationals, including \n     members of the Baha'i community, in a manner consistent with \n     Iran's obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights and other international agreements guaranteeing the \n     civil and political rights of its citizens;\n       (2) condemns the repressive anti-Baha'i policies and \n     actions of the Government of Iran, including the denial of \n     legal recognition to the Baha'i community and the basic \n     rights to organize, elect its leaders, educate its youth, and \n     conduct the normal activities of a law-abiding religious \n     community;\n       (3) expresses concern that individual Baha'is continue to \n     suffer from severely repressive and discriminatory government \n     actions, including executions and death sentences, solely on \n     account of their religion;\n       (4) urges the Government of Iran to permit Baha'i students \n     to attend Iranian universities and Baha'i faculty to teach at \n     Iranian universities, to return the property confiscated from \n     the Baha'i Open University, to free the imprisoned faculty \n     members of the Open University, and to permit the Open \n     University to continue to function;\n       (5) urges the Government of Iran to implement fully the \n     conclusions and recommendations on the emancipation of the \n     Iranian Baha'i community made by the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, Professor Abdelfattah \n     Amor, in his report of March 1996 to the United Nations \n     Commission of Human Rights;\n       (6) urges the Government of Iran to extend to the Baha'i \n     community the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights and the international covenants of human \n     rights, including the freedom of thought, conscience, and \n     religion, and equal protection of the law; and\n       (7) calls upon the President to continue--\n       (A) to assert the United States Government's concern \n     regarding Iran's violations of the rights of its citizens, \n     including members of the Baha'i community, along with \n     expressions of its concern regarding the Iranian Government's \n     support for international terrorism and its efforts to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n       (B) to emphasize that the United States regards the human \n     rights practices of the Government of Iran, particularly its \n     treatment of the Baha'i community and other religious \n     minorities, as a significant factor in the development of the \n     United States Government's relations with the Government of \n     Iran;\n       (C) to emphasize the need for the United Nations Special \n     Representative for Human Rights to be granted permission to \n     enter Iran;\n       (D) to urge the Government of Iran to emancipate the Baha'i \n     community by granting those rights guaranteed by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international \n     covenants on human rights; and\n       (E) to encourage other governments to continue to appeal to \n     the Government of Iran, and to cooperate with other \n     governments and international organizations, including the \n     United Nations and its agencies, in efforts to protect the \n     religious rights of the Baha'is and other minorities through \n     joint appeals to the Government of Iran and through other \n     appropriate actions.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my \nesteemed colleagues and I bring to the Senate's attention for the \neighth time in 18 years the plight of Iran's Baha'is by submitting \ntoday the Baha'i Resolution of 1999.\n  Since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, the world has \nwatched Iran with great anticipation of change. Indeed, under Khatami, \nIran has witnessed some small, incremental steps toward \ndemocratization, transparency, and an attempt to assert the rule of \nlaw. As recent demonstrations at Tehran University have shown, the \nIranian people are eager for reform, the kinds of changes that would \nallow Iran to become a member in good standing of the international \ncommunity.\n  The Iranian people have suffered much in the last 20 years. A regime \ndesperate to maintain control at all costs has executed hundreds of \nthousands of Iranians of all religious and political backgrounds. \nIran's economy is in shambles, many of its best and brightest have \nfled, and the government's pursuit of policies supporting terrorism and \nthe development of weapons of mass destruction have made Iran a pariah \nstate in the international community. It is good to remember, as we \nfocus on the plight of specific groups in Iran, that all of Iran's \ncitizens, Shi'a, Sunni, Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Baha'i, \nhave been victimized by the Iranian regime.\n  However, today we focus on the group that, man for man and woman for \nwoman, has fared the worst under Iran's revolutionary government--the \nBaha'is.\n  Since the Islamic Revolution and consequent seizure of power by the \nAyatollah Khomeni, the Baha'is have endured tremendous hardships that \ncontinue to this day. Large numbers have been killed and many other \nhave disappeared and are presumed dead. Unlike other religious \nminorities in Iran such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, the \nBaha'is are not recognized in the Iranian Constitution and subsequently \ndo not enjoy the rights, minimal though they may be, normally granted \nIranian citizens.\n  The refusal of Iran to protect the rights of the Baha'i community is \nironic. The Baha'is do not advocate insurrection, violence, or \npolitical partisanship. Their faith requires them peacefully to observe \nthe laws of the country. For the Iranian government to regard the \nBaha'is as a threat, when all they desire is to be able to live in \naccordance with their religious beliefs is truly outrageous.\n  Now, imagine if you will what it would be like to live in a world \nwhere you and your children are not recognized as citizens simply \nbecause of your religion. Imagine your government seizing your only \noutlet for a higher education. Imagine fearing arrest simply for \nadhering to a set of beliefs and a way of life that you and your family \nhold dear. Unfortunately, this nightmarish scenario is all too real for \n300,000 members of the Baha'i religion in Iran who need not expend any \neffort imagining such a situation, because they have the misfortune of \nliving it.\n  Even after their signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nand the recent election of President Khatami, the Iranian government \nstill shows no sign of easing its subjugation of Iran's largest \nreligious minority. Tehran continues to oppress, persecute, and \nundermine the Baha'i's way of life. Under such pressure, we fear that \nan already tragic past can only lead to a bleaker future.\n  Since 1979 the Baha'i community has been denied the right to assemble \nofficially, conduct religious ceremonies--including the proper burial \nof their dead--and attend Iranian schools of higher education. Baha'is \nare denied the same job and pension opportunities as their non-Baha'i \nneighbors and by law. They cannot even collect on insurance policies.\n  The denial of access to schools of higher education has been a \nparticular hardship to the Baha'is, who hold as one of the central \ntenets of their faith the supreme importance of education. In order to \neducate their youth, the Baha'is have created a network of university \nlevel courses, accredited by the University of Indiana and taught in \nthe homes of Baha'i professors. Over 900 Baha'is have enrolled in the \nOpen University and many more have benefited from their programs. In \nthe Fall of 1998, for no other reason than to harass the Baha'i \ncommunity, Iranian police raided over 500 homes associated with the \nOpen University. Police arrested hundreds of professors and seized \nmassive amounts of classroom and laboratory equipment, computers, and \ntextbooks. To this day, three professors remain in jail. One has been \nsentenced to a ten year imprisonment and two have received seven year \nterms all for the `sin' of involving themselves in teaching Baha'i \nstudies which, according to the Iranian authorities constituted \n``crimes against national security.''\n  (In recent years, the Iranian government has gradually stepped up its \nharassment of the Baha'is, as exemplified\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\nin the 1998 raids on the Open University. With the raids came the \nrealization that Tehran was not afraid to publicly display its \nmaltreatment of the Baha'is. It was in this same year that Iran \nexecuted Mr. Ruhollah Rowhani.)\n  Mr. Rowhani was accused by the Iranian government of forcibly \nconverting a Muslim woman to the Baha'i faith. Before Mr. Rowhani's \nhanging in July 1998, the woman totally refuted the charges, stating \nthat she had been raised as a Baha'i, making it impossible and \nunnecessary for Mr. Rowhani to impress his religion upon her. Mr. \nRowhani spent the nine months prior to his execution in solitary \nconfinement, and most telling, no sentence was ever passed. It is in \nrecognition and in memory of the recent one-year anniversary of Mr. \nRowhani's execution that we submit this resolution.\n  The Baha'i Resolution expresses our strong disapproval of the Iranian \ngovernment's treatment of the Baha'is and reminds Iran that the \ndevelopment of a relationship between our two countries depends greatly \non Tehran's record of human rights. Equally important, it is a \nstatement of America's values. It sends a message to perpetrators of \npersecution everywhere that our eyes will not be averted. And it \nreassures Iran's Baha'is, indeed all of those persecuted in Iran, that \nAmerica is with them and will continue to shine sunlight on the abuses \nof Iran's government while we plead, and pray for change there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11651-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 190--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 10, 1999, \n  THROUGH OCTOBER 16, 1999, AS NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Kerry, and \nMr. Robb) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 190\n\n       Whereas Cystic Fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic \n     disease in the United States, for which there is no known \n     cure;\n       Whereas Cystic Fibrosis, characterized by digestive \n     disorders and chronic lung infections, has been linked to \n     fatal lung disease;\n       Whereas a total of more than 10,000,000 Americans are \n     unknowing carriers of Cystic Fibrosis;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 3,900 babies in the United States \n     are born with Cystic Fibrosis;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States, \n     many of whom are children, suffer from Cystic Fibrosis;\n       Whereas the average life-expectancy of an individual with \n     Cystic Fibrosis is age 31;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     Cystic Fibrosis can extend the lives of those who suffer with \n     this disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in Cystic Fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in relation to gene, protein, and \n     drug therapies; and\n       Whereas education can help inform the public of Cystic \n     Fibrosis symptoms, which will assist in early diagnoses, and \n     increase knowledge and understanding of this disease: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of October 10, 1999, through \n     October 16, 1999, as National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Week;\n       (2) commits to increasing the quality of life for \n     individuals with Cystic Fibrosis by promoting public \n     knowledge and understanding in a manner that will result in \n     earlier diagnoses, more fund raising efforts for research, \n     and increased levels of support for Cystic Fibrosis sufferers \n     and their families; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution recognizing \nOctober 10, 1999, through October 16, 1999, as National Cystic Fibrosis \nAwareness Week. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators \nGramm, Ashcroft, Kerry, and Robb in submitting this resolution. We are \nhopeful that greater awareness of cystic fibrosis (CF) will lead to a \ncure.\n  Incredibly, CF is the number one genetic killer in the United States. \nApproximately 30,000 Americans suffer from the life-threatening \ndisease. Today, the average life expectancy for someone with CF is 31 \nyears. We must do what we can to change that.\n  While there remains no cure, early detection and prompt treatment can \nsignificantly improve and extend the lives of those with CF. For \nexample, my home state of Colorado is one of the first and only states \nthat requires CF screening for newborns, providing a greater quality of \nlife for CF sufferers. And since the discovery of the defective CF gene \nin 1989, CF research has greatly accelerated. At Children's Hospital of \nDenver, researchers are participating in the innovative Therapeutics \nDevelopment Program, a promising venture with the CF Foundation. \nDesigned to aid the development of new therapeutics for CF, researchers \nin the program are expediting the early phases of clinical trials that \nevaluate safety and dosing regimens for new drugs. I applaud their \nefforts.\n  But while I am encouraged by the CF research in Colorado and \nelsewhere, more needs to be done. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nact quickly on this resolution so that we can move one step closer to \neradicating this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11651-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11651-S11652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 191--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n    EAST TIMOR AND SUPPORTING THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE FOR EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. \nMurray) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today is the 100th birthday of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). Yesterday, the Senate approved H.J. \nRes. 34, a resolution which commemorates that auspicious event. I wish \nto mark the occasion further by offering my congratulations to the \nmembers and families of that fine organization.\n  In my 19 years as a United States Senator I have been able to count \non the VFW to convey the concerns of veterans in a fair and insightful \nmanner. Especially during my tenure as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I have always been able to rely on the VFW to assist \nme in ascertaining the quality of health care and benefits provided by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Without the VFW's 2,000,000 \nstrong membership, it would be extremely difficult for the Committee--\nor the Congress--to operate in the best interest of America's veterans.\n  Earlier this year, I had the honor of being named the recipient of \nthe VFW Congressional Award. At the award reception, I was struck by \nthe history of the VFW. From the trenches of Verdun to the deserts of \nIraq, VFW members have taken their place in America's history, serving \nto preserve ``one Nation, under God, with liberty and justice for \nall.''\n  The service of VFW members, however, has never been limited to \nwartime service--as vital as that has been. VFW members also play \nindispensable roles within their communities--as volunteers in VA \nhospitals and advocates for veteran claimants and through numerous \ncivic and youth projects in every State and locality. Indeed, America \ncounts VFW members among its model citizens.\n  For 100 years as honorable citizens and soldiers, the VFW deserves \nAmerica's gratitude for a job well done. We salute you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11654-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NORMA SULLIVAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in honor of Norma Sullivan, \na great Californian who died on September 22 in San Diego.\n  Norma Sullivan was a woman of many talents: a champion skier, an \naccomplished poet, a prolific essayist, a loving mother, and an \ninspirational teacher. But she was best known to her many friends and \nadmirers as a tireless fighter for the environment. As a writer, \nactivist, and spokesperson for the San Diego Audubon Society, Norma was \none of Southern California's most dedicated and effective defenders of \nthe natural world.\n  San Diego County contains some of the nation's most beautiful \nlandscapes and diverse habitat. The County is home to more endangered \nspecies per square mile than any other region in the continental United \nStates. Thanks largely to Norma's prodigious efforts, many of these \nlands and their inhabitants have been preserved for future generations.\n  She was instrumental in generating support for parks, establishing \nhabitat conservation programs, and blocking projects that would harm \nthe environment--including the proposal to build Pamo Dam near Ramona, \nwhich was withdrawn after Norma alerted the community to its dangers.\n  One of Norma's greatest achievements was her role in creating a major \nwildlife refuge in southern San Diego Bay. For ten years she worked \ntirelessly to build support for the refuge among conservationists, \nlandowners, local governments, community members, and federal wildlife \nagencies. She never shied away from confrontation, but she was always \nready to cooperate. Finally, this spring, her long efforts bore fruit \nwhen the South San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established \nand dedicated.\n  This magnificent refuge--and many other pristine tracts of San Diego \nCounty--live on as part of Norma Sullivan's legacy. She has also left \nus a model of what it means to be an engaged citizen: a person who \nworks for the public good with intelligence, humor, and love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11654-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11654-S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN ROYAL\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \n100th anniversary of the American Royal. The American Royal is an \nannual Fall event that has contributed much to the Kansas City area \nover the last century. The Royal features world-class horse and \nlivestock competitions; a top-ten PRCA indoor rodeo; as well as many \neducational and scholarship programs that foster the development of \ntomorrow's leaders. The American Royal is truly the Midwest's largest \nand oldest agricultural extravaganza. From the world's largest \nBarbecue, to the outstanding parade, music and comedy, to the elegant \nConcert of Champions, the Royal has something for every member of the \nfamily.\n  Even though the Royal began in the 19th Century, it still plays an \nintegral role in the community by providing a connection to Kansas \nCity's rural roots and by celebrating the value of working in \nagriculture. For many, being a part of the Royal's livestock shows or \nrodeo can be the highlight of their career. Not only does the Royal \noffer agricultural competition, but there are\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nalso educational tours of their museum, scholarships and programs for \ncollege age youth.\n  Mr. President, I am truly proud of the contribution the American \nRoyal has made to Kansas City, the state of Missouri, and the entire \ncountry over the last 100 years. I wish the Royal well as they continue \nto be America's best agricultural expose' well into the next \nmillennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11655-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORLD SERIES WINNERS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe achievements of the Millville Girls All-Star Softball Team, who \nrecently captured the first-ever Babe Ruth Softball World Series. This \npast year has seen tremendous accomplishments by American female \nathletes, including the 1999 Women's World Cup Soccer Champions. I am \npleased that the state of New Jersey can now boast its own champion's \nin women's athletics through the Millville team.\n  The Millville team, comprised of girls 16 years old and younger, \ndefeated several worthy opponents at the Softball World Series. The \nevent, which took place in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, was the \nfirst Championship of its kind. All of the games were close, \nparticularly the championship game. Millville won this in spectacular \nfashion, 1-0, on a two-out, ninth-inning-single which scored the \nwinning run. The girls demonstrated outstanding skills and \nsportsmanship throughout the tournament. From pitching a no-hitter, to \nnumerous diving catches, to clutch hitting; the Millville team proved \nthemselves to be superb players, and model young athletes.\n  The character and manners displayed by the thirteen girls on the \nMillville team throughout the Softball World Series should be a source \nof pride for the Millville community, the Southern New Jersey region, \nand the State as a whole. The values of the parents, teachers, \nofficials, and volunteers of Millville are clearly reflected in the \nplay and conduct of the World Champions.\n  I am proud to recognize the accomplishments and contributions of \nRachel Barber, Amy Holliday, Jil Conner, Constance DeSalvo, Tara \nHaines, Colleen Scholl, Rachel Mudry, Danielle Weber, Megan Lore, Adina \nDe Hainaut, Jodi Dick, Christin Carpini, and Debra Vento.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBill Greely on the occasion of his retirement. My good friend Bill \nserved as assistant manager and general manager of the Keeneland \nAssociation for 14 years, and is now stepping down from his successful \n13-year post as the Association's president.\n  Bill is a true horseman. He grew up in the Keeneland community, and \nbegan spending time at the horse track when he was a small child. Bill \nbegan taking on responsibilities at the horse track when he was just \nseven years old, and has worked in almost every aspect of horse racing \nin tracks around the country--but it is clear that Bill has always been \npartial to Keeneland. In 1972, after years of moving around the country \nfrom track to track, he finally got his chance to return to his \nhometown, working at the track he loved.\n  Bill's long-time affiliation with Keeneland and love of horse racing \nmade him an ideal candidate to manage the track and eventually become \npresident. Bill's knowledge of the horse industry prepared him for his \nleadership role at Keeneland, and enabled him to make Keeneland one of \nthe nation's premiere horse tracks. During his time at Keeneland, Bill \nupdated the track's betting options, improved the grandstands and \ngrounds, and brought Keeneland to a level of growth that will be hard \nto exceed or even match.\n  Keeneland would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and \nguidance over the last 27 years--and Bill would not be where he is \ntoday without the love and support of his family. His wife Norma, and \ntheir children Sean, Kevin and Kara, endured numerous moves before they \nfinally settled down in Lexington, and they have helped sustain Bill \nduring his demanding career at Keeneland. A third generation horseman, \nBill has seen first-hand what it takes to simultaneously work the track \nand raise a family--and he has happy, successful children to prove he \nmade it work.\n  Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into Keeneland to \nmake it a better place for others. Your hard work and successes have \nbecome your legacy, and will continue to impact the entire horse \nindustry for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you \non a job well done, and wish you all the best as you enter this new \nstage in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/29/senate-section/article/S11655-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11655-S11656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LEBANON CLOWNS\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, on June 18, 1999, Tennessee-based \nLebanon Clowns celebrated their inaugural reunion at their Baseball \nTeam Roundup in Lebanon. The Negro League baseball team gathered for \nthe first time in over thirty years to reminisce about their youthful \nbaseball exploits. The Clowns were a favorite among Lebanon's African-\nAmerican community as they played teams from Birmingham, Alabama, \nPontiac, Michigan and Nashville and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n  The Negro Leagues were an integral part of American baseball history. \nA product of segregated America, it gave opportunity where opportunity \ndid not exist. The teams were professional, pre-integration black \nbaseball leagues in which the level of play was considered to be the \nequal of play in major league baseball. The first stable black league \nwas the Negro National League organized in 1920 by Andrew ``Rube'' \nFoster. This league, as well as the recognized Negro National League--\ncreated by Gus Greenlee in the early 1930s--and the Negro American \nLeague, are universally regarded as having offered the highest level of \nplay among African-American players of the day.\n  During the 1940s the Negro National and Negro American leagues \nreached their highest point of popularity and financial success. While \nfans dreamed of watching their stars compete in major league play, the \neventual realization of this dream meant the end of both leagues. Some \nhistorians contend that the Negro Southern League and Texas Negro \nLeague, as well as several of the stronger independent teams during the \n1920s and 1930s, offered major league caliber play.\n  The Negro National League folded under financial pressures at the end \nof the 1948 season. The Negro American League continued play into the \nlate 1950s, but was no longer a stable circuit. As the talent pool of \nblack baseball was absorbed into the integrated major and minor \nleagues, Negro League team owners were left without a product of \nsufficient quality to attract fans to the ballpark.\n  Baseball history would not be complete without recognizing Negro \nLeague teams such as the Philadelphia Stars, Newark Eagles, Bacharach \nGiants, Nashville Elite Giants, St. Louis Stars, and the Memphis Red \nSox. The Negro Leagues brought us such great players as Willie Mays, \nHenry Aaron, Satchel Paige, Smokey Joe Williams, and Jackie Robinson. \nThe players and teams of the Negro Baseball League have become a \nfundamental part of American culture and are forever woven into the \nfabric of professional baseball. The surviving players, some now in \ntheir seventies, are still as filled today with pride and love for the \ngame as they were when they were young rookies on dusty sandlots.\n  So today, I pay tribute to the Negro League by recognizing the \ndeceased and surviving players and managers of the Lebanon Clowns, \nNegro League baseball team:\n       John Forris ``Bigclue'' Griffith; Harry ``Hammerhead'' \n     Harris, Jr.; Tommy ``Redeye'' Humes; Robert Earl ``Smiley'' \n     Smith; Gilbert ``Sunny'' Oldham; Robert Oldham; Teddy \n     ``Mutt'' Owens; Claude Britton; Bob ``Woods'' Oldham; L.D. \n     ``Zeak'' Ward.\n       George McGown, Jr.; Jerry ``Foots'' Oldham, Sr.; Robert L. \n     ``Pondwater'' McClellan; Betty Lou Oldham; Bob White; Price \n     Logue; Norton Whitley; Roy L.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 289, S. \nRes. 189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 189) authorizing expenditures by \n     committees of the Senate for the periods of October 1, 1999, \n     through September 30, 2000, and October 1, 2000, through \n     February 28, 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the resolution \nbefore the Senate today which authorizes funding for 18 Senate standing \ncommittees through the remainder of the biennium ending on February 28, \n2001.\n  This resolution marks another milestone in the development of the \nbiennial funding authority for committees, first authorized in the \n100th Congress. Since 1989, the Senate has funded committees on a two-\nyear basis. The two-year budget has given the authorizing committees, \nand the Rules Committee in its capacity as the oversight committee, a \nmanagement tool for efficiently operating the Senate committees. The \ntwo-year budget process allows for a continuity of funding which \nprovides greater flexibility in allocating committee funds and \nscheduling committee business. Although the Rules Committee has \nadjusted the biennial funding authority in the past to provide greater \nflexibility to committees, the Senate has consistently approved a \nbiennial budget for committee funding in each of the last six \nCongresses.\n  In the 106th Congress, changes in the Senate financial management \nsystem\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\nrequired to address Y2K issues necessitated a departure from the Senate \nrules and past practices. In the past, the Rules Committee completed \naction on the biennial committee funding resolution prior to the \nbeginning of the new biennium on March 1 of the new Congress, as \nprovided for in Rule XXVI of the Senate Rules. Due to the pressing \nbusiness of the Senate at the beginning of the Congress, and in light \nof a number of unresolved issues regarding the implementation of the \nnew financial management system in the Senate, the majority and \nminority staff of the Committee jointly recommended delaying committee \naction on the biennial budget until later in the year. Consequently, \nthe Committee proposed, and the Senate adopted, S. Res. 38 on February \n12 of this year, which authorized the Rules Committee to report a \ncontinuing resolution for committee funding for the period of March 1, \n1999 through September 30, 1999. Subsequently, the Committee adopted, \nand the Senate passed, S. Res. 49 which funded 18 standing committees \non a continuing basis for this period. In June, the Senate passed S. \nRes. 122, which required the authorizing committee to report their \nfunding resolution by July 15 of this year and authorized the Rules \nCommittee to report an omnibus funding resolution for the remainder of \nthe biennium, ending on February 28, 2001. S. Res. 189 before us today \nis the culmination of this process.\n  This resolution preserves the overall flexibility of a two-year \nbudget while modifying past practices to reflect changes in the \nSenate's financial management system. At the recommendation of the \nSenate Disbursing Office, this resolution moves the committee budget \nyear from two equal funding periods, within the overall two-year \nbudget, of March 1 through February 28, to three varying funding \nperiods which track the Senate's fiscal year period. S. Res. 49 \nprovided funding for the first of the three periods, March 1 through \nSeptember 30, 1999. S. Res. 189 authorizes committee spending during \neach of the next two periods of the biennium: October 1, 1999 through \nSeptember 30, 2000, and finally, October 1, 2000 through February 28, \n2001. It is anticipated that the biennial funding resolution adopted in \nthe 107th Congress will once again follow Senate Rule XXVI and be \nadopted prior to March 1, 2001, providing funding for committees for \nthe three fiscal year periods occurring during the biennium ending \nFebruary 28, 2003.\n\n  Most importantly, this resolution continues a practice begun by the \nRules Committee in 1993 referred to as the ``special reserves.'' \nSpecial reserves result from the overlap in the end of the committee \nfunding year on February 28 and the end of the fiscal year on September \n30. The unobligated balances of the authorizing committee budgets which \nare unspent at the end of the biennium on February 28, but which remain \navailable through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, are \nreprogrammed into special reserves and made available to the committees \nto meet their unforseen needs.\n  The Rules Committee first authorized the use of special reserves in \nthe 103rd Congress in S. Res. 71, section 23. In that resolution, the \nSenate authorized special reserves to be reprogrammed as carry-over \nfunds for the committees. In the 104th Congress, the Rules Committee \nreported S. Res. 73, section 22 of which continued the authorization \nfor special reserves, but eliminated the authorization for automatic \ncarry-over and replaced it with a procedure whereby the chairman and \nranking member of the authorizing committee could jointly request a \ndraw on the special reserves, subject to the joint approval of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee. This procedure, and \nthe authorization for special reserves, was continued in the 105th \nCongress in S. Res. 54, section 22. Finally, in the 106th Congress, S. \nRes. 49, which provided funding for committees on a continuing basis \nthrough September 30, 1999, also contained, in section 20, the \nauthority for special reserves. This authority continued the procedure \nfirst adopted in the 104th Congress providing that the chair and \nranking member of the authorizing committee jointly request a draw on \nspecial reserves, subject to the joint approval of the chair and \nranking member of the Rules Committee.\n  Although section 20 of S. Res. 189 continues the authority for \nspecial reserves, and the procedure by which such reserves are accessed \nby committees, this resolution reflects an important change in the \ncalculation of the special reserves amount. Prior to the 106th \nCongress, special reserves represented a reprogramming of unobligated \nbalances that automatically occurred when the committee funding \nauthorization ended on February 28. With the changes necessitated by \nthe new financial management system, committee funding authorizations \nnow track the fiscal year. Consequently, there is no overlap between \nthe end of the committee funding year and the end of the fiscal year. \nTherefore, in order to assure that sufficient funds remain available in \nthe appropriations Investigations and Inquiries account to fund the \nunforseen needs of committees, the Rules Committee specified a funding \nlevel for special reserves. That funding level is based on the historic \namount that has been available to the Committee for special reserves in \nthe past three Congresses.\n  I want to commend our chairman, Senator McConnell, for shepherding \nthis resolution to the Senate floor. His leadership during this \ntransition year has ensured that the committees have received \nsufficient funds while allowing the Committee time to adjust to the new \nfinancial management system. I especially commend the chairman for \ncontinuing the special reserves provision and for the responsible \nmanner in which he has proposed to fund special reserves. This \nprovision ensures that the Rules Committee can continue to hold \ncommittee funding to its historic levels, while retaining the \nflexibility to meet the unforseen needs that may result.\n  I urge adoption of this resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
