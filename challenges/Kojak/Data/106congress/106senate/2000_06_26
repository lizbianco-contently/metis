Mr. President, here we go again, treating foreign trade \nas foreign aid, failing to compete, and giving away our technology and \nproduction. The permanent normal trade relations with China--PNTR--vote \nis not about access to China. The agreement doesn't provide open \naccess, and even as a member of the WTO, China's market doesn't become \nopen. Japan has been a member of the WTO for 5 years and her market \nremains closed. PNTR is certainly not about jobs in America, but about \nproduction and jobs in China. As headlined in the Wall Street Journal, \ncorporate America is in a foot race to invest and produce in China. \nPNTR is not about exports. Today's $70 billion deficit in the balance \nof trade with China is bound to increase. Nor will PNTR maintain our \n``lead'' in technology. Already we have a $3.2 billion deficit in \ntechnology trade with China that threatens to reach $5 billion this \nyear. PNTR is not about environment and labor. It took the democratic \nUnited States 200 years to get around to labor and environmental \nprotections. Emerging countries, like us in the beginning, will \nsacrifice labor and environment to produce and build. PNTR is not about \nhuman rights. Human rights will be abused by a communist government in \norder to control a population of 1.3 billion. PNTR is not about \nundermining the communist regime in China. The communist regime knows \nwhat it's doing and unanimously favors PNTR. Finally, PNTR is not about \nChina obeying its agreements, but the United States enforcing ours.\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\n  We are in a desperate circumstance. For 50 years we have readily \nsacrificed our manufacturing sector to spread capitalism and defeat \ncommunism. But our security rests as if on a three legged stool. The \none leg of values is strong. America is admired the world around for \nits stand for human rights and individual freedom. The second leg of \nmilitary power is unquestioned. The third leg of economic strength has \nbecome fractured. We have gone from 41% of our work force in \nmanufacture at the end of World War II to 14 percent. Manufacture \nprovides the salary and benefits that produce a middle class. This \nmiddle class is not only the strength of an economy, but the strength \nof a democracy. As Akio Morita of Sony stated: ``That world power that \nloses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.''\n  ``Permanent'' is the objectionable part of PNTR. The issue is not \nwhether we will trade with China--we will. But the annual renewal of \nour trade relations affords us an opportunity to once more get the \nattention of our leadership as to an impending disaster. It's not just \ntrade. The U.S. influence in world diplomacy is threatened. The 6th \nFleet and the hydrogen bomb are no longer a threat. Today, economic \npower counts. Money talks. The domestic market is the principal weapon \nin the global competition. We have the richest, but refuse to use it, \nall because of some nonsense that a trade war may ensue. We are in a \ntrade war and don't know it. It shows the lack of understanding of the \nglobal economy, of the global competition.\n  To begin with, the global competition is keen. With the fall of the \nWall, 4 billion people have entered the work force. With technology \ntransferred on a computer chip, financed by satellite, one can produce \nanything anywhere. In the age of robots, skilled production is readily \navailable. The most productive automobile plant in the world, according \nto J.D. Power, is not in Detroit, but in Mexico. Years ago as Governor, \nI was admonished to let the emerging countries produce the textiles and \nthe shoes; the United States would produce the airplanes and computers. \nToday, the competition produces the textiles, the shoes, the airplanes \nand the computers. All countries have as a goal obtaining technology \nand producing technology. All protect their domestic agriculture. All, \nexcept the United States, protect their local market from foreign \nimports. And all, except the United States, enjoy government financing. \nThe European aircraft sold in the United States is government financed. \nThe Japanese car taking over the United States market is financed and \nprotected--and sold for less than cost. Most importantly, the goal of \nU.S. trade is profits. The goal of global competition is market share. \nWhile the competition cares little about a standard of living, the U.S. \nburdens its production with a high standard. Before ``Jones \nManufacturing'' can open its doors it must have a minimum wage, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, clean air, clean water, a safe working \nplace, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave--and almost \nergonomics. Corporate taxes in the U.S. are a cost of production; \nwhereas, the competition's value added tax is rebated at export. The \nglobal competition saves while we consume. They willingly pay $4.50 for \na gallon of gasoline but we go ``ape'' when a gallon reaches $2.00. The \nglobal competition is organized and directed. We are totally \ndisorganized. There are 28 agencies and departments engaged in trade \ndecisions and we have allowed the financing of our debt to control \ntrade decisions. Former Prime Minister of Japan, Hashimoto, threatened \none afternoon at Columbia University to stop buying our bonds if we \ninsisted on enforcing our dumping laws. The stock market fell 200 \npoints within an hour and the dumping law against Japan was not \nenforced. Finally, all countries in international trade use access to \ntheir markets as a bargaining chip. Refusing to compete, we cry, ``be \nfair; be fair; level the playing field''. Moral suasion has little \naffect in business. We continue to lose our technology and production. \nIt has gotten so bad that the foreign corporation in a controlled \neconomy now preys on the domestic bloodied from open competition. Volvo \nbuys Mack Truck. Daimler-Benz seizes Chrysler. And the European Union \ndenies the MCI-Sprint merger so the Deutsche Telekom can buy Sprint.\n\n  As the United States moves now to set the parameters of trade with \n1.3 billion producers of agriculture and products, we need time. We \nneed understanding. The $300 billion trade deficit, costing the economy \n1% growth, must be reversed. The PNTR vote is not against China, but to \nget the attention of the United States. We need to set trade policy and \nstart competing. We need to realize that we are competing with \nourselves. In the early 1970s our banks financing foreign investment \nbegan making a majority of their profits outside of the United States. \nThey organized think-tanks, consultants, and entities such as the \nTrilateral Commission to promote the ``free trade'' line. Corporate \nAmerica, making a bigger profit on foreign production, changed from \nnationals to multinationals. The campuses, sustained by corporate \nmultinationals, all teach ``free trade''. The retailers, enjoying a \nbigger profit on the imported article, shout ``free trade''. The \nnewspaper editorialists, financed by retail advertising, exhault ``free \ntrade''. And then there's the lawyer. One country, Japan, pays their \nlawyers more to lobby Congress than the combined salaries of all the \nMembers of Congress. By way of pay, Japan is better represented in \nWashington than the people of the United States. Article 1, Section 8 \nof the Constitution provides ``that Congress shall have the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations'', but this power has been \nforsaken to the multinationals and foreign competition. PNTR will only \ncontinue this outrage. Trade with China will continue. But the only \nleverage we have left with China, the only chance for Congress to \nassume its responsibility for trade, is this annual review. \n``Permanent'' must be stricken from Permanent Normal Trade Relations.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the reason I wanted to speak this afternoon \nis to address the issue of energy policy and gasoline prices.\n  It seems now that we are in the finger-pointing mode trying to blame \none another for what is in effect a market condition; that is, the \nincreasing rise in the price of gasoline.\n  My point this morning is that it should come as no surprise to any of \nus that gas prices have gone up. Why is this so?\n  First of all, thanks to Senator Pete Domenici, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who \nyesterday in response to a question on a national TV program made, I \nthink, the most succinct statement on this, we have the basic answer. \nHe said, ``The chickens have come home to roost.''\n  He said that after 7 years of the Clinton-Gore administration policy, \nwhich is in effect no policy with respect to improving our energy \nsituation, ``The chickens have come home to roost.''\n  While we have enjoyed a great time of prosperity in this country, we \nhave been doing nothing to ensure that we would be able to provide the \nenergy resources--the oil and gas on which our economy runs--at the \ntime when our economy is up and running, as it is now; and, therefore, \nwe should not be surprised that the demand for this product has \noutstripped the supply. He is correct in that.\n  Thanks to Senator Murkowski, who chairs the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in the Senate, we have the statistics which back up \nthis statement.\n  Since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 17 percent, but consumption \nis up\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\n14 percent. That is the basic fact right there. Demand is up \nsignificantly but production in this country is down significantly. The \nreason production is down is because of the specific policies of this \nadministration.\n  It should come as no surprise to us that when demand is greater and \nsupply is less, the price is going to go up. Only those who do not \nunderstand the free market would fail to appreciate this fact and point \nthe finger at someone else.\n  Imports, we learned from Senator Murkowski, are now at 56 percent of \nour total supply and growing rapidly. In fact, they are in the \nneighborhood of about 62 percent during some months--specifically \nduring this period of time.\n  By comparison, in 1973, during the time of the Arab oil embargo, we \nimported about 35 percent of foreign oil.\n  Remember how we were complaining at that point about how dependent \nupon these OPEC supplies we were--35 percent then and up to 62 percent \nnow.\n  We are approaching twice as much dependency on foreign oil supplies \nas we had during the time of the great oil embargo of the early 1970s.\n  At current prices, I might add, the United States spends $300 million \na day on imported oil. That is over $100 billion per year on foreign \noil, which, incidentally, is about one-third of our entire trade \ndeficit.\n  This puts into clear perspective the amount of our reliance on these \nforeign sources.\n  Are the people who supply this oil from abroad our friends when it \ncomes to the supplying of this particular product? Are they working \nwith us to keep the prices down? No. We know, as matter of fact, in \nthis area even that our friends are willing to take advantage of the \ngreat demand and thirst for this product in the United States.\n\n  The OPEC nations, which include our friend to the south, Mexico, and \nother countries in this hemisphere, but most especially the countries \nin the Middle East led by our friend, Saudi Arabia, have restricted the \nsupply so as to drive the cost of the product up.\n  It is real simple. When we don't have control over the supply that \nour friends do, they will take advantage of us. Frankly, we can't blame \nthem. That is part of the way the market operates. We would object that \nthey have gathered together in the form of a monopoly or oligopoly, and \nthey are controlling the price. But it is their ability to do that on \nthe foreign market. We understand that. We should not be surprised by \nit. But we should be committed to doing something about it.\n  For 7 years, this administration not only has not done anything about \nit; it has gotten us more and more deeply in the hole of reliance on \nforeign oil.\n  I have a friend back home--a rancher. The Presiding Officer will \nprobably appreciate this kind of western humor, since he likes to \ncollect these items. He said he has an attitude. He said: When you are \ntrying to get out of a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging.\n  I submit that we are going to keep digging the hole deeper and deeper \nif we don't stop this reliance on foreign oil, and if we don't start \ndoing something about increasing our supply here at home.\n  It turns out that we have plenty of opportunities, which I will get \nto in just a moment.\n  One other fact that I think is important to note is that 36 \nrefineries have closed since 1992. We have had no new refineries built \nin this country since 1976. It is not only the fact that we have less \noil being produced in the United States, but also that less oil product \nis being refined in this country primarily because of the stringency of \nenvironmental regulations.\n  What has been the administration's policy? Its energy policy says \nthat we should have a mix of energy sources. But let's look at the \nfacts.\n  We have the lowest production in this country since world War II. We \nare importing more oil than ever before. We have regulations and taxes \ndesigned basically to close the oil industry. The President himself \nvetoed a bill to open so-called ANWR in 1995 with 16 billion barrels of \noil--that is about a 30-year supply of imports from Saudi Arabia--and \nhas instead advocated increasing royalty rates, which, of course, would \nmake foreign investment even more attractive to U.S. companies and \ncause them to not want to produce oil here in this country.\n  I get letters from constituents who say we should close down any \noffshore drilling or any drilling of oil in the Alaska reserve. I think \nthese people need to appreciate that there was an area cut out of the \nwilderness area in Alaska and designated specifically for the \nproduction of oil. It is a very small area. We created a vast new \nwilderness on the North Slope of Alaska. It is a beautiful area. I have \nbeen there. But we created a very small island in there in effect that \ndoes not have any particular environmental benefit compared to the \nareas around it. We said in that particular area we would explore for \noil. It is in that area that we are talking about producing this 16 \nbillion barrels of oil.\n\n  I have been to that area. I suggest anybody who believes we should \nnot pursue the exploration for oil in that area ought to visit it. I \nthink they will see two things. First, we have found a way to drill for \noil that is very environmentally safe and benign. In effect, in a very \nsmall area about the size of this Senate Chamber, up to 10 wells can be \ndrilled at a depth of about 10,000 feet with another 10, 15, or more \nthousand feet of drilling horizontally to a point of oil. We have a \nvery small area where the oil drilling is actually evident from the \nsurface of the Earth but a very large area underneath from which the \noil is taken. This is done in an extraordinarily environmentally safe \nway. You cannot even tell, when you are on the surface, what is being \ndone.\n  We can explore for and obtain oil from these sites, such as the \nAlaska oil, as well as offshore sites, using the same technology \nwithout environmental damage. However, the administration has precluded \nus from doing so.\n  Now, we have a great deal of coal, much low sulfur. The cleanest coal \nin the lower 48 States was locked up when the President declared the \nlarge area of Montana a national monument and, therefore, we could not \ntake advantage of the low-sulfur coal that is located in that area.\n  Nuclear power is the cleanest of all, but this administration has \nbeen opposed to nuclear power. In fact, there have been no new power \nplants, and the President, of course, vetoed the nuclear waste disposal \nbill. This is essential for the further development of nuclear power.\n  With respect to hydropower, we have a Secretary of Interior who says \nhe was to be the first Secretary to tear down dams. We cannot produce \nhydropower without dams.\n  With respect to natural gas, vast areas of coal development in both \nthe OCS and the Rocky Mountain area have been closed to natural gas.\n  The bottom line is this administration's policy is not conducive to \nthe development of new sources of energy in the United States, even \nenvironmentally safe, environmentally benign sources. Instead, \nvirtually every policy this administration has pursued has had the \neffect of reducing U.S. oil production and increasing our reliance upon \nforeign sources. All that does is enable those foreign sources to take \nadvantage of this reliance by reducing their production and jacking up \nthe price. American consumers are paying the result of that at the \npump.\n  I have one or two other statistics. Since the start of the Clinton-\nGore administration, according to Senator Murkowski's figures, domestic \noil production in the United States has fallen by 17 percent for the \nreasons I articulated. We can't, with that level of reduction in U.S. \noil production, maintain a level which enables the U.S. to control our \nown destiny in terms of the price of oil. We are already spending over \n$100 billion per year on foreign oil, about a third of our trade \ndeficit.\n  As a result of these facts, I have joined with Senator Lott, our \nmajority leader, and others, in introducing the National Energy \nSecurity Act of 2000, S. 2557, the goal of which is to roll back our \ndependence on foreign oil to a level below 50 percent.\n  In conclusion, there has been a lot of finger pointing. Some say it \nis the result of taxes. I support, at least temporarily--in fact, I \nwould support permanently--removing the 18.4-percent Federal gas tax. \nPeople say that is only a drop in the bucket. It is almost 20 cents on \nthe price of a gallon of gas. That is not peanuts if you have to fill \nyour car as much as a lot of folks do.\n\n  The EPA has been changing its mind about additives. In some parts of \nthe\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\ncountry that has increased the cost of a gallon of gasoline.\n  We have fewer refineries, as I indicated.\n  Most of all, it is ``the chickens are coming home to roost'' answer \nthat Senator Domenici provided; namely, that we have decreased the \nUnited States oil production at the same time we are relying more and \nmore on foreign oil. The net result of that should come as no surprise \nto anyone. We are going to have to pay higher prices at the gas pumps \nas a result.\n  It is time that the United States had a clear strategy, a good energy \npolicy, that promoted the development of oil resources in the United \nStates in a safe and environmentally clean way. That can be done. I \nbelieve under a new administration which is focused on developing an \nenergy strategy that will suit the American people, it will be done.\n  I thank Senator Thomas for making some of his time available to talk \nabout this important subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Quite often we have difficulties, we have problems, and we really \ndon't think about the policy that has created it--or in this case, the \nlack of policy.\n  I think it is very important that as we have the great growth of \nenergy use in this country, that we take a look at our policy and not \nlet ourselves become captives of overseas production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5766-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           M/V ``MIST COVE''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2327, the Oceans \nAct of 2000. This bill would establish a Commission on Ocean Policy to \nassess the problems that face our nation's coastal regions. Over half \nof the U.S. population lives in these areas and they are the source of \none third of our gross domestic product. Clearly, the current problems \nfaced in our coastal areas cannot be left unattended. Senator Hollings, \nthe ranking member on the Commerce Committee, has worked hard on this \nlegislation. I am pleased that the Committee was able to report this \nbill in the most expeditious manner.\n  The Commission will examine current programs and policies related to \ncoastal and Great Lakes regions, and determine whether the problems in \nsuch areas are adequately addressed by current laws, regulations, and \npublic policy. The 1966 Stratton Commission, also the result of the \nhard work of Senators Hollings, Stevens, and Inouye, led to the \nestablishment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nand the enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act. While the \nStratton Commission provided an invaluable service to our nation, over \nthirty years have passed since that landmark study. Now it is necessary \nto reexamine the programs, policies, and state of America's coastal \nareas.\n  The Commission established by this bill will issue recommendations to \nthe President and Congress to develop an effective and efficient \nnational policy for our coastal regions. Mr. President, it is time for \na comprehensive review of the policies that affect so many Americans.\n  I thank Senator Hollings for his hard work and determination to \naddress this issue. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass the Oceans \nAct of 2000.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \npassage of S. 2327, the Oceans Act of 2000. The bill calls for an \naction plan for the twenty-first century to explore, protect, and make \nbetter use of our oceans and coasts. Its passage is, quite simply, the \nmost important step we can take today to ensure an effective, \ncoordinated and comprehensive ocean policy to guide us into the new \nmillennium.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Commerce Committee for their support, in \nparticular, Senators Snowe, Kerry, and Stevens, for their cosponsorship \nand their efforts over the last several weeks to bring this bill to the \nfloor. Following in the Commerce Committee tradition with respect to \nocean issues, this has been a bipartisan process. I also thank the \nother cosponsors of the legislation, Senators Breaux, Inouye, Boxer, \nLautenberg, Murkowski, Lieberman, Akaka, Feinstein, Cleland, Moynihan, \nMurray, Reed, Sarbanes, Schumer, Wyden, Landrieu, Murkowski, Chafee, \nand Roth for their continued support. Finally, I want to express my \nappreciation to the numerous industry, environmental, and academic \ngroups who agree that the time has come for this bill.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we enact the Oceans Act of 2000 \nthis year as we pass through the gateway to a new millennium. The \noceans are again beginning to receive the attention they received in \n1966 when we enacted legislation to establish a Commission on Marine \nScience, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton Commission \nfor its chairman Julius Stratton) to recommend a comprehensive national \nprogram to explore the oceans, develop marine and coastal resources, \nand conserve the sea. The Stratton Commission's report and \nrecommendations have shaped U.S. ocean policy for three decades, and \nresulted in the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) under Presidential Reorganization Plan Number \nFour, as well as most of the major marine conservation status NOAA \nimplements. These include the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and the \nCoastal Zone Management Act.\n  Where the Stratton Commission performed its work with vision and \nintegrity, the world has changed in myriad ways since 1966. Ocean and \ncoastal issues are growing more popular day by day, but we are able to \nmake the necessary headway to ensure they get the attention and \npriority they deserve. Consider the following quote from the National \nResearch Council's report entitled Striking a Balance, Improving \nStewardship of Marine Areas:\n\n       The findings of the Marine Board studies have revealed a \n     strong interest in the nation's coastal and marine areas by \n     present and potential offshore industries, coastal states \n     responsible for resource development and environmental \n     preservation of their offshore regions, and the ocean \n     research community. Little has been done, however, to devise \n     a comprehensive regulatory or management framework for \n     current or future activities in federal and state waters or \n     on or under the seabed in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. \n     The need for a regulatory and\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\n     management framework is likely to increase in the future . . \n     . No mechanism exists for establishing a common vision and \n     a common set of objectives . . . .\n\n  Establishing an independent national Ocean Commission in the year \n2000 could comprehensively evaluate concerns that cannot be viewed \neffectively through current federal processes or through privately-\ncommissioned studies. These include concerns about providing \nappropriate priority and funding for critical ocean conservation and \nmanagement issues, as well as whether the ocean management regimes that \nhave developed over the last 30 years are duplicative and \nuncoordinated, resulting in costly or time-consuming requirements that \nmay provide little incremental environmental benefit.\n  The essential elements of the legislation before the Senate today \nremain the same as the Committee-reported version, with further \namendments to reinforce the importance of science in supporting the \nCommission's activities. The Oceans Act of 2000 would establish a 16-\nmember high level national Commission, similar to the Stratton \nCommission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and report within \n18 months on recommendations for a national policy. The Commission \nmembers would be selected from individuals nominated by majority and \nminority representatives in both houses of Congress. Eligible \nindividuals include a truly balanced group of experts representing \nstate and local governments, academia, ocean-related industries and \npublic interest groups.\n  The Act would become effective at the end of this year, enabling the \ncurrent Administration to complete the interagency ocean initiative \nresulting from the hard work done by the ocean community for the 1998 \nInternational Year of the Ocean. It will also allow the incoming \nAdministration time to evaluate the Commission nominees and make \nappointments. Once the Commission completes its recommendations to the \nPresident and to Congress, it will then be the President's turn to \nreport to Congress how he will respond to these recommendations. As in \n1966, the real work will begin after the Commission completes its \nreport. History has taught us that Congressional support and \nparticipation is essential to ensuring the long-term success of this \ntruly national ocean effort. We are off to a very good start. The \ncurrent bill enjoys wide support in the Senate and from industry, \nconservation groups, scientists, and states, all of whom have sent \nnumerous letters of support over the past several months. Most \nrecently, we have received letters of support from the Chairman of the \nNational Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, the fifty-\nthree member institutions that are part of the Consortium for \nOceanographic Research and Education, as well as fourteen major \ntelecommunications and information technology groups.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is both appropriate and long overdue. \nBy the end of this decade about 60% of Americans will live along our \ncoasts, which account for less than 10% of our land area. I am amazed \nthat in this era, when we've invested billions of dollars in exploring \nother planets, we know so little about the ocean and coastal systems \nupon which we and other living things depend. Large storms events like \nHurricane Floyd and Hugo, driven by ocean-circulation patterns, pose \nthe ultimate risk to human health and safety. El Nino-related climate \nevents have led to increased incidence of malaria in some countries. \nHarmful algal blooms have been linked to deaths of sea lions in \nCalifornia and manatees in Florida, and we are still searching to \nunderstand their effects on humans. The oceans are home to 80% of all \nlife forms on Earth, but only 1% of our biotechnology R budget will \nfocus on marine life forms. Mr. President, the oceans are integral to \nour lives but we are not putting a high enough priority on finding ways \nto learn more about them, and what they may hold for our future.\n  The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the \nUnited States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly \nits security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for \nfood and raw materials, its position and influence in the world \ncommunity, and the quality of the environment in which its people \nlive.'' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago. It is \ntime to look towards the next 30 years. As a nation, we must consider \nthe challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and ensure the \ndevelopment of an integrated national ocean and coastal policy to deal \nwith them well into the next millennium. I urge the Senate to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 2327, \nthe Oceans Act of 2000. I am pleased to support this bill, which will \nhave a major influence on the direction of U.S. ocean policy, \nmanagement, and research for many years to come.\n  In 1966, Congress established the Stratton Commission through the \nenactment of the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act. The \nStratton Commission provided a comprehensive evaluation of the role of \nthe ocean to the United States and provided a series of recommendations \nregarding ocean and coastal policy for the future.\n  After over 30 months of meetings, hearings, and correspondence, the \nCommission produced the 1969 report, ``Our Nation and the Sea''. The \ndocument made a significant impact on coastal and ocean policy, leading \nto the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nin 1970 and the National Coastal Zone Management Program in 1972.\n  Now, over thirty years after publication of the original Stratton \nCommission report, it is time to reexamine current U.S. programs and \nlegislation that affect the oceans, Great Lakes, and coastal zones. Our \ncoastal regions and ocean resources are under increasing pressures. In \nthe United States, more than 53 percent of the population is living in \ncoastal regions that comprise only 17 percent of the contiguous U.S. \nland area. Additionally, the coastal population is increasing by 3,600 \npeople per day, with a projected coastal increase of 27 million people \nby the year 2015.\n  The increasing pressures on the coast are being mirrored in the \noceans. Valuable commercial activities such as shipping and maritime \ntransportation, oil and gas production, and fishing impact the oceans \nand Great Lakes. Additionally, environmental stresses, such as \npollution and increased water temperatures potentially due to global \nclimate change, are exacerbating existing problems.\n  The Oceans Act of 2000 will create a Commission on Ocean Policy to \nexamine a variety of ocean and Great Lakes issues. Protection of the \nmarine environment, prevention of marine pollution, enhancement of \nmaritime commerce and transportation, response to natural hazards, and \npreservation of the United States' role as a leader in ocean and \ncoastal activities will all be reviewed. The Commission will be \ncomposed of 16 members that represent state and local governments, \nocean-related industries, academic and technical institutions, and \nrelevant public interest organizations. The members will be nominated \nby Congress and appointed by the President.\n  The Commission will be responsible for submitting a report to \nCongress and the President, within 18 months, containing their \nrecommendations. These recommendations will focus on the development of \na comprehensive, cost-effective policy to address pressing ocean and \ncoastal issues. It will provide important guidance to policy makers on \nhow to shape the future direction of ocean policy for the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize Senator Hollings, the author \nof the bill, for his work creating the original Stratton Commission and \nfor his leadership on this issue. In addition, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye, both original cosponsors of the legislation, were \ninvolved with the work of the Stratton Commission, and I look forward \nto working with them and the other members of the Commerce Committee on \nthe Oceans Act of 2000. Finally, I would like to thank Senator McCain, \nthe Chairman of the Committee and Senator Kerry, the ranking member of \nthe Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for their support of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 3620) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2327), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator Snowe has an amendment at the desk. I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3621:\n       On page 13, beginning with ``Any'' in line 23, strike \n     through line 2 on page 14.\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3621) was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1651, the \nFishermen's Protective Act Amendments of 1999. This bill makes a number \nof conservation and management improvements to several important \nfisheries laws. First, it amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 \nto extend current law from\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\nfiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2003 so that reimbursement may be \nprovided to owners of U.S. fishing vessels illegally detained or seized \nby foreign countries. In 1998, there were not any claims filed under \nthis law, but in 1996 and 1997, U.S. vessel owners were reimbursed over \n$290,000 based on 261 claims for illegal transit fees charged by \nCanada. Because this provision of the law has expired, the bill will \nensure that U.S. vessels who are illegally seized or fined are able to \nseek reimbursement.\n  Second, the bill establishes a panel to advise the Secretaries of \nState and Interior on Yukon River Salmon management issues in Alaska. \nIn 1985, the United States and Canada signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty. \nThis treaty established a framework with which to bilaterally manage \ntheir shared salmon stocks. Ten years later, the countries signed an \ninterim agreement regarding management of the stock of salmon in the \nYukon River. The United States implemented the agreement on Yukon River \nsalmon through the Fisheries Act of 1995, creating a Yukon River salmon \npanel and advisory committee.\n  When the interim agreement expired in 1998, it was unclear whether \nthe advisory panel was still authorized to recommend salmon restoration \nmeasures. This bill codifies the Yukon River Salmon Panel, established \nunder the 1995 interim agreement, to advise the Secretary of State on \nYukon River Salmon management, advise the Secretary of Interior on \nenhancement and restoration of the salmon stocks, and perform other \nactivities that relate to the conservation and management of Yukon \nRiver salmon stocks. H.R. 1651, as amended, also authorizes $4 million \na year for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2003. Up to $3 million of \nthese funds can be used by the Departments of Commerce and Interior for \nsurvey, restoration, and enhancement projects related to Yukon River \nsalmon. In addition, the reported bill authorizes $600,000 for \ncooperative salmon research and management projects in the United \nStates portion of the Yukon River drainage area that have been \nrecommended by the Panel.\n  Third, the bill, as amended by the Commerce Committee, authorizes $60 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for the Secretary of \nCommerce to acquire two fishery research vessels. These vessels are one \nof the most important fishery management tools available to federal \nscientists. Because they conduct the vast majority of fishery stock \nassessments, their reliability is critical to fishery management. \nSpecies abundance, recruitment, age class composition, and responses to \necological change and fishing pressure can all be studied with these \nresearch platforms. The information obtained using them is critical for \nthe improvement of the regulations governing fisheries management.\n\n  In New England, there is only one NOAA research vessel--the Albatross \nIV. This vessel is 38 years old, at the end of its useful life, and \npractically obsolete. Despite this, the vessel continues to collect the \nsurvey data that is used for management decisions regarding valuable \nNortheast fisheries stocks, including cod, haddock and herring. A \nreplacement vessel is crucial to maintaining the existing ability to \ncollect the long term fisheries, oceanographic, and biological data \nnecessary to improve fishery management decisions. According to the \nCommerce Department, the deterioration of the Albatross IV has created \nan urgent need for a replacement vessel in the Northeast.\n  Finally, the bill also addresses the use of spotter aircraft in the \nNew England-based Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) fishery. Mr. President, \nin 1998, the Highly Migratory Species Advisory Panel, established under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, \nunanimously requested and advised the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit \nthe use of spotter aircraft in the General and Harpoon categories of \nthe ABT fishery. The use of these planes can accelerate the catch rates \nand closures in the General and Harpoon categories. In turn, the \naccelerated catch rates can have an adverse impact on the scientific \nand conservation objectives of the highly migratory species fishery \nmanagement plan and the communities that depend on the fishery. \nMoreover, the use of such aircraft has resulted in an unsafe and often \nhostile environment in the ABT fishery.\n  Over two years ago, NMFS issued a proposed rule to adopt the Advisory \nPanel recommendation. Unfortunately, NMFS has delayed the rule time and \nagain, and ultimately failed to finalize it. Consequently, it has \nbecome necessary to take legislative action on the issue. This bill \nadopts the Commerce Secretary's Advisory Panel recommendation and \nprohibits the use of spotter aircraft in the General and Harpoon \ncategories of the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery.\n  I thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee for his hard work and support, especially with regard to \nthe provisions related to the NOAA fishery research vessels and the \nAtlantic bluefin tuna fishery. Both of these provisions are quite \nimportant in New England. I would also like to express my appreciation \nto Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and Senator \nHollings, the ranking member of the Committee for their bipartisan \nsupport of this measure. I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1651, as \namended.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the committee \namendment, as amended be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill was read the \nthird time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5771-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5771-S5773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ENERGY COSTS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are focusing today on energy and energy \ncosts, which is something of which each of us is certainly aware. I \nsuspect there is more exposure to gasoline prices than any other \nparticular price. As we drive down Main Street in our hometowns, on \nevery block we see a big sign showing the price of gasoline, and it \ncertainly changes.\n  I wanted to go back a little, however. As the Senator from Arizona \nmentioned, there is a background here. I think there are several \nreasons, of course, why we have the price difficulties we have now. It \nis a complex story. It has to do with global supply and demand. It has \nto do with technological change and environmental consciousness, the \nshifting of consumer tastes, and social order. It also, of course, has \na great deal to do with restrictions and regulations that have been \nimposed.\n  But one of the other things it has to do with is the availability and \naccess to public lands. About 54 percent of the surface of this country \nbelongs to the Federal Government. Most of that, of course, lies in the \nWest. The State ownership in my State of Wyoming is about 50 percent of \nthe total. It goes up to as high as 90 percent of the total in Nevada \nand Alaska and other States. So the idea of multiple use and access to \nthese lands becomes a very important factor, not only for resources \nsuch as oil and gas, but equally important and perhaps even more \nimportant, often, for recreation, access for hunting and fishing \nrecreation. We have seen, in recent months, an even more focused effort \non the part of this administration to reduce access to public lands, to \nmake it more difficult for the people who own those public lands to \nhave an opportunity to utilize them.\n  After all, I happen to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks. The purpose of a national park, of course, is not only \nto preserve the resource, the national treasure, but to make it \navailable for the people who own it to use it; that is, the taxpayers \nof this country. It is true, parks are quite different than BLM lands, \nquite different than Forest Service lands, but the principle is still \nthere; that we ought to preserve that resource and at the same time \nhave multiple use so its owners can enjoy it for recreation, can enjoy \nit for hunting or fishing, so the economy of this country and the \neconomy of this particular State can be enhanced by the multiple use of \nthose resources.\n  As we move into different ways of prospecting for oil and different \nways of mining, different ways of using snowmobiles and so on, we find \nwe have a better opportunity, as time goes by, to use those resources \nwithout causing damage.\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\n  Particularly towards the end of this administration, and it has been \nstated very clearly by the Secretary of Interior and Assistant \nSecretaries of Interior, they are going to make a mark here. The \nPresident has indicated he would like to change his legacy to be like \nthat of Theodore Roosevelt, who did all these things for public lands. \nThe Secretary himself said: If the Congress is not going to do this, we \nwill go ahead and do it without them.\n  That is a real challenge to one of the strong principles of this \nGovernment, the principle of divided government. We have it divided in \nthe Constitution so we have the executive branch, we have the \nlegislative branch, and we have the judicial branch. We have that \nseparation for a very important reason. That is so none of those three \nbranches is able to assume all the responsibility and all of the \nauthority--and, frankly, very little of the accountability.\n  What we have seen in the last few months is a movement by the \nadministration to go out on its own and make a bunch of regulations and \ndo things, under the Antiquities Act, which reduce the availability of \nthe lands for people who own them to enjoy them; for example, setting \naside 40 million acres of forest lands as roadless. There are several \nproblems with that. I don't particularly have any problem with some of \nthat. We have lots of forest lands in my State, and I am glad we do. My \nparents' property, their ranch, where I grew up, was right next-door to \na national forest. There is nothing I care more for.\n  But the fact is, we ought to have a system for deciding how we handle \nthese lands. Instead of using the forest plan which is what the system \nis supposed to be, for instance, in the Black Hills we spent 7 years \nand $7 million doing a forest plan, and now the bureaucrats here in \nWashington decide we are going to have a national roadless area, \nwithout accommodating the people with an opportunity to discuss it for \neach of the forests, and without coming to the Congress.\n  Now there are a series of meetings going on which the Forest Service \ntalks about a lot, but I have attended some of those and the fact is \nwhen you go, they are not able to tell you really what the plan is. So \nno one has a chance to react. So what we have, in effect, is the \nopportunity to avoid this.\n  The people I have heard from, who feel very strongly about it--some \nhappen to be disabled persons, some happen to be veterans--say: Wait a \nminute, we don't need a road everywhere. But we need enough roads to \nhave access so people who cannot walk 17 miles with a pack on their \nback still have the opportunity to take advantage of that resource that \nis so important. So I think that is one of the things that is very \ndifficult.\n\n  The Bureau of Land Management also put out a ruling on off-road \nusage. I don't have any problem with that either. We ought not to have \nfour-wheelers going everywhere. We ought not to have roads going \neverywhere. But we ought to have a plan so people can have access by at \nleast having a road for access. You don't need five roads; I understand \nthat. So there needs to be a plan.\n  The Antiquities Act is a very important act. In fact, it was very \nimportant to my State of Wyoming with respect to the Devils Tower and \nthe Grand Teton National Park; it gives the President the authority to \nset aside certain lands in special use. Relatively little of that has \nhappened over the last few years, but this President in the last 6 \nmonths has set aside hundreds of thousands of acres, without the \ninvolvement of anyone. That is not the system. This is the same \nadministration that wants to do an environmental impact statement on \neverything that is done, so you could have public input. I am for that. \nI pushed very hard to have the opportunity for local governments to be \ninvolved in the decisions that are made and impact their States. There \nare no such decisions here, just one made by this administration.\n  Now we have what is called a CARE Act, to take $3.5 billion from \noffshore royalties and have it as mandatory spending, where the \nCongress has nothing to do with deciding how use of that money is \nplanned, $1 billion a year to be used for the acquisition of more and \nmore Federal lands. We feel very strongly about that in the West. It \ndoesn't mean there are not pieces of land that need to be acquired, \nneed to be set aside--no one opposes that. But the fact is, if you want \nto acquire more land in Wyoming, which is already 50 percent Federal \nowned, why not go ahead and acquire it and then release an equal value \nof Federal lands somewhere else so you don't have a net gain. That is a \nreasonable thing to do and we intend to pursue that, in terms of this \nCARE Act.\n  The endangered species, again, who argues with endangered species, \ntrying to protect the critters? The fact is, however, there has been no \ninvolvement in the listing of the animals; there has been very little \nopportunity to find a recovery plan. We have had grizzly bears listed \nnow for 10 years around Yellowstone Park. The numbers have far exceeded \nthe goal that was set. But you can talk about habitat forever and they \ncontinue to be there. We just have to manage this public land so it is \navailable and useful.\n  The Clean Water Act, nonpoint-source clean water, has also been used \nto manage land.\n  That is where we are. Interestingly, the latest one has been the \nproposal to ban snowmobiles from Yellowstone Park--in fact, from 27 \nparks. Again, I don't argue that there needs to be more management of \nthese vehicles so you ought to do something about the noise, ought to \ndo something about the air emissions, ought to do something about \nseparating them so we have a snow team over here, we can have cross-\ncountry skiers over here, without interfering with each other. The fact \nis, the Park Service over 20 years has never done anything to manage \nthis thing.\n  Now all of a sudden they say: It is not going the way it ought to, so \nwe are going to ban it for everyone. That is not a good way to manage a \nresource.\n  We find an increasing bureaucratic self-declaration that they are \ngoing to do these things, and if the Congress does not like it, that is \ntoo bad. That is not the way this Government is designed to work. Quite \nfrankly, we cannot let that happen.\n  How does this tie into energy? As I mentioned before, almost 55 \npercent of public land in the West belongs to the Federal Government. \nMost of the opportunities for resource development have been on these \nFederal lands in the West. They have been a very important part of the \nState economies. They have been a very important part of the natural \nproduction.\n  Over the last several years, it has become more and more difficult, \nbecause of regulations and rules, for people to go on these lands and \nproduce resources, even though they very clearly, under the law, have \nto reclaim the land, whether it is mining or oil wells. We have an \nincreased demand for energy on the one hand and a reduction in \nproduction on the other, and we are certainly a victim of overseas \nproduction.\n  Americans consume over 130 billion gallons of gasoline, almost four \ntimes as much as 50 years ago. Consumption has grown at a rate of 1.5 \npercent. That translates to about 8.4 million barrels a day, which is \n45 percent of the total oil production. There is increased usage, a \nreduction in domestic production, and we are at the mercy of OPEC.\n  It is also interesting that in 1999, the tax component of gasoline \nwas approximately 40 cents a gallon, or about 34 percent of the total \ncost. Interestingly enough, the price component of a gallon of gas, \ncrude oil, and taxes is about equal: 18.5 cents is Federal and 20 cents \nis the average State tax that is levied on top.\n  We also find ourselves with additional restrictions and regulations, \nput on this year, with making some changes in our policy if we are to \ndeal with this increased demand. Obviously, there are a number of \nthings that ought to be done over time.\n  We ought to take a look at consumption and continue pushing for high-\nmileage vehicles and reduce demand.\n  We need to take a look at domestic production so we are not totally \ndependent on imported energy.\n  We need to take a long look at the regulations and see if there are \nalternatives and whether they can be more economical, and whether, in \nfact, what we are doing has been thoroughly thought through. I am not \nsure that has been the case.\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\n  I have no objection to taking a long look at the pricing of gasoline \nas well. It is interesting that there is such a great disparity in \nprices in different parts of the country. Perhaps there is a good, \nlogical reason for that. If so, we should know about it.\n  I hope our energy policy does not become totally political. The fact \nis, we have not had an energy policy in this administration. We have \nheld hearings in our committee, not only with this Secretary of Energy, \nbut the previous two Secretaries of Energy. One says: Yes, we are going \nto have a policy. The fact is, we do not. The fact is, we have not been \nable to fully utilize coal. We have not been able to take advantage of \nnuclear power by stalling in getting our nuclear waste stored. There \nare a lot of things we need to do and, indeed, should do. It is \nunfortunate we have not had the cooperation from this administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5773-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a conversation I \nheard yesterday on the Sunday talk shows. It is too bad that on the \nSunday talk shows the issues are not more clearly defined.\n  This talk show was on Social Security and options, which are clearly \nlegitimate options. The options separate the points of view of the \nparties and the candidates. I am talking about taking a portion of the \nSocial Security program, as it now exists for an individual, and \nputting it into his or her private account and investing it in the \nprivate sector in equities or in bonds or a combination of the two. The \nreturn stays with this person because it is their account.\n  Out of the 12.5 percent that each of us pay--and each of these young \npeople will pay in the first job they have, and if something does not \nhappen by the time they are ready for benefits, there will be none. We \nhave to make some changes.\n  One of the changes we can make, of course, is to increase taxes. \nThere is not a lot of enthusiasm for that. For many people, Social \nSecurity is the highest tax: 12.5 percent right off the top.\n  The second change is we could reduce benefits. Not many people are \ninterested in reducing benefits.\n  The third change is to take those dollars that are put into the so-\ncalled trust fund and invest them for a higher return. Under the law, \nthose dollars can only be invested in Government securities which, in \nthis case, is a very low return.\n  We are talking about taking those same dollars that belong to you and \nto me and putting them in individual accounts. They can be invested, \nand the earnings would be part of that person's Social Security \npayment.\n  Yesterday, the implication was that would be a part of it, and then \nwe have to fix up Social Security and replace all the money that is put \nin these private accounts. That is not the fact. The fact is, they are \nstill part of Social Security, but they are yours. You make a decision \nhow they are invested, and then you get your 10 percent, as it always \nis, plus the return to the 2 percent on top of that, and that \nrepresents your benefits.\n  The lady yesterday representing the Clinton administration indicated \nwe would have to replace all those dollars and go ahead with Social \nSecurity as it is. That is just not the fact.\n  This is an opportunity for us to increase the return, to ensure those \ndollars and those benefits will be there when the time comes for \nsomeone to receive them, and to do that without increasing taxes, \nwithout reducing benefits, but by simply taking advantage of the \nopportunity of a better return on the investment.\n  A couple of Senators are going to be here shortly. In the meantime, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nthat has been discussed by Senator Thomas, and others, just before I \ncame to the floor. It is also an issue that every American who drives a \ncar has on his or her mind.\n  No one could fail to see the impact the high price of gasoline at the \npump is having on hard-working Americans and American families at the \nend of June who are looking to take their family vacations. They hope \nto do it by car. I hope they can, too. But we have a situation with \nregard to gas prices that has occurred for a number of reasons. And \nbecause Congress and this administration have not acted, we have a \nworse situation than ever.\n  I will talk a little bit about some of the causes of this. But I do \nnot think we have to dwell on the causes all day because I think we can \ndo something proactive that will begin to be a solution--both a short-\nterm solution and a long-term solution.\n  First, the causes. Clearly, we have an incredible dependence on \nforeign oil today. Seven years ago, we had about a 46-percent \ndependence on foreign oil; today, it is 56 percent; and it is projected \nto be 65 percent of our oil needs by 2020. So I think it is incumbent \non all of us in public office to try to take short-term steps to solve \nthe immediate crisis, particularly in the Midwest, but not without \ntaking long-term action as well.\n  We have a bill that is pending at the desk today. It is the National \nEnergy Security Act. It would take some steps, putting some things on \nthe table that would make a difference for our country and for the \nworking people of our country who depend on gasoline.\n  Let's look at some of the causes for the gas price crisis now being \nseen in the Midwest and elsewhere. The Congressional Research Service \nhas attribute 25 cents of every gallon of gasoline at the pump in \ncertain parts of the Midwest to the reformulated gas phase 2 \nrequirement that the EPA is insisting on imposing beginning June first \nof this year. These additional costs are the result of the added \nexpense of adjusting the refining process for the new gasoline \nrequirement, particularly when the gasoline is required to be blended \nwith ethanol, as is the case in the Midwest. In addition, there are \nadded costs of transporting the ethanol, which cannot be moved via \npipeline, to the sites where the gasoline is blended and distributed. \nOther additives, such as MTBE, are readily available at the refineries \nand so you have reduced transportation costs. You can put the MTBE--\nwhich was the requirement in the past--in at the refinery and send it \nto places such as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan--the places that \nare suffering right now--but the ethanol has to be carried from the \nagricultural areas, where it is grown, put into a new system in the \nrefineries, and then shipped back to the Midwest. So you are talking \nabout time, shortages, and costs that have added 25 cents per gallon. \nCRS estimates that an additional 25 cents of the increase in Midwest \ngas prices is attributable to recent problems with oil and gas \npipelines that feed the upper Midwest, which have come at a time when \ngasoline stocks nationwide are particularly low and when the demand for \ngasoline is on the rise.\n  With regard to the EPA requirements, we had hoped the EPA would say, \nOK, we are facing a crisis right now, so maybe for this summer we can \nrelax those new EPA regulations and go with what has been the \nregulation of the past.\n  Secondly, it is very important to realize that each State and many \nlocal governments impose additional taxes on gasoline at the pump. It \njust so happens that many of the midwestern States and cities within \nthose States have higher taxes than the average in the country. The \naverage combined federal and state gasoline excise tax is about 40 \ncents per gallon. In Chicago, Illinois, however, it is 61.3 cents per \ngallon. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it is 47.2 cents per gallon. So we can \nsee that there are wide differences across the country in taxes of \ngasoline.\n  I commend the Governors of these States who are seeing the crisis and \nresponding immediately. The Governor of Indiana has put a moratorium on \nthe State sales tax on gasoline. The Governor of Illinois is calling a \nspecial session of the legislature to review taking similar action.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  The Federal Government should assist these and other States by \nrepealing, for a time, the 18.4 cents-per-gallon Federal gas tax. If we \nsuspend this Federal tax through Labor Day of this year, that will give \nrelief in addition to the State taxes selected States are giving, and \nit will give us time to catch up with the EPA regulations and some of \nthe other transportation problems that have caused the rise in gasoline \nprices. We should follow the lead of these midwestern Governors. That \nmay also encourage other States to follow suit by responding in a \nsimilar fashion and giving the American people some much needed relief \nat the pump.\n  I would not for one minute suggest we should take the money from that \ngasoline tax and take it away from the highway trust fund. We need to \nkeep the highway trust fund whole so we can continue to make the \nimprovements in safety and highway construction necessary for the \nStates that depend on those funds.\n  The on-budget Federal surplus is estimated to be about $60 billion \nthis year. The estimates are going up because in fact we are getting \nmore and more of a surplus. We know we want tax relief for hard-working \nAmericans, and this is in fact tax relief for hard-working Americans, \nincluding truckers who are suffering under the increases in diesel fuel \ncosts.\n  We read stories about our own Coast Guard not being able to patrol \nthe waters, where they are supposed to be doing drug interdiction and \npatrolling for summer safety. They can't afford the fuel because the \nprices have gone up so much. We need to give relief across the board, \nand we need to give tax relief for hard-working Americans.\n  I am today introducing legislation granting a temporary repeal, \nthrough Labor Day, of the entire Federal gasoline and diesel tax. The \nbill will also ensure that the highway trust fund is made whole. This \nbill will give hard-working Americans immediate tax relief during the \npeak summer driving months, those who have to drive to work or who are \ngoing to take a family vacation this summer. At the same time we in \nCongress must act to take the longer term steps that we must take to \nhave an energy policy in this country that makes sense.\n  Let's talk about that for a minute. This administration is not only \nadhering to the regulations that make it so hard to drill for oil and \ngas in our own country, causing hundreds of thousands of jobs to go \noverseas, but they are also insisting on increasing the oil royalty \nrates. I fought the increase in oil royalty rates last year and the \nyear before because I was very much afraid we were going to add so much \nto cost that our domestic drillers would go overseas. In fact, that is \nexactly what has happened. We are continuing, through this \nadministration, to have increases in oil royalty rates at a time when \noil prices have spiked to $30 a barrel.\n  The fact is, we can't survive on $10-a-barrel oil and we can't \nsustain the economy on $30-a-barrel oil. That does not make sense for \nour country. What we need is price stability within a reasonable and \nsustainable range. The numbers show we are more and more dependent on \nforeign oil because we make it so hard for the little guys, the \nmarginal well producers, to make it in our country. The big guys are \nleaving our country in droves because it is more efficient to go \nelsewhere to drill for oil and gas.\n\n  As a matter of fact, just to cite a few real numbers, when oil was \n$10 a barrel, the little oil and gas producers went out of business in \ndroves: 150,000 marginal oil and gas wells closed--that is out of a \ntotal of 600,000--65,000 good paying jobs were lost in this country; \ncommunities were devastated.\n  In one example, in Midland-Odessa, the unemployment rate doubled in 1 \nyear from 5 to 10 percent. School district revenues were hit by $150 \nmillion, causing a virtual halt to any new hiring, and in some cases \nschool districts were having to let teachers go in the middle of the \nterm because they could not pay their salaries for the rest of the \nyear. They had to close classrooms because of this crisis when the \nprice of oil was $10 a barrel.\n  For some reason, when we were having that kind of problem, people \nweren't as tuned in. What has happened is, when we lost the 150,000 \nmarginal wells, we lost the ability in 15-barrel-a-day wells to match \nthe amount of oil we import from Saudi Arabia every day, because it \nadds up. We can produce 20 percent of the needs of oil in our country \nwith these 15-barrel-a-day wells.\n  Just to put that in perspective, a well in Alaska produces on average \nabout 600 barrels a day; a well offshore, over 1,000 barrels a day. We \nare talking 15 barrels a day for marginal wells.\n  What I would like to do is have a trigger. If the price goes below \n$14 a barrel for these 15-barrel-a-day drillers, let us have a tax \ncredit so they will be able to stay in business and keep those jobs, \nnot cap the wells, so that when the price goes up to $17 per barrel or \nmore, those people have stayed in business and will keep producing. \nThat is one part of a long-term strategy that would bring us up to 50-\npercent capacity for our oil needs every day.\n  This problem is not going to get better. Dr. Daniel Yergin, the \nPulitzer Prize-winning author who is probably the most credible \nindependent oil economist, told a group of Senators and Members of \nCongress just last week that one of the problems we are facing is an \nincreasing demand because of an increasingly hot economy worldwide.\n  We know our economy in America is very strong, but that is also the \ncase around the world. That causes more demand on our energy resources. \nSo if we are going to have a policy that we would be dependent on \nforeign oil only 50 percent, we are going to have to produce oil in our \nown country and we are going to have to have those little barrels that \nadd up, those little wells that produce 15 barrels a day, that add up \nto hundreds of thousands of jobs in our country, that support our \nschools. We are going to have to keep those people in business because \nthey can't make it at $10 a barrel, but they can make it on $17 a \nbarrel.\n  So if we will treat them like farmers and when we don't have markets, \nor when the prices are so low that a farmer can't make it, we will try \nto keep them stable and level. That is what we have been doing in this \ncountry for a long, long time. I would like to see us treat our small \noil producers in the same way because if there is anything that is \ncrucial to the security of our country, it is at least being able to \nproduce 50 percent of the energy needs of our country in order to have \nsome stabilizing effect. When we depend so much on foreign oil, what \nhappens is they can shut down the supply whenever they want to, and the \nOPEC countries have clearly done that. That causes a spike because of \nlow supply, high demand, overregulation in our own country, and the \nunwillingness of this administration to say we are in a crisis. Let's \nwork together to do something about it.\n  Senator Lott, Senator Murkowski, Senator Domenici, Senator Nickles, \nSenator Breaux, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Landrieu have all been \nvery proactive in trying to put forward a program that would give us \nshort-term relief and long-term relief for energy in our country. I do \nwant the short-term relief of the 18-cent Federal tax to be paused \nuntil after Labor Day for our independent truckers, for our families \ngoing on vacation, and for the working people of our country who must \nuse cars to go to and from work. I want that relief, but we must tie it \nto long-term relief because, if we don't, if things stabilize for the \nshort term, we are still going to be under the thumb of foreign \ninterests; we are still going to face the possibility that another \ncrisis will come. Why not anticipate it and do something proactive now \nthat will provide long-term relief as well as short-term relief?\n  I am introducing legislation that will provide the short-term relief. \nWe must tie that in with the long-term relief if we are going to do \nwhat is right for this country. The National Energy Security Act is \npending before the Senate. I hope we will take the action that has \ncertainly been called for with the crisis we are facing. But let's take \na longer-term view. Let's try to put some long-term energy policies in \nplace because, certainly, this administration has failed to do so.\n  If this administration would step up to the line and say: Of course, \nwe are not going to increase our royalty rates at a time like this and \nsay we need a little more time before the phase II ethanol regulations \ntake effect in the major cities--let's try to tamp down this crisis. \nLet's help the Governors of the Midwest, who are taking State\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\ntaxes off gasoline for this summer, and take the Federal gasoline tax \noff as well, make the highway trust fund whole by giving tax relief to \nhard-working Americans, and let's realize that the security of our \ncountry depends on our being able to provide for our own energy needs. \nIt is clear that no matter what we do for our neighboring countries \nthat supply most of the oil and gas we consume in this country, they \ndon't seem to pay back. I think the fact that they will not up their \nproduction to meet the demand is wrong; nevertheless, I am not going to \nwhine about it. I am going to take positive action that puts America in \ncharge of our own destiny. That is the responsibility of this Congress, \nand that is what this Congress must do.\n  Hopefully, the President will follow our lead and we can do something \nthat is right for America, even if other countries we have helped in \nthe past will not give us a break. We can do what is right for \nourselves, and I hope we will.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I note the presence of the Senator \nfrom Alabama. I am sure he is here because he would like to speak as in \nmorning business. I know we are going to go to an appropriations bill. \nI think the bill is open to amendment. In any event, I don't think the \nSenate would object.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have up to 20 minutes to discuss \ntwo matters and, following that, Senator Sessions have 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the first thing I want to do is \ncongratulate the distinguished Senator from Texas for her speech today. \nBefore she leaves, I say that I summarize the problem we have today in \na way that maybe down in your country, with Texas in mind, they might \nsay it this way: The chickens have come home to roost.\n  The truth is, we have no energy policy, and until something like a \ncrisis occurs, nobody seems to worry about it--in particular, this \nadministration. We have had a ride economically--up, up, and away. Part \nof it is because oil prices from foreign countries was so cheap, and \nAmerica was reducing some of its own, and we just decided that there \nwas no worry about becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil.\n  Look at the facts. While we have had this booming economy, I might \nsuggest to everyone that the unit utilization of petroleum products \nthat make this economy go has come down--not because of anything we did \nbut the high-tech industry uses a little bit less. Nonetheless, we have \ngrown so much that we use far more--as much as 14 percent more--\npetroleum products now than we did a few years ago. Guess what \nhappened. The foreign countries became our source of supply in ever \nlarger proportions. We were happy-go-lucky when Mexico was starving on \n$11-a-barrel oil that we were buying from them. They could not pay \ntheir debts; we were just gobbling it up, and the American producer was \ndisappearing. The price was so low we closed down the opportunity to \ndrill.\n  The litany of what this administration has done so we will produce \nless domestic oil is as long as this sheet of paper; from saying that \nin big areas in which you could look for oil 10 years ago, you can't \nlook for it anymore because something is more important. Not very much \nis more important than our growing dependence, as the greatest \nindustrial might in the world, upon the dictates of foreign countries \nwho sell us that tremendous product, without which we fail. At least \nfrom what I can tell for the next 35 or 40 years, there is no \nsubstitute for it.\n  I heard recently that this administration has somewhat of a defense \nbecause they are going to say: We asked you for some renewable energy \nresearch money and you didn't give it to us. I say right here before \nthe Senate that we will take every single proposal this administration \nhas made for renewables--wind, solar, and the like--and submit it to \nexperts. And we will ask them: Would that have changed the crisis of \ndependence on foreign oil? And, if so, how much? Do you know what it \nwould be? Zero. We don't use those kinds of energies in automobiles \nanyway.\n\n  Frankly, we are getting answers that the way for America to go is to \nput more in renewable sources and the like. We ought to do that. But if \nanybody thinks that is a solution to America's growing dependence on \nforeign oil, they had better take a long sleep because when they \nfinally wake up, they are going to be absolutely surprised that our \ndependence grew while they took a nap.\n  The truth of the matter is we had better sit down with the President \nand decide how we are going to start fixing this.\n  I want to say right now that it is in the worst condition it could \nbe--less American production; more of our land taken out of production; \nand more demand from the foreign countries; and they have finally found \nout how to enforce their agreements. They did not cheat the last couple \nof times on each other; that is, if Saudi Arabia agreed to X number of \nmillions of barrels, they didn't sell it to someone on the side to \nflood the market, nor did Mexico, nor did any country in South America.\n  They are putting just so much oil on a world market that demands \nmore. What do you think happens? The price goes up. It is now past $30 \na barrel. It was as low as $10 a barrel. But, in the meantime, nothing \nis being done for the American producer--large and small--to \nsubstantially increase their domestic production.\n  I am informed enough not to want to leave false impressions. We do \nnot have the wherewithal to totally eliminate dependence. Look at our \ngreat Nation. We are going to be dependent on Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and \na few other countries that produce for a long time after I have left \nthe Senate, if I am successful in staying here 2 more terms. I don't \nknow how long my good friend, the Senator from Texas, expects to be \nhere. But we are going to be dependent.\n  Let me predict the next thing. We are going to have brownouts in \nAmerica, which means the electricity supply to a region of the country \ncannot quite supply enough because we are exchanging it between areas. \nThen there will be another hue and cry: Who did that to us?\n  Just like the answer of this administration today--that it is \ngouging. They may find some gouging. But that is not going to fix this \nenergy problem.\n  We are going to have brownouts because we have not been producing \nenough electricity. We are scared to death to produce it anyway, other \nthan through natural gas, which is the cleanest fuel around. Yet it is \na carbon dioxide producer and is a small portion of the problem that we \nhave in the ambient air and the so-called greenhouse effect.\n  While we hide under the desk and don't want to even discuss nuclear \npower--which currently supplies 21 percent--it has literally zero \ngreenhouse gases. Eighty-four percent of France's electricity is \nnuclear. Their ambient air is as clean as a whistle. They are not \nfrightened one bit to have interim storage of nuclear waste.\n  Here sits the greatest industrial Nation on Earth in a total logjam \nover the issue of moving forward with just a little bit of the nuclear \nenergy and saying let's temporarily store it, while Europe is doing it \nwithout any difficulty and no fear.\n  Where are we going to get the electricity in the future?\n  The problem with greenhouse gases is so severe, according to some, \nthat we aren't going to be able to build any coal-burning plants until \nwe clean it up more. Are we going to do every single one in the future \nwith natural gas? Then the citizens are going to wake up and say: What \ndid you do to natural gas prices? Our bill went up in our homes, and \nnow we are coming to Congress and asking them to do something about it.\n  If you decide to produce all the electricity needs in the future with \nnatural gas, you are going to put a huge demand on American natural \ngas. Who knows where the price will go? Yet we have literally an \nabundance of natural gas in the offshore regions of America. We are \nfrightened to death to drill any more wells. Those who do not want to \nchange that one bit because they are scared of environmental things \nhave won their way, and we are not open to the production of natural \ngas as much as we should.\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n  I close today by saying I believe 7\\1/2\\ years of doing nothing has \n``come home to roost.'' We are just going to get around the corner \nmaybe with this election. But I submit this great Nation is in for two \nbig problems: Where do we get our electric-generating power in the \nfuture? What do we do about nuclear energy?\n  We ought to do much about it instead of falling under the table when \na small percentage will raise their concerns. We ought to increase the \ndomestic supply of oil so that the world knows we haven't gone to sleep \nby opening as many areas as we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5776-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HUMAN GENOMES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, isn't it interesting. I came to the \nfloor today to discuss a completely different subject. I want to do so \nbriefly. It is very difficult to do this because, frankly, there is a \ngreat story about it in the United States today.\n  The National Institutes of Health announced that they have just about \nmapped the human genome, which means in the future, at a minimum, every \nknown dreaded disease of mankind will be located in our chromosome \nsystem by the mapping of the human genome. Where scientists used to \ntake 25 years and devote an entire science department to try to locate \nwhere multiple sclerosis came from within the human body, in short \norder all of those dreaded diseases will be defined in reference to the \ngenetics of the human body, and mutations of that will be discovered as \nthe reason for the diseases. What an exciting thing.\n  I have not been part of the ceremony, but I started the genome \nprogram in Congress. I am very thrilled to find that it has resulted in \nwhat we predicted in 1996 and 1997.\n  I want to tell the Senate a rather interesting story of how the \ngenome got into the National Institutes of Health and how today it is \nstill one-third in the Department of Energy.\n  A very good scientist who worked for the National Institutes of \nHealth named Dr. Charles DeLisi had been urging the National Institutes \nof Health to get started with a genome program. He had described its \ngreatness in terms of it being the most significant wellness program \nmankind had ever seen--wellness. They defied his request and would not \nproceed. He said: I quit.\n  He meandered over to the Department of Energy, which had done a lot \nof research on genetics because they were charged with discerning the \neffect of radiation from the two atomic bombs that had been dropped on \nJapan. He joined their department.\n  He came to see the Senator from New Mexico, who worked for the \nlaboratories hard and long, and said: Why don't we start a genome \nprogram in the Department of Energy since the National Institutes will \nnot do it?\n  I am trying to recap for my future by writing it, and I am putting it \ntogether.\n  But what actually happened was I proposed that the genome program \nstart, and that it start in the Department of Energy.\n  Guess what happened. The National Institutes of Health heard about \nit. All of their reluctance disappeared because somebody was about to \ngive the genome project to the Department of Energy. What an easy patsy \nthey became.\n  They came to the office. Then we went to see Lawton Chiles, the \nSenator from Florida, who appropriated the science part of this budget. \nThey said: Let's do it together--a little bit for DOE, and a whole lot \nfor NIH. I said: Whatever it takes, let's do it.\n  Within the next year--1997--we funded the first genome money without \na Presidential request. It had come forth, I think, in the Labor-Health \nand Human Services bill that will be before us today at somewhere \naround $20 million, maybe $29 million.\n  We funded it for another year. Finally, the President of the United \nStates funded it in his budget in the third year of its existence. Ever \nsince then, it has been funded in a President's budget and by us. It is \nup around $129 million or $130 million. I think it is something like \nthat. But they predicted that within 15 years they would map the entire \nchromosome structure of the human being. Today, they made an \nannouncement. I don't think they are really totally finished. But there \nis competition afield as to how to use it, and the private sector group \nis purportedly moving more rapidly.\n  The NIH and another group of scientists announced at the White House \nto the American people and the world we have essentially mapped the \nchromosome system of a human being. We now know the site, the location, \nthe map is there, for discerning what the genes contain with reference \nto human behavior and human illness.\n  I predict, as I did at least five times before committees of the \nSenate from the years 1987 to about 1994, where I appeared more often \nthan any other committee urging we fund the genome project, we are \nready today to say the map is there; let's get with it and start using \nit. We will have breakthroughs of enormous proportions with reference \nto humankind's illnesses.\n  I am neither scientific enough nor philosophical enough to know what \nelse it will bring. When we do something of this nature, we bring other \nquestions. There will be problems of abuse, of genetic mapping to \ndecipher people in a society prone to cancer and who therefore will not \nbe hired, unethical research using mutations in ways not good for \nhumankind.\n  Incidentally, we were aware of that problem from the beginning. \nSenator Mark Hatfield said: Let's set aside 5 percent--that is my \nrecollection--of the funding to use for education and ethical purposes \nto try to make sure we are on track. I have not followed that well \nenough. I am not exactly sure how that is going. We still have some \nlegislating to do in the area regarding uses in research, and \nlegislating with reference to an insurance company taking a whole group \nof people and saying: We are not insuring you because we know something \nabout your genetics.\n  Those are serious problems. They are bigger than the problem itself. \nThey could make America angry at this program. We don't want to do \nthat. We want the American people happy that we have put this into the \nhands of human beings, for wellness purposes. That is our desire, so \nthat people not get dread diseases, or we find out how to cure them \nwhen they get them. Genome mapping ought to be heralded as something we \ndid right. I don't know where it goes.\n  I close today by thanking Dr. Charles DeLisi for bringing this idea \nfrom the NIH to my office. Senator Lawton Chiles, now deceased, is the \none to whom NIH ran, saying, let's get something going. He and I worked \non these projects well together. We got it going in an appropriations \nbill. I thank him, and I thank many Senators who worked on this, \nprincipally in the committee, whose legislation is pending. That is the \nsubcommittee that did most of the work and helped it along, more than \nany other group in the Congress.\n  I am delighted to have a chance to speak today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I love to hear the story Senator \nDomenici tells about helping to make this human genome project a \nreality. He shared it with me some time ago. It is one of those success \nstories we can feel good about. It does provide opportunities for \nhealth improvement in America in an extraordinary way.\n  We heard recently remarks by the head of the National Cancer \nInstitute who described one form of leukemia that had been diagnosed, \nand that certain types of treatments cured 60 percent of the leukemias \nand 40 percent were not cured; they didn't know why. But after the \nhuman genome study, they found out there were actually two different \nkinds of leukemias, and the treatment served one and not another.\n  A lot of good breakthroughs are on the horizon, I am convinced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5776-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5776-S5778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will share a few remarks at this \ntime about the rise in gasoline prices that are impacting American \nfamilies. I recently pumped the gas at a gas station in Alabama. I \ntalked to a lot of people. I talked to a young lady who commuted 50 \nmiles plus, every day, to go to college. She talked to me about working \npart-time and going to college, how much the gasoline prices were \neating\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\ninto her weekly budget, and what she was trying to do to keep those \nprices down.\n  It does impact Americans. Gasoline increases hurt our Nation's \nproductivity. It is a transfer of wealth that could be spent on \ncomputers, education, better equipment, shoes, food, housing, that has \nto be spent on a substance for which we previously had paid less. That \nis a diminishment of our national wealth. It is important and should \nnot be treated lightly.\n  Over a year ago, we had gasoline in many States, depending on the \namount of tax those States imposed, selling at close to $1 a gallon.\n  Senator Hutchison noted most of our gasoline comes from foreign \nsources. In fact, the Energy Information Agency reports that we are \nbuying 56 percent of our oil on the world market.\n  Just last year, we were buying oil at $10 a barrel, transporting it \nacross the ocean, refining it, shipping it to gasoline stations and 7-\n11 type stores, for sale all over America. One could go down to a gas \nstation and buy that gasoline for around $1 a gallon, and 40 cents of \nthat dollar was taxes. So the gas was actually 60 cents a gallon.\n  People say the oil companies are all evil and horrible, but I think \nthose numbers are pretty good. Madam President, 24 hours a day at \nvirtually any town intersection in America, anyone could buy gasoline, \nif we take the tax off, for around 60 cents a gallon. That is a \nremarkable achievement. Go to the same gas station and buy a bottle of \nwater; you will probably pay $3 or more a gallon. The little bottles of \nwater cost 70, 80, 90 cents a bottle. Still there has been a remarkable \nincrease in gasoline prices over the last 12 months.\n  How did we go from $1 to $1.50, $1.60, $1.70, $1.80, and even $2 a \ngallon for gasoline? What happened? How did it happen? If we are going \nto set good policy, we ought to ask ourselves that question.\n  The main issue is that OPEC wanted more money. The oil-producing \ngroup, the cartel, so to speak--Middle East countries including Saudi \nArabia along with Venezuela, and others --that overwhelmingly supply \nthe oil to meet world demand, got together and decided they wanted more \nmoney. They made a political decision they were going to do certain \nthings, as Senator Domenici said, to drive up the price of gasoline. \nThe world economy was coming up, so Asia was using more gasoline, other \nnations were using more gasoline. So they simply quit producing as \nmuch. They reduced their production, and they didn't cheat on one \nanother. It actually worked. They created a worldwide shortage.\n  The price for a barrel of gasoline, at $11 a year or so ago, rose to \nover $30 a barrel. It hovers around $30 a barrel now and is more than \ndouble today what it was last year at this time. That has driven up the \ncost of gasoline.\n  First, we have to understand that. In addition, we are now in a \nsummer vacation time cycle. People take their trips. We use more \ngasoline in the summer than at any other time. That is another \ncomplication. Increased demand creates upward price pressure.\n  There have been problems with pipelines, and I don't dispute that. \nGasoline companies, pipeline companies, the distributors, and the \npeople who actually run the gasoline stations, set the prices as they \nchoose, some of those businesses are catching this rise and perhaps \ntrying to make a few extra cents. It does not surprise me that is the \ncase.\n  Fundamentally, we have a shortage of supply in this world. The OPEC \nnations have done that through political action. It is very serious for \nour economy. There will be a negative impact on our Nation.\n\n  How did that happen? When political activities occur, you can only \nrespond, basically, politically. It seems to me, this administration \nhas not been alert at all to the problems we are facing. The Clinton-\nGore administration has not understood energy policy. It has effected a \nseries of small steps, really no-growth extremist steps, that have \ndebilitated our own American oil and gas industry, leaving us more \nvulnerable to a determined OPEC cartel that demands higher prices. That \nis basically what happened to us.\n  How are we going to defeat that? It is going to really take political \naction to use our power against it. Frankly, there are some people in \nthis country--most people who are sophisticated know this--who believe \nwe ought to have higher gas prices. That is the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration's policy for America. They believe if gasoline prices go \nup, we will drive less, we will buy their kind of small cars, windmills \nwill become more popular, solar panels will be more popular, and that \nkind of thing will happen. They believe we ought to have higher energy \nprices.\n  I believe we ought to support alternative energy sources, but I do \nnot believe we ought to be taxing American people to encourage them to \nalter their lifestyles, taking money out of their pockets, making them \npay more money for gasoline for these agendas. I am concerned about \nthat.\n  With regard to how it is impacting America, I think it is a fairly \nsimple matter. What is really happening in this country is we are \npaying 20 cents, 30 cents, 40 cents more a gallon because of OPEC price \nincreases. That is, in effect, a tax on American consumers by OPEC. In \neffect, when you go to the gasoline station and you buy a gallon of \ngas, if it is 10 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents, 40 cents more because of \ntheir prices they are charging, we are paying them that much more. It \nis not an economic thing; it is done by their political monopoly cartel \npower because of our failure to produce energy domestically.\n  We need to do better to produce more energy in this country. I have \nto say we have a policy in our Nation, by this administration, that is \ncontrary to that idea. For example, if we are going to increase energy \nproduction in America, we need to promote production and exploration. \nOne of the ways we could do this is to open up areas of federal land \nwith proven oil reserves.\n  We have, in Alaska, an ANWR region with huge supplies of oil. In \nfact, that region of Alaska, is about the size of the State of North \nCarolina, and the size of the area where the oil would be produced is \nabout the size of Dulles airfield. It is a very small area, but within \nthat small area they can produce huge reserves of oil. This \nadministration has steadfastly, through vetoes, refused to allow oil \nproduction there even though a majority of this Senate has voted for \nit, as I recall. They do not dare because they think it might have some \nenvironmental impact.\n  Experience shows that today's oil and gas production technology has a \nminimal negative environmental impact and in ANWR it affects a tiny \narea. So they have taken that source of oil--oil which could help us \ncompete effectively in the world and stop the transfer of our wealth to \nSaudi Arabia and give us greater bargaining power--off the table.\n  There are huge reserves of natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico--huge \nreserves. Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning fuels we have. \nMuch of our electricity generation is being transferred from coal and \nother fuels to natural gas because it burns so much cleaner and it is \nrelatively inexpensive. Vice President Gore, in his speeches in New \nHampshire during the primary campaign, said that not only did he oppose \nany further drilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico, but he \nwanted to cut back on those leases already approved for drilling. I \nthink that is an extremist position. They drill for gas right within \nthe Mobile Bay, my home town. It is a clean substance, compared to oil. \nEven if it leaks, it evaporates rapidly. It doesn't have the sludge \nthat oil does.\n  To stop production of gas in the Gulf of Mexico is an extremist \nposition and one which will make us more vulnerable to Saudi Arabia and \nOPEC. It is not acceptable.\n  This administration refuses to allow production of oil in the Rocky \nMountain area where as much as 60 percent of the land is owned by the \nFederal Government. They virtually shut off drilling in those areas.\n  There has been growing interest in coalbed methane production, in \nwhich you can drill a well into coal seams and bring out methane gas, a \nvery clean burning gas. New technology has made the production of this \nclean fuel economically viable, but through environmental regulations \nwhich even the EPA does not support, this fledgling energy production \nsource is at risk.\n  Finally, this administration has steadfastly opposed the use of \nnuclear power, which Senator Domenici mentioned. They refuse to allow \nus to store waste nuclear fuel, spent uranium fuel\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\nrods, in a remote desert tunnel in Nevada, where we used to blow up \natom bombs on the surface. It ought to be done. By refusing to allow \nspent fuel to be safely stored, it compromises our ability to produce \nmore of our energy by nuclear power which produces absolutely zero air \npollution. It is a nonpolluting source of power.\n  France already generates 80 percent of their power by nuclear power. \nJapan is moving in that direction. We have to realize we need to do \nmore with nuclear power. In fact, in this country, over 20 percent of \nour power comes from nuclear. But we have not ordered and brought on-\nline a new plant in over 20 years.\n  Those are the actions which must be done be done. The policies this \nadministration support are wrong, the consequence of these policies are \nclear: shortage of energy and higher prices. That is what will occur. \nThat is what is occurring. I think we need strong leadership from this \nadministration to deal with this problem now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today Governor Schafer, from my State of \nNorth Dakota, has made a request of President Clinton in the form of a \ndisaster declaration request as a result of substantial damage that has \noccurred in North Dakota from some huge storms that have rumbled across \nour State in recent weeks. About a week ago, late in the afternoon, in \nthe Fargo-Moorhead region of North Dakota-Minnesota, huge thunderstorms \nrolled across the northern plains and dumped 7 to 8 inches of rain on \nthat flat land in the Red River Valley in a matter of 8 hours--7 to 8 \ninches of rain in 8 hours. This occurred only a week after some regions \njust 80 to 90 miles North of there received 17 to 18 inches of rain in \na very short period of time: 24 to 36 hours. There was an enormous \nquantity of rain.\n  These two storm events occurred in the Red River Valley, which is as \nflat as a table top. There is not a hill in sight. The result was \ndramatic sheet flooding in every direction. I recently took a tour of \nsome affected regions in northeastern North Dakota--Grand Forks County \nand Walsh County and other areas, and small communities like Langdon, \nMekinock, and a range of other communities. Communities in the region \nwere hit with more moisture than anyone had ever seen in their lifetime \nin such a short period of time.\n  As a result, flat fields were totally inundated with water. Roads and \nrailroad lines were washed away. There was one area I traversed in \nwhich they had a box culvert that weighed about 2 to 3 tons. The force \nof the water--which, incidentally, totally inundated these fields--\nwashed out a 2-ton box culvert, and nobody could find it. It was gone. \nHow does one lose a 2-ton box culvert? Yet it was gone.\n  It is hard to imagine these flooding events unless one sees them \npersonally. We have had two of them in two weeks in the eastern part of \nNorth Dakota, and they have been devastating. As a result, the Governor \nhas made a disaster declaration request of the President, a request \nwhich I fully support and upon which I hope the President will act with \ndispatch this week. FEMA is continuing in both of these areas--\nnortheastern North Dakota and also the Fargo region--to do their damage \nassessments. Sufficient work has been done on the damage assessments \nfor us to know we are going to require some Federal assistance.\n  Some people say: Why is there Federal help available in the form of \ndisaster assistance? Precisely because there are some events which \noccur--floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, and so on--that are so \nlarge and so significant and cause so much damage that State and local \ngovernments cannot possibly deal with the resulting damage.\n  That is why the rest of the country says: You have had some trouble, \nlet us give you a helping hand. That is what happened during the 1997 \nfloods from the Red River in the Red River Valley which most everyone \nwill remember. That is what happened with the Los Angeles earthquake. \nThat is what happened when the Southern United States experienced \nsubstantial tornado and hurricane damage.\n  We regret we have to come again with a request for disaster \nassistance, but we do. It is not of our making. It is an act of nature \nthat is quite unusual. I have not, in all of my life, seen a \ncircumstance where, in a period of 24 to 36 hours, we had 17 to 18 \ninches of rainfall in a very small area. We are a semiarid State. We \nget 17 inches of rain in a year in North Dakota on average. Yet a week \nago today, Fargo and Moorhead received 7 to 8 inches of rain in a \nmatter of 8 hours and, as I said, 90 miles north of there, they \nreceived 17 to 18 inches in some parts in a matter of 24 to 36 hours. \nOne can imagine the devastation that causes.\n  We are trying to wrap up a supplemental appropriations bill probably \nby tomorrow evening. The hope is that it gets filed tomorrow evening. \nBoth sides want to get it to the President for his signature by the end \nof this week. It will be attached to the military construction bill.\n  I am working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to \nmake certain these flood events are mentioned in the context of that \nsupplemental bill. I expect FEMA already has the resources with which \nto deal with this, if and when the President declares a disaster.\n  I wanted to bring to my colleagues' attention the request the \nGovernor of North Dakota has made. My expectation is the President will \nmove quickly to respond to it, and my concern is that we do everything \nwe can not only to deal with the issue of infrastructure damage to \npublic buildings, and there is substantial damage in those areas--\nroads, buildings, water and sewage systems--but also that we are able \nto be helpful to family farmers, many of whom have lost virtually all \nof their crops, crops they dutifully planted this spring with such \ngreat hope and now have been completely decimated by these sheet \nfloods.\n  My colleagues and I who come from this region of the country will \ncontinue to work on all of these issues. We are joined by our \ncolleagues from the State of Minnesota because all this occurs on the \nNorth Dakota-Minnesota border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5778-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5778-S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk about the issue of energy \nsupplies and the debate over energy. I noticed today a number of \nSenators came to the floor of the Senate, and they waved their arms and \nraised their voices a bit and railed about energy: Lord, we should know \nwhat is going on here, they say. We have the OPEC cartel, yes, but we \nalso have an administration that does not have an energy policy, and \nwoe is us.\n\n  This is not brain surgery. This is not complicated at all. We have a \ncartel called OPEC that controls a substantial amount of the oil that \nis exported to this country, and they decided to decrease production. \nWhen they did, prices began to go up.\n  More than that, we also have the largest oil companies in this \ncountry and around the world merging. Exxon, Amoco, BP, are all \nmerging. We have larger oil companies and a circumstance of a cartel \nsupplier, and now people who go to the gas pumps are paying higher and \nhigher energy prices.\n  I do not hear any discussion about whether the energy companies may \nhave played a role in this. Does anybody understand how, when you get \nlarger, you also have the opportunity to manipulate prices? I think you \ndo.\n  Is a major part of this problem the OPEC cartel? You bet your life it \nis. But I think another part of this problem is we do not understand \npricing policies of energy companies that have become larger and \nlarger. We need to know that. That is why I fully support the Federal \nTrade Commission's investigation, and why I believe the Justice \nDepartment ought to be part of the same investigation.\n  I find it interesting, as the oil companies become larger and \ncontinue to oppose ethanol production, Congress has still not done \nnearly enough to promote the kind of energy supplies that are \nrenewable--wind energy and others. We ought to get, in my judgment, a \nwake-up call from these oil prices that we are held hostage by the OPEC \ncartel. We are a growing economy and\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nproduce and use a substantial amount of energy, but we are far too \ndependent on OPEC countries.\n  If one looks at production of energy, it does not matter who is in \nthe White House--a Republican or Democratic administration--we see that \nsame line, and the line is not going up, it is marginally going down. \nWe need an energy policy that is a Republican and Democratic energy \npolicy, not one about which one side continues to wave and rail about \nthe other side. We need a bipartisan energy strategy that recognizes \nthis country should not be beholden to an OPEC cartel for its energy \nsupplies. Not to do so means we put ourselves at risk, we put our \neconomies at risk, and put the American people at risk when, in some \ncases, they cannot purchase the energy they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5779-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT IN MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk about the subject that is \ngoing to be front and center in the Congress this week, the issue of a \nprescription drug benefit and Medicare. There are stories in today's \npapers--the Washington Post, the New York Times, and others--in which \nthe chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee is \nquoted as saying that there is a belief that his party, meaning \nCongressional Republicans, need to do something on the issue of \nprescription drugs. He says, ``It's a great issue--no question it polls \nwell.''\n  Another member from the other side of the aisle said: ``We're going \nto use the marketplace pressure to solve the problem, which is much \nbetter than the government program.''\n  In other words, the majority party feels they have to bring a bill to \nthe floor addressing the need for prescription drug coverage because \nthe issue polls well. So they are going to bring an illusory bill to \nthe floor of the House this week that requires private insurance \ncompanies to offer an insurance policy that helps people pay for their \nprescription drugs. The catch is that the insurance companies say they \ncannot offer such a policy. Officials from two companies have come to \nmy office and told me that, to offer a policy with $1,000 in benefits, \nit would cost $1,200.\n  I come from a rural State. In rural States, a recent study shows that \nrural Medicare beneficiaries pay 25 percent more out-of-their own \npockets for prescription drugs than do urban beneficiaries. Of course, \nrural areas are shrinking. Many have seen the movie ``Four Weddings and \na Funeral.'' In rural areas of my State, ministers tell me they have \nfour funerals for every wedding because the population is getting older \nand the younger people are moving out.\n  And those senior citizens living in rural areas are the ones who are \npaying the highest prices for prescription drugs.\n  And many of them cannot afford the drugs they need. They have heart \ntrouble, diabetes, and a range of other problems. Their doctors say: \nYou need to take this miracle medicine, this life-saving drug, to help \nyou live a better life. And they say to their doctors: I can't afford \nit.\n  We need to do two things. First, we need to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare program, and second, we need to put downward \npressure on drug prices.\n  I thought I might, with my colleagues' consent, show on the floor of \nthe Senate a couple of pill bottles that illustrate part of the \nproblem. Here are two bottles for a prescription drug called Zocor used \nto lower cholesterol. This is the same tablet, in the same strength, \nmade by the same company, probably made in the same manufacturing \nplant. If you buy Zocor in Canada, it costs $1.82 per pill. But if you \nbuy the same drug--the same pill, made by the same company--in the \nUnited States, it costs $3.82 per pill.\n  Let me say that again. If you are a Canadian, you pay $1.82 for \nZocor; if you are an American, you pay $3.82, more than twice as much. \nWhy? Because the big drug manufacturers have decided they want to \ncharge the American consumer more than twice as much.\n  One other example, if I might. Here are bottles of Zoloft. Zoloft is \na common prescription drug used to fight depression. If you buy this \nmedication in Canada--the same pill, in the same strength, by the same \ndrug company--it costs $1.28 per pill. But if you buy it in North \nDakota, it costs $2.34 per pill. The Canadian pays $1.28; the American \npays $2.34, 83 percent more.\n  I have other examples, but I think you get the point: American \nconsumers pay the highest prices in the world for their prescription \ndrugs. These are the prices that our current marketplace have achieved. \nWhy should an American citizen have to go to Canada to buy a drug that \nwas produced in the United States in order to pay half the price that \nis charged in the United States? The answer is that they should not \nhave to do that.\n  I think these examples illustrate why, when those on the other side \nof the aisle say ``we're going to use the marketplace pressure to solve \nthe problem,'' this marketplace approach just is not going to work. We \nneed a real prescription drug benefit added to the Medicare program. \nWhat we do not need is an illusion of a benefit where we tell private \ninsurance companies to sell a policy they say they can't underwrite and \nwon't sell.\n  That is not good public policy. Maybe the polls show that Medicare \nprescription drug coverage is a popular issue, but you do not solve a \nproblem, no matter how popular an issue, by coming up with a solution \nthat does not work.\n  We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program in \na way that is sensible and thoughtful and workable. And, second, as we \ndo that, we need to put some downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices.\n  It is not fair, right, or reasonable that the American consumer ought \nto pay double the price for the same drug, put in the same bottle, \nmanufactured by the same company. That is not fair. The common \nmedications that senior citizens so often need--to treat their heart \nproblems, diabetes, arthritis, and so many other difficulties--have \nbeen increasing in cost at a dramatic rate.\n  I am not talking about creating price controls, but we need to do \nsomething to put some downward pressure on prices. One thing we should \ndo is pass legislation that I have introduced, along with Senator \nSnowe, Senator Wellstone and others, that will allow American consumers \nto have access to these drugs from anywhere in the world, as long as \nthey are FDA-approved with safe manufacturing standards. This \nlegislation, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, will allow \nAmericans to access these drugs from anywhere in the world at a lower \nprice.\n  If we eliminate the legal obstacles that currently exist and allow \npharmacists to purchase these medications from other countries on \nbehalf of their American customers, the pharmaceutical industry will be \nforced to re-price their drugs in this country.\n  In short, I wanted to come to the floor to make the point that we \nmust put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program, but we \nmust do it in a way that works. We should not do this just so some will \nbe able to go home to their states and say: We passed prescription drug \ncoverage, didn't we? That might provide some self-satisfaction but it \ndoes nothing for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who need \nprescription drug coverage. And finally, as we develop this \nlegislation, we need to acknowledge that drug pricing is unfair in this \ncountry and do something to put some downward pressure on prescription \ndrug prices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5779-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5779-S5780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.N. CHARTER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, fifty-five years ago, the members of the \nUnited Nation's founding delegation met in San Francisco for the \nsigning ceremony that created the U.N. There was great anticipation and \na collective enthusiasm for this new, global institution. Delegates \nspoke of hope, of expectation, of the promise of peace. President \nTruman echoed the thoughts of those founding members when he told the \ndelegates they had, ``created a great instrument for peace and security \nand human progress in the world.'' Fifty-five years later, the United \nNations is struggling to meet its potential.\n  As Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee which has \nU.N. oversight responsibilities and having been appointed by the \nPresident to\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nserve two terms as a Congressional Delegate to the U.N., I have focused \nsignificant attention on the United Nations. On the anniversary of the \nsigning of the U.N. Charter, I think it is appropriate to take time for \nus all to reflect on that important institution.\n  The U.N. is making headway in implementing reforms, and I believe \nthat is due in a large part to the efforts of the U.S. Congress. \nAccording to GAO, the U.N. has made substantial progress in \nrestructuring its leadership and operations. It has also created a \nperformance-oriented human capital system. Unfortunately, however, \nthere is no system in place within the U.N. to monitor and evaluate \nprogram results and impact. In other words, the U.N. undertakes \nnumerous activities on social, economic, and political affairs, but the \nSecretariat cannot reliably assess whether these activities have made a \ndifference in people's lives and whether they have improved situations \nin a measurable way. I look forward to working with the U.N. to make \nsure in the future it will not just believe it is contributing to \npositive change, it will know it is doing so. As Secretary-General \nAnnan noted, ``a reformed United Nations will be a more relevant United \nNations in the eyes of the world.''\n  In the area of peacekeeping, the U.N. is clearly in crisis because \nmany countries, including the U.S., keep calling on the U.N. to take on \nmissions it is not capable of fulfilling. The U.N. can play a useful \nrole in building coalitions to address matters of international \nsecurity, as we saw in the Persian Gulf War. Moreover, the U.N. has the \nability to effectively conduct traditional peacekeeping operations, \nsuch as those in Cyprus and the Sinai Peninsula. Unlike NATO and other \nregional military forces, however, the U.N. is only successful when it \ntakes on limited missions where a political settlement has already been \nreached, hostilities have ceased, and all parties agree to the U.N. \npeacekeeping role. The U.S. must be careful not to set up the U.N. for \nfailure. We risk ruining the U.N.'s credibility if we insist on a more \nrobust peace making role for U.N. forces. In Sierra Leone, a feel-good \nU.N. operation with no impact on keeping civilians safe and with \n``peacekeepers'' held as hostages sounds a lot like a replay of U.N. \nforces in Bosnia. I had hoped the U.N. learned its lessons since that \nterrible time.\n  As we celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter, \nwe should celebrate the success of the U.N. without turning a blind eye \nto its failings. We should recommit ourselves to making sure the U.N. \ncontinues to reform. We should make sure our nation doesn't push the \nU.N. to do more than it can do effectively. If we do nothing, and in \nfifty-five more years the United Nations collapses under its own \nweight, then we will have only ourselves to blame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5780-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, yesterday was the 50th anniversary \nof the beginning of the Korean War, an often overlooked, yet very \nimportant event in history. ``Forgotten'' is a term used too often \nabout the Korean War; for veterans and their families, the war is very \nreal, and something they can never forget.\n  Officially, the war was the first military effort of the United \nNations, but American involvement was dominant throughout the conflict. \nThousands of Americans traveled to a distant land to help defend the \nrights of strangers threatened by hostile invasion. Unfortunately, many \nwho fought bravely to aid the Koreans lost their lives while waging the \nwar.\n  Today, I want to pay homage to all who served in this war. The troops \nfrom the United States and the 20 other United Nations countries who \nprovided aid to the South Koreans deserve our great acclaim every day, \nbut even more so on this special anniversary. These great countries \nunited to preserve the rights of South Korea, a small democracy \nthreatened by the overwhelming power of the Communist government. South \nKorea did not have sufficient military resources to protect its \ninterests. Fortunately, the United Nations member countries were not \nabout to sit back and watch North Korea, with the aid of China and the \nSoviet Union, annihilate the democracy in the south.\n  On June 25, 1950, troops from Communist-ruled North Korea invaded \nSouth Korea, meeting little resistance to their attack. A few days \nlater, on the morning of July 5th--still Independence Day in the United \nStates--Private Kenny Shadrick of Skin Fork, West Virginia, became the \nwar's first American casualty. Kenny was the first, but many more West \nVirginians were destined to die in the conflict--in fact, more West \nVirginians were killed in combat during the three years of the Korean \nWar than during the 10 years that we fought in Vietnam. In one of the \nbloodiest wars in history, 36,940 more Americans would lose their lives \nbefore it was all over. In addition, more than 8,000 Americans are \nstill missing in action and unaccounted for.\n  Five years ago, we dedicated the Korean War Memorial on the Mall in \nWashington, DC. This stirring tribute to the veterans of this war \npoignantly symbolizes the hardships of the conflict.\n  The Memorial depicts, with stainless steel statues, a squad of 19 \nsoldiers on patrol. The ground on which they advance is reminiscent of \nthe rugged Korean terrain that they encountered, and their wind-blown \nponchos depict the treacherous weather that ensued throughout the war. \nOur soldiers landed in South Korea poorly equipped to face the icy \ntemperatures of 30 degrees below zero, their weaponry outdated and \ninadequate. As a result of the extreme cold, many veterans still suffer \ntoday from cold-related injuries, including frostbite, cold \nsensitization, numbness, tingling and burning, circulatory problems, \nskin cancer, fungal infections, and arthritis. Furthermore, the \npsychological tolls of war have caused great hardship for many \nveterans.\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\n  As a background to the soldiers' statues at the Memorial, the images \nof 2,400 unnamed men and women stand etched into a granite wall, \nsymbolizing the determination of the United States workforce and the \nmillions of family members and friends who supported the efforts of \nthose at war. Looking at the steadfast, resolute faces of these \nindividuals invokes in the viewer a deep admiration and appreciation \nfor their importance to the war effort.\n  Author James Brady, a veteran of the Korean War, spoke for all those \nwho served in the war when he wrote, ``We were all proudly putting our \nlives on the line for our country. But I would later come to realize \nthat the Korean War was like the middle child in a family, falling \nbetween World War II and Vietnam. It became an overlooked war.'' Mr. \nBrady conveys the sentiments of many of the veterans who served in this \nwar and underscores our need to give these veterans the recognition \nthey are long overdue.\n  Today, I salute the courage of those who stood up for democracy while \nfighting for the freedom of strangers. Through their unselfish display \nof determination and valor in the battles they endured, they sent an \nimportant message to future generations. I thank our Korean War \nveterans; their bravery reminds us of the value we put on freedom, \nwhile their sacrifices remind us that, as it says at the Korean War \nMemorial, ``Freedom is not free.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5781-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, here in Washington, DC, administrations \ncome and go, Members of Congress and their staff pass through at an \nincreasing pace. It often seems that many of the people that we know \nare on their way to someplace else.\n  With all this change, we cherish the points of stability in our \nlives, and among these are the professional staff members who have been \nwith us for the long haul. These are the people who could have gone \nelsewhere and earned more money, but they chose to stay and work in \npublic service. They are the silent heroes here in Congress. They keep \nthe process moving; their invisible stamp is upon all our work in \npublic policy. We depend upon them more than we like to say.\n  Lucy Calautti is one of those key staff members who makes things \nhappen here in the United States Senate.\n  Lucy has worked with me for over 25 years, first in my role as an \nelected State official in our State Capitol in North Dakota, then in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and now the U.S. Senate. During much \nof that time she has been my Chief of Staff.\n  Lucy goes about her work with an energy, focus, and high-spirited \ncompetence that people who deal with her have come to know well. For \nme, Lucy has been a treasure. I have had the great luxury of knowing \nthat when I leave the office to travel to North Dakota, the work here \nwill continue to be directed by a real leader.\n  Lucy is a true original. She is practical and idealistic, a patriot \nand an ardent advocate of women's rights. When she graduated from high \nschool in Queens, New York in the 1960s, she went right into the Navy \nto serve her country. That was not exactly the most popular thing to do \nback then. When she left the service she came to North Dakota and \nenrolled in North Dakota State University to get her Masters degree.\n  I hired Lucy in 1974, and during all of those years she has brought \npassion and conviction to her work. No problem has been too small or \ntoo big. If it concerned the people of North Dakota and our country, \nthen Lucy would tackle it until it got resolved.\n  One of Lucy's passions has been Major League Baseball. For years she \nand her husband, Kent, have taken a weekend or two in February to catch \na part of Spring training in Florida. It's true she has suffered over \nthe years as an ardent New York Mets fan. But for years I have watched \nthe autographed baseballs on her desk form a rising pyramid in their \nplastic cases. I had a sense where this stack was heading.\n  And now, not surprisingly, Lucy is going to leave my office this week \nto become the head of Government Relations for Major League Baseball. I \nam sad, but I am happy, too. America's national pastime is gaining a \ntireless advocate here in Washington. No one deserves this opportunity \nmore than Lucy, and no one could do a better job.\n  Such passages are common here in Washington, but that does not make \nthem any easier. I just wanted to take a few moments to express my \nappreciation to Lucy Calautti, on behalf of all the people of my state, \nfor a job well done. We wish her well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5781-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3625\n\n  (Purpose: To implement pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance \n                       monitoring and prevention)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3625.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, before the colon on line 4, insert the \n     following: ``, and of which $25,000,000 shall be made \n     available through such Centers for the establishment of \n     partnerships between the Federal Government and academic \n     institutions and State and local public health departments to \n     carry out pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance \n     detection, surveillance, education and prevention and to \n     conduct research on resistance mechanisms and new or more \n     effective antimicrobial compounds.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment to H.R. 4577, \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill \nto implement pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance monitoring and \nprevention.\n  Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide problem. Emerging, \ndrug-resistant infections threaten the health and stability of \ncountries across the world. Diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis \nhave become resistant to treatment in many countries, and we are \nbeginning to see these drug-resistant infections reemerging in the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n  Here in the U.S., resistance is developing in both large, urban areas \nand rural communities. We are seeing widespread resistance develop to \ncommon drugs such as Penicillin. Some microbes are even becoming \nresistant to our last line of therapy, Vancomycin. We are approaching \nthe point where such common ailments as a sore throat or an ear \ninfection could become life threatening. The problem is not limited to \na certain line of microbes. We are seeing the development of resistance \nin all major groups of microorganisms--viruses, fungi, parasites, and \nbacteria.\n  We must address this problem on several levels. We must build our \npublic health infrastructure for both surveillance of and response to \nresistance and outbreaks. We need to educate practitioners and patients \nin the responsible use of antimicrobials, and we need to continue to \ninvest in research on the mechanisms of resistance and the development \nof new treatment.\n  This amendment begins to address the global threat posed by \nantimicrobial resistant infections. We must aggressively act over the \ncourse of the next several years to avert the situation of a half \ncentury ago when infectious diseases were the greatest threat to human \nhealth.\n  Specifically, this amendment provides $25 million to be available \nthrough such centers as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nfor the establishment of partnerships between the Federal Government \nand academic institutions and State and local public health departments \nto carry out pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance detection, \nsurveillance, education, and prevention, and to conduct research on \nresistance mechanisms and new or more effective antimicrobial \ncompounds.\n  For the information of the Senate, authorizing legislation is being \nintroduced and referred to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. The purpose of the new legislation, which is being sponsored \nhere in the Senate by the Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, will provide a framework of \nlegislative authorization for activities and appropriations of dollars \nsuch as that reflected by this appropriations bill amendment. I also am \npleased to have the cosponsorship on this specific amendment of Senator \nKennedy and Senator Frist, as well.\n  I am hopeful the majority leader will be able to permit us to \nannounce that a vote will occur on this amendment as the next order of \nbusiness for the Senate. It will not likely occur today but probably \ntomorrow at sometime to be announced by the leader. I hope we will be \nable to make that announcement for the information of all Senators very \nsoon.\n  The funding that is provided as an addition to that included in the \nbill for microbial research into resistance to diseases, viruses, and \nillnesses is a matter that is emerging as one of the most serious \nchallenges we face in medical science today. I am hopeful the Senate \nwill approve this amendment and increase the funding for this important \narea of inquiry.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness to discuss two related pieces of legislation for the \nDepartment of Education that I will introduce today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran pertaining to the introduction of S. 2788 \nand S. 2789 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will find out what is going on, and I may withdraw my \nobjection. So I will reserve the right to object at this point, and I \nwill ask the distinguished Senator a question or two.\n  There is a consent request that I am told was being circulated on \nboth sides of the aisle to have a vote on the pending amendment that I \nhave offered at a time certain. In fact, it would occur at 9:40 a.m. \ntomorrow and would provide for some remarks to be made before the vote. \nI would like to know whether or not we can expect to get consent to \nthat proposed agreement before permitting the amendment to be set aside \nand proceeding to another amendment and possibly never getting back to \nthe pending amendment. That is the purpose for my concern.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have the proposed unanimous consent \nagreement here and we are giving it every consideration. I thought it \nwould be more appropriate, in that we are trying to move the bill \nalong, to try to get some amendments offered and get them out of the \nway. We have dozens of amendments on this bill of which we need to try \nto dispose. We in the minority certainly have no problem with having a \nvote in the morning. It is just that we have some people to check with \nbefore we agree to the unanimous consent request. We would be happy to \nschedule votes on my amendments. We are not trying to avoid votes. We \nare happy to get votes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Why don't we get consent on the agreement----\n  Mr. REID. Because I don't have authority to offer my approval of the \nagreement at this time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I don't have the authority to set aside my amendment and \nproceed to other matters until we get consent. So we have a problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I also want to make sure everyone \nunderstands that we are trying to offer amendments to move the bill \nalong. We don't want people to be complaining that people are trying to \nslow up movement of this bill. There is no problem at all with having \nthe vote sometime tomorrow. As you know, there are scores of amendments \nthat are going to be offered. We need to have a number of votes. What \nabout if we had that vote at noon tomorrow rather than 9:40? Would the \nSenator agree to that?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I don't have any indication from our \nleadership as to what alternatives would be available to substitute for \nthe consent being circulated.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will check, that would be good.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We will find out an answer and get back to you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I just saw the unanimous-\nconsent request, I might say, and there is a part in there--I don't \nmind the time, but there is a clause that says ``with no second-degree \namendments in order.'' I am checking to find out whether or not that is \ngoing to be standard fare for the remainder of this bill. I support the \nSenator's amendment, but if we have a unanimous consent where some \ndon't get an opportunity to offer second degrees and others do--we \nought to play under the same rules is what I am saying. I ask the \nminority whip whether or not we are going to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that certainly is a question. That is one \nof the reasons we were holding off agreeing to this. I say to my friend \nfrom Mississippi, it appears we can agree to his amendment. It appears \nwhat is happening here is the majority wants a vote sometime tomorrow \nmorning. If we agree to the Senator's amendment, how about having a \nvote on one of my amendments in the morning?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, he is negotiating with the \nwrong guy. He is down the hall. I will show you the direction how to \nget there. I am the author of this amendment and that is about as high \nas I get in this discussion. I appreciate Senator Reid's support for \nthe amendment, and also Senator Harkin's support. If it were up to the \nthree of us, we could probably get this worked out.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe we can have our very competent staff walk down the \nhall and discuss that. In the meantime, I will speak about my \namendment, and if it is appropriate at a subsequent time to offer it, I \nwill do so.\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\n  I also extend my appreciation to the Senator from Mississippi, who is \nalways so cordial and easy to work with. I recognize that we all have \nthings to do, sometimes over which we have no control. It happens to me \nall the time.\n  I have spent a lot of time in hospitals in the last 10 or so years \nbecause of the illness of my wife. She is doing very fine now, but she \nhas spent a lot of time in the hospital. Last August, she spent 18 days \nin the hospital. Prior to that, she spent a month in the hospital.\n  During her hospitalizations, the one thing I recognized more than \nanything else was the extremely important work of nurses. I understand \nhow we depend on the doctors and that they are lifesavers, to say the \nleast. But the personnel who are underappreciated and undercompensated \nare nurses. They work so hard and do so much for so little. We need to \ndo more to protect nurses, and the amendments that I am going to offer, \nwhen I have that opportunity, relate to nurses.\n  First of all, I am going to offer an amendment that is going to \nrecognize how dangerous nurses' work is. Nurses spend every day of \ntheir lives afraid that they are going to be stuck by mistake with a \nneedle.\n  One of my amendments would allow the Secretary of Labor to amend \nOSHA's blood-borne pathogen standard to require that employers use \nneedle-less or safe needles and to require that employers create a \nsharp injury log to keep detailed information about on-the-job needle-\nstick injuries.\n  My second amendment would establish a new clearinghouse within the \nNational Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health to collect data \non engineered safety technology designed to prevent the risk of needle \nsticks. I have worked with the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, for \na number of years on this problem. This amendment would relate directly \nto that problem.\n  Keep in mind that needle sticks occur routinely. About 600,000 needle \nsticks occur in America every year--not 60,000, not 600--600,000. Every \n39 seconds, a nurse in America is accidentally stuck with a needle. \nThis is a tremendously difficult problem. We could give example after \nexample. I know we don't want to do that. But I am going to give a \ncouple of examples.\n  In October 1997, a woman from Reno, NV, by the name of Lisa Black, a \nregistered nurse, was nursing a man who had a terminal case of AIDS \nwhen a needle that had been used on him accidentally stuck her. Today, \nshe is a very sick woman. She is infected not only with HIV, but she \nalso has hepatitis C. Lisa Black, who was a totally healthy person \nprior to that day in October 1997 when she was accidentally stuck in \nthe hand with a needle, now takes 22 pills a day to keep her HIV \ninfection from progressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects \nof hepatitis C.\n  Karen Daley is a nurse from Massachusetts. In fact, she is presently \nin a nurses association in Massachusetts. She had been a nurse for more \nthan 20 years when she sustained a needle-stick injury when she reached \nher gloved hand into a needle box to dispose of the needle from which \nshe had drawn blood. She was stuck with another needle.\n  Just last week, in testimony before the House Subcommittee on \nWorkforce Protection, Karen Daley described how the needle-stick injury \ncaused her to contract both hepatitis C and HIV, which changed her \nlife. I quote from part of her testimony.\n\n       In the first year of my treatment I took a daily regimen \n     that consisted of 21 pills a day and an injection that caused \n     a wide range of side effects, among them: weight loss, \n     nausea, loss of appetite, hair loss, headaches, skin rashes, \n     severe fatigue and bone marrow depression. To say these side \n     effects interfered with my normal day-to-day routine is a \n     gross understatement. The single moment when my injury \n     occurred 18 months ago has changed many other things for me. \n     In addition to the emotional turmoil it has created for \n     myself, my family, my friends, my colleagues--it has cost me \n     much more than I can ever describe in words. As a result of \n     my injury, I have given up direct nursing practice, work that \n     I love.\n\n  Karen Daley did everything in her power and took all the necessary \nprecautions--including wearing gloves and following proper procedures--\nto reduce risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Her injury did not \noccur because she was careless or distracted or not paying attention to \nwhat she was doing.\n  These needlesticks just occur. Karen Daley has good reason to believe \nthat had a safer needle and disposal system been in place at her \nhospital, she would not be sick today. According to the CDC, eighty \npercent of all needlestick injuries can be prevented through the use of \nsafer needles.\n  Senator Boxer and I have introduced legislation that would \ndramatically reduce the risk of needlestick injuries by requiring \nhospitals and health-care facilities to use safe needles and keep \nbetter track of needlestick injuries.\n  When I offered this bill as an amendment last year, many of my \ncolleagues, including the chairman of the HELP Committee, assured me \nthat they were concerned about this problem and were committed to \nworking on it.\n  Another year has passed, and still, nothing has been accomplished.\n  In the year since I offered this amendment,there have been \napproximately 600,000 accidental needle wounds--that is one injury \nevery 39 seconds.\n  If we don't do something this coming year, there will be 600,000 more \nneedle sticks, and a number of them will wind up as did Karen Daley and \nLisa Black--infected with HIV, hepatitis C, and other debilitating \ndiseases.\n  The actual number of needlestick injuries is probably much higher, \nbecause these injuries are considered to be widely under-reported. \nSeveral studies show needlestick under-reporting rates of between 40 \nand 90 percent.\n  We could have over 1 million needle sticks every year instead of \nevery 39 seconds and every 15 seconds. Some people do not report their \ninjuries.\n  The longer we wait, the more people--nurses, housekeeping staff, and \nanyone who handles blood, blood products, and biological samples--will \nbe at risk of contracting a number of debilitating, if not deadly, \ndiseases.\n  There are more than a score of diseases we know of to which nurses \nand other related personnel are subject to being infected. I mentioned \nHIV. Hepatitis B and C and malaria may be transferred from just a speck \nof blood--a very small amount of blood.\n  Despite the fact that safer devices have been available since the \n1970s and that we know that more than 80 percent of needlestick \ninjuries can be prevented through their use, fewer than 15 percent of \nU.S. hospitals have switched over to these safer devices, except in \nstates that have enacted laws requiring them.\n  My amendments would ensure that the necessary tools--better \ninformation and better medical devices--are made available to front-\nline health care workers in order to reduce the injuries and deaths \nthat result from needle sticks.\n  My amendment would establish a new clearinghouse within NIOSH to \ncollect data on engineering safety technology designed to help prevent \nthe risk of needle sticks, would allow the Secretary of Labor to amend \nOSHA's blood-borne pathogen standard to require employers to use \nneedle-less or safe needles, and would require that employers create a \nsharp injury log to keep data on on-the-job needle-stick injuries.\n  The companion measure Senator Boxer and I sponsored in the House \nreceived overwhelming support. To date, it has 181 cosponsors. In the \nSenate, we also have support for our legislation, in addition to \nSenator Boxer and the Senator offering the amendment at this time.\n  Protecting the health and safety of our front-line health care \nworkers should not be a partisan issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to have the amendments agreed to \nso that injuries and deaths from needle-stick injuries can be avoided.\n  Again, having spent time in hospitals and seeing how hard the nurses \nwork, I had not realized that in America every 15 to 30 seconds women \nor men working as nurses stab themselves accidentally and subject \nthemselves to these terrible diseases.\n  I ask the Senator from Mississippi if we have any word from down the \nhall yet.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I am advised \nthat we have not received any word from down the hall yet. I am not in \na position to consent to the request at this time.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, who was not on the floor at the time, \nthat\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nI want him to understand we are doing the best we can, along with the \nmajority, about this bill. Remember that I had two amendments to offer, \nbut we weren't able to offer them because of a procedural problem.\n  I hope we can move this bill along quicker. There are lots of \namendments.\n  I think the Senator has already talked to the Appropriations \nCommittee, and we would agree to getting a list of who wants to offer \namendments so we have a finite number. We are doing what we can.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond by saying to my whip that we are trying to get \na finite list of amendments together so we know how many we have. \nHopefully, we can dispose of those in the next couple of days.\n  We are definitely open for business. I want to start moving \namendments. Hopefully, we will get an agreement shortly to offer \namendments to be lined up to vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. My friend has done such a tremendous job of comanaging this \nvery difficult piece of legislation. We agree to accept the amendment \nof the Senator from Mississippi and vote on my amendment.\n  Madam President, Senator Boxer is to be listed as cosponsoring this \nbill. As I have stated, she has been stalwart in working with this. She \nis the main sponsor of the underlying amendment, the bill last year. We \nare both working on this amendment. She should be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5784-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nspeak about S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of \n1999. I urge the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, to act \nquickly to bring this bill to the floor. We have no excuse for delay in \nproviding life-saving treatment to women who have been diagnosed with \nbreast and cervical cancer.\n  As many of you in this body know, this is an issue I take very \nseriously. My only two sisters both had breast cancer and died from the \ndisease. Sadly, they contracted breast cancer at a time when regular \nmammograms and improved treatment methods were not widely used or \navailable.\n  Over the past several years, we have made a great deal of progress \nagainst breast cancer, but there is still a long way to go. In \nparticular, we've been able to secure significant increases in funding \nof research to understand the causes and find treatments for breast \ncancer.\n  Look how far we have come. Almost a decade ago, when I looked into \nthe issue of breast cancer research, I discovered that barely $90 \nmillion was spent on breast cancer research.\n  That is why in 1992, I offered an amendment to dedicate $210 million \nin the Defense Department budget for breast cancer research. This \nfunding was in addition to the funding for breast cancer research \nconducted at the National Institutes of Health. My amendment passed \nand--overnight--it doubled federal funding for breast cancer research.\n  Since then, funding for breast cancer research has been included in \nthe Defense Department budget every year.\n  Today, I am proud to say, between the DoD and NIH, over $600 million \nis being spent on finding a cure for this disease.\n  Scientific researchers are making exciting discoveries about the \ncauses of breast cancer and its prevention, detection, diagnosis, \ntreatment, and control. These insights are leading to real progress in \nour war against this devastating disease. We know better than ever \nbefore how a healthy cell can become cancerous, how breast cancer \nspreads, why some tumors are more aggressive than others, and why some \nwomen suffer more severely and are more likely to die of the disease.\n  For example, discovery of the BRCA1 gene has led us to better \nidentify women who are at risk of breast cancer, so the disease can be \ncaught early and treated. And of course the development of cancer-\nfighting drugs like tamoxifen owes a great deal to our federal research \ninvestment.\n  But our success in building our research enterprise will be pointless \nif breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and cures are not available \nto the public.\n  That is why, a decade ago, as chairman of the Senate Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked \nto create a program, run by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, to provide breast and cervical cancer screening for low-\nincome, uninsured women.\n  This program is run nationwide and is tremendously successful. In \nIowa, almost 9,000 women have been screened.\n  Nationally, more than one million low-income American women have been \nscreened. Of these, more than 6,000 were diagnosed with breast cancer \nand 500 with cervical cancer.\n  This program is a great success. But it is only the first step. \nCongress must now provide the next critical piece: funding for \ntreatment services once a woman has been diagnosed with breast or \ncervical cancer. Too often, women diagnosed through this program are \nleft to scramble to find treatment solutions.\n  I recently heard about this terrible problem from one of my \nconstituents. Her name is Barbara. Five years ago, Barbara was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer through the CDC's program. Uninsured, she \nstruggled to find treatment. Several doctors refused to treat her \nbecause she lacked insurance. Eventually, through a hodgepodge of \nsources and some volunteer services in Iowa she was able to receive \nchemotherapy. But today, she owes over $70,000 in medical bills. She \nwrites, ``My bills are so high I often wonder if I should quit \ntreatment so I will not saddle myself and my family with so much \ndebt.''\n  Barbara is one of the lucky ones. Many women who have been diagnosed \nthrough this program do not get treated at all.\n  The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act has 70 Senate cosponsors \nfrom both parties.\n  Its companion bill, H.R. 4386, has passed the House of \nRepresentatives with a vote of 421-1. There is no excuse for any \nfurther delay in the Senate. We should get this legislation through, \ncombine it with the House bill, and get it to the President for his \nsignature as soon as possible.\n\n  I note for the record, the original cosponsor of this bill was our \nnow departed colleague, Senator John Chafee. He was the original \nsponsor. It has 70 cosponsors. Those who worked so long with John \nChafee admired him so much. I think it would be a fitting tribute to \nhim to get this bill through as soon as possible and get it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  This is S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999. \nAs I said, its companion bill passed the House 421-1. I think we should \npass it as soon as possible. That is why I am taking this time to talk \nabout it, to encourage our distinguished majority leader to bring it to \nthe floor as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5784-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5784-S5787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND RELATED \n                AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this morning I was invited to the White \nHouse for a truly historic announcement. Through the collaboration of \ngovernment and private sector efforts, scientists have completed the \nfirst rough map of the human gene. I believe history will prove this \nthe most significant scientific development of our generation. Its \nimplications for improving the health and well-being of people are \ntruly astounding.\n  Today's announcement was especially fulfilling for me. In 1989, when \nI served as chair of the subcommittee responsible for this bill, I \nbegan the funding for the Human Genome Center at NIH, and the race to \nmap the genome began in earnest. At that time, many criticized the \nmove, saying it was a waste of time and money and couldn't be done in \nour lifetimes.\n  I listened very carefully to Dr. James Watson, the Nobel Prize winner \nwho first discovered the double helix of our DNA, and he was the first \ndirector of the genome center. He talked to us at great length about \nthe possibilities of not only mapping the human genome but sequencing \nthe entire human genomic code. At that time a lot of us were captivated \nby this concept, that we could actually have the blueprint of\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\nlife that hitherto has been known to no human being, but only to the \nAlmighty.\n  By breaking down this human genetic code, sequencing every one of the \n3 billion pairs that every human has, it would, as Dr. Watson said, \nprovide more than a blueprint, but it would provide the source of \nresearch that could very rapidly bring to a close our search for an end \nto some of the more debilitating diseases that have afflicted mankind \nfor thousands of years. Knowing the genetic code, researchers will now \nbe able to more precisely determine the genetic markers that people \nhave that predispose them to one disease or another.\n  It was Dr. James Watson who really got the policymakers here in the \nCongress excited about and interested in this human genome project. I \nhappened at that time to be the chair of the subcommittee. As Dr. \nWatson explained to us what this would do, I had probably just enough \nengineering background and mathematics background to get a feel for \nwhat this could possibly mean. As a result, we began to fund the human \ngenome project and center.\n  Today's announcement also demonstrates the importance of our drive to \ndouble funding for medical research. Senator Specter and I are \ncommitted to this effort. The bill provides the third installment of a \n$2.7 billion increase, the largest ever of a 5-year plan, to double \nfunding for NIH. The completion of mapping the human genome will yield \ntremendous advances in the search for medical breakthroughs in heart \ndisease, cancer, Alzheimer's. We are on the way to learning more than \nwe ever thought possible to cure human diseases. The reward will be \nreflected in the faces of MS, multiple sclerosis, patients who may live \nlonger and better lives because research isolated the gene that causes \ntheir dread disease. We will see it in the faces of Parkinson's \npatients who will experience an improved quality of life from a drug \ntargeted to their individual genome type. And we will see it in the \nfaces of cancer patients whose lives may one day be saved by gene \ntherapy.\n  Yet as we celebrate this great milestone, we must be looking to the \nchallenges ahead. I, of course, look forward to the day when genetic \ndiscrimination will be illegal, both at the workplace and in insurance. \nGenomic technologies have the potential to lead to better diagnosis and \ntreatment and ultimately to the prevention and cure of many diseases \nand disabilities. But without antidiscrimination protections, Americans \nwill forego early diagnosis and treatment for fear of discrimination in \nhealth insurance and employment.\n  So we cannot let discrimination or the fear of discrimination \nthreaten our ability to conduct the very research we need to \nunderstand, treat, and prevent genetic diseases. That is why Senator \nDaschle, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and I have introduced the \nGenetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act. Our \nlegislation would provide greatly needed protections against genetic \ndiscrimination in both employment and insurance and prohibit \ninappropriate disclosure of that information. I urge all my colleagues \nto join in passing anti-genetic-discrimination legislation to allow the \nresearch of the human genome project to reach its full potential.\n\n  In conclusion, I offer my heartiest congratulations and appreciation \nto every individual who worked on this project. There is no higher \ncalling than this work, saving human lives. These outstanding \nscientists and researchers made this historic day possible. Not only \ndid they meet their timetable, they beat it, and that is what I call \nreal success.\n  In that vein I want to pay special tribute to Dr. James Watson whose \npioneering efforts made today's breakthrough possible and who, at one \ncritical point in this human genome project several years ago, made the \ndecision with the new types of supercomputers we had to ratchet up the \nnumber of base pairs that they would be investigating and sequencing, \nto a much higher level than was ever done before. Because of that, we \nwere able to complete the sequencing of the human gene now rather than \n10 or 15 years from now.\n  I also commend Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the human genome \nproject at NIH. His brilliant and charismatic leadership of the project \nhas been the engine driving this effort.\n  I might say Dr. Collins headed not only the effort here in the United \nStates, but this has been a multinational effort, and this morning, at \nthe White House, we had Prime Minister Blair on closed circuit \ntelevision. He was in London. He had his scientists around him. They \nhad provided great support for our project, as had the French and the \nGermans, the Swiss, the Chinese, the Japanese, and a number of others. \nThey had all provided help and support for sequencing this human gene. \nDr. Francis Collins led this international effort.\n  Finally, I also pay tribute to Dr. Craig Venter, a former NIH \nscientist now the head of a private entity called Celera Genomics. It \nis the private sector firm that has been central to today's \nbreakthrough. Dr. Venter, again, at a critical point, came up with a \nnew way of discovering and sequencing more base pairs in a shorter \nperiod of time than had ever been done before. Again, because of his \ninsight and his leadership and efforts, and his own private enterprise, \nhe was able to help us reach this day a lot sooner.\n  I think that also points out the benefit of the tremendous \nrelationship we have had in this country between public-sector-funded \nbasic research and private-sector-funded research. Most--I would not \nsay all--of the basic research done in this country is funded publicly \nby our taxpayers through the money that we appropriate here in the \nCongress. There is some basic research done by the drug companies, that \nis true. But in most of the research done in the private sector they \ntake the basic research that is funded publicly and determine whether \nor not there is something there that can be made into a drug or \ntherapeutic or intervention or diagnostic tool that can be used in the \nprivate sector, in the real world, to help either to stop the onset of \na certain illness, to cure it once it has onset, or to make the illness \nless invasive and less detrimental to the normal life of a person.\n  With this marriage, we have in the United States cultivated a very \nunique body of health research. Today's announcement, with the public \nand private sector together, illustrated that.\n  Again, my congratulations to Dr. Venter for his leadership in the \nprivate sector.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as this week progresses, we are going to \nbe busier and busier and there will be less time to say what I want to \nsay.\n  I said at our subcommittee hearing how much I admire and respect the \nwork Senator Harkin and Senator Specter do in the subcommittee. The \naudience there was very small. Hopefully, the audience here is bigger. \nI want everyone to understand what great work Senator Harkin has done \nwith Senator Specter on this subcommittee.\n  This year--and the President made an announcement today--we have a \nsurplus of $217 billion. We have not had that in recent years. This \nsubcommittee, in spite of the fact it has been fighting for money, has \ndone wonderful things dealing with the National Institutes of Health. \nThey have been the leaders in stem cell research. They held hearings. \nThat work being done on stem cell research, together with the work \nbeing done on the human genome, is the same as the work we did with \ncomputers and the Internet. What we did 10 years ago with the computer \nis nothing compared to what we can do now, and the same is going to be \ntrue when we understand the genomes each of us has, together with stem \ncell research and some of the other things being done as the result of \nthe funding of this subcommittee.\n  When the history books are written, the work the two Senators have \ndone in funding this very important research is going to be a big \nchapter. There is hope, as the Senator mentioned. The people who have \nmultiple sclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's are going to \nbenefit from the work done with the funding of this subcommittee.\n  I hope the Senator from Iowa knows how much he is appreciated. This \nis as important as anything we have ever done in this Congress. Half \nthe people\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\nin the rest homes in America today are there because of two things: \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's. Think what it will mean for not only the \npeople who are sick but their loved ones. Think how good it will be if \nwe can do something to delay the onset of these two diseases or, when \nthe miracle does come, we can cure them. Think how important it will be \nfor them and their families. In addition to that, think how important \nit will be for the American taxpayers. Billions of dollars go into \ntaking care of people who have these two diseases.\n  On behalf of the people of the State of Nevada, and I think I can \nspeak for the people of this country, the Senator is appreciated. I \nhope he understands that. It is great work. We hear so much negative in \nthe press about no one will cooperate with anything. What this \nsubcommittee does is an example of what the rest of the Congress should \ndo. The work of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa \nhas been good. I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate what he \nhas done.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. \nI was thinking as he was talking on this specific project, the human \ngenome project, it is true I happened to be chairman at that time and \nwe started funding it because of what Dr. Watson was able to get across \nto us when he explained what this would mean down the road. I must say, \nwhen I turned over the gavel to Senator Specter in 1995, there was not \neven a bump in the road. We always worked together on this. When he \ntook over as chairman, we continued our strong support for NIH and our \nstrong support for the human genome project.\n  As the Senator from Nevada said, it has truly been good bipartisan \nteamwork. I do not mean to say only the two of us. The members of the \ncommittee have been very much involved in this through the years.\n  Looking back now and seeing what has happened gives me goose bumps \nbecause when we first started this I checked with some people to find \nout what it would mean to sequence the human genes. We knew we could \nmap it, but to sequence the 3 billion base pairs of genes, of cold \nhuman genome, I asked them how long: Maybe 25 years; maybe we will get \nit done in 25 years, maybe longer.\n  Even then they did not know if they could really get them all \nsequenced. So I would talk with Dr. Watson about it, and he would say: \nNo, it may take us that long, but we should start on it; we should not \nput it off any longer; we should start on it.\n  I thought when we first started this it was going to take literally \n20 years, as an outside estimate. As I said in my remarks, there came a \ntime when Dr. Watson and some of his team figured out a better way of \nsequencing these genes, and that collapsed the timeframe right there. \nIt took money. The whole effort in the human genome project has been \npeople and money. If one has the people and the money, one can get it \ndone. It took people to do it, but it took money to buy the big \ncomputers. The faster the computers got, the better it was. And along \ncame Craig Venter with a different concept on how to do this, and that \nagain collapsed the timeframe.\n  To think we started this project literally a decade ago, in 1990, and \nhere we are 10 years later. Having the entire human genome sequenced is \njust mind boggling. It really is the Rosetta stone. Before that, they \ndid not know how to read the Egyptian hieroglyphics. When they found \nthe Rosetta stone, they could break the code.\n  That is what this is. It is going to provide the best tool \nresearchers all over the world have ever had. The beauty of it is that \nany scientist anywhere in the world can go on the Internet right now \nand get all the information they need. Every sequence is now in the \npublic domain. It is not being held privately. Any researcher can get \naccess to it.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, I cannot wait for the next 10 years \nto see what is going to happen. We are going to see an explosion of new \nfindings researchers are going to come up with that are truly going to \nbe mind boggling.\n  In the next 10 years, mark my words--I probably will not be here; \nmaybe the Senator from Nevada will be here--by gosh, we are going to \nlook back and say the first decade of the 21st century was the decade \nwhen we truly understood disease and illness, the things the Senator \nfrom Nevada talked about--Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's \ndisease. Not only will we understand it, we will know how to go right \nin there and fix it 10 years from now. Mark my words.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Iowa--I did not do \na very good job of describing it--had someone told Senator Harkin and I \n10 years ago what is now possible with the Internet through computers, \nwe would not have believed it. We simply would not have believed it. I \nknow I would not have.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not have the capacity to understand it.\n  Mr. REID. But now the progress that has been made is unbelievable. \nWhat I tried to say--and the Senator from Iowa described it better than \nI--the same is going to apply to medicine. Ten years from now, people \nwill think this conversation of ours was so amateurish.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Archaic.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nCochran amendment regarding antimicrobial resistance monitoring agents \nbe laid aside to recur as the pending business at 9:40 a.m. and there \nbe 5 minutes for closing remarks tomorrow morning with a vote to occur \non the amendment at 9:45 a.m. with no second-degree amendments in \norder.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate \nresume consideration of the McCain amendment regarding the Internet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I supported the amendment to create a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program offered \nby my colleague, Senator Robb from Virginia, to the Labor, Health and \nHuman Resources and Education Appropriations bill.\n  Despite the Senate defeating this amendment largely along a party \nline vote of 44 to 53, I vow to continue the fight with my colleagues \nto push the Senate for further debate on prescription drug proposals \nand pass a meaningful prescription drug bill this year. The millions of \nneedy seniors and those with disabilities receiving Medicare deserve \nnothing less.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that this was not the time, nor the \nproper legislative process by which we should pass a Medicare \nprescription drug proposal. Mr response to that accusation, is when is \nthe proper time then? When are we in Congress going to listen to the \nconstituents like those that I have spoken to from Wessington Springs \nand Custer, South Dakota? This is not, nor should be a partisan issue. \nThis is not, nor should be an issue that gives greater deliberation to \nthe pleas of party politics than pleas of needy seniors.\n  Constituents in my home state of South Dakota, have been telling me \nfor years that they are struggling to make ends meet and need help \naffording their prescription drugs. I introduced my first bill on this \nissue well over a year ago in the Senate, and since then debate \nsurrounding how to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to \naffordable prescription drugs has produced several proposals from both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Yet, this is the first time that the Senate has taken the time during \nthe 106th Congress to have a floor vote on this issue. I am cautiously \noptimistic that we will continue to see debate on this critically \nimportant matter, and may indeed find compromise between the two \nparties to help our senior citizens better afford their expensive \nprescription drug medications.\n  I am in constant contact with South Dakotans who have expressed their \ndifficulty in choosing between paying for medication, or buying food \nand paying\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\nutilities. I want to assure them that the Senate will not wait any \nlonger and will pass legislation this session to provide immediate \nrelief to the thousands of senior citizens in South Dakota and across \nthe nation who are having difficulty affording life-saving medication.\n  Even if we can't reach an agreement on a Medicare prescription drug \nplan this year, there are several steps we can take now that would \nprovide some relief to seniors who face rising prescription drug costs. \nAll three of the bills that I have sponsored, including the \nPrescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act, the International \nPrescription Drug Parity Act, and the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and \nChoice For Consumers Act, if enacted this year, would provide immediate \nrelief to millions of Americans across the country. Equally so, these \nbills would require no additional taxpayer dollars nor new government \nprogram.''\n  While they may not be the magic bullet that meets all of the long \nterm needs of providing Medicare prescription drug coverage, they would \nprovide a mechanism for immediate relief from rising drug costs. \nWorking together, reaching across the aisle, we can use this time of \nunparalleled prosperity to do the right thing by our seniors. We should \ndo it this year for their sake, and for the sake of the future of \nMedicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5787-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise today, on the 66th \nanniversary of the National Credit Union Act being signed into law by \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, to salute the Nation's credit unions \nand acknowledge their important contributions.\n  Prior to 1934, collective pools of employees gathered their assets to \nassist them in acquiring credit and improving their financial futures. \nThe first credit union in the United States was established in 1909, as \nthe only financial institution available to low-income workers who \nwanted to save their wages and receive short-term consumer loans.\n  In the spring of 1925, the Minneapolis postal employees collectively \nbegan Minnesota's first credit union with 15 workers attending the \ninitial meeting. Started with a total of $146.25 in assets, the \nMinneapolis Postal Employees Credit Union, now called the US Federal \nCredit Union, has survived through times of economic hardship such as \nthe Depression of the 1930s and World War II.\n  Today, the Federal Credit Union System has well over $300 billion in \nassets, and some 67 million Americans enjoy membership in credit unions \nnation-wide. Credit unions bring together people with common employers, \nethnic backgrounds, or geographic areas. They have positively impacted \neconomic growth in the United States by increasing Americans' access to \ncredit through a system of cooperative organizations which have helped \nstabilize America's credit structure.\n  The credit union philosophy of ``people helping people'' continues to \nprovide many rural and economically depressed areas with the financial \ntools and confidence necessary for success. In my state of Minnesota, \nmore than 195 credit unions not only provide mortgages, loans, and \nfinancial savings opportunities, but also bring their communities \ntogether to raise money for programs such as ``Credit Unions for \nKids.'' This effort is a collaboration of credit unions and business \npartners benefitting 170 Children's Miracle Network-affiliated \nhospitals serving 14 million kids nation-wide.\n  Minnesota credit unions also provide funds for the Minnesota Credit \nUnion Foundation, a non-profit corporation organized to serve \ncharitable, scientific and educational purposes with special emphasis \non credit union-related activities. Funds are used to provide disaster \nrelief efforts for credit union members, develop credit unions in \nemerging nations, and supply scholarships to educational training \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, as a member of a credit union myself, I would like to \nthank America's credit unions on this anniversary for their constant \nand continuous efforts to assist the men and women of their communities \novercome life's financial obstacles and build a more secure future for \nthemselves and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5787-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF PAUL McLAUGHLIN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join the City of \nBoston, the residents of Massachusetts, and members of the law \nenforcement community across the country in recognizing the loss of \nPaul McLaughlin. Paul was a committed prosecutor who lived his life for \nothers, and on September 25, 1995, he was shot while getting into his \ncar after work. This weekend Boston memorializes its loss with the \ndedication of the Paul McLaughlin Boys and Girls Club in Dorchester's \nSavin Hill neighborhood and I join the city in this important day of \nrecognition.\n  Paul came from a long, distinguished line of Bostonians. His \ngrandfather, Edward Sr., was the Boston Fire Commissioner as well as a \nmember of the State Legislature in the 1920's, and his father, Edward \nJr., was President of the Boston City Council, an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney, and Lt. Governor under Governor Volpe. A graduate of Boston \nLatin School, Dartmouth College and Suffolk Law School, Paul was \nadmitted to the bar in 1981 and his early work included time at the \nCambridge District Court and the Public Protection Bureau. Paul was the \nconsummate professional, and his reputation soon led to serving on the \nAttorney General's staff in 1991, where he was assigned to drug and \ngang cases in Suffolk Superior Court. During one five year stretch he \ncompiled an impressive 73 percent conviction rate, winning 98 of 134 \nSuperior Court cases.\n  In a fitting tribute to Paul's commitment to working for a better \ncommunity for all of us, especially our children, the site for the \nMcLaughlin Boys and Girls Club is one of Boston's Ten Most Wanted drug \nhouses. On Saturday, June 24th, the McLaughlin Family joined with Mayor \nThomas M. Menino and members of the Colonel Daniel Marr Boys & Girls \nClub in honoring Paul's life by opening a remarkable new facility in \nhis name in Dorchester's Savin Hill neighborhood. The Paul R. \nMcLaughlin Youth Center will perpetuate Paul's legacy of selfless \nservice to his community by serving 2,600 children in one of the \nstate's most successful youth programs. The structure that used to be \nthe source of drugs and despair will now be a beacon of hope for the \nwhole city.\n  Mr. President, I join the people of Dorchester, West Roxbury and \nJamaica Plain in mourning the loss of their neighbor and friend. My \nthoughts go out to Paul's colleagues, friends and family. Together, we \nrealize how fortunate we are to have worked with and known an \nindividual of his caliber. Today the City of Boston memorializes this \nloss, and I join everyone in honoring his life by opening the Paul R. \nMcLaughlin Youth Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5787-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5787-S5788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO THOMAS BURACK\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an individual who has distinguished himself in the State of \nNew Hampshire by performing the outstanding heroic act of saving the \nlife of a resident of the town of Bedford.\n  Ryan Belanger acted selflessly on April 9th, 2000, to rescue resident \nPaula Halla, only moments before her car exploded. Paula's car had been \nstruck off the road by a tree that fell during a storm, leaving her \ntrapped in the burning vehicle anxiously awaiting rescue crews.\n  Belanger, who noticed the vehicle after also striking the fallen \ntree, checked on the passengers in his vehicle and immediately rushed \nto the aid of Paula. Without hesitation, Ryan Belanger began to attempt \nto put out the fire, and pulled Paula from the burning car only moments \nbefore it exploded.\n  Citing his late grandfather's influence and love of life, Belanger \nstated, ``He was my father, and made me who I am. If it wasn't for him, \nI wouldn't have pulled that lady out of the car.'' Had Ryan not acted \nwith haste, Paula would have most likely been killed in the incident. \nInstead, she escaped with minor bruises and cuts.\n  I am honored to recognize a true American hero, and to commend him on \nhis successful efforts to rescue a fellow resident of the state. He \nquickly rescued Paula Halla from her vehicle, saving her life. He is an \ninspiration to the town of Bedford, his home town of Manchester, and \nthe state and nation as a whole. I applaud his courage and perseverence \nin the daring rescue. It is truly an honor and a pleasure to represent \nhim in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5788-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EILEEN KENNEDY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Salem on its 250th anniversary, an important and \nhistoric milestone.\n  Since being incorporated as a town on May 11, 1750, Salem has \nprovided its residents with a safe place to raise families in a \nconvenient location on the border of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. \nThis thriving community boasts countless recreational opportunities. \nCanobie Lake attracts boaters, fishermen and those just looking for a \npeaceful place to relax. People from all over New England flock to \nCanobie Park to enjoy a day of games and fun during the summer months, \nand those who are looking for a little history can visit America's \nStonehenge.\n  Salem's 26,000 residents have seen a great amount of change \nthroughout its 250 years. The town is now home to numerous industrial \nfirms, and will soon welcome Cisqo to the growing number of businesses \nthat call Salem home. Salem also offers numerous shopping outlets, most \nnotably the Mall at Rockingham Park, with opportunities for great tax-\nfree shopping.\n  Salem is also home to some very talented athletes. Olympic Women's \nHockey Gold Medalist Katie King was a multi-sport star at Salem High \nbefore the world took notice in Nagano in 1998. And Salem High's \nsoftball team is a perennial state power, taking the state title once \nagain this year.\n  Salem is also a very politically active town as it recently opened \nits Republican Town Committee offices. Also, the town has come together \nto celebrate its 250th anniversary, celebrating with events that began \nwith a tremendous First Night party to mark the year 2000 and will \nculminate with a party on the Fourth of July. Once again, I want to \ncongratulate the town of Salem on its 250th anniversary. It is an honor \nto serve its citizens in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5788-6", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5788-S5789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE BELKNAP COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GROUP\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill entitled the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and \nPublic Safety Act''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         the 21st century law enforcement and public safety act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non the Judiciary, I am pleased to introduce at the request of the \nAdministration ``The 21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety \nAct.'' This bill reflects the continuing aggressive approach of this \nAdministration and this Department of Justice, under the leadership of \nAttorney General Janet Reno, to keep the both the violent and property \ncrime rates in this country going down.\n  Under the Attorney General's leadership and the programs established \nby the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the \nnation's serious crime rate has declined for eight straight years. We \nare seeing the lowest recorded rates in many years. Murder rates have \nfallen to their lowest levels in three decades. Even juvenile crime \nrates have also been falling. According to the FBI's latest crime \nstatistics release, on May 7, 2000, in just the last year, there has \nbeen a seven percent decline in reported serious violent and property \ncrime from 1998 totals. Both murder and robbery registered eight \npercent drops, while forcible rape and aggravated assault figures each \ndeclined by seven percent from 1998. This is cause for commendation for \nthe Attorney General and our Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers, to whom all Americans owe an enormous thanks for a job well \ndone.\n  This Administration has not rested on its laurels, however. Instead, \nthe Administration has crafted the bill I introduce on their behalf \ntoday. It contains a number of good ideas to which the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Congress should pay attention. Unfortunately, the \nCommittee and the Congress has spent more time on symbolic issues, such \nas a proposed amendments to the Constitution to protect the flag and \ncrime victims than to other concrete steps we could take to combat \ncrime and school violence. Indeed, the majority in Congress has stalled \nany conference action on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation, \nS. 254, which passed the Senate by a substantial majority in May, 1999.\n  The Administration's bill contains five titles focusing on various \naspects of crime. Title I contains proposals for supporting local law \nenforcement and promoting crime-fighting technologies, including \nexpanding the purpose of COPS grants by funding an increase in the \nnumber of prosecutors as well as police; authorizing grants to improve \nthe technology used for investigations in underserved rural areas--less \nthan 25,000 people; and extending the Leahy-Campbell Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act.\n  Title II contains many proposals for breaking the cycle of drugs and \nviolence. Title III would promote investigative and prosecutorial tools \nfor fighting terrorism and international crime. Title IV would \nreauthorize certain VAWA programs and provide other assistance to \nvictims of crime and consumer fraud. In addition, this title contains \nimportant proposals to prevent and punish abuse and neglect of the \nelderly and other residents in nursing homes and health care facilities \nand environmental crimes. The last title would strengthen federal \ncriminal laws to combat white collar crime, including in correction \nfacilities and involving the theft of government property.\n  While I have concerns with certain parts of the bill, such as \nproposals for increases in mandatory minimum penalties, a new death \npenalty provision and broad administrative subpoena authority, I \nsupport many other parts, such as the Extension of Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act to assist law enforcement in Vermont and across \nthe nation obtain bulletproof vests and stay safe on the job.\n  Again, I commend the Attorney General and the Administration for this \nimportant legislation and their efforts to keep Americans safe from \ncrime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\n  S. 2784. A bill entitled ``Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains \nNational Monument Act of 2000''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n   santa rosa and san jacinto mountains national monument act of 2000\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nbill today to designate the Santa Rosa/San Jacinto mountain range in \nsouthern California as a National Monument. This bill was introduced by \nCongresswoman Mary Bono earlier in the year. An almost identical \nversion of this bill was passed out of the House Resources Committee \nearlier in the week.\n  The Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains contain nationally \nsignificant biological, cultural, recreational, geological, \neducational, and scientific values. This includes magnificent vistas, \nunique wildlife and mountains which rise from the desert floor to an \nelevation of almost eleven thousand feet. These mountains provide a \npicturesque backdrop for Coachella Valley communities and support a \nwide array of recreational opportunities.\n  The bill designates this environmentally sensitive area as a monument \nand instructs the Department of Interior and the Forest Service to \ncraft a management plan. The bill protects the rights of individual \nland owners, Native American tribes, and all lands outside the monument \nboundary. It protects the environment and preserves property rights. \nThe bill has bipartisan support and supported by most of the local \ncommunity.\n  This bill is quite timely. Three hundred and fifty-five thousand \nacres of the Sequoia National Forest were designated a national \nmonument by President Clinton on April 15. Over the sixty-day period \npreceding the designation, many members of the affected community \nexpressed significant opposition to the monument designation. I came to \nbelieve that when possible, Congress is in the best position to decide \nmonument and other land use designations and can best ensure that \nstakeholders affected by such a designation have ample opportunity to \nprovide input, influence the process and understand the designation.\n  I believe this bill is the proper way to protect this majestic \nnational resource.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Roth, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Ashcroft, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Reid, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Dodd, Mr. L.

A bill to reauthorize the Federal programs to prevent \nviolence against women, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the violence against women act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with \nSenator Hatch, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. And I thank \nSenator Hatch, the principal cosponsor of the original Act, for working \nwith me over the past year to produce a bipartisan, streamlined bill \nthat we are confident will enjoy the support of Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. Indeed, we already have a total of 50 cosponsors--\nmany of them Republicans--as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994--bipartisan \nlegislation cosponsored by 67 Senators from both parties--signaled the \nbeginning of a national and historic commitment to the women and \nchildren in this country victimized by family violence and sexual \nassault.\n  The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal penalties, \nfacilitated enforcement of protection orders from state to state, and \ncommitted $1.6 billion over six years to police, prosecutors, battered \nwomen shelters, a national domestic violence hotline, and other \nmeasures designed to crack down on batterers and offer the support and \nservices that victims need in order to leave their abusers.\n  And this federal commitment has paid off: the latest Department of \nJustice statistics show that overall, violence against women by \nintimate partners is down, falling 21% from 1993 (just prior to the \nenactment of the original Act) to 1998.\n  The programs contained in the original Act were authorized only \nthrough fiscal year 2000. So unless Congress acts, programs to run the \nbattered women's shelters, the national domestic violence hotline, the \nSTOP grants to help law enforcement and prosecutors combat domestic \nviolence and to provide victims services, grants to address domestic \nviolence in rural communities--all of these will expire this year. \nThese programs are popular, and more importantly, ladies and gentlemen, \nthe Violence Against Women Act is working.\n  And it's not just me calling for this law to be reauthorized.\n  It's police chiefs in every state. It's Attorneys General. Sheriffs. \nDistrict attorneys. The American Bar Association. Women's groups. \nNurses. Battered women's shelters. Family Court judges.\n  States, counties, cities, and towns across the country are creating a \nseamless network of services for victims of violence against women--\nfrom law enforcement to legal services, from medical care and crisis \ncounseling, to shelters and support groups.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has made, and is making, a real \ndifference in the lives of millions of women and children by providing \nmuch needed funds at the local level to--and let me just give you a few \nexamples:\n  Give police officers more specialized training both to deal swiftly \nand surely with abusers and to become more sensitive toward victims, as \nwell as to provide them with better evidence-gathering and information-\nsharing equipment and skills;\n  Train prosecutors and judges on the unique aspects of cases involving \nviolence against women;\n  Hire victim advocates and counselors and provide an array of \nservices, including 24-hour hotlines, emergency transportation, medical \nservices, and specialized programs to reach victims of violence against \nwomen from all walks of life; and\n  Open new and expand existing shelters for victims of violence against \nwomen and their children.\n  The Violence Against Women Act funds 1,031 shelters and 82 safe \nhouses in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. But \ntens of thousands of women and children are still turned away every \nyear.\n  Together--at the federal, state, and local levels--we have been \nsteadily moving forward, step by step, along the road to ending this \nviolence once and for all. But there is more that we can do, and more \nthat we must do.\n  The Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 would accomplish \nthree basic things:\n  First, the bill would reauthorize through Fiscal Year 2005 the key \nprograms included in the original Violence Against Women Act. These \ninclude the STOP grants, the Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic Violence \nand Child Abuse Enforcement Grants, the National Domestic Violence \nHotline, and rape prevention and education programs.\n  This also means reauthorizing the court-appointed special advocate \nprogram (CASA), and other programs in the Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n  Second, the bill would extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund \nthrough Fiscal Year 2005. Funding for the trust fund expires this year. \nThis dedicated funding source--paid for by the savings generated by \nreducing the federal workforce by more than 300,000 employees--provides \nall the grant money for additional police officers, prosecutors, and \nbattered women shelters. It is these funds that provide the specialized \ndomestic violence training for law enforcement and prosecutors.\n  The Trust Fund is the source of funding for all the victim services, \nincluding counseling, legal services, nursing and hospital services, \nespecially designed for victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault.\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\n  Of course, the Trust Fund's significance extends beyond the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. The trust fund has provided the funds for a host of \nsuccessful law enforcement initiatives, ranging from drug courts; the \nweed and seed programs that exist in every state to drive drugs from \nour cities; and funding for prisons, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, and Boys and Girls clubs. And the list goes on.\n  In order to replicate the successes we have achieved under the \noriginal Violence Against Women Act, and in order to continue to pursue \nthese other important law enforcement programs, it is imperative that \nwe: (1) extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional \nfive years, and (2) that we fully fund the Trust Fund.\n  Third, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 makes some targeted \nimprovements that our experience with the original Act has shown to be \nnecessary. Let me give you just a few examples.\n  Civil Legal Assistance Grants: Our bill would create a separate grant \nprogram to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual \nassault who need legal assistance because of that violence, to obtain \naccess to legal services at little to no cost.\n  This provision would also establish a database of legal assistance \nproviders to be maintained and used by the National Domestic Violence \nHotline, so that victims who call the hotline can be directed to a \nlegal service provider immediately.\n  Improving Full Faith & Credit Enforcement of Protection Orders: My \nbill would help states and tribal courts improve interstate enforcement \nof civil protection orders, as required by the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act. The program would prioritize the development and \nenhancement of data collection and sharing systems to promote tracking \nand enforcement of protection orders across the nation.\n  Transitional Housing: The bill would also authorize the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to make grants to provide short-term housing \nassistance and short-term support services to individuals and their \ndependents who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or other \nhousing assistance as a result of fleeing a situation of domestic \nviolence, and for whom emergency shelter services are unavailable or \ninsufficient.\n  Safe Havens for Children: The bill would authorize a new two-year \npilot grant program to be administered by the Department of Justice \naimed at reducing the opportunity for domestic violence to occur during \nthe transfer of children for visitation purposes by expanding the \navailability of supervised visitation for victims of domestic violence, \nsexual assault, and child abuse. We all know that women are at greatest \nrisk of assault at the time when children are transferred between \nparents.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to point out that the \nSupreme Court's recent decision in United States v. Morrison, 120 S. \nCt. 1740 (2000), invalidated a single provision of the original Act, \nthe ``civil rights remedy'' that permitted a victim of gender-motivated \nviolence to sue her attacker in federal court. No other provision in \nthe original Act--or, for that matter, in the Violence Against Women \nAct of 2000--is affected by the Supreme Court's decision.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on where we are and how we got here.\n  The bill Senator Hatch and I are introducing today is a streamlined \nversion of S. 51, the legislation I originally introduced at the \nbeginning of the 106th Congress.\n  Since I first introduced S. 51, I have consulted extensively with \nSenator Hatch and with many other individuals, inside and outside of \nthe Senate, and on both sides of the aisle, in an effort to narrow the \nlegislation to produce a bill that every Senator, regardless of party, \ncan enthusiastically support.\n  In the course of that effort, I agreed to drop a number of items that \nquite frankly, I think were worth doing, and made other concessions. I \ndid that because I believe it is critical, in the waning days of this \nlegislative session, to achieve a strong bipartisan consensus on the \nessential elements that must be included in this bill. I am convinced \nthat we have reached that consensus, and that the bill we now propose \nreflects the priorities of a substantial majority of Senators.\n  For far too long, law enforcement, prosecutors, the courts, and the \ncommunity at large treated domestic abuse as a ``private family \nmatter,'' looking the other way when women suffered abuse at the hands \nof their supposed loved ones. Thanks in part to the original Act, \nviolence against women is no longer a private matter, and the time when \na woman has to suffer in silence because the criminal who is \nvictimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend has passed.\n  The bill I introduce today will renew the commitment we made as a \nnation in 1994 to combat family violence, sexual assault, and stalking. \nI urge all of you to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Battered Immigrant Women \n     Protection Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered \n     immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept \n     battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive \n     relationships;\n       (2) providing battered immigrant women and children who \n     were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection \n     against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders \n     against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law \n     enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against \n     their abusers and the abusers of their children without \n     fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or \n     threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit \n     under the abuser's control; and\n       (3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women \n     and children who do not have access to the immigration \n     protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which \n     means that their abusers are virtually immune from \n     prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result \n     of action by their abusers and the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter \n     how compelling their case under existing law.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons \n     who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against \n     immigrant women and children; and\n       (2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring \n     in family and intimate relationships that are covered in \n     State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and \n     family law statutes.\n\n     SEC. 503.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Joseph Biden, to introduce one of the most significant pieces \nof legislation that the Senate will consider this year, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2000. This historic bill reauthorizes the Violence \nAgainst Women Act programs that would otherwise expire at the end of \nthis fiscal year. This new bill is the result of bipartisan cooperation \nover the last year and combines the best provisions of S. 245, the \nViolence Against Women Act of 1999, which I introduced last year, and \nof S. 51, Senator Biden's Violence Against Women Act II.\n  Six years ago, recognizing the importance and need to protect the \nwomen and children in this country from domestic violence, stalking, \nand sexual assault, senators from both parties supported the original \nViolence Against Women Act in 1994. This legislation has made a \ncritical difference in the lives of countless families in my state of \nUtah and across the country.\n  The Violence Against Women Act strengthened our laws, empowered law \nenforcement, facilitated access to protective orders, established and \nfunded both battered women shelters and a national domestic violence \nhotline, and most importantly led to the overall protection of \nAmerica's women and children.\n  Well, we must ask ourselves, ``Was it worth it? Did our efforts made \na difference?'' I stand here today to answer those questions with a \nresounding ``yes.''\n  The most recent Department of Justice statistics show that violence \nagainst women by intimate partners is down 21 percent across the board \nfrom just before the original bill's enactment. The Department of \nJustice has prosecuted hundreds of cases involving interstate domestic \nviolence, interstate stalking, and interstate violations of protection \norders. Through funding provided by the Act, the Department of Health \nand Human Services has provided grant funds to shelter more than \n300,000 women and their dependents each year, while the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline has responded to approximately 500,000 calls. \nIn all, the original Violence Against Women Act provided $1.6 billion \nin grant funds supporting the work of law enforcement officials, \nprosecutors, the courts, victim advocates, and intervention and \nprevention programs to address domestic violence at all levels.\n  Although the Violence Against Women Act has been widely successful, \ndomestic violence continues to plague our homes, our communities, and \nour country. The national statistics are sobering:\n  Nearly one-third of women murdered each year are killed by their \nintimate partners.\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n  Violence by intimates accounts for over 20 percent of all violent \ncrime against women.\n  Approximately one million women are stalked each year.\n  Women were raped and sexually assaulted 307,000 times in 1998 alone.\n  Thus, I believe we should ask ourselves today, ``Should we continue \nand strengthen our efforts to combat violence against women?'' Once \nagain, I stand here today to answer this question with a resounding \n``yes.'' We must continue our efforts to protect our women and children \nfrom the devastating effects of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual \nassault.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 will reauthorize through \nfiscal year 2005 the grant programs that will enable the federal, \nstate, and local governments to persist in their efforts to prosecute \noffenders and provide vital services to the victims of domestic \nviolence. I would like to point out that the recent Supreme Court case \nUnited States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), simply invalidated \nthe ``civil remedy'' provision, which allowed a victim of gender-\nmotivated violence to sue her attacker in federal court. The case did \nnot affect the ability of Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act, nor did the case affect any other aspect of the Act.\n\n  There are several new, important, and worthwhile programs in this \nbill. One in particular, the transitional housing program, had its \ninception in my own state of Utah. Dedicated professionals in my State, \nworking in the field, brought to my attention the fact that shelters \noften fail to provide adequate help to persons escaping the horror of \ndomestic violence. In states like Utah, the spread-out location and the \nfew number of shelters makes it difficult to serve the entire \npopulation in need of refuge from domestic violence. Furthermore, \nshelters are often inadequate for anything more than a few weeks. The \ntransitional housing program remedies the situation by allowing some \nsupplemental and short term housing for persons escaping domestic \nviolence.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we achieve strong, bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. We are approaching the end of our legislative \nsession--we need to take the politics out of the process and \nreauthorize this Act. Senator Biden and I have worked long and hard on \nthis--we are confident that our bill represents not only the interests \nof both Republicans and Democrats, but that it truly represents the \ninterests of the American family. I intend to move this bill through \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee promptly and intend to do all I can to \nensure it becomes law this year.\n  Finally, I would conclude by expressing my gratitude to Senator Biden \nfor his tireless efforts to get this legislation written and passed. No \none in the Senate has a longer and greater history of dedication to \ncombating violence against women.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to Senator Spencer \nAbraham from Michigan. He has given much of his time and attention to \nthis bill, particularly on the immigration provisions. I am grateful \nfor his efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the Violence Against Women Act of \n2000 (VAWA II). As we head into the 21st century, violence against \nwomen continues to affect millions of women and children in this \ncountry. Whether you live in a big city or a rural town, domestic \nviolence can be found anywhere.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early on in \nmy career, when I was the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden \nCounty. In those days, long before the passage of the Violence Against \nWomen Act (VAWA), there were not support programs and services in place \nto assist victims of these types of crimes. Today, because of the hard \nwork and dedication of those in Vermont and around the country who work \non these problems every day, an increasing number of women and children \nare seeking services through domestic violence programs and at shelters \naround the nation.\n  Since the passage of VAWA in 1994, I have been privileged to work \nwith groups such as the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and \nSexual Assault and the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services who \nhave worked to help put a stop to violence against women and provided \nassistance to those who have fallen victim to it. I am proud today to \nsupport the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, a Federal initiative \ndesigned to continue the success of VAWA by reauthorizing Federal \nprograms to prevent violence against women.\n  Six years ago, VAWA passed Congress as part of the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act. That Act combined tough law \nenforcement strategies with safeguards and services for victims of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. I am proud to say that Vermont \nwas the first State in the country to apply for and receive funding \nthrough VAWA. Since VAWA was enacted, Vermont has received almost $7 \nmillion in VAWA funds.\n  This funding has enabled Vermont to develop specialized prosecution \nunits and child advocacy centers throughout the state. Lori Hayes, \nExecutive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and \nMarty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic \nViolence and Sexual Assault, have been especially instrumental in \ncoordinating VAWA grants in Vermont. Their hard work has brought \nVermont grant funding for encouraging arrest policies as well as for \ncombating rural domestic violence and child abuse. These grants have \nmade a real difference in the lives of those who suffer from violence \nand abuse. Reauthorization of these vital programs in VAWA II will \ncontinue to build on these successes.\n  We have tolerated violence against women for far too long and this \nbill continues to move us toward reducing violence against women by \nstrengthening law enforcement through the extension of STOP grants, \nwhich encourage a multi-disciplinary approach to improving the criminal \njustice system's response to violence against women. With support from \nSTOP grants, law enforcement, prosecution, courts, victim advocates and \nservice providers work together to ensure victim safety and offender \naccountability.\n  The beneficial effects of STOP grants are evident throughout Vermont. \nFrom the Windham County Domestic Violence Unit to the Rutland County \nWomen's Network and Shelter, STOP grants have resulted in enhanced \nvictim advocacy services, increased safety for women and children, and \nincreased accountability of perpetrators. The Northwest Unit for \nSpecial Investigations in St. Albans, Vermont, has established a multi-\ndisciplinary approach to the investigation of adult sexual assault and \ndomestic violence cases with the help of STOP funds. By linking victims \nwith advocacy programs at the time of the initial report, the Unit \nfinds that more victims get needed services and support and thus find \nit easier to participate in the investigation and subsequent \nprosecution. The State's Attorney's Office, which has designated a \nprosecutor to participate in the Unit, has implemented a new protocol \nfor the prosecution of domestic violence cases. The protocol and multi-\ndisciplinary approach are credited with an 80 percent conviction rate \nin domestic violence and sexual assault cases.\n  Passing VAWA II will continue grants which strengthen pro-arrest \npolicies and enforcement of protection orders. In a rural state like \nVermont, law enforcement agencies greatly benefit from cooperative, \ninter-agency efforts to combat and solve significant problems. Last \nyear, approximately $850,000 of this funding supported Vermont efforts \nto encourage arrest policies.\n  Vermont will also benefit from the extension of Rural Domestic \nViolence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants under VAWA II. \nThese grants are designed to make victim services more accessible to \nwomen and children living in rural areas. I worked hard to see this \nfunding included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am proud that its \nsuccess has merited an increased authorization for funding in VAWA II. \nRural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants have \nbeen utilized by the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and \nSexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's Office, and the Vermont \nDepartment of Social and Rehabilitation Services to increase community \nawareness, to develop cooperative relationships between state child \nprotection agencies and domestic violence programs, to expand existing \nmulti disciplinary task forces to include allied\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nprofessional groups, and to create local multi-use supervised \nvisitation centers.\n  This bill will also reauthorize the National Stalker and Domestic \nViolence Reduction Grant. This important grant program assists in the \nimprovement of local, state and national crime databases for tracking \nstalking and domestic violence.\n  As we work to prevent violence against women, we must not forget \nthose who have already fallen victim to it. This bill recognizes that \ncombating violence against women includes assistance measures as well \nas preventive ones, providing assistance to victims of domestic and \nsexual violence in a number of ways.\n  The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has already assisted \nover 180,000 callers, will be able to continue its crucial operation. \nMuch like the state hotline that the Vermont Network Against Domestic \nViolence and Sexual Assault helped to establish in Vermont, the \nNational Hotline reaches victims who otherwise have nowhere to turn.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that VAWA II will also authorize a \nnew grant program for civil legal assistance. In the past, funding for \nlegal services for victims of domestic violence was dependent on a set-\naside in the STOP grant appropriation. This separate grant \nauthorization will allow victims of violence, stalking and sexual \nassault, who would otherwise be unable to afford professional legal \nrepresentation, to obtain access to trained attorneys and advocacy \nservices. These grants would support training, technical assistance and \nsupport for cooperative efforts between victim advocacy groups and \nlegal assistance providers.\n  As enacted, the Violence Against Women Act has funded programs that \nprovide shelter to battered women and children. I am pleased to see \nthat VAWA II expands this funding, so that facilities such as the Women \nHelping Battered Women Shelter in Burlington, Vermont, will continue to \nbe able to serve victims in their most vulnerable time in need of \nshelter.\n  In addition to this funding, I am excited to see the addition of a \nprovision for transitional housing assistance in VAWA II. This grant \nfor short-term housing assistance and support services for homeless \nfamilies who have fled from domestic violence environments was one of \nthe biggest priorities for my State and I am pleased to see its \ninclusion in this legislation.\n  Despite the overwhelming benefits of this legislation, I do think \nthere are some problems with this bill and it is my hope that we can \nwork to fix them. For example, this legislation does not go far enough \nin providing the comprehensive housing assistance that state and \nvictim's coalitions need in combating this problem. In Vermont, the \navailability of affordable housing is at an all time low. Providing \nvictims of domestic violence with a safe place to reside after a \nterrifying experience should be a priority. I would like to see \nadditional support for groups that addresses the need for funding for \nunderserved populations. I had proposed a more extensive program of \ntransitional housing assistance than we were able to keep in the bill. \nIt is my hope that we can continue to work to expand these transitional \nliving opportunities in the coming weeks as Congress takes up this \nbill.\n  Another area of concern that I wish to see addressed in this bill is \nthe absence of a redefinition of ``domestic violence'' to include \n``dating relationships'' in its provisions and grants. As written, VAWA \nII amends the definition of ``domestic violence'' for grants to reduce \nviolence against women on campus to include dating relationships. I \nwould like to see this definition amended to include all women. The \nBureau of Justice Statistics report indicates that more than four in \nevery 10 incidents of domestic violence involves non-married persons, \nand further, that the highest rate of domestic violence occurs among \nyoung people aged 16-24. Yet, VAWA, as currently enacted, does not \nauthorize prosecution of their offenders. We cannot ignore this \nincreasingly at risk segment of the population.\n  I was also pleased to see a new provision in VAWA II that would \nenhance protections for older women from domestic violence and sexual \nassault. Last year I introduced the Seniors Safety Act which would \nenhance penalties for crimes against seniors. This provision in VAWA II \nis an important complement to that legislation and I am glad to see we \nhave been able to generate wide support.\n  The bill is also designed to help young victims of crime through \nfunding for the establishment of safe and supervised visitation centers \nfor children in order to reduce the opportunity for domestic violence. \nGrants will also be extended to continue funding agencies serving \nhomeless youth who have been or who are at risk of abuse and to \ncontinue funding for victims of child abuse, including money for \nadvocates, training for judicial personnel and televised testimony.\n  Many of the most successful services for victims start at the local \nlevel, such as Vermont's model hotline on domestic violence and sexual \nassault. The Violence Against Women Act II recognizes these local \nsuccesses and continues grant funding of community demonstration \nprojects for the intervention and prevention of domestic violence.\n  When VAWA passed Congress, it was one of the first comprehensive \nFederal efforts to combat violence against women and to assist the \nvictims of such violence. Today's bill gives us an opportunity to \ncontinue funding these successful programs, to improve victim services, \nand to strengthen these laws so that violence against women is \neliminated. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation \nand hope we can work together to ensure the swift passage of the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2000.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today as an original \ncosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join with us in this effort to ensure the safety and \nprotection of women and families.\n  The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has been crucial in reducing \nviolence perpetrated against women and families across America. VAWA \n'94 increased resources for training and law enforcement, and bolstered \nprosecution of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence \ncases. States have changed the way they treat crimes of violence \nagainst women; 24 states and the District of Columbia now mandate \narrest for most domestic violence offenses. States are lifting some of \nthe costs to women associated with violence, and as a result of VAWA, \nall have some provision for covering the cost of a forensic rape exam.\n  And notably, VAWA '94 provided much-needed support for shelters and \ncrisis centers, and created a National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n  Yet, despite the advances made as a result of the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act, violence against women remains a critical problem in \nour country. Recent studies show 307,000 incidents of rape and sexual \nassaults were perpetrated in 1998 alone. Over one million women are \nstalked annually. Violence by intimates accounts for 20% of all violent \ncrimes against women.\n  It is essential that we reauthorize VAWA now, so that we can continue \nthe initiatives that have made a difference, and so that we can further \nprotect women and children from violence.\n  VAWA 2000 combines a variety of law-enforcement initiatives with \nsupport and prevention programs, in an effort to eradicate both the \ncauses and effects of violence against women and families. The bill \nwould ensure that those who regularly interact with victims of domestic \nviolence--the courts, police, and social service providers--receive \nexcellent training in reversing the destructive effects of domestic \nviolence. As too many families are turned away in time of great need, \nVAWA 2000 offers increased funding to expand shelter services for \nfamilies escaping violence. And in addition to providing emergency \nshelter, VAWA reauthorization provides for short-term and transitional \nhousing, providing women and families real alternatives to returning to \nabusive homes.\n  Finally, VAWA '94 enabled immigrant victims of domestic violence to \ngain lawful permanent residence in the U.S. without the knowledge, \nparticipation, or cooperation of their abusive citizen or permanent \nresident spouses. Although the spirit and intent of this law was to \nfacilitate the prosecution of\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nabusers, and to allow women and children to safely escape violence and \nrebuild their lives, unintended legal barriers have prevented the full \nprotection of VAWA '94 from taking effect. VAWA 2000 cures this fault, \nand continues the spirit and work that began with the bi-partisan \npassage of VAWA '94.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that these programs be reauthorized, \nso that we may stop the cycles of violence and poverty that result from \ndomestic violence. I urge my colleagues to support VAWA 2000, and I \nlook forward to working with the members of the Judiciary Committee in \nbringing this important legislation to the floor as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 2788. A bill to establish a strategic planning team to develop a \nplan for the dissemination of research on reading; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       the reading research dissemination and implementation act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, today I am introducing a bill to \nestablish the Reading Research Dissemination and Implementation Plan, \nan initiative which follows up on the important work of the National \nReading Panel.\n  Three years ago I discovered that the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Services had completed a thorough study of factors and \nconditions that affect the learning of reading in children. Since \nreading is such a basic and necessary first step in the process of \neducation, nothing is more important to a child's educational \ndevelopment than learning to read.\n  I was honored to chair the recent hearing of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which \naccepted the National Writing Panel's report titled, ``An Evidence-\nBased Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and \nIts Implications for Reading Instruction.'' The report has been \ndistributed to Congress, universities, schools, education \nadministrators, and libraries. At the hearing, Dr. Donald Langenberg, \nChairman of the panel, stated, ``There is a recent report entitled \nTeaching Reading Is Rocket Science. . . . that is a gross \nunderstatement.''\n  It is time to ensure that the panel's findings are disseminated in a \nmanner that will result in the implementation of the best practices for \nthe effective teaching of reading.\n  This bill directs the National Reading Panel, the National Institute \nfor Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education \nto devise a strategic plan to include the findings in teacher \npreparation course work, professional development for current teachers, \ntextbooks, and other instructional materials. The legislation further \ninstructs that the plan be submitted to the Secretary of Education by \nDecember 31, 2000, and that the Secretary immediately take actions to \nimplement it.\n  The research report, ``Relations Between Policy and Practice: A \nCommentary,'' written in 1990 by D. K. Cohen and D. L. Ball states, \n``It costs state legislators and bureaucrats relatively little to \nfashion a new instructional policy. If instructional changes are to be \nmade, [teachers] must make them. Teachers construct their practices \ngradually. Teaching is . . . a way of knowing, of seeing, and of \nbeing.''\n  Over the last several years, reading assessments have continued to \nshow that nearly half of our nation's fourth graders do not read at \ngrade level. Research and study on literacy over the last few decades \nhas shown that children who have difficulty reading are more likely to \nsuffer poor self esteem, fail to achieve in other subjects, become \ntrouble makers in school and eventually criminals in jail. The research \nalso shows that once a child is nine years old, remediation becomes \nmore difficult. We need to move quickly to take advantage of what is \nknown to predict and prevent reading difficulties, help those children \nwho are having difficulty, and begin teaching for successful reading \ninstruction.\n  We know that successfully mastering reading at an early age makes \nsuccess in life more likely. It is my purpose and hope in introducing \nthis legislation that the classrooms of today's preschoolers, \nkindergartners, and early grades will begin to benefit from the \nintelligence we have about how our brains connect and decode the \ncomplicated processes needed for reading.\n  This legislation will engage researchers, policy makers, teachers and \nparents in a focused mission. A mission to ensure that children acquire \nthe most essential skill for future success: reading. I invite other \nSenators to join me in supporting this important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2788\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. READING RESEARCH DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION \n                   PLAN.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Reading Research Dissemination and Implementation Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Reading Panel was convened to assess the \n     status of research-based knowledge in the area of reading \n     development and instruction and to evaluate the effectiveness \n     of various approaches to teaching children to learn to read.\n       (2) On April 13, 2000, the National Reading Panel issued \n     its report, ``Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based \n     Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading \n     and its Implications for Reading Instruction''.\n       (3) The National Reading Panel was to assess the extent to \n     which instructional approaches found to be effective are \n     ready for application in the classroom, and to develop a \n     strategy for rapidly disseminating the information on those \n     approaches to schools to facilitate effective reading \n     instruction in the schools.\n       (4) The National Reading Panel has completed its assessment \n     of the objective research-based knowledge in the area of \n     reading development and reading instruction and has \n     identified several instructional strategies that have been \n     clearly documented by research to be effective for teaching \n     the range of reading skills to children of varying reading \n     abilities.\n       (5) The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development has developed an initial dissemination strategy \n     to provide all Members of Congress, all colleges of \n     education, all State departments of education, and all public \n     libraries in the Nation with copies of the National Reading \n     Panel's report.\n       (6) A dissemination of findings, although helpful, does not \n     typically lead to systematic and genuine implementation of \n     the critical research findings that inform teacher \n     preparation practices, classroom instructional practices, and \n     educational policies.\n       (7) To ensure that research findings on effective reading \n     instructional approaches are fully implemented for the \n     improvement of the education of our Nation's children, a \n     strategic plan for the dissemination and implementation of \n     the findings is necessary.\n       (c) Establishment of Strategic Planning Team.--The \n     Assistant Secretary of Education for Educational Research and \n     Improvement and the Director of the National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services shall jointly convene a strategic \n     planning team to develop the plan required under subsection \n     (d). The team shall be composed of the following:\n       (1) The Chairman of the National Reading Panel.\n       (2) Persons jointly appointed by the convening officials \n     from among persons who are representative of each of the \n     following:\n       (A) The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development.\n       (B) The Department of Education.\n       (C) Teacher professional organizations.\n       (D) Parents.\n       (E) Presidents of institutions of higher education.\n       (F) The teacher education colleges or departments within \n     institutions of higher education.\n       (G) Private businesses.\n       (H) Public libraries.\n       (I) State boards of education.\n       (J) State directors of special education.\n       (K) The Governors of States.\n       (L) Publishers of reading textbooks.\n       (d) Plan.--The Strategic Planning Team shall develop and, \n     not later than December 31, 2000, submit to the Secretary of \n     Education a plan--\n       (1) to determine--\n       (A) the extent to which current teacher preparation for \n     both preservice and inservice training incorporates the \n     findings of the National Reading Panel; and\n       (B) how any barriers to the incorporation of those findings \n     can be changed in order to integrate the findings into \n     programs to educate and certify teachers;\n       (2) to identify the deficiencies in instructional \n     materials, including textbooks and supplementary materials, \n     and to determine how materials might be designed to correct \n     the deficiencies in ways that reflect the findings of the \n     National Reading Panel;\n       (3) to determine whether there are any barriers in Federal \n     and State policies that\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\n     would preclude appropriate adoption of the National Reading \n     Panel findings; and\n       (4) to identify specific strategies for collaboration among \n     businesses, public schools, teacher education programs, \n     university and college administrators, and teacher-parent \n     collaborations to guide and ensure that evidence-based \n     instructional practices are implemented in teacher \n     preparation, classroom instruction, and Federal and State \n     policies.\n       (e) Implementation of Plan.--Upon receiving the plan under \n     subsection (d), the Secretary of Education shall immediately \n     take the actions necessary to implement the plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 2789. A bill to amend the Congressional Award Act to establish a \nCongressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Board; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION FOR EXCELLENCE IN ARTS EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich would establish the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in \nArts Education awards to schools.\n  The 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress Arts Report Card \nwas the first ever assessment of the effects of specific arts \ninstruction and the level of fine arts skills in American students. It \nshowed that arts instruction improved competency and literacy; and \nwithout it, very few students were able to create or perform at an \nadvanced or adequate level. The evidence of the positive effects of \narts education on overall scholastic achievement is an incentive for \nstudents, parents and schools to insist upon arts courses being a part \nof every school's curriculum.\n  In 1997, The College Board reported that high school students with \nfour or more years of arts instruction scored over 100 points higher on \nthe Scholastic Aptitude Test than students with no arts instruction. In \na 1999 report titled, ``Gaining the Arts Advantage: Lessons From School \nDistricts that Value Arts Education'' it was said that, ``the presence \nand quality of arts education in public schools today require an \nexceptional degree of involvement by influential segments of the \ncommunity which value the arts in the total affairs of the school \ndistrict: in governance, funding, and program delivery.''\n  It is clear from these and other studies that students who have the \nopportunity to be involved in music, art, theater and dance instruction \nat school, truly have an advantage. As part of the effort to improve \neducation, we need to encourage arts education in our schools. One way \nto do that, I think, is to recognize those schools that are offering \nthis advantage.\n  Therefore, the legislation I am introducing would create a \nCongressional board and a citizens' advisory board which will establish \nan award for schools demonstrating excellence in arts education \ncurriculum. The legislation also encourages the boards to establish \nindividual student awards in the future.\n  This bill sends a clear message of support and appreciation to those \nteachers in our schools who dedicate their lives to the teaching of \nmusic, art, theater and dance; and to those school administrators who \nsupport comprehensive arts programs. I invite other Senators to join me \nin cosponsoring this bill. I look forward to its consideration and \nadoption by the Senate in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION FOR EXCELLENCE IN ARTS \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Congressional Award Act (2 U.S.C. 801-\n     808) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n ``TITLE II--CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION FOR EXCELLENCE IN ARTS EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 201.

A bill instituting a Federal fuels tax holiday; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                the federal fuel tax relief act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I was in the city of Chicago to \nannounce the introduction of a bill today called the Federal Fuel Tax \nRelief Act of 2000. I was standing in Chicago on La Salle Street, in \nwhat is known as the Loop, the premier business district in downtown \nChicago. I was at a gas station there. Behind me you could see the \nprices at the pump that that particular gas station in Chicago was \nadvertising. Those gas prices were well over $2 a gallon. In fact, I \nthink the price for the\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\npremium blend of fuel was up over $2.30 a gallon.\n  Right now, we are in the midst of a very serious crisis in my part of \nthe country with respect to gas prices. Prices throughout Illinois are \nat record highs. They are at record highs in Michigan, in Ohio, in \nother parts of the Midwest.\n  I am afraid if we do not bring down the cost of gas at the pumps, we \nare going to be seeing shock waves throughout our entire Nation's \neconomy. The bill I am introducing today is S. 2790. What it would do \nis bring immediate relief by lowering the cost of gas nationwide for 90 \ndays by temporarily rolling back the 18.3-cent-per-gallon Federal gas \ntax.\n  In the last couple of weeks, anybody who has been following the news \nanywhere in this country has seen nothing but nonstop coverage about \nthe escalating price, the rising price of gasoline. The response at the \nState level and at the Federal level, amongst public officials, has \nbeen to find somebody to blame. Is it the OPEC nations? Is it the oil \nindustry? Is it the administration? But no one is taking any action to \nactually bring down prices. We can argue about culpability later. What \nwe need to do now is to lower prices at the pump or we are going to see \nlosses of jobs and losses of economic productivity.\n  We will see senior citizens who cannot even afford to drive to the \npharmacy to buy the pharmaceuticals, for which they already are having \na hard time paying. We are going to see college students who cannot \nafford to make the commute to their community colleges. We need to have \na long-term plan to increase productivity of oil in this country to \nlessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil. There are a number of \nmeasures that have been introduced in recent weeks in the Congress. The \nadministration last week sent over recommendations on what our long-\nterm solution should be for this energy crunch.\n  But in the meantime, there are countless families all across the \ncountry that may have to cancel summer vacations, families that have \nworked hard all year, but now all of a sudden, when it comes time for \nthem to have a couple of weeks off to take their families on a \nvacation, they can't afford the cost of the vacation because the price \nof gasoline has gone up so much.\n  There will be many who will criticize my proposal. There will be many \nwho come up with arguments against it. Certainly many will bring up the \npoint that the proceeds from the motor fuels tax goes into our Federal \nhighway trust fund. This legislation would hold harmless the highway \ntrust fund. It would require the Federal Government to make up any loss \nto the highway trust fund by taking money from the on-budget or non-\nSocial Security surplus and indemnify that road fund. We all want to \nmake sure we continue to improve and repair our roads in this country.\n  But the fact remains, the only instrument that the Federal and State \ngovernments have to directly affect the price of gasoline at the pump \nis to lower the motor fuels tax. My State, I hope, is going to do its \npart. A couple of weeks back, I pointed out that Illinois has amongst \nthe highest gas taxes in the country. In fact, in addition to a motor \nfuel tax that is 19 cents a gallon, the State of Illinois has a sales \ntax on motor fuel that is assessed on top of the Federal motor fuels \ntax. In other words, Illinois has what we would call a tax on a tax. \nThat sales tax on gasoline in Illinois is a percentage tax, so, as the \nselling price of gasoline has gone from $1 to over $2 in Illinois, the \nState's take on its sales tax has been increasing dramatically. It has \ndoubled its take under that sales tax.\n\n  The Governor of Illinois and legislative leaders recently called a \nspecial session of our Illinois General Assembly, which will be \nconvening in 2 days, to temporarily roll back or repeal that Illinois \nsales tax on gasoline. If they enact that legislation, that should take \n10 cents off the price of every gallon of gas sold in Illinois. But the \nprices will still be too high. We need further relief. My State is not \nthe only State that is suffering. States across the country, and \nparticularly in the hard-hit Midwest, need relief.\n  Like you, Mr. President, and my other colleagues in the Senate, all \nof us are in virtually constant contact with our constituents. We have \nan endless stream of letters, of faxes, of e-mails, of calls to our \noffices on a daily basis. We travel up and down our States. We march in \nparades. We are constantly talking to the constituents, whether it is \nin the grocery store, as I was doing over the weekend, or in parades \nthat I was in recently. The No. 1 single issue that I have been hearing \nabout is we have to do something to bring down prices at the pump.\n  Let me share a few of the letters my office has received on this \nissue. I am going to try to just go through a few of them because we \nhave gotten literally thousands. I think, to some of the people in \nWashington, the pain people are feeling out in the Midwest and around \nthe country about the rising cost of gas sounds like some kind of \ntheoretical abstraction. But I have to tell you, for real people who \nare trying to drive to work, who may have a long way to drive to work \nor get to school, or senior citizens on fixed incomes, or folks in \nlower income brackets--they are having a very tough time. I have had \nmany people tell me they have canceled weekend vacations and they are \nplanning to cancel summer vacations.\n  Let me read parts of a few of these letters. This one is from a \nresident of Springfield, IL, who is a part-time driver for a senior \nservices van service that runs vans for senior citizens to and from a \nsenior citizens center. He says that the escalating gas prices are \nreally hurting the transportation budget at the center. If we have to \nshut down the van service, it would be a tremendous loss for the \nseniors.\n  This one from a senior citizen in southern Illinois says that now we \ncannot afford to drive to the pharmacy to purchase the drugs that we \nalready cannot afford.\n  A person from Rantoul, IL, says that gas prices in Illinois are too \nhigh. It costs me more than $87 a week to drive to and from work now \nthat the prices have skyrocketed. I cannot afford this for much longer.\n  A small business owner in the Chicago suburbs--small businesses are \nsuffering. He says: I have had small business men and women in my \noffice saying they have lost money for several months in a row and \ncould have to shut down if this keeps up. The current fuel prices are \nkilling my small business.\n  I am a small business owner who employs 20 people from McHenry County \nand 10 people from Lake County. This increase in fuel is killing my \nprofit line. If this does not stop, I do not know how much longer we \ncan survive.\n\n  This is an interesting letter from a community college administrator \nin central Illinois. This person pointed out that, unlike many \ncolleges, his school is a commuter college and students drive anywhere \nfrom 20 to 60 miles. That is 40 to 120 miles round trip to attend \ncollege. Most of the students are trying to better themselves by \nworking part time and going to school. Now with gasoline prices \nsoaring, they are being forced to drop out.\n  This individual from Danville, IL, after a lengthy letter explaining \nhow, for his job, he had to drive, at the end he said if the prices \nraise much higher, he will have to dip into his son's and daughter's \neducation fund just so he can keep driving back and forth to work.\n  I have another letter from a community college student. He is from \nSherman, IL. He describes in his letter how he turned down State full-\ntime universities because of the cost and because he wanted to attend \nhis community college. It would be more affordable.\n  Now that he has started at his community college and is having to dig \ndeep into his pocket just to pay for the price of gas to get to and \nfrom college, he is getting squeezed. He has a 30-mile distance to go \njust to get to his school. He said: Just to let you know, I am not a \nfreeloader. I am currently holding down three jobs and working through \nthe summer. I do not expect you to work a miracle, but maybe submit \nsome form of legislation that would reduce the price or give a break to \nstudents furthering their education.\n  A husband from western Illinois has to commute 100 miles a day to \nwork. That is how it is in rural parts of the country, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows in his largely rural State. The wife has to drive 55 \nmiles to work, and then the kids have to go 15 miles for their various \nathletic events and the like.\n  He says: We are probably more fortunate than most people, but if this\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nkeeps up, it will be hard to commute into work every day, and there is \nno public transportation or opportunity to car pool in our downstate \nIllinois region. We barely have highways.\n  Finally, another letter from a retired senior citizen on fixed income \nsaid: It is extremely hard to get along with gasoline prices so high. I \nhave curtailed driving to a bare minimum, only to the doctor, shopping, \nchurch, and as a volunteer to a community radio station where I \nbroadcast a show every Saturday.\n  I think we need to take action. It is time for Washington and \nCongress to stop playing the blame game. We can argue about who is \nculpable later. I support the Federal Trade Commission investigation. \nWe need to find out if anybody has been colluding in the oil industry \nor anywhere else to fix prices, and if they have been, they ought to go \nto jail for a very long time.\n  That investigation is going to take a while. It is going to take a \nwhile to put pressure on OPEC nations to loosen the taps and to \nincrease production. It is going to take a while until we get \nincentives in the system for the small oil well drillers in the United \nStates to boost their production.\n  Once that is boosted, we could be getting as many as 500,000 more \nbarrels of oil a day. We probably have to take a look at what kind of \ntax laws we have to give people incentives to keep drilling even when \nthe price of oil is low, but we need to give people relief now.\n  It is a compassionate move. It makes sense. Our country, the most \nprosperous country in the world, can afford to give some relief to \ntaxpayers and consumers, and if we do not give that relief, we will \nprobably pay for it later because there is going to be a slowdown in \neconomic activity. It may start in the Midwest, but it is eventually \ngoing to send shock waves all across the country, and this country \ncould go into a long slump because of it.\n  I hope to get many Senators and Members of this body as cosponsors of \nthis legislation. We had a test vote earlier in the year, in April, on \ntemporarily lowering the Federal gas tax. At that time, the measure \nreceived only 43 votes. It needed over 50 to pass. That was 2 months \nago, and in the intervening time, oil prices have continued to \nskyrocket. The price which was only theoretical 2 months ago is now \nreal. It is upon us. We need to take action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Under this Treaty, \nthe Parties also agree to customary international law standards for \nexpropriation. The Treaty includes detailed provisions regarding the \ncomputation and payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation \nfor expropriation; free transfer of funds related to investments; \nfreedom of investments from specified performance requirements; fair, \nequitable, and most-favored-nation treatment; and the investor's \nfreedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through \ninternational arbitration.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, \nand give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty, with \nAnnex and Protocol, at an early date.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I commend my friend from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, and also Senator Frist, for the introduction of the \namendment. I welcome the opportunity to join with them in the hope that \nthe Senate will accept that amendment because this amendment is focused \non one of the very significant and important public health challenges \nthat we face as a Nation, and that is antimicrobial resistance.\n  Microbes resistant to antibiotics are a major health threat. The \nWorld Health Organization reports that antibiotic-resistant infections \nacquired in hospitals kill over 14,000 people in the United States \nevery year--that's almost two persons every hour, every day, every \nyear. Unless we take action, drug-resistant infectious diseases will \nbecome even more widespread in the United States and kill even larger \nnumbers of patients.\n  Infections resistant to antibiotics are extremely expensive to treat. \nIt is a hundred times more expensive to treat a patient with drug-\nresistant TB than to treat a patient with drug-sensitive TB. The \nNational Foundation for Infectious Diseases has estimated that the \ntotal cost of drug-resistant infections in this country is $4 billion a \nyear--and this cost will rise as resistant microbes become more common.\n  The amendment takes an important step to address this health crisis \nby giving the nation more tools to win the battle against antimicrobial \nresistance.\n  Overuse of existing antibiotics contributes heavily to the problem of \nantimicrobial resistance. Patients often demand antibiotics and doctors \noften prescribe them for conditions in which they are clearly \nineffective. We need to educate patients and medical professionals in \nthe more appropriate use of antibiotics.\n  The nation's public health agencies are under-equipped to monitor and \ncombat resistant infections. Many public health agencies lack even such \nbasic equipment as a fax machine, and cannot even conduct simple \nlaboratory tests to diagnose resistant infections. We need to \nstrengthen the capacity of public health agencies to diagnose, monitor, \nand deal effectively with outbreaks of resistant infections.\n  Many patients acquire resistant infections in hospitals. Children, \nthe elderly and persons with reduced immune systems are particularly at \nrisk. We can do more to prevent the spread of resistant infections by \nstrengthening infectious disease control programs in hospitals and \nclinics.\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\n  We are in a race against time to find new antibiotics before microbes \nbecome resistant to those already in use. We need to increase research \non how microbes become resistant to antibiotics and on new ways to \nfight resistant infections. If we slow the rate at which existing \nantibiotics are losing their effectiveness and accelerate the pace of \ndiscovery, we can win the race against antimicrobial resistance.\n  The measures we take against microbes resistant to antibiotics will \nalso allow the nation to respond more effectively to terrorist attacks \nusing biological weapons. America is a nation at risk from \nbioterrorism. A deadly disease plague released into a crowded airport, \nshopping mall or sports stadium could kill thousands. A contagious \ndisease like smallpox released in an American city could kill millions.\n  To fight such attacks effectively, we must strengthen the nation's \nability to recognize, diagnose and contain outbreaks of infectious \ndisease. The additional funds that the Cochran-Frist-Kennedy amendment \nprovides to state and local public health agencies will improve their \nability to combat any disease outbreak, whether caused by microbes \nresistant to antibiotics, new diseases like West Nile fever, or \ndeliberate attacks using biological weapons.\n  The need is urgent to begin to arm ourselves for the fight against \ninfectious disease, bioterrorism, and microbes resistant to \nantibiotics. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5818-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5818-S5821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SPENDING AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to be addressing \nthe Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. In that legislation, we \nwill have allocations of resources to fund the Federal participation in \neducation. The federal government provides only 7 cents out of every \ndollar spent on education at the local level. But those are important \nfunds for many different communities.\n  I regret very much that we are taking up this appropriations bill for \neducation, before we have completed action on the authorizing bill, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. It seems to me that we are \nputting the cart before the horse. We should have had a good debate and \nresolved the issues on education policy before funding them. Instead, \nwe are now addressing appropriations before we even have the \nauthorizations in hand. There are important policy issues and questions \nthat ought to be resolved.\n  At the outset, I thank our friends on the Appropriations Committee \nfor the resources they provided in a number of different programs. But \nI believe some programs were underfunded in the allocation of \nresources.\n  The budget is established by the majority. In this case, it was \ndecided by the Republican majority. The Republican Budget Resolution \nshortchanged education programs in order to pay for unwise tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. In the Resolution, the Republican majority imposed cuts of \nmore than 6%--more than $100 billion over the next five years--in \ndiscretionary spending, including education programs.\n  As a result of this resolution, the allocation for education is too \nlow. Because of that inadequate allocation, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee was forced to make unwise cuts in key education and other \ndiscretionary programs. This $100 billion in order to afford a tax cut \nfor wealthy individuals is the wrong priority.\n  That is what a good deal of the debate is going to be about--about \nwhether we think we ought to have further tax cuts for wealthy \nindividuals or whether we ought to invest in the education of the \nchildren of this country. I believe we ought to invest in the children \nof this country.\n  We didn't get the kind of allocation in the Appropriations Committee \nthat we should have, and we are going to find, once this is approved, \nthat it will go to the House, which has had a very significant \nreduction in terms of allocating resources. We are going to find \nfurther cuts in education. That troubles me.\n  If you look over the past years, we will see what has happened in the \nhistory of cutting education funding in appropriations bills.\n  We have seen, going back to 1995 when the Republicans took control of \nthe Senate, that we had a rescission. We had money already \nappropriated. But then we had a rescission of $1.7 billion below what \nwas actually enacted in 1995.\n  In 1996, the House bill was $3.9 billion below 1995.\n  In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below what the President \nrequested.\n  In 1998, the House and Senate bill was $200 million below the \nPresident's request.\n  In 1999, the House bill was $2 billion below the President's request.\n  In 2000, the House bill was $2.8 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  In fiscal year 2001, it is $2.9 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  We have all of the statements being made by the Republican leadership \nabout how important education is in terms of national priorities. We \nhave our Republican Majority Leader, going back to January 1999, \nsaying, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . For \nstarters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. That is important.''\n\n  That was the bill which was set aside in May of this year. Some six \nweeks later, we still haven't had it back in order to be able to debate \nit.\n  In remarks to the Conference of Mayors, the majority leader said: \n``But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going \nto be just words. . . .''\n  June 22, 1999: ``Education is number one on the agenda for \nRepublicans in the Congress this year. . .''\n  Then remarks to the Chamber of Commerce on February 1, 2000: ``We're \ngoing to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year \nI have been majority leader. . . . And Republicans are committed to \ndoing that.''\n  National Conference on State Legislatures, February 3: ``We must \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. . . . Education \nwill be a high priority.''\n  April 20, the Congress Daily: ``Lott said last week his top \npriorities in May include an agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four \nappropriations bills.''\n  May of this year: ``This is very important legislation. I hope we can \ndebate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \ntalk education.''\n  Then, on May 2, on elementary and secondary education: ``Have you \nscheduled a cloture vote on that?'' Senator Lott: ``No, I haven't \nscheduled a cloture vote. . . . But education is number one on the \nminds of the American people all across this country and every State, \nincluding my own state. For us to have a good, healthy and even a \nprotracted debate on amendments on education, I think is the way to \ngo.''\n  This is the record. We still don't have that debate. That was 6 weeks \nago. We had 6 days of debate, and 2 days of the debate were without any \nvotes at all. We had eight amendments, and three of those we were glad \nto accept.\n  We have effectively not had the debate on education. Here we are on \nMonday afternoon before the Fourth of July recess, and we have the \nappropriations bills up with a wide variety of appropriations to \nsupport the agencies in areas of health and of education. I believe we \nare giving education policy short shrift. You can't draw any other \nconclusion--short shrift.\n  We were prepared to spend 15 days on bankruptcy reform but only 6 \ndays on education--and for 2 days we couldn't vote. 15 days on \nbankruptcy and 53 amendments; 4 days where we had amendments on \nelementary and secondary education and only 8 amendments.\n  That is an indication of priorities. I take strong exception. I think \nthe American people do as well.\n  Money in and of itself doesn't solve all of our problems, but it sure \nis an indication of where our national priorities are.\n  If I look over this chart, the Federal share of education funding has \ndeclined. Look at what has happened in higher education: 15.4 percent \nin 1980 has declined to 10.7 percent in 1999. Take elementary and \nsecondary education. In 1980, it was 11.9 percent on\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\nelementary and secondary education. In 1999, it was only 7.7 percent.\n  We have seen a decline in elementary and secondary education. We \ndon't even spend 1 percent of our budget in support of elementary and \nsecondary education. That is amazing.\n  Think of any of us going into any hall across this country in any \npart of our Nation. Ask about the priorities of people in that hall. \nThey would say: We need national security, national defense. We have to \ndeal with that. Certainly we do. Save Social Security and Medicare--\nabsolutely. Deal with Medicaid--absolutely. But among their four or \nfive priorities would be education.\n  I think Americans will be absolutely startled to find out that we are \nspending less than one penny out of every dollar on elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  This is what has been happening. In the area of elementary and \nsecondary education, K through 12, we have now gone from 1990 with 46.4 \nmillion students up to 53.4 million in 2000. 7 million additional \nstudents at a time when our participation is going down in favor of tax \ncuts instead of investing in the children of this country.\n  That is what is happening. As we start off on this debate, I think it \nis important to understand that. I think most parents across this \ncountry believe there ought to be a partnership, at the local level, \nthe State level, and the Federal level in terms of participation.\n  However, we are not meeting our responsibilities. We get a lot of \nstatements, a lot of quotes, a lot of press releases, but when the time \ncomes in terms of the Budget Committee--which is controlled by that \nside of the aisle--allocating resources on education, they are not \ndoing it. They are not walking the walk. They are talking the talk, but \nthey are not walking the walk. That is one of the important issues \ndividing our political parties, unfortunately. I think the American \npeople ought to understand that.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to have several education amendments. One \nwhich I will offer will be to try to strengthen the recruitment, \ntraining, and mentoring for teachers in this country. We need 2 million \nteachers. Last year, we hired--``we,'' meaning the States across this \ncountry--50,000 teachers who did not have certification in the courses \nthey are teaching.\n  We believe we ought to guarantee to the families in this country that \nwithin 4 years every teacher in every public school will be certified. \nWe are committed to that. We are going to offer an amendment on that. \nWe think that is one of the better ways of going with education. When \nwe look at the results, better prepared teachers stay longer. The \nearlier intervention occurs for teachers, the longer they will stay. If \nwe give them continued help and assistance that is school based, they \nwill remain longer.\n  Providing professional training and mentoring for the teachers is \nenormously helpful. If we have experienced teachers working with \nyounger teachers in the classroom, they stay longer. This is enormously \nimportant. We ought to be debating and discussing these issues. \nHopefully, tomorrow, we will.\n  Amendments to be offered by our colleagues include after school \nprograms, accountability, and the digital divide. We are going to have \na series of amendments regarding helping, assisting, and modernizing \nour schools. All these amendments are for worthwhile programs.\n  We need to have this debate. We need to have this expression. We need \nto call the roll to find out where our colleagues are going to stand on \nthe issues involving education in this country.\n  We will, of course, have the opportunity to debate smaller class size \nwith the Murray amendment. We have had bipartisan support for that in \nthe past. I will not take the time tomorrow to place again in the \nRecord all of the press releases we had from Newt Gingrich and Mr. \nArmey celebrating the fact that we would go to smaller class size. We \nhad strong bipartisan support, but they have emasculated the program in \nthe appropriations legislation. We will have an opportunity, hopefully, \nto debate that, as well.\n  The bill before the Senate includes $2.7 billion for title VI block \ngrants but eliminates the Federal commitment to reducing class size and \ndoes nothing to guarantee the funds for communities to address the \nurgent need for school repair and modernization.\n  Under the Class Size Reduction Program, the funds are distributed to \nschool districts based on a formula that is targeted 80 percent by \npoverty and 20 percent by population. Under title VI, block grant \nfunding is distributed based solely on population. It includes no \nprovisions to target the funds to high poverty districts. It is \nbasically a blank check--whatever the Governor wants to do with those \nfunds--without the accountability which is so important and necessary.\n  I think people across this country want scarce resources utilized in \nan effective way, on proven, tested, effective programs that will \nenhance academic achievement and accomplishment. That is provided in \nthe amendments we are going to offer tomorrow.\n  Better schools, a better education for all children, and making \ncollege more affordable are top priorities for the Nation's families \nand communities.\n  I regret very much that we are taking up this appropriations bill for \neducation, before we have completed action on the authorizing bill, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. In many ways, we are putting \nthe cart before the horse again.\n  We have an opportunity this year to do our part to help local \ncommunities improve their schools by strengthening the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. And, to Democrats, this is must-pass \nlegislation.\n  The Republican majority has paid great lip service to the importance \nof education, but the reality is far different. We considered only \neight amendments to that legislation over 6 days--and during 2 of these \ndays, we were allowed to debate only, not vote. On May 9, the \nRepublican leadership suddenly abandoned the debate, moved to other \nlegislation, and haven't returned to it since then.\n  I hope that our Republican friends have just temporarily suspended \nthe bill, and not expelled it. We owe it to the Nation's schools, \nstudents, parents, and communities to complete action on this priority \nlegislation.\n  The Senate education appropriations bill now before us also has \nproblems. It is a much better step towards funding education than the \nHouse bill, but it's not enough.\n  The Republican budget resolution shortchanged education programs in \norder to pay for unwise tax cuts for the wealthy. Because of the \nRepublican budget resolution, the allocation for education is too low.\n  Because of that inadequate allocation, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee was forced to make unwise cuts in key education and other \ndiscretionary programs because of the unreasonably low funding level \nset for domestic discretionary programs in the budget resolution. In \nthe resolution, the Republican majority imposed cuts of more than 6 \npercent--more than $100 billion over the next 5 years--in discretionary \nspending. These cuts are far from necessary to curb uncontrolled \nfederal spending. The opposite is true. We are already spending less on \ndomestic discretionary programs as a percentage of GNP than we ever \nhave. Republicans are seeking to impose these drastic cuts for one \nreason only--to fund the massive tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  This is not the time for cuts in education. We need to increase our \ninvestment in education to ensure a brighter future for the nation's \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, the bill approved by the House of Representatives is a \nmajor retreat from all of these priorities. It slashed funding for \neducation by $2.9 billion below the President's request.\n  The House bill zeroes out critical funding to help states turn around \nfailing schools.\n  It slashes funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers program by \n$400 million below the President's request, denying 900 communities the \nopportunity to provide 1.6 million children with after-school \nactivities to keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of \ntrouble, and to help them with their studies.\n  It eliminates the bipartisan commitment to help communities across \nthe country reduce class size in the early grades.\n  It cuts funding for title I by $166 million below the President's \nrequest, reducing or eliminating services to\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\n260,000 educationally disadvantaged children to help them master the \nbasics and meet high standards of achievement.\n  It reduces funding for the Reading Excellence Act by $26 million \nbelow the President's request, denying services to help 100,000 \nchildren become successful readers by the end of the 3rd grade.\n  It slashes funding for safe and drug free schools by $51 million \nbelow the President's request, denying communities extra help to keep \ntheir students safe, healthy, and drug-free.\n  It does nothing to help communities meet their most urgent repair and \nmodernization needs. Those needs are especially urgent in 5,000 schools \nacross the country.\n  It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $125 million below the President's \nrequest, denying more than 644,000 low-income middle and high school \nstudents the support they need for early college preparation and \nawareness activities.\n  It does nothing to increase funding for the teacher quality \nenhancement grants, so that more communities can recruit and train \nbetter qualified teachers.\n  It slashes funding for Head Start by $600 million below \nthe President's budget, denying 50,000 low-income children critical \npreschool services.\n\n  It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the \nPresident's request, denying over 100,000 dislocated workers much-\nneeded training, job search, and re-employment services.\n  It reduces funding for adult job training by $93 million below the \nPresident's request, denying 37,200 adults job training this year.\n  It cuts youth opportunities grants by $200 million below the \nPresident's request, eliminating the proposed expansion to 20 new \ncommunities, reducing the current program by $75 million, and denying \n40,000 disadvantaged youth a bridge to skills and opportunities of our \nstrong economy and alternatives to welfare and crime.\n  It slashed summers jobs and year-round youth training by $21 million \nbelow the President's request, reducing the estimated number of low-\nincome youth to be served over 12,000.\n  The Senate bill does take some positive steps towards better funding \nfor education.\n  It increases the maximum Pell grant by $350 to $3,650.\n  It increases funding for IDEA by $1.3 billion.\n  Although these are important increases, they are not enough. In too \nmany other vital aspects of education, too many children and too many \nfamilies are shortchanged by this bill.\n  Once again, the Republican leadership has put block grants ahead of \ntargeted funding for education reforms. Block grants are the wrong \napproach. They prevent the allocation of scarce resources to the \nhighest education priorities. They eliminate critical accountability \nprovisions that ensure better results for all children. The block grant \napproach abandons the national commitment to improve education by \nencouraging proven effective reforms of public schools.\n  Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong \ndirection for the nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public \nschools.\n  The bill includes $2.7 billion more for the title VI block grant, but \nit eliminates the federal commitment to reducing class size. It does \nnothing to guarantee funds for communities to address their urgent \nschool repair and modernization needs.\n  It is unconscionable to block grant critical funds that are targeted \nto the neediest communities to reduce class size. Under the Class Size \nReduction program that has received bipartisan support for the past two \nyears, funds are distributed based on a formula that is targeted to \nschool districts 80 percent by poverty and 20 percent by population. \nBut under the title VI block grant, funding is distributed based solely \non population--it includes no provisions to target the funds to high \npoverty districts. This is unacceptable, when it is often the neediest \nstudents that are in the largest classes.\n  The national class size average is just over 22 students per class. \nBut, in many communities--especially in urban and rural communities--\nclass sizes are much higher than the national average.\n  In 1998, the publication Education Week found that half of the \nelementary teachers in urban areas and 44 percent of the teachers in \nnonurban areas had classes with 25 or more students.\n  A 1999 study found that 56 percent of the students in Portland, OR, \nin grades K through 3 were in classes with more than 25 students.\n  In fact, nationwide, K through 3 classrooms with 18 or fewer children \nare hard to find. For example, in 22 northern and northeastern counties \nin Kentucky, and in 5 districts in Mercer County, New Jersey, less than \n15 percent of the children are in classes of 18 or less. Class size in \nNew York City is an average of 28 students per class.\n  The federal Class Size Reduction program is making a difference. For \nexample, in Columbus Ohio, class sizes in grades 1 through 3 have been \nreduced from 25 students per class to 15 students per class.\n  We need to invest more in this program, so that communities can \ncontinue to reduce class sizes. We should not block grant the program. \nIf we do, it will no longer be targeted to the neediest communities, \nand parents will no longer be guaranteed that their children will be \nlearning in smaller classes.\n  In addition, it is wrong to put the $1.3 billion that the President \nrequested for repairing and modernizing schools into the title VI block \ngrant. We need to target school modernization funds to the neediest \ncommunities, and the title VI block grant will not do that. Parents \nneed a guarantee that they will get the support they need to help their \nchildren to school in buildings that are modern and safe, and are not \novercrowded.\n  The bill also falls short in other areas.\n  It fails to increase the national investment in improving teacher  \nquality. It provides only level funding for the teacher quality \nenhancement grants that are helping colleges and communities recruit \nand train prospective teachers more effectively\n\n  It cuts funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers by \n$400 million below the President's request, denying 1.6 million \nchildren access to after-school programs.\n  It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $100 million below the President's \nrequest. That reduction will deny 407,000 low-income middle and high \nschool students the help they need to go to college and succeed in \ncollege.\n  It slashes the title I Accountability program by $250 million below \nthe President's request, eliminating critical funding for states to \nturn around failing schools.\n  It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the \nPresident's request. As a result, 100,000 American workers who lost \ntheir jobs because of down-sizing or business relocation will go \nwithout the important services that they need to find adequate \nemployment in their communities.\n  It also slashes funding for youth opportunity grants by $125 million \nbelow the President's request, denying 27,000 youth in high-poverty \ncommunities access to vital education, training, and employment \nassistance, and eliminating the proposed expansion of the program to up \nto 15 new communities.\n  We should be doing more, not less, to improve public schools, to help \nmake college affordable and accessible to every qualified student, and \nto increase training opportunities for the Nation's workers.\n  School and communities are already stretching their budgets to meet \nrising needs.\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. \nFourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are \nlearning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least \none unsatisfactory environmental condition.\n  The problems with crumbling school buildings aren't just the problems \nof the inner city. They exist in almost every community--urban, rural, \nand suburban.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, many \ncommunities need to build new schools, in order to keep pace with \nrising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary \nschool enrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 \nmillion students. Enrollment will continue to rise over\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\nthe next ten years. The number will increase by 324,000 in 2000, by \n282,000 in 2001, and by 250,000 in 2002--and it will continue on an \nupward trend in each of the following years.\n  To meet this urgent need, the Nation faces the challenge of hiring \nmore than 2 million new teachers over the next ten years. According to \nthe Urban Teacher Challenge Report, released by Recruiting New Teachers \nlast January, almost 100 percent of the 40 urban school districts \nsurveyed have an urgent need for teachers in at least one subject area. \nNinety-five percent of urban districts report a critical need for math \nteachers. Ninety-eight percent report a need in science. Ninety-seven \npercent report a need for special education teachers.\n  Unfortunately, the need for new teachers in 1998 was met by admitting \n50,000 unqualified teachers to the classroom. And nearly 50 percent of \nthose who do enter teaching, leave the profession within 5 years.\n  Parents, schools, and communities also need special help in providing \nafter-school activities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as \n8 or 9 years old, are left home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent \ncrime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. We know that \nchildren left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-\nsocial activities and destructive patterns of behavior.\n  The Nation's schools need more help to meet all of these challenges.\n  In addition, many families across the Nation are struggling to put \ntheir children through college. The burden of education debt is rising. \nEight million seven hundred thousand students borrowed $32 billion in \n1999 alone.\n  Only 53 percent of students with a family income below $25,000 go on \nto higher education, and only 26 percent--1 in 4--go on to 4-year \ncolleges. But 90 percent of students with family income above $74,000 \nattend college. The opportunity for a college education should not be \ndetermined by the level of family income. Any student who has the \nability, who works hard, and who wants to attend college should have \nthe opportunity to do so.\n  We need to do more to fund programs such as GEAR UP that help make \ncollege a reality for more young people.\n  We also need to do more to help American workers who have lost their \njobs because of down-sizing or business relocation to find other good \njobs in their communities. Companies are doing more hiring and firing \nsimultaneously than ever before. Workers need a new set of skills,  and \nglobalization is driving more work abroad. Greater services for \ndislocated workers will guarantee that workers have the skills they \nneed as we move full speed into the information-based economy. It will \nalso help us respond to employer needs during the current labor \nshortage by having an efficient labor exchange system and retraining \nprograms.\n\n  We must also do more to emphasize keeping young people in school, \nincreasing their enrollment in college, and preparing and placing these \nyoung people in good jobs. Only 42 percent of dropouts participate in \nthe labor force, compared to 65 percent of those with a high school \neducation and 80 percent of those with a college degree.\n  Next week, when we have the opportunity to address education in the \npending Senate appropriations bill, Democrats will offer amendments to \naddress as many of these critical needs as possible.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to increase funding for title II of \nthe Higher Education Act, to help communities recruit and train \nprospective teachers and put a qualified teacher in every classroom. In \naddition, I will offer an amendment to increase funding for skills \ntraining programs by $792 million to ensure that the Nation's workers \nget the support they need in today's workplace.\n  Senator Murray will offer an amendment to continue the bipartisan \ncommitment we have made over the last two years to help communities \nreduce class size in the early grades.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Robb will offer an amendment to ensure \nthat communities get the help they need to meet their most urgent \nrepair and modernization problems.\n  Senator Dodd will offer an amendment to increase funding for the 21st \nCentury Learning Centers program, so that more children will have the \nopportunity to attend after-school activities.\n  Senator Bingaman will offer an amendment to help states turn around \nfailing schools.\n  Senator Reed will offer an amendment to increase funding for the GEAR \nUP program, so that more children will be able to attend college.\n  Other colleagues will offer additional amendments to increase the \nNation's investment in education.\n  The time is now to invest more in education. The Nation's children \nand families deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/26/senate-section/article/S5821-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5821-S5822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a few moments on another \nsubject, the issue of our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  A short while ago, we had an opportunity to vote on the issues on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. This was basically as a result of the fact \nthat the conference in which we are involved had reached a dead end and \nwas going nowhere. It wasn't only my assessment of that development, \nbut the conclusion of a great number of the conferees as well, not just \nthe Democrats, but also those who had supported an effective Patients' \nBill of Rights in the House of Representatives, Dr. Norwood and Dr. \nGanske. We offered an amendment on the floor, and we failed by one \nvote.\n  Now we understand the Republicans have decided that effectively they \nare not going to participate with the Democrats at all. They are \nwriting their own bill. We had indicated we were still willing to \nparticipate. We wanted to get a bill.\n  It is interesting that the 300 organizations that represent the \ndoctors, the patients, the nurses, the health delivery community, have \nall been in support of our position. They have not had a single medical \norganization that has supported the position taken by the Republican \nleadership in the Senate.\n  When we talk about bipartisanship, I think we ought to do what the \nmedical professions, the patient organizations, and common sense tell \nus to do--to listen to doctors and nurses who have had training and \nfollow their recommendations, rather than accountants for HMOs. That is \nwhat this bill is basically about.\n  In the Patients' Bill of Rights, we have outlined the various areas \nwhere we think patients need protection. We have asked those who have \nnot been supportive of our position to spell out which protections they \ndon't wish to provide for the American people. One, for example, is to \nmake sure all patients are going to be covered. That is a rather basic \nand fundamental issue. It shouldn't take a long time to debate and \ndiscuss that. The House bill provided for comprehensive coverage for \nall of the patients and holds plans accountable. That seems to be \ncommon sense. Again, that was in the bipartisan bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In the category of access for specialists, we see a situation where a \nchild has cancer; we want to make sure the child will see a pediatric \noncologist. They ought to be able to get the specialist. We certainly \nhave that opportunity for Members of the Senate. We ought to be able to \nunderstand that. We should guarantee the specialists.\n  Access to clinical trials. We are in a period of great opportunities \nfor breakthroughs in research. The only way that breakthroughs get from \nthe laboratory to the patient is through clinical trials. We ought to \nguarantee it. We don't need to study the question of clinical trials.\n  Access to OB/GYNs. That is common sense.\n  Prohibition on gag rules. We are going to take the gag off our \ndoctors who have been trained to provide the best in medicine. They \nshouldn't be gagged by accountants for HMOs.\n  Emergency room access, another area of importance.\n  These are some of the points that are guaranteed.\n  Perhaps some of these are protections that our Republican friends \ndon't want to guarantee. We wish they would state which ones. Why do we \nhave to do it behind closed doors? Why not come out here and say which \nones they don't want to guarantee, have some votes in the Senate, and \nthen get legislation passed?\n  However, we have been buried in the darkness of our offices. We ought \nto have an opportunity to have matters decided or stated. These \nprotections should be available to every American. Those Members \nrepresenting our side of the aisle are committed to that. Republicans \nand Democrats alike in the House of Representatives were in support of \nit. A third of the Republicans voted for that and a few courageous \nRepublicans in this body supported that position as well.\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\n  We should get about the business of closing this legislation down. \nEvery day it delays people are being hurt. It is wrong. We ought to get \nabout doing the people's business and pass a strong Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  To reiterate, the American people have waited more than 3 years for \nCongress to send the President a Patient's Bill of Rights that protects \nall patients and holds HMOs and other health plans accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  Every day that the conference on the Patient's Bill of Rights fails \nto produce agreement on meaningful patient protections, 60,000 more \npatients endure added pain and suffering. More than 40,000 patients \nreport a worsening of their condition as a result of health plan \nabuses.\n  By all accounts, Republicans are working amongst themselves on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They are working in the middle of the night, \nbehind closed doors, to produce a partisan bill that will surely fail \nthe test of true reform. The crocodile tears were flowing form the eyes \nof the Senate Republican leadership on June 8 when we took the \nbipartisan, House-passed Managed Care Consensus Act to the floor for \nits first Senate vote. That legislation, which passed the House with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year, is a sensible compromise \nthat extends meaningful protections to all patients and guarantees that \nhealth plans re held accountable when their abuses result in injury or \ndeath.\n  Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator Nickles on June 13. In \nthat letter, we reiterated that we remained ready to negotiate on \nserious proposals that provide a basis for achieving strong, effective \nprotections. But the assistant majority leader has not responded. The \nsilence is deafening.\n  We have been forewarned of what to expect from a partisan bill. The \nAmerican people won't stand for a sham bill, and we won't either.\n  Make no mistake. We want a bill that can be signed into law this \nyear. There is not much time left. We need to act now.\n  The Republican leadership continues to refuse to guarantee meaningful \nprotections to all Americans. They continue to delay and deny action on \nthis critical issue. This debate is about real people. It's about \nwomen, children, and families.\n  The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan \nlegislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. \nAnd the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing \nadequate progress.\n  Republican conferees steadfastly refuse to cover all Americans. Their \nflawed approach leaves out two-thirds of those with private health \ninsurance--more than 120 million Americans.\n  The Senate Republican leadership says no to farmers, truck drivers, \npolice officers, teachers, home day care providers, fire fighters, and \ncountless others who buy insurance on their own or work for state or \nlocal governments.\n  The bipartisan legislation that we support and which we voted on in \nthe Senate on June 8 covers everyone. But the Republican leadership \nsaid no.\n  The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed by \npatients across the country. Yet, the Republican leadership is adopting \nthe practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use themselves to \ndelay and deny patients the care they need.\n  It's just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed \nreforms, as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care.\n  Congress can pass bipartisan legislation that provides meaningful \nprotections for all patients and guarantees accountability when health \nplan abuse results in injury or death. The question is, will we?\n  The American people are waiting for an answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD.
