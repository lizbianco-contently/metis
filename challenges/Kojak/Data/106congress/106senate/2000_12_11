DIXON OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 387 submitted by \nSenators Lott and Daschle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the resolution \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 387) relative to the death of \n     Representative Julian C. Dixon, of California.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable public servant who has been taken from us all too quickly.\n  The sudden loss of Representative Julian Dixon has shocked and \nsaddened us all. Without a doubt, Julian served California's Thirty-\nSecond District with passion and distinction. He was a man of the \nhighest integrity and credibility and his departure is a terrible loss \nto all of us.\n  He was a gentleman in every sense of the word who was willing to work \nacross partisan lines to improve the lives of his constituents and so \nmany Americans.\n  I was privileged as a member of the Senate Appropriations to work \nwith Julian Dixon, who was a member of the House Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  In this role, Julian always put California's needs first. He helped \naid small businesses in Southern California who had been hurt by \nmilitary base closures and defense downsizing. He also was a champion \nof the Los Angeles Metro Subway and the Alameda Corridor, an \nunderground connection between the port of Los Angeles and the major \neast-west rail lines.\n  He also consistently fought to maintain our Nation's commitment to \ncivil rights and to increase the economic upward mobility of the people \nof the Thirty-Second District.\n  Julian was also a leader through his role on the Appropriations \nCommittee to secure funds to rebuild after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, \nthe 1994 Northridge earthquake, and to improve public transportation \nthroughout Los Angeles.\n  Julian Dixon served in Congress for 22 years, first being elected in \n1978. He completed his undergraduate studies at California State \nUniversity in Los Angeles and attended Southwestern\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\nSchool of Law. He served in the United States Army, practiced law in \nLos Angeles and then was elected to the California State Assembly in \n1972.\n  He was also Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and worked \ntirelessly to establish a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. here \nin our Nation's Capital.\n  In 1999, Julian became an active participant in protecting America's \nnational security through his role as ranking Democrat on the Select \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Julian Dixon was a man of principle and fairness whose grace and \nhumility will be sorely missed.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Betty and the entire Dixon \nfamily during this very difficult time.\n  Put simply, this Nation owes much to Julian Dixon and the United \nStates Congress was truly made a much better place because of his \nservice.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 387) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Dixon, late a Representative from the \n     State of California.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary communicate these resolutions \n     to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy \n     thereof to the family of the deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns or recesses today, \n     it stand adjourned or recessed as a further mark of respect \n     to the memory of the deceased Representative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11756-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate \na message from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 1508).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the Senate the following \nmessage from the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1508) entitled \n     ``An Act to provide technical and legal assistance to tribal \n     justice systems and members of Indian tribes, and for other \n     purposes'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Justice \n     Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) there is a government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are \n     responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian \n     lands;\n       (3) the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country \n     is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in \n     the United States as a whole;\n       (4) in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a \n     major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic \n     growth;\n       (5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal \n     governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the \n     health and safety and the political integrity of tribal \n     governments;\n       (6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly \n     recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate \n     forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal \n     and property rights on Native lands;\n       (7) enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to \n     those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal \n     political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;\n       (8) there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate \n     coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal \n     assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of \n     adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their \n     operation;\n       (9) tribal court membership organizations have served a \n     critical role in providing training and technical assistance \n     for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;\n       (10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially \n     through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established \n     record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian \n     people in tribal court forums, and also contribute \n     significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal \n     jurisprudence; and\n       (11) the provision of adequate technical assistance to \n     tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and \n     tribal courts is an essential element in the development of \n     strong tribal court systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) to carry out the responsibility of the United States to \n     Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes by ensuring access \n     to quality technical and legal assistance.\n       (2) To strengthen and improve the capacity of tribal court \n     systems that address civil and criminal causes of action \n     under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes.\n       (3) To strengthen tribal governments and the economies of \n     Indian tribes through the enhancement and, where appropriate, \n     development of tribal court systems for the administration of \n     justice in Indian country by providing technical and legal \n     assistance services.\n       (4) To encourage collaborative efforts between national or \n     regional membership organizations and associations whose \n     membership consists of judicial system personnel within \n     tribal justice systems; non-profit entities which provide \n     legal assistance services for Indian tribes, members of \n     Indian tribes, and/or tribal justice systems.\n       (5) To assist in the development of tribal judicial systems \n     by supplementing prior Congressional efforts such as the \n     Indian Tribal Justice Act (Public Law 103-176).\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5528, which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5528) to authorize the construction of a Wakpa \n     Sica Reconciliation Place in Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n              ancsa historic site and cemetery selections\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Campbell, and of my colleague from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye on H.R. 5528, the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act. I am pleased \nthat this measure includes several provisions that will benefit \nWisconsin tribes.\n  However, I have concerns regarding title XV of this measure, which \nreinstates applications for particular parcels of land that are now \npart of the Chugach National Forest to be conveyed to the Chugach \nAlaska Corporation, CAC, the Alaska Native Corporation for the Chugach \nRegion. The provisions included in title XV of H.R. 5528 differ from \nthose included in title II of H.R. 2547 and its companion bill in this \nbody S. 1686. These bills are in the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy \nCommittee. Would the Senator be willing to allow me to engage in \ndiscussion with the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski to clarify a few \nimportant points about this legislation?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to allow the Senator to \nclarify aspects of this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As I understand the legislation, it directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to reinstate applications for the conveyance \nof seven parcels of land, now in federal ownership as part of the \nChugach National Forest, for a determination of eligibility for \nconveyance to the CAC as historical places or cemetery sites under \nsection 14(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My colleague from Wisconsin is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Am I also correct in my understanding that five of \nthese parcels covered by these applications are currently within the \nNellie Juan-College Fjord Wilderness Study Area, WSA, designated by \nCongress in section 704 of Public Law 96-487, the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, ANILCA?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My colleague from Wisconsin is correct, and I am sure \nmy colleague shares my concern that the Secretary of Agriculture has \nnot met\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\nthe requirement of section 704 of ANILCA that he report to the \nPresident and Congress within three years his recommendation as to the \nsuitability and nonsuitability of such lands for wilderness \ndesignation. I would also note that the submission of these \napplications by the CAC pre-dated enactment of ANILCA.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Am I further correct in my understanding that one of \nthese parcels, Coghill Point, is near an area which was determined to \nbe eligible for designation as a wild and scenic river as part of the \nChugach National Forest planning process?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, my colleague from Wisconsin is correct, \nhowever, the land containing such parcel is not designated as such in \nthe draft forest plan identified by the Forest Service as the preferred \nalternative.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As the Senator knows, 43 C.F.R. Sec. 2653.5 requires \nthat regional corporations that are conveyed cemetery sites or \nhistorical places pursuant to section 14(h) of ANCSA agree to accept a \ncovenant in the conveyance that these cemetery sites or historical \nplaces will be maintained and preserved solely as cemetery sites or \nhistorical places by the regional corporation, in accordance with the \nprovisions for conveyance reservations in 43 C.F.R. Sec. 2653.11. Is it \nthe case that, if the Secretary of the Interior chooses to act \nfavorably on these conveyance applications, nothing in this act is \nintended to prevent the Secretary from complying with the covenant \nrequirements of these regulations in conveying these seven parcels of \nland to the CAC?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct. This \nlegislation is not intended to eliminate any covenant requirements.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As my colleague further knows, the conveyance \nreservations contained in 43 C.F.R. Sec. 2653.11 prohibit the grantee \nfrom authorizing any mining or mineral activity of any type, or ``any \nuse which is incompatible with or is in derogation of the values of the \narea as a cemetery or historic place'' as defined further by 36 C.F.R. \nSec. 800.9. Is it the case that nothing in this act is intended to \nprevent the United States from seeking enforcement of such \nprohibitions, as authorized under C.F.R. 2653.11?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct. This \nlegislation is not intended to prevent enforcement of such \nprohibitions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Alaska for helping me to \nclarify these issues.\n\n\n the torres-MARTINEZ DESERT CAHUILLA INDIANS CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, Senator Campbell, engage in a brief \ncolloquy regarding the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians \nSettlement Act of 2000. The purpose of this legislation is to provide \nfor the settlement of issues and claims related to the trust lands of \nthe Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians of California.\n  In June 1996, after decades of neglect and months of difficult \nnegotiations, representatives of the United States, the Torres-Martinez \nTribe, the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Coachella Valley Water \nDistrict signed a settlement agreement that resolves their conflicting \nclaims and provides for dismissal of litigation. Legislation necessary \nto ratify this settlement agreement and to authorize the Federal \nactions and appropriations necessary for its implementation was \nintroduced in 1996. However, because provisions in the legislation \ndealing with the taking of after-acquired land into trust for purposes \nof gaming proved very controversial, the legislation never passed the \nSenate. It has taken this long to get to the point where the bill is \nagain being considered by the Senate, and the bill is still \ncontroversial.\n  The basic settlement provisions involve land and cash in return for \ndismissal of all claims with regard to the Torres-Martinez Tribe. By \nfar the most controversial of the provisions in the bill are those \nauthorizing the Secretary of the Interior to take lands into trust for \nthe explicit purpose of gaming. These lands are isolated from the \nprincipal lands to be taken into trust for the tribe, and have only one \npurpose--to provide a place to build a casino. It is clear that these \nlands have been chosen, not because of their cultural or historical \nrelationship to the tribal members, but because of their proximity to \nan area of high density traffic. While Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \nIGRA, authorizes the Secretary to take lands into trust as part of a \nland settlement, it was never the intent of IGRA to allow the Federal \nland claims settlement process to be manipulated in this manner.\n  Personally, I feel that the language in H.R. 4643 is poorly drafted, \nparticularly when it comes to authorizing the taking of land into trust \nfor purposes of gaming. I think we should draft a new bill that more \nclearly respects the intent of IGRA. However, I understand the hardship \nthat further delay would cause the Torres-Martinez Tribe; and so I am \nprepared to allow H.R. 5528 to proceed as drafted. I do believe, and I \nwant to make my views clear, that the practice of settling Indian land \nclaims with off-reservation land-into-trust acquisitions for purposes \nof gaming is something that should not become common practice in \nsettling these claims.\n  Does the chairman agree that H.R. 5528 represents a unique situation, \nand the Department of Justice and the Secretary of Interior should work \nto ensure that when they are negotiating Indian land claims they should \ntry and hammer out fair settlements that fully compensate tribes for \nlegitimate losses they have suffered and that land-into-trust \nacquisitions for gaming purposes as a component of such settlements \nshould be avoided?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Nevada for expressing his thoughts and concerns with H.R. 5528, \nand I want to express my thoughts on this matter as we pass this \nlegislation.\n  I think that H.R. 5528 does present a unique situation in that the \nTorres-Martinez Tribe's lands have been inundated by the waters of the \nColorado River since the beginning of the 1900s and one that I hope is \nnot in other settlement agreements negotiated by the Department of \nJustice and presented to Congress for its consideration.\n  I understand your concerns about the precedent that would be set if \nas part of land settlements, land-into-trust acquisitions for gaming \npurposes were routinely proposed in exchange for the settlement of land \nclaims. Though IGRA clearly calls for that situation in section 2719 of \nthe Act, I agree that if a wholesale policy of off-reservation \nacquisitions as part of a settlement were adopted by the Department of \nJustice or this Congress, that a great many Senators would call for \namendments to the act.\n  While I appreciate these concerns and would not favor inclusion of \noff-reservation land-into-trust acquisitions for purposes of land \nsettlement in all cases, the IGRA is clear in providing the authority \nto do just that if warranted by the facts of the case in question.\n  Although this legislation is not the most desirable option and does \nnot provide all parties with what they want out of a legislated \nsettlement, it does provide justice to the Torres-Martinez Tribe and I \nthink we are right in approving the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the chairman and agree with him that this is a \nmatter for which we do not want to set precedent with the bill before \nus.\n\n\n                      coushatta tribe of louisiana\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Breaux engage in a brief \ncolloquy regarding S. 2792. The purpose of the legislation sponsored by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana is to provide that land \nowned by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana but which is not held in \ntrust by the United States for the Tribe may be leased or transferred \nby the tribe without further approval by the United States.\n  I am concerned because the language in this bill does not clearly \nprovide that, if there is going to be gaming on this land, it is to be \nregulated gaming. That is, any land included in this bill is subject to \nregulation either by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, if Indians \npurchase the land, or subject to state and local regulation.\n  I stand for a conservative interpretation of the IGRA. As such, with \nall land bills involving Indian land, we must follow IGRA--in statute \nand intent. Congressional intent for Indian gaming under IGRA was to \nprovide economic flexibility regarding the use of land\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nwhich has a cultural or historical relationship to the tribal members. \nCongress did not provide in IGRA a mechanism for tribes to use to \nacquire and sell land which is only valuable because of its proximity \nto a commercially attractive area of high density traffic.\n  Is it the intent of the Senator from Louisiana that S. 2792 fully \ncomply with the statute and intent of IGRA and that if any gaming takes \nplace on the land covered by this bill, such gaming continues to be \nsubject to the applicable IGRA or state or local regulation?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nexpressing his thoughts and concerns with S. 2792, and I want to \nexpress my thoughts on this matter as we pass this legislation.\n  I agree that it was never the intent of S. 2792 to circumvent \nregulation of gaming. This bill simply provides for the Coushatta Tribe \nto lease or transfer land without further approval. This bill in no way \nprovides for any gaming regulatory loopholes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the senior Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                  the graton rancheria restoration act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished ranking Democrat, \nSenator Inouye, for moving this important bill to the Senate floor. \nThis bill will restore Federal recognition and associated rights, \nprivileges, and eligibility for Federal services and benefits to the \nFederated Indians of the Graton Rancheria of California, formerly known \nas the Coastal Miwok tribe.\n  This bill provides much needed recognition for the tribe. The Graton \nRancheria have been waiting decades for the Government to undo a past \nwrong. In 1958, the Federal Government stripped the Graton Rancheria of \nFederal recognition. Recently, it was found that the tribe holds a \nsmall parcel of land in Graton, CA that had been set aside as \nreservation for them in the 1920s.\n  As passed in the House of Representatives, this bill included \nlanguage that waived the tribe's gaming rights. I supported that \nlanguage, as did the Graton Rancheria and the local community. However, \nit was clear that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs would not support the language. The chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs have offered \nan amendment that removes the no-gaming clause. In his statement \naccompanying the amendment, Senator Inouye asserts that the no-gaming \nclause is unnecessary because the Graton Rancheria have no intention of \nconducting gaming.\n  I hope with the Senate passage of this bill that the House, the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs, and the administration can work to \nresolve the differences over the no-gaming clause and come to an \nagreement on either bill or report language.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe considered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and any statement relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5528) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11759-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11759-S11760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 5528\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

LEASE OF RESTRICTED LANDS FOR THE NAVAJO NATION.\n\n       The first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. \n     415) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) the term `individually owned Navajo Indian allotted \n     land' means a single parcel of land that--\n       ``(A) is located within the jurisdiction of the Navajo \n     Nation;\n       ``(B) is held in trust or restricted status by the United \n     States for the benefit of Navajo Indians or members of \n     another Indian tribe; and\n       ``(C) was--\n       ``(i) allotted to a Navajo Indian; or\n       ``(ii) taken into trust or restricted status by the United \n     States for an individual Indian;\n       ``(4) the term `interested party' means an Indian or non-\n     Indian individual or corporation, or tribal or non-tribal \n     government whose interests could be adversely affected by a \n     tribal trust land leasing decision made by the Navajo Nation;\n       ``(5) the term `Navajo Nation' means the Navajo Nation \n     government that is in existence on the date of enactment of \n     this Act or its successor;\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\n       ``(6) the term `petition' means a written request submitted \n     to the Secretary for the review of an action (or inaction) of \n     the Navajo Nation that is claimed to be in violation of the \n     approved tribal leasing regulations;\n       ``(7) the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior; and\n       ``(8) the term `tribal regulations' means the Navajo Nation \n     regulations enacted in accordance with Navajo Nation law and \n     approved by the Secretary.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) Any leases by the Navajo Nation for purposes \n     authorized under subsection (a), and any amendments thereto, \n     except a lease for the exploration, development, or \n     extraction of any mineral resources, shall not require the \n     approval of the Secretary if the lease is executed under the \n     tribal regulations approved by the Secretary under this \n     subsection and the term of the lease does not exceed--\n       ``(A) in the case of a business or agricultural lease, 25 \n     years, except that any such lease may include an option to \n     renew for up to 2 additional terms, each of which may not \n     exceed 25 years; and\n       ``(B) in the case of a lease for public, religious, \n     educational, recreational, or residential purposes, 75 years \n     if such a term is provided for by the Navajo Nation through \n     the promulgation of regulations.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to individually owned \n     Navajo Indian allotted land.\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall have the authority to approve or \n     disapprove tribal regulations referred to under paragraph \n     (1). The Secretary shall approve such tribal regulations if \n     such regulations are consistent with the regulations of the \n     Secretary under subsection (a), and any amendments thereto, \n     and provide for an environmental review process. The \n     Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove the \n     regulations of the Navajo Nation within 120 days of the \n     submission of such regulations to the Secretary. Any \n     disapproval of such regulations by the Secretary shall be \n     accompanied by written documentation that sets forth the \n     basis for the disapproval. Such 120-day period may be \n     extended by the Secretary after consultation with the Navajo \n     Nation.\n       ``(4) If the Navajo Nation has executed a lease pursuant to \n     tribal regulations under paragraph (1), the Navajo Nation \n     shall provide the Secretary with--\n       ``(A) a copy of the lease and all amendments and renewals \n     thereto; and\n       ``(B) in the case of regulations or a lease that permits \n     payment to be made directly to the Navajo Nation, \n     documentation of the lease payments sufficient to enable the \n     Secretary to discharge the trust responsibility of the United \n     States under paragraph (5).\n       ``(5) The United States shall not be liable for losses \n     sustained by any party to a lease executed pursuant to tribal \n     regulations under paragraph (1), including the Navajo Nation. \n     Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to diminish the \n     authority of the Secretary to take appropriate actions, \n     including the cancellation of a lease, in furtherance of the \n     trust obligation of the United States to the Navajo Nation.\n       ``(6)(A) An interested party may, after exhaustion of \n     tribal remedies, submit, in a timely manner, a petition to \n     the Secretary to review the compliance of the Navajo Nation \n     with any regulations approved under this subsection.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague from the State of Washington, Senator Slade Gorton.\n  During the course of working with Slade over the past several years, \nI have come to know a dedicated, intelligent individual who is \nrecognized throughout Congress as a work horse. He is a life-long \npublic servant who began his political career in the Washington state \nlegislature, where he was elected by his Republican peers to the \nposition of State House Majority Leader. After his tenure in the state \nhouse, he continued to serve the fine people of Washington as Attorney \nGeneral. While serving in this position he argued fourteen cases before \nthe Supreme Court, winning much acclaim for his proficiency as a \nlawyer.\n  We come from opposite coasts, yet there are many common ideological \nthreads we share. I respect Slade's commitment to fighting for the blue \ncollar worker--the salt-of-the-earth, hard working individuals who I am \nalso pleased to represent--along with his strong support for the law \nenforcement community and for states' rights. More importantly, I \nadmire Slade's determination, a trait which enabled him to serve three \nterms in the United States Senate.\n  Senator Slade Gorton is a straightforward individual whose candor \nwill be greatly missed, and I feel that I can speak for all of my \ncolleagues when I express my gratitude for his countless contributions \nto the Senate. I wish him and his wife Sally health, happiness, and \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11760-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11760-S11761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision in \nH.R. 2903, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. This legislation \nauthorizes a population study of Atlantic striped bass to determine if \nthere is sufficient diversity in year classes to ensure successful \nrecruitment and healthy stocks for continued commercial and \nrecreational fishing.\n  The Atlantic striped bass is considered one of the success stories in \nrecent fisheries management. Striped bass stocks along the Atlantic \ncoast experienced precipitous declines during the 1970s and early \n1980s. This decline was attributed to the increase in the number of \nrecreational and commercial fishermen, and the use of increasingly \nefficient gear. Because the decline was widespread and encompassed \nmultiple jurisdictions, recovery efforts were delegated to the Atlantic \nStates Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) under the authority of the \nStriped Bass Conservation Act of 1984, and later the Atlantic Coastal \nFisheries Cooperative Act of 1993. The ASMFC consists of coastal member \nstates from Maine to Florida.\n  In an effort to rebuild striped bass stocks, the ASMFC halted both \ncommercial and recreational fishing for striped bass beginning in the \nmid- 1980s. The ASMFC began to allow limited recreational and \ncommercial fishing for striped bass in the early 1990s, when striped \nbass began to show signs of recovery. Today even though stock abundance \nremains high, cautious vigilance of coast-wide fisheries performance \nand its impact on resource conditions should continue to be a primary \ntask of the ASMFC.\n  The Atlantic Striped Bass, or stripers as they are known in the Bay \nstate, are the number one recreational fishery in Massachusetts. In \n1999 recreational fishermen caught 4.7 million stripers in the Bay \nstate, this represents 33 percent of all stripers caught along the East \ncoast from North Carolina to Maine. While most states allow anglers to \nkeep two fish, Massachusetts allows anglers one fish, so that even \nthough 33 percent of all stripers are caught in Massachusetts, only 10 \npercent of the recreational landings occur in Massachusetts. The \ndifference between caught and landed fish is fish caught and released. \nMassachusetts has a small commercial fishery for the striped bass as \nwell. In 1999 commercial fishermen landed 40,000 stripers, which \nrepresented 4 percent of the commercial harvest on the East coast.\n  These figures do not even begin to represent what stripers mean to \nour economy. In a 1996 US Fish and Wildlife Service survey the agency \nestimated that 886,000 anglers spent 10.7 million days fishing for \nstriped bass in salt water during 1996. Average expenditures for all \nAtlantic Coast saltwater trips were about $800 per angler in 1996, for \na total estimated annual expenditure in this fishery of $762 million.\n  Stripers are an anadromous fish that frequents brackish waters and \ndepends on a healthy estuarine ecosystem for its survival. As such, it \nis affected by non-point source pollution and habitat loss and \ndegradation, more so than an offshore fish. I am very concerned that \nwithout a national program to identify and reduce sources of non-point \npollution, that eventually our striper stocks will again crash as they \ndid in the 1970s. On two occasions the United States Senate has passed \nS. 1534, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000.\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\nThis bill authorizes states to apply for funding that specifically \ntargets non-point pollution, and in turn help striped bass populations. \nMr. President, the sound policies of S. 1534 will help the striped \nbass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11761-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. HOCK\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJohn J. Hock, the devoted father of my press secretary Jim Hock.\n  John Hock will be remembered by friends and family for his deep \ndevotion to his religious faith, family, and football. His family \nmembers recall that although he was not one to yell or scream, he \nalways commanded great respect from everyone who knew him. His greatest \ntreasure was his family. Jim always spoke of the selflessness of this \nfather, who even in his last days, wanted to ensure that his family \nwould be taken care of once he was gone.\n  A natural athlete, Mr. Hock played in the National Footfall League as \nan offensive tackle for the Chicago Cardinals. During the Korean war, \nMr. Hock, a participant in the Olympic trials in the late 1940's, also \nentertained troops while on USO football teams in Japan. After \nreturning from the Korean war, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, \nwhere he played as a guard from 1953-1957. As captain of the Santa \nClara University's football team, Mr. Hock led his teammates to victory \nover the top-ranked University of Kentucky in the 1965 Orange Bowl.\n  During the off-season, Mr. Hock taught high school in Los Angeles to \nmake ends meet. It was while he was working as a teacher that he met \nhis wife, Bernadette. His family remembers how devoted they were to one \nanother. Because her husband was too humble to promote himself, Mrs. \nHock carried around his paying cards to give to friends. Their son \nJoseph put it best when he said that his mother and father were one.\n  In 1960, his pro-football career over and family growing, Mr. Hock \nmoved into sales and marketing at Western Carloading, a Los Angeles-\nbased trucking and shipping company. From 1988 until this year, he \nworked as a sales agent for Coldwell Baker Realty in Mahwah, spending \nhis freetime with his grandchildren, his family members said.\n  He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Bernadette, his sister, Ruth \nRahe, his children, Jay, Joseph, Jim, Mary, Susan, Anna, and Lisa, and \n11 of his grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Hock will be greatly missed, not because he \nentertained us, but because he stands as a reminder of the importance \nof family. As the holiday season draws near, let us all remember what \nJohn Hock always knew: Family and friends are truly the sweetest \nrewards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11761-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ON THE DEATH OF SALIM Y. SARAFA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay respect to a \ndear friend of mine who passed away recently. Salim Y. Sarafa helped \nstart the Chaldean-Iraqi Association of Michigan, became its first \npresident in 1954 and served three terms in that post. The \nassociation's first facility was built in 1979, and now includes the \nSouthfield Manor and the Shenandoah Golf and Country Club.\n  Salim served on the St. Michael's School Board and was vice-chairman \nof the Associated Food Dealers of Michigan. He also helped develop a \nschool that taught students to read, write, and speak Arabic. He was \nactive in the National Association of Arab-Americans, the American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Committee and the Republican Party at the state and \nnational levels.\n  He was born in Telkaif, Iraq, in 1921. He earned an education degree \nfrom the University of Baghdad and became a high school teacher in \n1942. He went on to teach in Kut in southern Iraq for four years before \nbeing promoted to assistant principal of a school near Baghdad. He left \nteaching to become director general of the Iraqi Department of Public \nWorks.\n  Salim came to the United States in 1951. While living with the George \nJonna family, he worked in their store, Union Pacific Market, until he \nopened his own store in 1953. He met and married Margarett George that \nsame year.\n  In 1957, he and four partners opened Big Dipper Market, Detroit's \nlargest independent supermarket at the time. He also was involved in a \nconstruction company, convenience store and wholesale business over the \nyears. He got into the real estate business in 1968 and remained active \nuntil retiring in 1995.\n  He is survived by three sons, Joe, Michael, and Mark; two daughters, \nJudy Jonna and Doreen Mangrum; and ten granchildren. His wife Margarett \ndied in 1998.\n  Salim and Margarett Sarafa lived their lives dedicated to the \nAmerican way while preserving the core values of the Chaldean culture. \nThey were able to raise their family and start their business in the \nland of the free while never forgetting the people who were not blessed \nwith the same chance. I am so very proud to call them my \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11761-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on December 8, 2000, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills and \njoint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 3514.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Navajo Nation Trust Land \n     Leasing Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 1202. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Recognizing the special relationship between \n     the United States and the Navajo Nation and its members, and \n     the Federal responsibility to the Navajo people, Congress \n     finds that--\n       (1) the third clause of section 8, Article I of the United \n     States Constitution provides that ``The Congress shall have \n     Power...to regulate Commerce . . . with Indian tribes'', and, \n     through this and other constitutional authority, Congress has \n     plenary power over Indian affairs;\n       (2) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general \n     course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the \n     responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and their resources;\n       (3) the United States has a trust obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency;\n       (4) pursuant to the first section of the Act of August 9, \n     1955 (25 U.S.C. 415), Congress conferred upon the Secretary \n     of the Interior the power to promulgate regulations governing \n     tribal leases and to approve tribal leases for tribes \n     according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary;\n       (5) the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated the \n     regulations described in paragraph (4) at part 162 of title \n     25, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (6) the requirement that the Secretary approve leases for \n     the development of Navajo trust lands has added a level of \n     review and regulation that does not apply to the development \n     of non-Indian land; and\n       (7) in the global economy of the 21st Century, it is \n     crucial that individual leases of Navajo trust lands not be \n     subject to Secretarial approval and that the Navajo Nation be \n     able to make immediate decisions over the use of Navajo trust \n     lands.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       (1) To establish a streamlined process for the Navajo \n     Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the \n     approval of the Secretary of the Interior for individual \n     leases, except leases for exploration, development, or \n     extraction of any mineral resources.\n       (2) To authorize the Navajo Nation, pursuant to tribal \n     regulations, which must be approved by the Secretary, to \n     lease Navajo trust lands without the approval of the \n     Secretary of the Interior for the individual leases, except \n     leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any \n     mineral resources.\n       (3) To revitalize the distressed Navajo Reservation by \n     promoting political self-determination, and encouraging \n     economic self-sufficiency, including economic development \n     that increases productivity and the standard of living for \n     members of the Navajo Nation.\n       (4) To maintain, strengthen, and protect the Navajo \n     Nation's leasing power over Navajo trust lands.\n       (5) To ensure that the United States is faithfully \n     executing its trust obligation to the Navajo Nation by \n     maintaining federal supervision through oversight of and \n     record keeping related to leases of Navajo Nation tribal \n     trust lands.\n\n     SEC. 1203. LEASE OF RESTRICTED LANDS FOR THE NAVAJO NATION.\n\n       The first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. \n     415) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) the term `individually owned Navajo Indian allotted \n     land' means a single parcel of land that--\n       ``(A) is located within the jurisdiction of the Navajo \n     Nation;\n       ``(B) is held in trust or restricted status by the United \n     States for the benefit of Navajo Indians or members of \n     another Indian tribe; and\n       ``(C) was--\n       ``(i) allotted to a Navajo Indian; or\n       ``(ii) taken into trust or restricted status by the United \n     States for an individual Indian;\n       ``(4) the term `interested party' means an Indian or non-\n     Indian individual or corporation, or tribal or non-tribal \n     government whose interests could be adversely affected by a \n     tribal trust land leasing decision made by the Navajo Nation;\n       ``(5) the term `Navajo Nation' means the Navajo Nation \n     government that is in existence on the date of enactment of \n     this Act or its successor;\n       ``(6) the term `petition' means a written request submitted \n     to the Secretary for the review of an action (or inaction) of \n     the Navajo Nation that is claimed to be in violation of the \n     approved tribal leasing regulations;\n       ``(7) the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior; and\n       ``(8) the term `tribal regulations' means the Navajo Nation \n     regulations enacted in accordance with Navajo Nation law and \n     approved by the Secretary.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) Any leases by the Navajo Nation for purposes \n     authorized under subsection (a), and any amendments thereto, \n     except a lease for the exploration, development, or \n     extraction of any mineral resources, shall not require the \n     approval of the Secretary if the lease is executed under the \n     tribal regulations approved by the Secretary under this \n     subsection and the term of the lease does not exceed--\n       ``(A) in the case of a business or agricultural lease, 25 \n     years, except that any such lease may include an option to \n     renew for up to 2 additional terms, each of which may not \n     exceed 25 years; and\n       ``(B) in the case of a lease for public, religious, \n     educational, recreational, or residential purposes, 75 years \n     if such a term is provided for by the Navajo Nation through \n     the promulgation of regulations.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to individually owned \n     Navajo Indian allotted land.\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall have the authority to approve or \n     disapprove tribal regulations referred to under paragraph \n     (1). The Secretary shall approve such tribal regulations if \n     such regulations are consistent with the regulations of the \n     Secretary under subsection (a), and any amendments thereto, \n     and provide for an environmental review process. The \n     Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove the \n     regulations of the Navajo Nation within 120 days of the \n     submission of such regulations to the Secretary. Any \n     disapproval of such regulations by the Secretary shall be \n     accompanied by written documentation that sets forth the \n     basis for the disapproval. Such 120-day period may be \n     extended by the Secretary after consultation with the Navajo \n     Nation.\n       ``(4) If the Navajo Nation has executed a lease pursuant to \n     tribal regulations under paragraph (1), the Navajo Nation \n     shall provide the Secretary with--\n       ``(A) a copy of the lease and all amendments and renewals \n     thereto; and\n       ``(B) in the case of regulations or a lease that permits \n     payment to be made directly to the Navajo Nation, \n     documentation of the lease payments sufficient to enable the \n     Secretary to discharge the trust responsibility of the United \n     States under paragraph (5).\n       ``(5) The United States shall not be liable for losses \n     sustained by any party to a lease executed pursuant to tribal \n     regulations under paragraph (1), including the Navajo Nation. \n     Nothing in this paragraph shall be\n\n[[Page S11763]]\n\n     construed to diminish the authority of the Secretary to take \n     appropriate actions, including the cancellation of a lease, \n     in furtherance of the trust obligation of the United States \n     to the Navajo Nation.\n       ``(6)(A) An interested party may, after exhaustion of \n     tribal remedies, submit, in a timely manner, a petition to \n     the Secretary to review the compliance of the Navajo Nation \n     with any regulations approved under this subsection. If upon \n     such review the Secretary determines that the regulations \n     were violated, the Secretary may take such action as may be \n     necessary to remedy the violation, including rescinding the \n     approval of the tribal regulations and reassuming \n     responsibility for the approval of leases for Navajo Nation \n     tribal trust lands.\n       ``(B) If the Secretary seeks to remedy a violation \n     described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall--\n       ``(i) make a written determination with respect to the \n     regulations that have been violated;\n       ``(ii) provide the Navajo Nation with a written notice of \n     the alleged violation together with such written \n     determination; and\n       ``(iii) prior to the exercise of any remedy or the \n     rescission of the approval of the regulation involved and the \n     reassumption of the lease approval responsibility, provide \n     the Navajo Nation with a hearing on the record and a \n     reasonable opportunity to cure the alleged violation.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/11/senate-section/article/S11763-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 387--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF REPRESENTATIVE JULIAN \n                        C.
