Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nbecause--and I speak with some sense of timing--I come from an \nagricultural State.\n  In the next several days we could very well have a crop insurance \nreform conference report out here on the floor. There is at least some \ndiscussion, some thought, and maybe some probability that included in \nthat conference report will be about $7 billion of economic assistance \nfor family farmers, which essentially will be more AMTA payments.\n  When the Budget Committee allowed for up to $7 billion to go to \nassistance for family farmers in the country, whether it be Minnesota, \nwhether it be Montana, or any other State, I think all of us believed \nand hoped that this would be far superior to emergency appropriations, \nand that we would have the agriculture authorization committee do some \nfairly important investigation and analysis of the best way to get this \nfinancial assistance out to family farmers.\n  In my rush to come down to the floor, I did not bring with me the \nexact statistics, but basically the reports that we now see on what are \ncalled AMTA payments suggest that entirely too much of this money goes \nto those in least need. In other words, it is a subsidy program. Last \nyear, it was to the tune of about $16 billion in inverse relationship \nto need. The top 10 percent of the producers--some of the big \ncorporations--received over 60 percent of the benefits, and then the \nfarmers received the rest, so that a family farm in Minnesota would be \nlucky to get maybe $2,000 worth of assistance; whereas, those huge \noperations were raking in $100,000 worth of assistance.\n  If we just take the $7 billion and put it into this conference report \nwithout any committee hearings and without taking at least several \nweeks after we get back to do some evaluation and some important \nanalysis about how to get this assistance out to the people who need it \nthe most, then I think we have not lived up to our responsibility as \nSenators.\n  I say to my colleagues that I think we could at the very minimum, for \nexample, make sure that this money goes to producers. Those who own the \nland\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\nbut aren't involved in the production receive too much of the benefits. \nThe benefits ought to go to the producers.\n  I would also say to my colleagues that there is no reason in the \nworld that for fiscal year 2001 we can't focus on equity and get the \nloan rate up at least to the rate for soybeans, in which case corn \nwould be $2.11 and wheat would be $3.10. Let me tell you that is the \ndirection we need to go for a State such as mine.\n  I sent a letter yesterday to Chairman Lugar, my colleague, a Senator \nfor whom I happen to have a tremendous amount of respect. I will \ncertainly get a chance to talk with him today. I believe that we are \nmaking a big mistake if we simply put this money into a conference \nreport, which means there will not be any real discussion and no real \ndebate. We will not have paid any attention whatsoever as to how we can \nallocate this financial assistance out there in the countryside so that \nthe lion's share of the benefit goes to the farmers who are in greatest \nneed.\n  Why in the world do we want to use the same AMTA formula which gets \nsubsidies out to farmers in inverse relationship to need? Why not some \ncareful consideration and some careful discussion? Isn't that what we \nare about as legislators?\n\n  Too many times now in the Senate we see the same pattern of important \ndecisions not being made by virtue of taking, in this particular case, \nwhat I think is an important question and just putting it into a \nconference report with no opportunity for amendments and no opportunity \nfor discussion. I think that would be a big mistake. Instead, we can \nsurely decide on a better formula for getting the money out there to \nthe people. At the very minimum, it ought to go to the producers. It \nought not go to landowners who are not even involved in production.\n  Again, we have an opportunity for fiscal year 2001 to literally talk \nabout equity and at least get the loan rate up for other farmers and \nother grain farmers that are equal to what we do for soybeans.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, as a Senator from an agricultural State, \nI come to the floor today to take issue with the direction in which we \nare going and to urge my colleagues not to put this financial \nassistance money into the crop insurance bill. But instead let's do the \nkind of work that we ought to do as legislators. Let's do the kind of \nevaluation we ought to do as legislators so we can get the help out \nthere to people who need it.\n  Farm income is going to go down 17 percent again this year. There are \na lot of farmers in my State. Many are going to be driven off the land.\n  If we are not going to write a new farm bill as an alternative to \nthis ``freedom to fail'' bill, which is one of the worst pieces of \nlegislation ever passed by the Congress or ever signed by a President, \nthen I don't think we are going to write a new farm bill until after \nthe election. At the very minimum, we ought to do our best to get the \nassistance to the people who need it the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, sometimes we use morning business to \nhave a chance to speak about legislation we introduce. Sometimes we use \nmorning business to make a plea to colleagues. Sometimes we use morning \nbusiness to convey a message. I want to convey a message to some \nSenators about conference reports and the way we have been conducting \nour business.\n  Right now with the conference reports--and I am specifically talking \nabout the bankruptcy bill--we don't have a conference committee. We \nhave a shadow committee because Democratic Senators are not involved at \nall in the deliberations. There are some rumors going around in the \nSenate that Republicans will basically reach an agreement on the \nconference report on bankruptcy. Democrats will not be involved in this \ndeliberation at all. So we have not had a conference committee meeting. \nWe will know what is in that conference report when it is on our desk.\n  That conference report dealing with bankruptcy, believe it or not, \nAmerican public, could be put into an unrelated conference report such \nas a conference report dealing with crop insurance. There is no longer \nany scope of conference rule so it can be completely unrelated. Again, \nthat is a new way of doing business in the Senate. My argument is that \nis no way to do business in the Senate.\n  I believe the minority should be involved in the conference. That is \na real conference. I do not believe the way to do business is for \nDemocrats to find out what is in the bill when it is put on our desk. I \ncertainly don't think this bankruptcy bill --which is so harsh and so \negregious in its effect on the most vulnerable citizens in the country, \nwhile basically calling for no accountability or responsibility on the \npart of the big credit card companies--should be put into an unrelated \nconference report such as one dealing with crop insurance.\n  I use my time as a Senator today to say to Senators that if that \nhappens, and I hope it won't, if that should happen tomorrow, for \nexample, when we are supposed to go on recess, I think that would be \noutrageous. I will oppose it. I will speak out against it and do \neverything I can to block it. We would be here for days. I think there \nare other colleagues who will be also outraged, especially at this \neffort to put a shadow conference report on bankruptcy, with Democrats \nnot even being involved--and all the reports are that the bill is \ngetting harsher and harsher, not better--into an unrelated conference \nreport with a day to go before we are supposed to go into recess. If \nthat happens, I want to be clear, I don't intend to be jammed. I do not \nintend to roll over on it. I intend to speak out against it. I intend \nto point out to the American people all the ways in which this is \negregious legislation and the impact it will have on them and their \nfamilies. That will take time. I think other Senators will join me.\n\n  I hope we do not conduct our business that way in the Senate. I hope \nI do not have to do that. I hope, instead, we will do what we need to \ndo with the legislative branch and with judicial nominations, with the \nnomination of Brad Smith, have those votes, get onto other work, but \nnot have last minute efforts to sort of jam legislation into unrelated \nlegislation and attempt to ram it through here without the deliberation \nand without the discussion.\n  I do not think that is the Senate at its best. I certainly, as a \nSenator from Minnesota, cannot represent people in my State and people \nin the country that way, and I will not. I will challenge it. So I hope \nit does not come to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have until 10:30 \nin morning business on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4338-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4338-S4339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a little over a year ago in Littleton, CO, \nat Columbine High School, there was a shooting incident which shocked \nAmerica. We saw in that high school an event which we did not believe \ncould happen in the United States, where students could get guns \nthrough a gun\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nshow, go into a high school filled with other students, and open fire, \nkilling 12 or 13 students and injuring many others. It shocked \nAmerica's conscience.\n  As a result, the Senate began to consider gun control legislation--\nfrankly, more gun safety legislation--to keep guns out of the hands of \nthose who would misuse them. We are a nation of 200 million guns. Many \nof us believe guns should be kept out of the hands of criminals and \nchildren.\n  So we considered legislation on the floor of the Senate to do a \nbackground check at gun shows so kids and criminals would not have \naccess to guns through these gun shows. We know the Brady law requires \na background check at gun dealers. We think the same should apply to \ngun shows.\n  We also thought handguns should have a trigger lock so children who \nwere looking around for something that was unusual and different or \nchallenging would not find a loaded gun and hurt themselves or a \nplaymate. We read about that almost every day. A trigger lock is a way \nto make sure that gun is securely stored away from children.\n  In another part of the bill, we dealt with the whole question of \nthese high-capacity ammo clips, imported into the United States from \noverseas, that have absolutely no value whatsoever for any legitimate \nsportsman or hunter. They are people killers.\n  We considered that bill on the floor of the Senate. The vote on that \nbill was 49-49, a tie vote. As provided under the Constitution of the \nUnited States, the Vice President came and cast the tie-breaking vote. \nWe sent that bill over to the House in the hopes we could reduce some \nof the gun violence in America after Columbine High School.\n  The National Rifle Association got its hands on that bill over in the \nHouse, and that was the end of it. They stripped from that bill \nvirtually any of the provisions I described to you and sent it to a \nconference where it has languished for almost 8 months. During that \nperiod of time many more people have been killed by gun violence in \nAmerica.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Million Mom March across the United States \nbrought out mothers on Mother's Day who gave up a celebration with \ntheir family to come out and talk about the need in America for gun \nsafety, for gun control, sensible gun control. Yet this Congress has \nturned a deaf ear. We have refused even to acknowledge that this gun \nviolence is rampant in America as in no other nation on Earth.\n  Every day now, for the last week, Members of the Senate have come to \nthe floor to memorialize those who died a year ago today, after \nColumbine, after Littleton, CO, after Jonesboro, AR, and all of the \nother cities where we saw the gun violence that captured our \nimagination and basically stunned America. We come to the floor each \nday to read the names of some of the victims. These are victims whose \nnames were collected by the U.S. Conference of Mayors from cities large \nand small to remind us that a year ago today these people, whose names \nI am about to read, died because of gun violence--people who had \notherwise normal lives and families and aspired to all the good things \nwe do in life. They lost their lives because of gun violence.\n  Many times, issues on the floor of the Senate and the House really do \nnot become very personal. They are statistics. We just refer to them in \nthe abstract. This is not about statistics. It is not about abstract \nthought. It is about real human lives that have been lost to gun \nviolence a year ago today and, sadly, will be lost to gun violence \nagain today.\n  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire 1 year ago, on May 24, 1999: Michael Calim, age 32, Houston, \nTX; Mark Raiffie, age 47, St. Louis, MO; Gary Ricks, age 51, Detroit, \nMI; Bobby L. Williams, age 40, Houston, TX; Ronald Williams, age 47, \nMiami-Dade County, FL; an unidentified female, San Francisco, CA.\n\n  Today in America there will be more gun deaths. We must remember that \namong those gun deaths will be 12 children who will die. The National \nRifle Association at their recent convention said: We know who those 12 \nkids are; they are the gang bangers, drug gangs, and all the rest. You \ncan expect that.\n  They are wrong. Included among those 12 children are those who commit \nsuicide with guns, those who play with guns, little infants killing \nthemselves or a playmate, certainly those who are victims of gang \nbangers and, believe me, I have seen innocent young men and women who \nhave been maimed. I have talked with the parents of people who have \nbeen killed on the streets of one of my cities in Illinois, Chicago. \nThese were children waiting for a schoolbus when somebody came by and \nsprayed bullets from one of these weapons and injured or killed \nstudents.\n  For the National Rifle Association to say we basically should ignore \nthese 12 children who die every day in America because they are part of \ndrug gangs is a sad commentary on this organization and a sad \ncommentary that they are out of touch with the reality of gun violence \nas it affects every family in America today.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer, came to the Senate floor to discuss Social Security reform. \nIn her discussion, she took on the issue of some of the Texas \nmunicipalities that had chosen to opt out of Social Security and \nattempted to show they were doing less well than anyone in the Social \nSecurity system today. I want to refute some of those remarks, \nespecially the ones that referred to these counties in Texas, and give \nthe other side of the story.\n  She attempted to show that municipal employees in Texas, particularly \nGalveston County, are not doing as well under their own retirement plan \nthan if they were part of the Social Security system.\n  Just in the last few minutes, I talked to the county judge of \nGalveston County, Judge Yarborough, who is a very good Democrat, a very \ngood person, and is doing a good job in Galveston County. He says in \nthe 5\\1/2\\ years he has been county judge, he has never had one \ncomplaint from an employee in Galveston County and, in fact, has had \nmany retirees come up to him and say how glad they are that they have \ntheir own retirement system rather than having been forced into the \nSocial Security system back in the eighties when they were allowed to \nopt out.\n  First and foremost, because this is important, this was somehow \nlinked to Governor Bush's Social Security plan. There is no linkage \nwhatsoever. In fact, the opt-out was done in 1981 by Galveston and a \nfew other municipalities around my State, and there were others around \nthe country. There was a window during that time in which county and \nmunicipal employees were able to opt out of Social Security, and \nGalveston County did decide to opt out.\n\n  I hope as we go into the future and as we talk about Governor Bush's \nSocial Security plan, we will not attempt to link that window when some \nmunicipalities opted out of Social Security to Governor Bush's plan. \nThat is important because Governor Bush has said all along, from the \nvery beginning when he put his plan forward, that, in fact, we would \nhave a choice under his plan. Anyone wanting to stay in the present \nSocial Security system would have that option.\n  That is a very important distinction to make because people might \nwant to keep that option after they have looked at the alternative that \nwill be available, but, in fact, millions of Americans will decide that \nthey want to have a part in making some decisions on their own for the \nSocial Security tax they pay.\n  Nearly 5 million municipal employees across the country are not part \nof the Social Security system. One such area is the city of San Diego. \nThe rates of return on these pension programs are very good--so good, \nin fact, that the California Senators sent a letter to President \nClinton in which they said:\n\n       Millions of our constituents, who will receive higher \n     retirement benefits from their\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\n     current public pensions than they would under Social \n     Security, are appealing to their elected representatives in \n     Washington. We respectfully urge you to honor the original \n     legislative intent underpinning the Social Security system, \n     and exclude this provision from any reform plan you consider \n     during the remainder of your term.\n\n  It is clear that if municipal employees are earning higher rates of \nreturn and want to stay in their own retirement plans, they should not \nbe forced into a system of lower returns, and it should be a choice \nthey have. I agree with the Senators from California in their goal.\n  I will now talk about the specifics of the Galveston plan. Many of \nthese same Galveston employees have urged me to oppose their inclusion \nin Social Security.\n  Some of the information that was used on the floor yesterday was \nbased on a GAO report, but if my colleagues read the report carefully, \nthey can see the clear differences between Social Security and the plan \nin Galveston County.\n  First, it is important to remember that, in Galveston, they have a \nbasic retirement plan that every employee puts money into and on which \nthey have returns. That plan is separate. In 1981, they were allowed to \nopt out of Social Security so that their 7 percent they would have paid \ninto Social Security would, in fact, go into a supplemental plan. In \nGalveston County, we are talking about a supplemental plan to their \nbasic retirement plan, so everything they get with the 7 percent which \nthey put into their own supplemental plan is over and above their basic \nretirement system.\n  The GAO said that ``outcomes generally depend on individual \ncircumstances and conditions.'' So each case is taken on an individual \nbasis--it is hard to make broad statements about the plan. The annuity \neach retiree receives is based on the contributions and the time served \nin government; it is not a defined benefit formula, such as Social \nSecurity. Nevertheless, the plan is designed to provide a return \nsimilar to Social Security, which it does, and it has some features \nthat are even better.\n  The GAO noted that ``The Galveston plan also has a very conservative \ninvestment strategy that has precluded investing in common stocks.'' \nThe Galveston supplemental plan only relies on Government bonds and \nvery safe Treasury-type investments, and the average return has been \napproximately 8 percent per year. When one compares that to Social \nSecurity, however, it is very high.\n  The Heritage Foundation has estimated that some workers are getting a \n1- to 2-percent return on their money from Social Security.\n  Also, comparing the Social Security plan to the Galveston plan, it is \nnot accurate because the Galveston plan is a supplement, not the basic \nretirement system.\n  Lastly, the GAO noted one critical point that was left out of the \nWashington debate: The Galveston plan benefits are fully funded, GAO \nsays, ``while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without \nincreasing revenues.''\n  Thus, the Galveston plan is financially sound. It is not dependent on \nsignificantly increased contributions or massive tax increases to meet \nits promises.\n  Here, in Washington, we have promised benefits without developing a \nplan to pay for them. In Galveston, no retiree is subject to the mercy \nof the Congress that the benefits might change.\n  Here are some of the facts about the differences between the \nGalveston plan and Social Security.\n  For individual earners without a survivor benefit, the monthly \nannuity figures for retirees are nearly identical or better than Social \nSecurity. For low-wage workers, there is a $1 difference. For workers \nwith wages over $25,000, they would earn nearly $200 a month more under \nthe Galveston plan than they would under Social Security.\n  A worker earning $50,000 will earn nearly $1,000 more every month.\n  If you have a 45-year work history, the numbers are higher across the \nboard at every income level in the Galveston plan.\n  The Cato Institute also reviewed the Galveston retirement plan. For a \nworker who earns $30,000 for 30 years, he or she will have a $320,000 \ninvestment in retirement. This is based on a 4.5-percent return when, \nin fact, Galveston is getting 8 percent.\n  I should also note that the numbers in GAO are based on a 4-percent \nreturn each year. So the numbers in GAO are very low in their \nestimates, and most workers are going to receive a much higher benefit.\n  According to Cato, the employee with the $320,000 in savings could \nearn a monthly annuity of $2,494, compared to Social Security, which is \n$1,077.\n  So according to Cato, the monthly annuity would be $2,494 for a \nGalveston employee, compared to $1,077 under Social Security.\n  The county of Galveston believes the average annuity is approximately \n7.8 percent for every $1,000 in retirement funds. The Social Security \nAdministration thinks that is too high and made the GAO use a lower \nannuity figure. So the monthly annuity figures used by GAO are lower \nthan for the Galveston workers.\n  I think it is very important that we take this debate out of the Bush \nplan or the Gore plan when we are dealing with the employees in cities \nsuch as San Diego, CA, or Galveston County, TX, because it is very \nclear that the Galveston County employees have a major benefit. As the \ncounty judge said this morning: Retirees come up to me every day and \nsay thank goodness.\n  Another good feature of the Galveston plan is that if the retiree \ndoes not use up all of the retirement when that person dies, it is \npassed on to the spouse or the children. That does not happen in Social \nSecurity.\n  I think it is very important, if we are going to build up a stability \nin our working people and their families, that we would have this kind \nof alternative with which the Galveston County employees are very \npleased.\n  I think it is very important that we not put this in the political \nrealm. If we are talking about the actual numbers, I think the \nmunicipal employees that were allowed to opt out in the early 1980s are \nmostly happy with their plans. They like the choices they have. \nGalveston was very conservative and did not go into the stock market.\n  But I think the bottom line is that we need to give people a choice, \na choice to stay in the Social Security system as it is today and have \nthe exact same returns that they would be entitled to under Social \nSecurity, or if they choose not to do that, and they do want to have \nsome control over their own taxes they pay in--maybe 3 percent of the \n12-plus percent they pay in Social Security--I think we ought to let \nthem do that. Because even with the stock market fluctuating, the \nreturns show that they will do better and they will be able to give \ntheir children something they have not been able to under the present \nSocial Security plan.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to rise in \nrecognition of Small Business Week 2000. As chairman of the Committee \non Small Business, I have participated in a number of activities this \nweek. I urge all of my colleagues who may not have done so to consider \nworking with, identifying with, and listening to the small businesses \nin their State. I think today it is appropriate that we recognize some \nof the small business trends of the future.\n  Most of us know that the prototypical entrepreneur of the last \ncentury--or of the 1900s; the manufacturing age--was a man, inventing \nsomething in his garage or basement, which became the basis for a \nFortune 500 company. The prototypical entrepreneur of the 21st \ncentury--the information and service age--is a woman trying to run her \nhousehold, keep her kids fed and cared for, who comes up with a good \nidea that she can turn into a business.\n  Women have started businesses in record numbers over the last 10 \nyears. They are driving the economy. They are helping to expand \nopportunities and provide good payrolls for their workers. They are \nwilling to use the new information technologies even more than men. The \nexplosion of capabilities through information technologies certainly \nopens up a range for a whole new series of undertakings.\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\n  The number of small businesses owned and controlled by women is \nexpanding at a very rapid rate. Today, small businesses owned by women \ntotal 30 percent of all businesses in the United States. Their numbers \nare expanding at such a pace it is anticipated that women-owned small \nbusinesses will make up over 50 percent of all businesses by 2010. \nGiven where we came from, that is a gratifying and astounding \nstatistic.\n  But for all the good news, women-owned small businesses still face \nsome age-old obstacles in starting and running their businesses: work \nand family conflicts, a lack of access to capital, and complex \nregulatory and tax issues.\n  In addition, yesterday the Senate adopted a resolution I sponsored, \nS. Res. 311, that was adopted unanimously. I express my appreciation to \nmy colleagues for adopting it. It called attention to the Federal \nGovernment's failure to meet the statutory goal to award 5 percent of \nFederal contract dollars to women-owned small businesses.\n  The members of the Small Business Committee who joined me in \ncosponsoring this resolution included my ranking member, Senator Kerry \nof Massachusetts, and also sponsoring it were Senators Burns, Snowe, \nLandrieu, Lieberman, Edwards, as well as Senator Abraham, who authored \nlast year's initiative in the committee to help women reach the 5-\npercent goal. In addition, Senators Bingaman and Murray joined us as \ncosponsors of the resolution.\n  In 1994, Congress recognized the important role women-owned small \nbusinesses played in our economy. During the consideration of the \nFederal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Senate approved a provision \ndirecting that 5 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be awarded \neach year to women-owned small businesses. The goal includes 5 percent \nof prime contract dollars and 5 percent of subcontract dollars, and was \nincluded in the final conference report enacted into law.\n  The Federal Departments and Agencies have failed to meet that 5-\npercent goal enacted in 1994. After Senator Abraham chaired a committee \nfield hearing in Michigan on the state of women business owners, he \noffered an amendment addressing the failure of the Federal Departments \nand Agencies to meet the 5-percent goal during the Small Business \nCommittee markup of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999.\n  That was adopted unanimously by the committee and enacted into law as \nPublic Law 106-165, which directed that GAO undertake an audit of \nFederal procurement systems and their impact on women-owned small \nbusinesses.\n  The statistics for Federal procurement in fiscal year 1999 have just \nbeen released. Again, the 5-percent goal for women-owned small \nbusinesses was not met. It fell over 50 percent short of the goal, \nreaching only 2.4 percent. The administration's failure to reach that \ngoal was the subject of the resolution, which resolved that the Senate \nstrongly urge the President to adopt a policy in support of the 5-\npercent goal for women-owned small businesses, to encourage the heads \nof the Federal Departments to make a concentrated effort to meet the 5-\npercent goal before the end of fiscal year 2000. I understand the \nPresident has now issued an Executive order. But the second part of the \nresolution says the President should hold the heads of Federal \nDepartments and Agencies accountable to ensure that the 5-percent goal \nis achieved during this year.\n  But these are just some of the issues confronting women-owned small \nbusinesses. I am very pleased to say I have been joined by Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts, Senator Snowe, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Hutchison of Texas to convene a National Women's \nBusiness Summit on June 4 and 5 of this year in Kansas City, MO. This \nsummit will give women small business owners a chance to tell Congress \nand the next President what they need and what will work. Their agenda \nwill serve as the women's small business agenda for the next Congress \nand the next President.\n  I might add that we have nationally known women and professional \nbusiness leaders, as well as bipartisan government servants, who will \nbe talking with the participants in the conference. I invite women who \nare engaged in and concerned about small business to participate. More \ninformation can be found about the summit on my Senate office web site \nat www.Senate.gov/bond or they can call us through the Capitol number: \n(202) 224-3121. We would be happy to provide them information.\n  I think it will be a very interesting and worthwhile endeavor in \nKansas City. I am looking forward to participating. I know we will have \nmany good ideas, based on the women participating in that conference, \non how we can help the fastest growing and most important new sector of \nthe economy--women-owned small businesses in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4341-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2603, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2603) making appropriations for the Legislative \n     Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as chairman of the legislative branch \nsubcommittee of appropriations, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndescribe S. 2603, the legislative branch appropriations bill for the \nfiscal year 2001.\n  The bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, provides for \n$1,721,077,000 in new budget authority exclusive of the House items. \nThis is a $58,607,000 increase over fiscal year 2000. It is \n$146,770,000 below the President's request.\n  The subcommittee's allocation is 1.8 percent above last year's \nfunding level, which is the $43 million increase.\n  We are being very frugal with the legislative branch. I think we are \ndoing a responsible job of keeping the overall increase at a level that \nis defensible.\n  We are not allowing the legislative branch appropriations to grow \nfaster than inflation. We are not allowing it to grow faster than the \npopulation. And the demands that are made upon the legislative branch \nwe are keeping under 2 percent.\n  It was a challenge to draft a bill that stayed within this allocation \nbecause, as always happens, there was $20 million of new items that \nCongress committed to in previous years but which had not been funded. \nTherefore, they were not included in last year's base.\n  If we were going to talk about an increase over last year's base, but \nwe had $20 million worth of obligations that were not included in that \nbase, we realized that it created a tension and a pressure on the \ncommittee. But that is what we have to do when we are dealing with \nbudgets. I have dealt with budgets in the business world and understand \nthat this is not an unusual kind of challenge.\n\n  The mandatory increases that we have in the bill alone account for \n$54 million, exclusive of the House, on top of the situation which I \nhave just described,\n  Senator Feinstein, the ranking member, and I spent a great deal of \ntime going over the accounts with our respective staffs and the \nincreases that agencies have had over the last 4 years in an effort to \nfind where we could best and most fairly cut without impacting \nemployees. One of our goals was to see to it that no one was laid off \nas a result of the budgetary pressures on this year's bill. I am happy \nto say that we have met that goal in this bill.\n  There will be no reduction in force as a result of the Senate's \naction, if this bill is adopted, and no employees currently working in \nthe legislative branch will lose their jobs. The subcommittee's goal \nwas to ensure that would be the case.\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\n  There has been a great deal of discussion and concern in the press \nexpressed over the House Appropriations Committee's first reported \ntargets. Those targets were reported out of subcommittee with cuts of \nalmost $105 million below the fiscal year 2000 level.\n  It is my understanding that the House now plans in their legislative \nprocess to increase this bill by $85 million before it comes up for \nfloor consideration. I hope those reports are accurate and that the \nHouse does, indeed, move in that direction.\n  We do not want to criticize the actions of the other body in this \nbody. We simply want to lay out what we think is the logical thing to \ndo.\n  I hope those who have been focused on the press reports of what was \nproposed on the other side of the Capitol initially will recognize that \nthere is a great deal of legislative action that has to take place \nbetween initial proposals and final passage. Certainly we are doing our \nbest on the Senate side to make a contribution to see to it that final \npassage achieves the goal that I have outlined; that is, the goal that \nsays there will be no reduction in force in the legislative branch.\n  S. 2603 includes an increase over last year's funding for every \nagency. That sounds better than it is for some agencies. The increase \nis truly only a token one--one-tenth of 1 percent increase. But, \nnonetheless, it is an increase to demonstrate, once again, that we are \ntrying to treat everybody fairly, and that we are not trying to \npenalize one group in order to benefit another.\n  The area that has had the greatest amount of public interest and \npress reporting is the amount of money being made available for the \nCapitol Police.\n  The bill before the Senate will provide a 26-percent increase for the \nCapitol Police. If we are only going to have a one-tenth of 1 percent \nincrease in some areas, that is where we will get the money to come up \nwith the 26-percent increase for the Capitol Police. We do this because \nwe believe security in the Capitol is a priority. We need to make sure \nthe resources are available to the men and women who protect the \nCapitol, its visitors, the Members, and the staff.\n  We had a tragic demonstration that security needs to be addressed \nwith the shooting of the two officers who protected the Capitol against \nthe deranged individual who came in with a gun after some imaginary \nthreat he, and only he, could see.\n  We had an example within the last week during a hearing in the House \nwhen a man threatened to kill himself with the jagged end of a broken \nbottle after approaching a Cabinet officer who was testifying at a \nhearing. He was subdued by a member of the Capitol Police and by a \nmember of the security detail of one of the Cabinet officers involved.\n  These incidents, coming along with increased frequency, demonstrate \nwe have a security challenge in the Capitol. We want to make sure the \nCapitol remains open to the American people. I would hate to reach the \npoint of other capitals in the world. I don't mean to pick this country \nout because I recognize they have enormous security problems of their \nown and I think they are acting responsibly, but I will share my \nexperience when I first went to the Knesset in Israel and the kind of \nsecurity I had to go through as a U.S. Senator in order to get into the \nKnesset. There were barriers, more barriers, and checks and police \npoints, all the way through so that the members of the Knesset could \nconduct their business in security and freedom.\n  In the United States, we run into our constituents, sometimes \nliterally, virtually every day in the corridors of the Capitol. We \nenjoy that. The American people enjoy that. We want to continue doing \nthat. I will be walking down the corridor on the way to a committee \nmeeting and it is not at all unusual to have someone call out from the \nmoving crowd, ``Hi, Senator Bennett'' or ``Hey, there's Senator \nBennett.'' I stop and it is someone from Utah who is here with a school \nclass, here with their family, here on a vacation, or here for a civics \nlesson experience.\n  Walking through the Capitol, it is something of a thrill for a \nconstituent to see their own Senator on his way to work. If I thrill \nsomebody, they get thrilled easily. Nonetheless, it is the kind of \nexperience that the American people enjoy and historically have had in \ntheir Capitol Building. We want to make sure that continues.\n  The number of visitors each year is increasing more rapidly as the \noverall general population increases and as Americans get a little more \nmoney, a little more time, more leisure opportunities. I think it is \nwonderful they want to come to the seat of Government in the Capitol of \nthe United States and see how it operates. As they come in these \nincreased numbers, the tiny fringe of American citizens who represent a \nphysical threat come also in increased numbers. Security is a priority. \nIn this bill, we have made sure the resources will be available to \nprovide that kind of security.\n  As we have reviewed the security issue, we have made provisions in \nthis bill for a fairly significant change in the way security is \nprovided on the Capitol complex. We have provided transferring the \npolice who currently service the Government Printing Office and the \npolice who currently service the Library of Congress into the Capitol \nPolice. Rather than having three different police forces in a small \nphysical area, we will have only one.\n\n  Since assuming the chairmanship of this subcommittee, I have been \nworking towards this goal. I think we are now at the point where it \nmakes sense to provide this unified force to provide seamless security. \nUntil this time, the training for the police of the Library of Congress \nand the police at the Government Printing Office has been moving toward \nequity and par with the training given to the U.S. Capitol Police, so \nit will not be a big jump for these police officers to be in the same \nforce.\n  It will be an opportunity for many of the police officers in the two \nforces that are currently outside of the Capitol Police to increase \ntheir career opportunities because the Capitol Police Force is seen as \na higher level of pay and benefits and opportunity than the two smaller \nforces.\n  Additionally, it will mean we can bring the total security for the \nCapitol complex up to the level we want it at a faster pace because we \nneed additional officers. Additional officers are not provided \nautomatically by going out and hiring people. They have to go through a \ntraining period. By taking advantage of the pool of trained officers \nwho are already there for the Government Printing Office police and the \nLibrary of Congress police, and perhaps bringing some of the new hires \nin at a level where the requirement is not as high as it is in the \nCapitol itself, we can increase the speed by which we can get to the \nlevel we seek.\n  Some legitimate concerns have been raised about how this will work. \nThe General Accounting Office has been cooperating with the \nsubcommittee for quite some time in examining how it will work, but in \nthe bill we provide for the General Accounting Office to prepare a \nreport for the Appropriations Committee addressing those issues that \nhave most recently been raised, giving us an understanding of how they \ncan be dealt with. This provision was included at the request of \nSenator Feinstein who is particularly interested in the career path of \nthe Capitol Police men and women themselves. I think it is a very wise \naddition. I thank the Senator for her initiative in its inclusion. It \nwill ensure an orderly transition and protect the rights of the \naffected officers.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for her service as the ranking member on \nthis subcommittee. She brings a particular flavor of experience to the \nsubcommittee, having been an executive herself, as mayor of San \nFrancisco. I have been an executive but not of an enterprise that big. \nBetween the two of us, we have a good balance of the practical and \nadministrative experience that is necessary as we deal with some of \nthese administrative challenges. I thank the Senator for her service. I \nappreciate very much the support she has given.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 2603, \nthe legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  This is my second year as ranking member of the legislative branch \nsubcommittee. I have been very proud to serve alongside our dedicated \nand distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Bennett. Senator \nBennett is\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\nalways very open and very willing to discuss the various issues that \narise in relation to this bill. He has been very accommodating to my \nconcerns as well as those of other Senators. I think he has displayed \ngreat knowledge of the various Departments and Agencies that fall under \nthe legislative branch. It has been a real pleasure working with him.\n\n  Thanks to the allocation to our Legislative Branch Subcommittee by \nthe distinguished chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Byrd, this appropriation is $145 million in \nbudget authority greater than the House subcommittee's allocation, so \nthe bill before us now restores the House cuts of 2,112 employees, \nincluding 438 Capitol Police officers.\n  Although we were not able to fully fund every agency's request, I \nbelieve the committee has distributed the scarce resources as fairly as \npossible, and we were able to make modest increases in most agency \naccounts above last year's level.\n  Overall spending is increased by 3.7 percent over last year's bill. \nIn particular, I note that during markup of this year's bill, Chairman \nBennett agreed to include committee report language recommended by \nSenator Mikulski, having to do with the need for better employee \nrelations in the office of the Architect of the Capitol. Senator \nMikulski came to the subcommittee hearing and questioned the Architect \nof the Capitol directly concerning these matters. As a result of her \nefforts, the committee report language directs the Architect of the \nCapitol to establish a position of employee advocate, in an effort to \nimprove morale and employee relations in the office of the Architect.\n  In his remarks, Chairman Bennett has outlined for the Senate the \nvarious components of the bill, so I do not want to repeat that \nsummary. I do, however, wish to point out to the Senate that for the \nCapitol Police, the subcommittee in that regard has included an \nappropriation of $109.6 million for fiscal year 2001. This is an \nincrease of $22.8 million, or 26 percent over last year's enacted level \nof $86.8 million. This will fund 100 to 115 new Capitol Police \nofficers.\n  The funding level, we believe, will enable the Capitol Police to \nimplement the department's plan for posting two police officers at all \nkey and critical entries and exits throughout the Capitol complex.\n  I take this opportunity to thank all Capitol Police officers for \ntheir really outstanding service to the Members, to this Capitol, and \nto the tens of thousands of visitors to the Capitol each year. They do \na great job.\n  I know Senator Mikulski will be presenting a sense-of-the-Senate \ncommendation to the Capitol Police, with which I strongly agree. I \nthink it is important, because of what happened last year, to be able \nto really tell them how much we do appreciate their efforts. This can \nbe a very thankless job, particularly when there are tens of thousands \nof visitors milling through the Capitol each and every week. So I think \nwe both agree that they do a truly fine job and are, indeed, to be \ncommended.\n  I also thank Chairman Bennett for agreeing to include language in the \ncommittee report about which he spoke, which I requested, relating to \nthe proposed merger of the police forces at the Government Printing \nOffice and the Library of Congress with the Capitol Police Force. This \nstudy will enable a careful feasibility analysis to be carried out and \ncompleted prior to any consolidation. The GAO report, I believe, can be \ndone by July 1, giving the conference the opportunity to review its \nfindings at that time. I understand Chairman Bennett's intentions in \nthis area. He believes the proposed merger will result in greater \nefficiencies for the overall legislative branch police force. I believe \nit can be carried out in a way, as he just stated, that can maintain \nthe upward mobility and career path for officers.\n  I share that hope, and I believe that prior to proceeding with such a \nmerger, Congress should first have these views of the GAO to ensure \nthat no unforeseen problems exist in relation to such a consolidation \nor merger. Chairman Bennett has agreed to that study, and the committee \nreport ensures that the study will be completed by July 1.\n  In closing, I express appreciation and recognition to the very \ncapable staff who assisted Chairman Bennett and myself with the \nlegislative branch bill: Christine Ciccone, Chip Yost, Jim English, \nEdie Stanley, and Chris Kierig.\n  This is a very good bill. I urge my colleagues to give favorable \nconsideration to its passage in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3166\n\n         (Purpose: Commending the United States Capitol Police)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3166.\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Sec. ____. Sense of Senate Commending Capitol Police. (a) \n     The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States Capitol is the people's house, and, \n     as such, it has always been and will remain open to the \n     public;\n       (2) millions of people visit the Capitol each year to \n     observe and study the workings of the democratic process;\n       (3) the Capitol is the most recognizable symbol of liberty \n     and democracy throughout the world and those who guard the \n     Capitol guard our freedom;\n       (4) on July 24, 1998, Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective \n     John Michael Gibson of the United States Capitol Police \n     sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of hundreds of \n     tourists, Members of Congress, and staff;\n       (5) the officers of the United States Capitol Police serve \n     their country with commitment, heroism, and great patriotism;\n       (6) the employees of the United States working in the \n     United States Capitol are essential to the safe and efficient \n     operation of the Capitol building and the Congress; \n       (7) the operation of the Capitol and the legislative \n     process are dependent on the professionalism and hard work of \n     those who work here, including the United States Capitol \n     Police, congressional staff, and the staff of the \n     Congressional Research Office, the General Accounting Office, \n     the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Printing \n     Office, and the Architect of the Capitol; and\n       (8) the House of Representatives should restore the cuts in \n     funding for the United States Capitol Police, congressional \n     staff, and congressional support organizations.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Capitol Police and all legislative \n     employees are to be commended for their commitment, \n     professionalism, and great patriotism; and\n       (2) the conferees on the legislative branch appropriations \n     legislation should maintain the Senate position on funding \n     for the United States Capitol Police and all legislative \n     branch employees.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, that amendment is offered in behalf of \nmyself, Senator Daschle, Senator Murray, Senator Reid, Senator \nSarbanes, and Senator Wellstone.\n  The reason I wanted the amendment read is that I wanted to convey the \nimportance that many of us feel in commending the employees who work \nhere at the Capitol, both the police as well as other very important \ndepartments and divisions.\n  I first compliment Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein for the \noutstanding job they have done on moving the legislative branch \nappropriations bill. This sense of the Senate is in no way a commentary \non their leadership, which I think has been exemplary. I think their \nleadership has been sensitive to the needs of employees and sensitive \nto the needs of the taxpayers. So we thank you for the leadership you \nprovided, first in terms of the adequacy of the resources to do the job \nand, second, stewardship over Federal funds.\n  Also, I particularly want to thank Senators Feinstein and Bennett for \nadding the report language on the need for an employee ombudsman for \nthe employees of the Architect of the Capitol. I had come to their \nhearings, in which I was received with such collegiality that I am very \ngrateful. But we wanted to problem-solve over what was happening to the \nrestaurant employees who often believe they have nowhere to go with \nmany of their problems. Essentially, my own office was becoming the EEO \noffice for these employees.\n  I am ready to do that. I am ready to be the Senator from Maryland and \nI am ready to be the Senator for the restaurant employees. But I want \nthe Architect of the Capitol and those who work for him to do their job \nso that our employees have the same type of ombudsman and opportunity \nfor personnel\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\ngrievance that the private sector has. I thank them for that.\n\n  Let me come back to my amendment. My amendment is a sense of the \nSenate. It is not about money, but it is about morale. We want to say \nto the men and women who work at the U.S. Capitol that we know who they \nare and we value what they do.\n  These are the men and women who work in this building for the \nAmerican people and serve the Nation. The Capitol Police protect this \nbuilding which is a symbol of freedom and democracy the world over. \nThey protect all the people who visit the Capitol, and they protect \nMembers of Congress. It is the Capitol Police who ensure that everyone \nwho comes to the U.S. Capitol is safe and secure. They are the most \nunique law enforcement officers in the country. They protect the \nbuilding, and they protect the people, and they do it whether you are \nan American citizen or a foreign dignitary. They protect you whether \nyou are a Member of Congress or a member of a Girl Scout troop.\n  That is who they are. They are brave, they are resourceful, they are \ngallant, whether it is protecting a dignitary such as Nelson Mandela or \na Girl Scout troop from Maryland. They protect us from crooks, \nterrorists, people who are deranged, and anyone else who wants to harm \nus or the Capitol. Also, each is Officer Friendly welcoming people from \nall over America and all over the world.\n  The Capitol is a tourist attraction. Why? Do they come because we are \nso compelling, so charismatic, so gifted? No, they come to see \ndemocracy in action. We are the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Sometimes we act great, and sometimes we deliberate, and \nsometimes we even do something together. But people come to see us in \naction. Those police officers ensure this facility is open to the \npeople, preserving safety, often giving guidance and direction, many \neven learning foreign languages to do it.\n  Under their community police mentality, do not think, because they \ngreet visitors like Officer Friendly, that they are soft. Talk to the \nCapitol Police. We know, No. 1, that they are tough, they are \ncompetent, they are a modern police force. They take bomb squad \ntraining, they take antiterrorist training, and they also work to make \nsure they have the right approach to deal with each and every situation \nthey may encounter.\n  We need to make sure they have their jobs, they have their pay, they \nhave their benefits, and they have our respect. That is what the sense \nof the Senate resolution is all about: to support the Capitol Police \nand the other employees of the legislative branch.\n  The House was going to cut over 1,700 people and as many as 400 \npolice officers, which is 25 percent of the force. That is \nunacceptable. Then they were going to cut 117 staff from the \nCongressional Research Service. I will say what the Congressional \nResearch Service is. It is a group of people who are absolutely \ndedicated to giving us unbiased, accurate information and unbiased, \naccurate analysis so we can do our jobs. If we want to make some very \ngood decisions on the best models for the Older Americans Act or new \ntechnology breakthroughs, we should ensure adequate funding for the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  I will talk about the jobs being cut at GAO, the Government \nAccounting Office. The Government Accounting Office is not about \nkeeping the books, it is about keeping the books straight.\n  My colleagues and I know we continually turn to the staff at the \nGovernment Accounting Office to do investigations of waste and abuse, \nto give us insights into how better to manage and be better stewards of \nthe taxpayers' funds. People with those kinds of skills could leave us \nin a wink and be at a dot com in less than a nanosecond. If we are \ngoing to be on the broadband of the future, we need to make sure we \nhave the people with the skills to run a contemporary Congress. And, we \nneed to make sure that these people have security in their jobs and \nreliability of pay that they need to do just that.\n\n  I will now talk about our own congressional staff. They help us serve \nthe Nation. We all know what the people who work for us do. They are \nthe caseworkers who track down Social Security checks for our \nconstituents; they help us answer our mail; and they help us draft \nlegislation. It is the congressional staff who are now working, \nhopefully, to see that we pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It \nis the congressional staff who are now working around the clock so we \ncan have a conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Whether it's the Democratic side or the Republican side--the fact is \nthat our staff is on our side so we can be on the people's side. We \nshould not be cutting the very staff who help us get the job done.\n  We should not forget the restaurant workers, the custodial staff, and \nthe facility managers who ensure the U.S. Capitol is a building that is \ncomfortable, clean, and safe to visit.\n  We know about the draconian cuts in the House. Rumor has it they are \ngoing to restore some of those cuts. Good, because I would say to them, \nshame on them for what they were doing.\n  Do my colleagues know what the House intended to do? They intended to \ncut 400 Capitol Police officers, 114 employees from the Congressional \nResearch Service, and 700 employees from GAO--1,700 people could have \nlost their jobs.\n  This is not about job security, this is about maintaining the safety, \nsecurity, and cleanliness of the Capitol and the competency of staff so \nwe can do our job.\n  I hope we adopt this amendment 100-0.\n  I close my remarks by saying that the reason I am offering this sense \nof the Senate amendment is so we know and show the people who work here \nevery day that we are on their side. I believe Senators Bennett and \nFeinstein showed that by putting the money in the Federal checkbook, to \nshow there is money which hopefully ensures a high level of morale.\n  I am also offering this sense of the Senate amendment because we need \nto keep our promises. A short time ago, we had two gallant police \nofficers die in the line of duty--Officer Chestnut from Maryland and \nDetective Gibson from Virginia. We all attended their memorial \nservices. We mourned them. We tried to console their families. We \nthanked them for their sacrifice, and we said that a grateful Congress \nwill never forget. We should not forget Officer Chestnut, and we should \nnot forget Detective Gibson. We should not forget the men and women who \nwork here every day, in every way, in their own way dedicating their \nlives to serving us.\n  I hope we adopt this sense of the Senate amendment. Again, I thank \nSenators Bennett and Feinstein for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, for her leadership and for her fine statement on this \nimportant issue that is before the Senate today.\n  I am very proud to join my many colleagues who are here to commend \nthe men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police Force. Day in and day out, \nthese fine officers risk their lives to protect all of us who work in \nthe legislative branch. They also protect the millions of people who \ntravel from across the country to the Capitol every year.\n  They deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks. They certainly \ndo not deserve pink slips. Unfortunately, that is what the budget that \nwas recently passed by the House Republicans would give them. In fact, \nin the budget that was passed by the House Appropriations Committee, if \nit were to take effect, 438 members of the Capitol Police Force would \nbe relieved of duty. That is no way to thank some of the hardest \nworking and most dedicated people I have ever encountered. At the same \ntime that security experts are recommending to us we hire additional \nofficers so we can station two officers at every entrance, the House \nmajority's proposal goes in the opposite direction and requires us to \nfire officers.\n  Many people who are visiting the Nation's Capitol often turn to our \nCapitol Police Force for help in finding their representatives' offices \nor to get tour information. While our officers are always very gracious \nand helpful to everyone, the public really does not get a chance to see \nthe many other things they do.\n\n  Every day, these officers interact with thousands of people, \nconstantly\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\nassessing potential threats and stopping problems before they ever have \na chance to start.\n  In fact, in recent days, there have been two potential instances of \nviolence in this Capitol complex. Thanks to the quick work of the \nCapitol Police, and others, those situations were quickly controlled \nand no one was injured.\n  In a world where the number of threats seem to be growing, in an age \nwhen you never know when someone will act violently, and in a time when \nthe memories of the two officers who died protecting Members of this \nCongress are still fresh in our minds, we are all better off with a \nstrong, professional, and well-trained Capitol Police.\n  I think it is fair to say that through their work they help all of us \ncarry out the democratic process.\n  They do not just protect elected officials; they protect everyone who \nvisits and works near the Capitol Building.\n  I have been very disappointed to hear what some of the House \nRepublicans have said about the Capitol Police. I do not think those \ncomments reflect accurately on the work of the Capitol Police. I \ncertainly do not want the officers to think that those few Members \nreflect the way the rest of us feel about the work that you do.\n  I encourage my colleagues to do three things to honor these fine men \nand women.\n  First, I hope Members, as they go about their daily work, take a \nmoment to say thank you to the men and women of the Capitol Police \nForce, and let them know how much you appreciate the fine work they do.\n  Secondly, don't let the House Republican budget slap these officers \nin the face. Instead, let's give them the tools and the resources they \nneed to do their jobs effectively.\n  Finally, I hope all Members of the Senate will vote for the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution and show that you stand with us in supporting our \nCapitol Police.\n  I join the Senator from Maryland in commending Senator Bennett and \nSenator Feinstein for doing an outstanding job. I hope we can adopt \nthis resolution with a very strong vote so that we can maintain the \nnumbers that they have worked to put into this budget.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, and thank Senator \nMikulski for offering this resolution. I join my friend from the State \nof Washington in urging that all Members--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--support it. But I commend Senator Mikulski for her initiation of \nthis issue. And we express our appreciation to Senators Bennett and \nFeinstein for the action they have taken to express our full confidence \nand support for the police officers here at the Capitol.\n  How time flies, as we remember those memorial services for Officer \nChestnut and Detective Gibson, who gave up their lives in order to try \nto save the lives of the Members of Congress. That is the kind of \nprofessionalism that is typical of this corps of men and women and that \nall of us too often take for granted. I strongly oppose any provision \nin the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill that would slash the \nCapitol Police budget. Any such reduction would show a flagrant \ndisregard for the security of the Capitol. It is shocking that House \nRepublicans voted for this cut, after a non-partisan study concluded \nthat even the ``current Capitol Police Force staffing is insufficient \nto meet today's threat environment.'' Members on both sides of the \naisle should be able to agree on this basic necessity of our time.\n  The budget must have room for adequate law enforcement. Police \nofficers deserve a fair wage, equal to their risks and \nresponsibilities. The way we treat Capitol Police officers is a measure \nof the respect we hold for them as professionals. No officers should \nhave to jeopardize their lives to do their job because of inadequate \nresources and inadequate support.\n  The Capitol Police deserve enormous respect for their dedicated \nservice. What these officers do as professionals affects the welfare \nand the very lives of every member of Congress, every staff person, and \nevery visitor to the Capitol. They deserve our highest praise and \ngratitude for the skill and commitment they bring to their work.\n  The House Republican bill is a symptom of the larger problem facing \ncommunities across the country. Democrats have strongly supported the \nhiring of more local police officers and more school resource \nofficers--giving communities and schools the tools they need to ensure \nthe safety of citizens and students. Yet, Senate and House Republicans \nconsistently fight us every step of the way.\n  Last week, the Senate Republican leadership attempted to block debate \non sensible and long overdue gun control measures.\n  Last year, Republicans defeated an amendment to expand the Community \nOriented Policing Program, which would have provided additional needed \nresources to communities across the United States in the ongoing battle \nagainst crime. And Republicans continue to target that successful \nprogram for elimination;\n  On the Juvenile Justice bill, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort \nto create a National Center for School Safety and Youth Violence;\n  On the same bill, Republicans rejected a Democratic amendment to \nencourage more effective after-school programs, so that one million \nadditional children would be off the streets, out of trouble, and \nengaged in worthwhile school and community activities.\n  Republicans also defeated one Democratic amendment to expand the Safe \nSchools/Healthy Students initiative, to enable 150 additional \ncommunities to build partnerships between schools, parents and law \nenforcement to reduce truancy. The initiative would also provide \nmentoring for troubled youth, and teach students how to resolve \nconflict without resorting to violence.\n  Time and again, Democrats are placed in the position of fighting \nagainst Republican opposition in our effort to enact public safety \nmeasures that make sense--that keep families, schools and neighborhoods \nsafe. Republicans would rather kowtow to the National Rifle Association \nand other special interest groups than listen to the American people.\n\n  We too infrequently recognize the professionalism and also the \ndedication of these officers. The least we can do is to treat these men \nand women fairly. And more importantly, what we can do--and we should \ndo--is to commend them for their continued professionalism and for \ntheir devotion to duty.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation to the two \nleaders on this appropriations bill, Senators Bennett and Feinstein, \nfor what they have done in this area.\n  I will mention one other area, though, that finds fault with the \nactions of the leadership in the House of Representatives, in this \nterm, the Republican leadership.\n  I find it difficult to understand what the Republican leadership has \nagainst low-income workers. Here we have the greatest prosperity in the \nhistory of this country, and the Republican leadership has been aligned \nto deny us a simple vote on a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage for \n1 year, and a 50-cent increase in the next year. We have effectively \nbeen denied the opportunity to do so.\n  We have had to go through extraordinary gymnastics here on the floor. \nAnd then, finally, we end up with a 3-year bill, which is an insult to \neven the 10 million Americans who are working at the lowest levels of \nthe economic ladder, and then tying on to that $100 billion in unpaid \ntax goodies for the wealthiest individuals and the most powerful \ncorporations of this country. I think that is shameful action by this \nbody.\n  But we have been battling, and we are going to continue to battle. We \nare going to remind our friends that even though they do not like \nvoting on an increase in the minimum wage--and they use every effort to \ntry to avoid that--they are going to be faced with the continued \nopportunities to do so until we get a fair adjustment in the minimum \nwage, which these working families are due.\n  But now we have not only opposition in terms of an increase in the \nminimum wage, but opposition to an adjustment in the cost of living for \nthose individuals who are at the lowest level of service in the \nNational Government. The House Republican leadership wants\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nto make sure that these employees are not going to get any cost of \nliving increase, even though we have seen a generous cost-of-living \nincrease for the Members. These workers are the ones who will get no \nincrease--they are the press operators who work the presses, the \nbindery workers who bind the volumes of paper that we produce in this \nchamber, and the workers at the printing plant who haul paper and move \nthe printed products. There is no increase for even these workers, the \nlaborers in the printing office who publish the reports that go across \nto the libraries to inform the American people as to the actions of the \nCongress.\n  But it is not just the Government Printing Office employees who will \nsuffer from this cutting of the cost of living adjustment. Mail clerks \nand laborers in the Library of Congress, Secretaries in the \nCongressional Budget Office, and Information Receptionists, Library \nAides, and Reference Files Assistants at the Congressional Research \nService--those who carry and sort the mail, who type and file our \nvarious reports and documents, and those who assist with the \ncataloguing and researching of all the reports and documents that we in \nCongress generate--all of these employees will be denied a fair cost of \nliving increase by the House Republican leadership.\n  These are among the lowest of the low paid by the Federal Government. \nThey are men and women who have a great sense of pride and dignity in \nthe work they do. They are part of the team in terms of trying to serve \nthis country. Nonetheless, the way we deal with them is to say: No, you \nare not going to be able to get the adjustment that others are going to \nbe able to get in the Congress, and that those of the higher level pay \nscales are going to get in general.\n\n  That is basically unfair, and it is unwise and unjust. I do not know \nwhat the explanation is. Why is it? Why is it that we effectively make \nsure that those individuals who are working in the darkest areas of the \nbuilding and are absolutely key elements do not get an increase? If you \ntake those individuals out of this whole process, you are not going to \nget the printing of the records, which are reflective of the Government \nin action, and you are going to basically paralyze, in a very important \nrespect, the representatives of Government having the information which \nis necessary to make sound judgment.\n  Maybe there is an explanation for it, but I do not see it. It is \nunfair and unjust. It is something where we have to say, if you have \nopposition to an increase in the minimum wage, you are hurting those \nworkers. And who are those workers? They are primarily women because 60 \npercent of minimum-wage workers are women. This impacts children \nbecause fully one-third of the women who are earning the minimum wage \nhave children under 18. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights \nissue because a disproportionate percent of minimum-wage workers are \nmen and women of color.\n  Most of all, it is a fairness issue that men and women who are going \nto work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should not live in \npoverty in the richest country in the world, when we are having the \nmost extraordinary economic prosperity in the history of this Nation. \nIt just is wrong.\n  We are facing that blind opposition by the Republican leadership in \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States that \nsays no to those working members of our economy. Who are they? They are \nthe men and women who work in our nursing homes looking after parents \nwho may be in nursing homes. They are the men and women who are working \nin our schools as assistant teachers. They are men and women who are \nlooking after children when their parents are out there working and \ntrying to put food on their table.\n  We are saying, no, they are not going to get an increase in the \nminimum wage. No, we are not going to give it to them. And no, we are \nnot going to give a cost of living increase to other members who are at \nthe lower level of the pay scale in our nation's Capitol.\n  That is an absolutely unfair, unjust, and unacceptable position. I am \ndelighted that here in the Senate, in a bipartisan way, that position \nhas been rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank both Senator \nBennett and Senator Feinstein for their important work. I just want to \necho the comments of my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nin support of providing adequate funding to pay all the people who help \nus do our work in the Senate. I too support a wage increase for the \nmany people who work here, who don't make near the money we make, don't \nhave near the salary we have. I promise the Chair that if it were the \nHouse Democrats who had made these cuts, my condemnation would be just \nas strong. The action the House took, cutting funding for salaries was \na mistake, and it wasn't fair. I think that on the Senate side, in a \nbipartisan way, we have done a good job.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and all the other Senators here, including \nSenators Daschle, Murray, Reid, Sarbanes, and Kennedy, for their \nsupport for full funding for the Capitol Police Department. I just want \nto read the last part of the Mikulski amendment, that I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     Capitol Police and all legislative employees are to be \n     commended for their commitment, professionalism, and great \n     patriotism; and the conferees on the legislative branch \n     appropriations legislation should maintain the Senate \n     position on funding for the United States Capitol Police and \n     all legislative branch employees.\n\n  My hope is that all 100 Senators will come out here on the floor and \nspeak in support of this amendment and in support of all the work that \nCapitol Police do to keep the Capitol safe. In a way, it is almost \nshocking that the Senator from Maryland feels the need to introduce \nthis sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I think we ought to really think \ndeeply as to why it is necessary to come out with an amendment that \nbasically says that we value the Capitol Police and all the Senate \nemployees.\n  I just want to make this appeal to all my colleagues that they come \ndown to the floor and express their support for all the people who work \nin the Senate. I hope Republican Senators will come out here as well \nand speak. Maybe all of us can take 15 or 20 minutes. I think that \nsends a much more powerful message.\n  What I regret is that the House Republicans chose to cut the Capitol \nPolice budget by 11 percent; that is a $10 million cut. Here is the \nproblem. Forget the money. Anybody who watches us on the floor might \nsay: What are they talking about, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, an \n11-percent cut, a $10 million cut; what does it mean?\n  This is what it means. First of all, we will never forget that we \nlost two officers, Officer Chestnut and Agent Gibson, in 1998. Many of \nus were at their service. It was so moving and so powerful. We made a \ncommitment we would do everything possible to make sure that the police \nofficers here--Capitol Police officers--would be working under the best \nof conditions, that they would be safe, that they could do their job \nand not be put in peril.\n  Their job is to protect all the people who visit the Capitol. I have \ngiven enough speeches to deafen the gods about this. I have probably \nspoken 15 times on the floor of the Senate in support of the Capitol \npolice. Today, I get to come out here as an original cosponsor of this \namendment and say I really believe it is critically important that the \nCapitol police be recognized for the worth of their work, the \nimportance of their work, and also that we make sure we do everything \nhumanly possible, as legislators, so that they work under the best \nconditions, which translates into making sure we do everything we know \nhow to do to make sure we never again lose any police officers.\n  What the House Republicans did in their proposal would mean the \nelimination of some 400 police officers. That is no way to say thank \nyou to the Capitol police--to have an 11-percent cut in their budget, \nto have a cut of hundreds of police officers, to have even less backup \nfor officers; that is no way to say thank you to the Capitol Hill \nPolice. It is certainly no way to honor Officer Chestnut, Officer \nGibson, and their families--no way.\n\n  So I want to make crystal clear on the floor of the Senate that I \nbelieve that it is important that we all speak--not just Democrats, but \nRepublicans as well--in support of this amendment to\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\nsend a message as Senators to the Capitol Hill police and their \nfamilies that we have a tremendous amount of appreciation for the work \nthey do, we value the work they do, we value them as friends, and we \njust simply want to say thank you and we intend to continue to support \nthe Capitol Police. In addition, I believe that the work that Senator \nBennett and Senator Feinstein have done matters more than any words I \ncan utter here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The last point that this amendment is important, and the reason I \nhope Senators will speak on it, is to show our united support and \nrespect for the men and women of the Capitol Police force, who protect \nus each and every day. In the days following the House actions to cut \nfunding for the force, many of the police officers were just \ndemoralized. How many people have said--as a matter of fact, we are \nlosing Capitol Hill police members to the D.C. Police Force because \nthey do feel they have the respect and support of the people they are \nhere to protect.\n  But part of it is, I say to Senator Reid, who was a Capitol Hill \npoliceman--the only Member of the Senate who served on that police \nforce--that part of the question of whether or not people continue to \nwork here and feel good about their work is whether or not people think \nthey are respected. You know, in light of what we have gone through for \nthe past several years, when you then cut the budget and you \npotentially put some of these police officers in harm's way, you \ncertainly are not communicating a message to these police that we value \ntheir work. You are communicating the opposite message. I think what \nthe House Republican ``leadership'' did on this issue was one of the \nworst things that has been done here, at least since I have served \nstarting in 1991.\n  I feel really good about what we have done on the Senate side. I feel \nreally good that we have done it in a bipartisan way, and I feel good \nthat I get a chance to support the Mikulski amendment. I want to, one \nmore time, make the appeal to Republican Senators: Look, the truth of \nthe matter is--and I don't want to get people angry at me--it is not as \nif we are doing a lot right now and we don't have time for people to \ncome out and speak. I think we ought to get as many Senators as \npossible to speak on this resolution because it is important that we \ncommunicate a message of strong support for these police officers.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nByrd, Bennett, Feinstein, Kennedy, and Durbin be added as cosponsors to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthis amendment be taken at the appropriate time as agreed upon by the \nleaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I amend the Senator's unanimous-consent \nrequest that the vote on the pending amendment occur at 9:45 on \nThursday with no amendments in order to the amendment, and that there \nbe 10 minutes of remarks prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, to make the record clear with respect to \nthe statement that was made earlier about employees of the Government \nPrinting Office not receiving an increase in this bill, Senator \nFeinstein and I have provided funds so those employees will receive the \nmandatory increases.\n  It is a little bit confusing as to how the bookkeeping works. The \ndollar amount stays level, but because we researched the number of \npositions that had not been filled in previous years and we are funding \nthose positions, we recognize the money that would go for those \nunfilled positions will be available for the mandatory increases for \nemployees.\n  I want to make sure the record reflects that. We are not, in fact, \nforcing those employees to go without their standard mandatory \nincreases in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could I ask my colleague for 5 seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I forgot to also thank Jim Ziglar, the \nSergeant at Arms on the Senate side, who has done great work on this \nquestion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Maryland.\n  First, I thank Senator Bennett of Utah and Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Legislative Branch. They have important \nresponsibilities. They have met the responsibility and have done it \nvery well in a very difficult time. I commend both of them for their \nhard work in preparing this important legislation.\n  I also commend my colleague from the State of Maryland, Senator \nMikulski. Because of the proximity of Maryland to the District of \nColumbia, Senator Mikulski has said that she oftentimes feels that she \nis the Senator for so many people who work on Capitol Hill who come to \nher with their concerns. I know that is a burden for her to carry, but \nit is one that she carries with grace.\n  The offering today of this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is so \ntypical of her dedication and loyalty to the men and women who serve us \nhere in the Capitol.\n  This Capitol Building is one of the most recognizable buildings in \nthe world. People literally come from across the United States and from \naround the world to see this magnificent dome.\n  You can never forget the first time you see it. I can still remember, \nI guess almost 38 years ago, when I first saw it in person. It made \nsuch an impact on me as a student. Little did I realize that I might \nsomeday serve in this building. But so many millions of people come to \nthis site on this great hill to see this building, to walk through its \nHalls, and to witness the history that is here portrayed; to see the \nmagnificent statues in Statutary Hall; to recall the history of this \nbuilding; the Rotunda; the times that America has gathered in this \nplace to pay homage to the greats who have served our Nation; to recall \nhistory when that same Rotunda was used as a hospital for Union \nsoldiers who were injured in battle.\n\n  It is a great building and contains a great history. The dome on this \nbuilding, which was built during the era when Abraham Lincoln of \nSpringfield, IL, served as President during the Civil War, is really a \nbeacon not just for our Nation but for the world.\n  All of the visitors who come here to be part of this great American \nhistorical moment expect the very best treatment, and they deserve it. \nThat is why it is hard for me to understand what happened in the House \nof Representatives when the Republican leadership decided they would \nmake a substantial cut--a one-third cut or more--in the number of \npolice officers who would be in this building to protect all of us who \nwork here and all of us who visit here.\n  It is hard to imagine how that could occur under ordinary \ncircumstances; with the millions of people who flock to this building, \nthat we would cut back in the security and protection of those visitors \nand employees. It is impossible to understand that suggestion in light \nof what occurred just 2 years ago in this same building--when, on a \nFriday afternoon, a deranged man came to this building with a gun and \nopened fire, sadly killing two of the very best Capitol Hill policemen, \nOfficer Chestnut and Officer Gibson.\n  Those two men died in the line of duty protecting all of us--\nprotecting\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\nthe visitors to this building, protecting the workers who come to this \nbuilding each day, protecting many of the same Members of Congress who \nhave sponsored on the House side this amendment to reduce the number of \nCapitol Hill policemen. It is an incredible thing that only 2 years \nlater we would forget that basic lesson.\n  I remember going to the memorial service for the two officers, as so \nmany Members of Congress did, to show our respect and our gratitude to \ntheir families--to try to express with our presence what we couldn't \nsay in words; to thank them and their families for what they had given \nus. So many people were chocked up that day as they looked across at \nthe rows of family members and saw not only the spouses but a lot of \nyoung children who would never know their fathers, who, frankly, would \nmiss out on many of life's great moments with their fathers, because \nOfficer Chestnut and Officer Gibson had given their lives to protect \nus.\n  Many of the same Members of Congress who stood choking back the tears \nthat day are, 24 months later, offering amendments to reduce the number \nof Capitol Hill policemen.\n  How short is their memory? Can they not recall those moments? I \ncertainly can. I know Senator Mikulski can.\n  As I come into this building each day and into the office building \nthat we use, I see these men and women in uniform standing there doing \ntheir very best to make sure people know the right place to go and \nwhere the offices are located, but also keeping in mind that at any \ngiven moment they could have their lives on the line.\n  When Senator Mikulski introduces this resolution, when Senator \nWellstone takes the floor repeatedly and talks about the security at \nthe doorways of the entrances to the buildings on Capitol Hill, they \nare talking about a life and death issue for these men and women. They \ndon't just come to work, as many of us do, and shuffle the papers and \ndo our business. They put their lives on the line every day. The \nthought that the House Republicans would suggest cutting by one-third \nthe number of police officers is incredible when you consider what is \nat stake here and what we lived through only 2 years ago.\n  I certainly commend my colleague, Senator Mikulski, for offering this \namendment. I hope every Member of the Senate in a show of fidelity and \nsupport to the men and women who protect us every day will join as \ncosponsors. This should have a 100-0 vote because it really is an \nindication of what we feel about these people who mean so much to us \nand who go out of their way to be kind and helpful.\n  Some of my favorites--I hate to pick out a few because I know there \nare many who deserve recognition--Officer Charlie Coffer, who stands at \nthe Russell door every day, is a joy in my life. There cannot be a \nnicer person on Capitol Hill in any spot. He brings a smile to my lips \nevery time I walk through the door.\n  Officer Best works on the door on the Senate side. I came here at 10 \no'clock one night with a group of visitors, and I asked if it would be \npossible to walk through Statuary Hall. He went out of his way to clear \nthings and make sure we could bring those visitors through for the time \nof their lives, to be able to walk through this great building in the \ndarkness of night, and sense the history of this building.\n  Officer Best, Officer Coffer, and so many others, go out of their way \nto do such a great job. If they go out of their way every day, we \nshould go out of our way to show our gratitude and respect by passing \nthis amendment and this important appropriations bill.\n  I close by referring to one other item which I hope this \nappropriations subcommittee can consider. It has come to our attention \nthat some of the workers on the Senate side, particularly those \nassociated with the restaurant, are technically part-time employees. \nWhen we are in session, they may work a full 40-hour week; of course, \nwhen we are out of session, they don't. Because of this part-time \nstatus, many of them do not qualify for basic employee protection life/\nhealth insurance. It is hard for me to imagine the men and women who \nserve food every day, who make sure this building runs smoothly, don't \nreceive the most basic protections which we would expect for any member \nof our family.\n  I ask the committee, I ask Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein, if \nthey would be kind enough to look into this situation. I am happy to \nwork with them and make certain we are treating all of the men and \nwomen who work here with respect in giving them the benefits which we \nwould expect every American who comes to work every day to enjoy. I \nthink we ought to join to try to set such an example.\n  If this is not a major problem, I apologize to the subcommittee. \nHowever, if it is one that I have been told is a concern to many of the \nemployees, I hope we can work together to resolve it.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nfine work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to \ncommend the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett, and the \nranking member, Senator Feinstein, for their efforts in bringing out of \nthe Appropriations Committee and out of their subcommittee prior \nthereto, a bill which I know that all Senators can support.\n  As noted by the Chairman and Ranking Member, the allocation to the \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee here in the Senate was substantially \nlarger than the amount allocated to the Subcommittee's House \ncounterpart. That increased allocation was distributed fairly \nthroughout the Legislative Branch.\n  In particular, as has been noted by Chairman Bennett and Senator \nFeinstein, the bill as reported by the Committee recommends a \nsubstantial increase for the Capitol Police. I commend these two very \nable Senators for their excellent work in recommending this increase \nfor the Capitol Police and for the increases they recommended \nthroughout the legislative branch. It should be kept in mind something \nthat Members of this body often forget, perhaps at least temporarily, \nthat the Legislative Branch is the people's branch.\n  I stand here on this floor time after time to say that again and \nagain that this is the first of the three branches of our Government \nmentioned in the Constitution, article I. We should adequately fund the \nlegislative branch. I believe this bill does so. We certainly bend over \nbackwards time and time again to fund the executive branch, and the \nexecutive branch includes in its budget on every occasion that a budget \nthat comes here, additional persons for various segments of the \nexecutive branch. In many instances, few questions are asked, if any. \nSo the executive branch adds to its numbers by the hundreds, from time \nto time. Yet we respond quite niggardly with appropriations for the \nlegislative branch. We are always pinching pennies when it comes to the \nlegislative branch.\n  The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, as reported by the House \nAppropriations Committee, contains major cuts throughout the \nlegislative branch, including the appropriation for the Capitol Police. \nRather than recommending an increase sufficient to continue the growth \nin the Capitol Police force that we approved two years ago as a result \nof the tragic shooting that took the lives of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson, the bill, reported by the other body requires \ndramatic reductions in the Capitol Police force. Through a combination \nof the regular Fiscal Year 2000 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act \nand the additional funding that had already been provided in the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, sufficient resources \nhave been provided for 1,511 Capitol Police personnel. That increase in \npersonnel was carefully considered as part of an overall plan to \nimprove security of the U.S. Capitol complex. It was to be a multi-year \neffort with these additional forces being brought on board as quickly \nas the new hires could be trained. Yet, that is not what has been \nrecommended in the bill as reported in this year's bill by the House \nAppropriations Committee. That recommendation provides only $70 \nmillion, a cut of almost $39 million below the budget request, and \nprovides for a level of only 1058 personnel, a reduction of 453 \npositions! Think about that. We all talk about how strongly we support \nreducing crime throughout the Nation. Let's\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\nstart right here in the Nation's Capitol, right now! We have put \n100,000 cops on the beat across the Nation. A number of years ago, \nSenator Gramm of Texas and I offered an amendment which was \nsubsequently enacted to establish a Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.\n\n  I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate at that \ntime. Since that time, tens of billions of dollars have been \nappropriated over the years from that trust fund. As a result, we have \nseen a marked improvement in the statistics on violent crime all across \nthis Nation. When the tragic shooting of Officer Chestnut and Detective \nGibson occurred in the Nation's Capitol in the summer of 1998, we all \nquickly rushed forward with promises of increased funding for the \nsecurity measures for the Capitol complex.\n  I have seen this happen time and time and time again over the 48 \nyears I have been virtually an inhabitant of this building. The \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois said a moment ago he first came to \nthis building 38 years ago. Mr. President, I came to this building my \nfirst time almost 70 years ago. I was a boy scout from the coal fields \nin southern West Virginia. Of course, it was never meant that I should \never become a Member of this body, not from the lowly beginnings from \nwhich I sprang. Upon that occasion when I sat up in the galleries, I \nsaid to the scoutmaster: I'm coming back here one day; I'm going to be \na Member of this body. How little did I know that that might come true, \nreally, when I came to this Capitol almost 70 years ago.\n  I was a Member of the other body when the shooting occurred in the \ngallery of that body. I was sitting on the opposite side, on the \nDemocratic side, from where the shooting took place. The shooting \noccurred from the galleries just over the Republican side of the aisle. \nAt first, I thought it was a demonstration of some kind, perhaps some \nfirecrackers or some blank bullets.\n  I saw--I believe it was one of the Members named Jensen. I saw other \nMembers fall. I saw one fall right in the center of the floor, towards \nthe front of the House Chamber. I saw Members running to the Cloakroom.\n  A Member from Tennessee had sat in a chair to my left. If I were \nlocated in the House Chamber right now, he sat just over to my left. He \nwas called to go out to the Cloakroom to take a telephone call. While \nhe was out, that shooting occurred and a bullet pierced the very center \nof the chair in which he had sat. The bullet would have gone through \nhis heart.\n  A Member of the House who sat just directly behind him was from \nAlabama, and that Member suffered a wound in his leg.\n  I remember going up to the galleries after they had taken the \ndemonstrators out. There was a TV camera there. They asked me what I \nthought about it. I said, ``It just shows what a cockeyed old world \nthis has come to be.''\n  The world hasn't improved any. As a matter of fact, it has gotten \nworse. I can remember some years ago when there was an explosion on the \nnext floor below us in the Capitol. A bomb exploded right down here \nwhere the old barber shop was, where the Senators used to get haircuts. \nWe were criticized so much because we got haircuts in the Capitol that \nwe closed down the room, the barber shop. But in one of the little \nrestrooms just outside the premises of that barber shop a bomb \nexploded.\n  Then, a few years later, a bomb exploded right here near the Senate \nChamber, beyond the Republican Cloakroom, out in the corridor there. I \nwas the Democratic leader at that time, and I had an office just a few \nfeet away from where that bomb was deposited behind a bench where one \nof those Vice Presidential busts is now located. That blast occurred at \n11 o'clock at night.\n  As Howard Baker stated the next morning, it could very well have \nkilled a Republican Member or Members in that Republican Cloakroom that \nnight. The explosion was directed toward the Republican Cloakroom. \nNevertheless, that explosion blew off the huge doors to my office in S-\n208. It blew those doors over on the desks where members of my staff \nworked. As I say, fortunately, it was at 11 o'clock at night, but it \njust filled my offices with dust. It broke the picture window in that \nbeautiful office.\n  I have been around this Capitol 48 years, and I know these things \nhappen, and they will happen again. They will happen again. One of \nthese days there may be a major catastrophe in this Capitol. And every \ntime there is a rush to improve the security, and then after a few days \nor weeks or months, that subsides and the security lapses.\n  This is the most beautiful Capitol in the world, bar none, with \nBrumidi's paintings. Brumidi came to this country in 1855 and he died \nin 1880. He painted these beautiful frescoes in the Rotunda. I have my \noffice now in his old studio down on the next floor. It is in this \nCapitol that Webster and Hayne had their famous debate. It was not in \nthis Chamber but in the Old Chamber down the hall. Webster and Clay, \nand Calhoun--where the old Senate sat from 1810 to 1859; the Senators \nin 1859 moved to this Chamber. Ah, what history here--history, the \nhistory of the greatest Republic that was ever created--history fills \nthese Halls. If you walk in these Halls at night, you can almost hear \nthe words of Webster and Clay and Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. Yet, \nthis Capitol is put in danger by reductions of this kind in \nappropriations.\n  Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein have performed a great deed for \nthe Nation, for the men and women of yesterday, for the citizens of \ntoday, and for our posterity--those who will walk these Halls in future \nyears and gaze with wonder at the beauty of this Capitol.\n  A lot is expected of the men and the women who serve on the U.S. \nCapitol Police Force. We expect them to be highly professional, highly \nskilled, and highly motivated individuals who perform their duties well \nat all times. They must be courteous to the many thousands, the \nmillions of people who visit this Nation's Capitol while at the same \ntime being alert to the dangers that can arise at any time with little \nnotice or without notice.\n  Members of the House and Senate, our staffs--Jim English, others on \nthe staff of the Appropriations Committee who sit on this side, and \nstaff people who sit across the aisle and aid Senator Bennett; there \nare thousands of them who work in and around this Capitol--their lives \nare at stake, their lives and the lives of the tourists who come here \nfrom the mountains of West Virginia and the level plains of the \nMidwest, the prairies, from the Rocky Mountains and the sunny shores of \nCalifornia. They come here to see this Capitol and to marvel at it, to \ngaze in awe. How many times a day I see those tourists come in here and \nlook about these halls; they just gaze in awe. They seem to be entirely \nunaware that somebody else is walking by. They are entranced by what \nthey see in this Capitol.\n  These visitors deserve no less from our U.S. Capitol Police Force. \nBut if we are to have the kind of police force that exhibits these \nqualities and these skills, we cannot subject these men and women to \nthe specter of having their jobs eliminated in massive numbers on the \nheels of initiating a program to substantially increase their numbers.\n  It would be unwise in the extreme to cut security personnel at the \nCapitol complex, so I will join Chairman Bennett and Senator Feinstein \nand other members of our committee in defending the funding levels \nrecommended in the Senate bill for the U.S. Capitol Police. I trust we \nwill succeed in convincing our counterparts on the other side of the \nCapitol of the need for that increase.\n  I congratulate Senator Mikulski, too, on the resolution which she has \noffered, which she was kind enough to allow me to cosponsor. That is a \ngood amendment and this is a good bill which, I believe, deserves the \nsupport of every Senator.\n  I again congratulate Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein. I again \nthank them. The Senate is in their debt. The Congress is in their debt. \nThe people of the country are in their debt because this is the \npeople's Capitol. This is the people's branch.\n  These two Senators have done excellent work in bringing \nrecommendations to the Senate. I salute them, thank them, commend them, \nand say: Long may the great God who is the Judge of us all and in Whose \nhands rests the destiny of the Nation continue to bless this great \ncountry and this great Capitol of the United States.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems just a day or two ago--the fact of \nthe matter is, it was almost 40 years ago--that I served as a Capitol \npoliceman. I can remember being out on the steps on the east front of \nthe Capitol. I worked the night shift while I attended law school \nduring the day. I remember one of my first duty stations was to be \npresent during the concerts which took place every night.\n  I can remember a lot of things. One thing I remember is Senator Carl \nHayden coming to the concerts every night. He had been in Congress more \nthan 50 years at that time. He was still mentally alert but physically \ninfirm. He would come in his wheelchair. As a Capitol policeman, I \nwould stand near him during these concerts.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, the most dangerous thing I did as a \nCapitol policeman was to direct traffic. Directing traffic was a little \ndangerous in those days. I can remember that on Constitution Avenue, \nthey had railroad tracks. And there were cars all over the place. It \nsounds a little facetious when I say it was the most dangerous thing I \ndid, but it was true. I was barely old enough to carry a gun. One had \nto be 21. I carried a pistol. Thank goodness, I never took it out of \nthe holster during the time I was a Capitol policeman.\n  I have very fond memories of being a Capitol policeman. Like Senator \nByrd, I can remember coming from a town of 200 at the southern tip of \nthe State of Nevada where we had a policeman by the name of Big John. \nGrowing up in Searchlight, he was ``the law.'' But here in Washington, \nfor me to walk in a uniform at night down these Halls--there was nobody \nin these Halls when I made my rounds--it brought a chill to my soul, \nthinking I was able to work in this Capitol and walk past the statues \nof the great men and women who made this country what it is.\n  For me now, to think I have served in the House of Representatives, \nthe greatest democratic body in the history of the world--no one has \never served in the House unless they have been elected. In the Senate, \nthere have been people who have served who had been appointed, but \nnever in the House of Representatives. And then to serve in the Senate. \nI told one of my friends I was lucky. He said: ``You are not lucky, you \nare blessed.'' That is really true. I was wrong, and he was right.\n  I am blessed to serve in the Senate of the United States. I walk down \nthese Halls many times a week to Senator Byrd's old office. As you \nknow, the Democratic whip's office is down on the next floor. Senator, \ndid you know that the fireplace was put in that office in 1824? When I \nwalk down there, even with people around, I get that same chill I had \nas a young man in a police uniform. This is truly a wonderful building. \nI sometimes wonder why I am so fortunate to serve here. I am, and I \naccept those responsibilities along with the privilege.\n  I have never forgotten that I was a Capitol Police officer. I can \nremember when I was transferred to the House. In 1961, Henry Gonzalez \nfrom Texas, was a freshman Congressman. I can remember the very lonely \nduty I had over there. This freshman Congressman from Texas worked late \nat night, and he would say to me: ``Can I bring you something to eat? \nCan I bring you something to drink?''\n  Another Member I remember was Congressman Lindsay from New York, who \nlater became the mayor of New York City. These are the two people I \nremember reaching out to a police officer, reaching out in kindness. It \nmade me feel good about my job.\n  Like Senator Wellstone so eloquently stated, I have tried to be kind, \nthoughtful, and considerate to police officers. They have such an \nimportant job, and are often overlooked because things get so crazy \naround here.\n  The world is so different than it was 40 years ago. Unfortunately, \nthere are people who are hellbent upon destroying this facility, not \njust damaging the Rayburn Building. I say to my friend from West \nVirginia, immediately before that bomb went off in the Rayburn \nBuilding, the Nevada State Society held a meeting there. We were the \nlast group to meet in that room. I was a Member of the House at the \ntime that explosion took place, and I remember the incident as if it \nhappened yesterday.\n\n  Today, it seems that people are no longer content with blowing out a \nfew windows. They want to destroy this facility, and, if given the \nopportunity, they could. That is why we have to reach out to the men \nand women who provide security for us on a daily basis. But, it's not \njust us, Mr. President. The Capitol Police provides security for all \nthe staff we see throughout these buildings, the people without whom we \nwould not be able to do our jobs. Most importantly, the Capitol Police \nis also charged with providing security for the millions of people who \ncome to this beautiful Capitol complex each year.\n  We simply must ensure that we take care of the Capitol Police. The \nCapitol Police are very well trained. Today, as I was proceeding to a \nmeeting in the Dirksen Building, I saw a man climb out of a car dressed \nin SWAT team apparel. I asked the officer with whom I was walking about \nhim, and he told me that he was a member of the SWAT team. He was \ndressed like you would see in a movie. He is here because he is needed. \nWe have demolition experts, people who are experts in defusing bombs. \nThey are called upon to do that more often than we know. Again, they \nare here because, unfortunate as it may be, they are needed.\n  Often time, we only hear about the heroics of the Capitol Police when \nsomething goes wrong. We know when someone breaks a bottle and tries to \nattack other people because the press is there to capture the event-in-\nthe-making. We know about the tragic deaths of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson because the press covered it in such detail. The many \nthings we do not know about are the tragedies that are averted because \nof the skill and proficiency of the Capitol Police. Their training is \nas good as any police force in America.\n  When I served on the Capitol Police, all that training was not \nnecessary. When people came to this building, we did not check to see \nwhat they had in their bags. We didn't have electronic machines for \nvisitors to pass through. We did not check to see if they were staff. \nOur responsibilities were much different, much simpler.\n  Every day, these men and women put their lives on the line for \nAmerica--not for me, not for the Presiding Officer, but for America, to \nprotect this beautiful structure and the people who visit it.\n  Without belaboring the point, I have been fortunate to do a few \nthings in my adult life. I am so privileged to represent the people of \nNevada in this body. But this Senator is just as proud to have been a \npolice officer, and I am proud of the fact I was a Capitol policeman.\n  I extend to my friend from Utah, the chairman of this subcommittee, \nand my friend from California, the ranking member, my appreciation for \ncrafting this bill on a bipartisan basis. Not only have they reached \nout to protect the Capitol Police, which is so important, but they have \nalso reached out to protect the rest of the staff.\n  I had the good fortune to serve as chairman of the legislative branch \nappropriations subcommittee when I first came to the Senate. I loved \nthat job, because we did some very constructive things.\n  We see things in the other body on the other side of the Capitol that \nhave not been very constructive. In fact, they have been destructive. I \nwould say to my colleagues that the chairman and ranking member have \nbrought about some dignity to the legislative branch of Government.\n  The other body, for example, drastically cut the Government Printing \nOffice which does very important things for this country. In the State \nof Nevada, the Government Printing Office has 11 different institutions \nto which they supply periodicals and other materials.\n  Across the country, there are more than 1,300 institutions that serve \nas official depository libraries which disseminate more than 16.1 \nmillion official Government documents to the general public every \nyear--every year, over 16 million documents the public gets from the \nGovernment Printing Office.\n  In Nevada, there are 11 such libraries, the 2 largest of which exist \non the campuses of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Reno.\n  The depository is a bargain when one considers the program as a \nwhole.\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\n  While the GPO supplies the printed materials, the university, \ncollege, and other public libraries which participate in the Federal \nDepository Library Program supply the space to house the documents, the \nstaff to assist the public, as well as the computers, the photocopiers, \nand other equipment needed to use this information. In other words, the \nGPO embodies the public's access to government.\n  What if we were to cut off that access? There would be--rightfully \nso--a public outcry that such access to government had been denied. If \nwe were to cut back the staff the way the other body did, that is what \nwe would have to do--limit the public's access to their government. The \nranking member and the chairman have made every effort to stop this, \nand that is very important.\n  I also think that it is very important we recognize that the General \nAccounting Office--because of the work you have done--has been, in \neffect, spared. We complain because we do not get our reports and other \ninformation fast enough from the General Accounting Office. Why? \nBecause in the past we have cut them back a significant amount. They \nare already working with a very lean staff. Thank goodness the ranking \nmember and the chairman have taken care of this. This Senator \nappreciates that very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator was talking about how the Capitol Police are \ncareful to search our briefcases and to be on the alert for all people \nwho walk through the doors.\n  A couple weeks ago, after I reached my house one evening, I got to \nlooking for something, and I decided I left it on my desk in my office.\n  I said to my wife: I am going back up to the Capitol.\n  She said: Do you want me to go with you?\n  I said: Yes.\n  She and I are going to be married, by the way, this coming Monday, 63 \nyears.\n  As I said, she said: Do you want me to go with you?\n  Anyhow, she came up here with me. I had already changed clothes. I \nhad an old slouch rainhat on. I had some old wear-around-the-house \ntrousers and some scuffy-looking shoes. I came up here with a slouch \nsweatshirt and had it outside my trousers.\n  I walked in down here and went through the magnetometer. I guess I am \nthe only Senator who goes through the magnetometer. I don't know. But I \ndo. I do that so the police and others who may get some complaints from \nsome people who go through that magnetometer can say, Senator Byrd, who \nhas been around this floor longer than any other Member of the House or \nSenate, who has been around here longer than any staff member on this \nHill, goes through that.\n  So I went through that magnetometer. And there were two policemen \nstanding there. They were not the regular attendants at the door. And \nthey did not see any ID card on me with a chain around my neck. So one \nof them said to me: Sir, are you a staff member? And I laughed. I said: \nNo, I'm not a staff member. I just want to compliment you on doing the \nkind of job you are supposed to do. No, I'm not a staff member.\n  So they were on the alert. They did what they were supposed to do. I \nsalute them for it. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much, I say to Senator Byrd.\n  Let me say that I sat with awe as I listened to your presentation. It \nwas very well done, as usual. There is no one in this institution who \nhas the feeling for not only this building, not only this institution, \nthe Senate, but for our country than you do. I have great, great \nrespect for what you have done to inspire me to try to do a better job.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things I say to my two \ncolleagues, the chairman and the ranking member, is, if the other body \nis looking for additional sources of money, I think they should take a \ncloser look at their franking practices. I am the last person to tell \nthe other body what to do with franking, even though in the past, when \nI was chairman of the Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee, \nwe had some real battles dealing with franking. We cut our Senate \nfranking practices tremendously. In fact, we now hear complaints that \nwe do not have enough money to mail to our constituents. We have really \ntightened our belts, especially with mass mailings.\n  But, let's talk about the other body. In 1994, as part of a \nbipartisan effort that was initiated by Senator Mack and myself, our \nsubcommittee successfully instituted sweeping reforms regarding \nfranking privileges in the Senate. In fact, we cut overall mail costs \nby 50 percent between 1994 and 1995.\n  As part of the same initiative, the House, in 1995, combined its \nmail, staff, and office expense accounts, and instituted an expenditure \nlimit on mail based upon an allowance fund.\n  However, Mr. President, that was changed. In 1999, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, the House, unfortunately, eliminated \nany expenditure limit on franking privileges.\n  So if the House is looking for some ways to get some money, they can \nalways use some of the money they reapplied to franking just last year.\n  Also, I want to talk about the Congressional Research Service, for \nwhich I have the greatest respect. It is a great program, the \nCongressional Research Service. If we have a problem, we can have some \nresearch done. That is what it is. It helps our constituents, our \nstaffs, and helps us Members of Congress.\n  These cutbacks that have been requested in the other body are simply \nnot wise. I think it goes without saying that we need the Congressional \nResearch Service so that we are not forced to rely upon a group of \nlobbyists.\n  I, again, commend the chairman and ranking member for their work to \nensure that the Congressional Research Service is protected.\n  Finally, let me say, in closing, we have appropriated $100 million \nfor the Visitors Center. I am not happy with the fact we are reaching \nout to the private sector to get money to help build what I think \nshould be a totally Government institution.\n  A Visitors Center is long overdue. I hope we get it done quickly. I \nhave been told, though I have heard this before, that construction is \ngoing to start soon.\n  I think it says a lot that we, in Washington, do not have a facility \nfor visitors to come into this Capitol. That is one of the reasons why \nOfficer Gibson and Detective Chestnut are dead, because we did not have \na visitor entrance where people could be checked to see if they have \nweapons before coming into the Capitol.\n  Also, separate and apart from the security aspect of it, it is \nimportant that visitors have a place to come in during cold weather to \nstay warm until they can come into the Capitol, and a place during hot \nweather to stay cool, and a place where they can get a soft drink, a \nglass of water, or go to the bathroom. This is long overdue.\n  I hope this initiative will move forward expeditiously. I also hope \nthis eyesore that we have out here with the painted lines on the road \nand all that other stuff will quickly be done away with. The east front \nof the Capitol should be just as beautiful as the rest of the Capitol \ncomplex. I hope we take care of that very quickly.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate my gratitude and recognition of the \nleadership of Senators Bennett and Feinstein. I wish them well not only \nin the passage of this bill, but also wishing them well in conference, \nwhere all eyes of the Senate, including our staff and the brave men and \nwomen of the Capitol police and other legislative branch agencies, will \nbe upon them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senators who have spoken in \nsuch generous terms. It helps to have a bill that is relatively \nnoncontroversial and to be on the side of the issues where most \nSenators are to get those glowing terms, but nonetheless, I am grateful \nfor them. I appreciate the comments.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 3167 through 3170, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I send to the desk a managers' package of \nfour amendments and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these amendments have been cleared on \nboth sides. The first one is an amendment for the Sergeant at Arms to \nmake $2.5 million of funds appropriated available until September 2003. \nThe second is an amendment to raise the cap on the amount of private \nfunds that can be provided to the National Garden. The third is an \namendment to create a fund to allow for private funds to endow the \nRussian Leadership Program of the Library of Congress. And the fourth \namendment is a technical correction to section 309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments. \nWithout objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3167 through 3170), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Stevens, is anxious to come to the floor to \nmake a statement. I will suggest the absence of a quorum to allow him \nto come, unless the Senator from California has something that she \nwishes to say at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is fine.\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to talk about a couple of issues. \nFirst of all, I commend the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nFeinstein, and the chair of the appropriations subcommittee for their \noutstanding work on the legislative appropriations bill. Many of our \ncolleagues have come to the floor already to speak as eloquently as I \nhave heard about the importance of the Capitol Police, about the \nimportance of those who serve us in so many capacities throughout the \nCapitol and throughout the Capitol complex itself.\n  I want to express my support for this bill and for the statement that \nit makes about the importance that we as Senators put on the work done \nby our Capitol Police each and every day. Those of us who are fortunate \nenough to be in Leadership especially recognize the unique role the \nCapitol Police play. They are with us almost from the time we leave the \nhouse to the time we are dropped off at the house late at night. They \nare with us publicly. They follow us. They protect us. They provide \nservice to us in the most exemplary and professional manner. I think it \nwould be all too easy for some to misinterpret the ill-advised actions \ntaken thus far by the House in their legislative branch appropriations \nbill.\n  It was really for that reason many of us felt the need not only to \nsupport a good Senate legislative appropriations bill, but to \nunderscore the numbers and the commitment made in the Senate version of \nthis bill by cosponsoring and supporting the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  We want to say just two words without equivocation to the Capitol \nPolice, to the members of the Congressional Research Service, to the \nGAO, and to all of those who work so diligently and professionally each \nand every day: Thank you. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for how \nyou do it. Thank you for setting the example. Thank you for the \nextraordinary dedication you demonstrate to public service.\n  That is really the message. I will be surprised if we don't see a \n100-0 vote in our expression of gratitude and our desire to ensure that \nthey realize how much we appreciate what they do. While we may not say \nit each and every day, and we may not walk up as we probably should \nfrom time to time to a Capitol Police officer, or to one of our floor \nstaff, or to any of those who serve us, maybe in this small way we can \nsay as a body, as Senators, regardless of political or philosophical \npersuasion, thank you. We express our sincere and heartfelt gratitude \nto each and every one of you for dedicating your lives to public \nservice, and in some cases dedicating your lives to the safety of \nothers, safety that oftentimes asks too much of police officers and \ntheir families, as we saw just 2 years ago.\n  So this is as an important a statement as I think we will make this \nyear regarding our Capitol Police and our staff in many respects, and I \nam hopeful that it won't go unnoticed. I am hopeful that this will \nserve as a big exclamation point that we are very grateful, and that we \nare appreciative in ways that probably are not articulated on a regular \nbasis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4353-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4353-S4354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF BRADLEY SMITH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President I also want to address the matter \nconcerning Bradley Smith. I know there will be time allocated for his \nnomination later on this afternoon. I will simply take time as if in \nmorning business using the quorum call to address his nomination at \nthis time.\n  As I have stated before, I have come to the conclusion that I must \noppose this nomination. For me, this is not just a vote on a particular \nnominee with whom I don't agree, this vote is about whether or not we \nwill prove the cynics in America wrong in demonstrating our commitment \nto strong campaign finance laws.\n  Yesterday morning in the Washington Post, a Republican strategist who \nadvises Governor Bush and the Republican National Committee said the \nfollowing:\n\n       There are no rules any more . . . There were few if any to \n     begin with but there are virtually none today. They know it, \n     we know it, everybody knows it.\n\n  That wasn't Common Cause or Ralph Nader. That was an adviser to Texas \nGovernor George W. Bush.\n  Governor Bush's adviser is right. In many ways, we have entered the \npost-Federal Election Campaign Act era. It is the Wild West of ``soft \nmoney,'' issue advocacy ads and secret donors.\n  The system is broken, and everybody knows it. A vote in favor of this \nnomination will simply confirm what we already know. It doesn't have to \nbe this way. It shouldn't be this way.\n  I know very few Members of the House and the Senate, of either party, \nwho like our current campaign finance system. I know very few members \nof either party who prefer raising money to meeting with constituents \nand working on issues. I know very few members of either party who \nenjoy the fact that, every time they face reelection, the amount of \nmoney that has to be raised to be competitive has risen exponentially. \nAnd frankly, I know very few members of either party who don't resent \nthe fact that so many of our legislative activities are scrutinized \nsolely in the context of donations--which groups backed which said of \nthe argument, and whose money prevailed.\n  I am irritated by that. I am frustrated by that. That screen should \nnot be the consideration. Even in the media, it shouldn't be the frame \nwithin which we view the debate on issues. But that is exactly how it \nis framed on the Sunday talk shows and in the newspapers.\n  If we think the current system is unacceptable, that is nothing \ncompared to the way our constituents feel.\n  Our constituents don't like the current campaign finance system. They \ndon't think it puts their interests first. But they also don't think \nwe'll ever really change it.\n  In fact, they are convinced of it. Poll after poll showed the \nAmerican people responding in single digits--not double digits, but \nsingle digits--to the question: Do you think Congress will ever change \nthe campaign finance laws? Overwhelmingly, over 90 percent say no.\n  Today, it seems to me, the Senate can take the first step toward \nrestoring at least a modicum of public trust in American political \ncampaigns.\n  One thing we can do to promote greater confidence in our electoral \nsystem is to ask a simple question before we confirm the men and women \nwho will serve on the Federal Election Commission. It seems to me that \nfundamental question ought to be: whether those who may be interested \nin serving believe in the laws on the books today? Do you believe you \ncan objectively enforce the laws? We are asked that question every time \nwe are sworn in. Will you uphold the Constitution? It seems to me \nupholding the Constitution and all the statutes and the compendium of \nlaws that have been created as a result of our fundamental freedoms \nestablished in the Constitution is a prerequisite for serving in public \noffice.\n  The men and women who, as Commissioners, would have the courage to \nissue clearer guidelines about what is permissible, and would have the \ncourage to enforce those guidelines are the people whom we should \nencourage to serve on this and all bodies.\n  Brad Smith, it is clear to me, does not fit that description. Rather \nthan decrying the weaknesses of our current campaign laws, Mr. Smith \nhas made a career out of criticizing the utility of our federal \nelection law scheme. He has argued for the repeal of the Federal \nElections Campaign Act, and he denies that money has a corrupting \ninfluence on the political system.\n  Simply put, when it comes to campaign finance laws, Brad Smith is an \nanarchist. This is not the marshal who will save the day in Dodge City. \nConfirming Brad Smith is more like asking Billy the Kid to preserve \npeace.\n  Let's be clear. Putting reform-minded FEC Commissioners in place is \nnot enough by itself. We created the FEC and our inaction has created \nsome of\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nthe problems within the FEC with respect to enforcing the laws we have \ntoday. Congress has a responsibility to act today to close loopholes, \nclarify the law, and do everything possible to stem the endless chase \nof money in which we all engage.\n  We should pass McCain-Feingold immediately. We should end the abuse \nof section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code immediately.\n  Our Constitution doesn't stand in the way. The only thing standing in \nthe way of our taking these modest steps is the reluctance to tamper \nwith the system that we know and that has gotten us elected, even if we \ndon't like it.\n  We are worried our careers won't survive. It seems to me we should be \nmore worried about whether faith in our system will survive.\n  The trends are ominous. The soft money accounts in both parties' \ncoffers are at record levels. In the first 15 months of the 2000 \nelection cycle, the national Democratic and Republican Party committees \nhave raised over $160 million in soft money. Mr. President, $160 \nmillion in corporate, union, and large individual contributions. Is \nthere any real question why Americans are losing faith in our elections \nsystem?\n\n  Every election cycle, the cost of campaigns goes up and the number of \npeople who vote goes down. If we really want to increase voter \nparticipation, we have to address that reality. The reality is, there \nis simply too much money in politics. We all know, whether we admit it \nor not, that the current system is broken. We have a choice: Do we \nreduce the influence of special interests money in Washington? Do we \nwant to wink and nod at the few flimsy campaign laws we have?\n  Today we have an opportunity to answer that question. It seems to me \nthat if we defeat Brad Smith's nomination and demand we be presented a \nnominee who will work with us to regain public confidence in our \ncampaign laws, we will be taking the first step. Then we could pass \ncampaign finance reform, the McCain-Feingold bill, and put an end to \nthe flood of soft money into campaigns once and for all, and then shut \ndown the so-called 527 loophole. Those three steps would go a long way \nin this election cycle, in this session of Congress, to do the right \nthing. They are things we can and should do. The currency of politics \nshould be ideas, not cash.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before I begin, I commend the distinguished Democratic \nleader, the minority leader, for his very eloquent statement and \ncomments, particularly in regard to the need for this body to take up \nthe issue of campaign finance reform. I could not agree more. We have \nhad a series of hearings at the Rules Committee on the campaign finance \nsystem. We have heard from all sides, but we heard a little more from \none side than another.\n  I tried to arrange for our good friends, Senator Feingold and Senator \nMcCain, to testify. I talked to my colleague from Wisconsin about this \nso we could hear about the McCain-Feingold bill. I hope our colleagues \nand others heard the remarks. This is a very important issue. Nothing \nis more fundamental than trying to get a handle on this process that \nhas gone wild. It is absolutely out of control, and it is getting worse \nby the day.\n  While there is obviously a great need to deal with other issues, \nnothing is more fundamental than how people get here, where their \nattention is spent, their time and effort, how it is allocated. Until \nwe change the system, in my view, it will only get worse.\n  I applaud my leader for his comments. I know he reflects the views of \nthe overwhelming majority on this side of the aisle and some on the \nother side. More importantly, I think the Senator reflects the views of \nthe American public. There may be differences on details, but \nfundamentally the American public understands this system is not \nworking well at all. The point that we spend more money each year on \ncampaigns, while voter participation seems to be heading in the \nopposite direction, paints a very clear picture of what the American \npublic thinks. I associate myself with those remarks and commend the \nSenator for those remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4354-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4354-S4356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of minutes on the \nlegislative appropriations bill and to commend Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd, the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as well as our good friends, the chair and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Feinstein and Senator Bennett, for the work \nthey have done in putting together, I think, a very responsible bill on \nthe Senate side in terms of dealing with the costs of running the \nlegislative branch of Government.\n  They have put together a good bill. They have been fiscally \nrestrained in their approach. Obviously, our legislative branch should \nnot be exempt from the kind of scrutiny we apply to every single aspect \nof this, the Federal budget. They are to be commended for packaging a \nbill that does less than the administration wanted but is certainly far \nmore responsible, far more thoughtful, far more balanced than what the \nother body has apparently crafted.\n  The bill here is $59 million over current spending but $147 million \nbelow the President's budget request for operations of the legislative \nbranch. We need to remember we are not just talking about Members' \nsalary or staffs. We are talking about being the temporary custodians \nof these buildings we call the Capitol Grounds.\n  A few minutes ago, I greeted another student group from my State, \nfrom Woodstock High School, a group of eighth graders, and, earlier, a \ngroup of students from a school in Washington, DC. I try to tell the \nyoung people when they are here, these are their buildings; this is \ntheir Government. They are not voters yet, but I want them to develop \nan appreciation of what has been handed down to us as temporary \ncustodians, what we will be handing down to them in the coming \ngeneration so their children and their grandchildren will be able to \ncome to this great Capital City of ours, come to the great buildings, \nand cherish and appreciate what it represents to them as citizens of \nthe greatest democracy ever created in the history of mankind. As \ntemporary custodians of their well-being, we have a responsibility not \nto somehow pad the budgets to serve our own comfortable interests but \nto see to it that we preserve this venue, this seat of democracy, for \ncoming generations.\n  That is what Senator Feinstein and Senator Bennett have done with \nthis budget. Regretfully, it is what the other body has not done. That \nis what makes me so sad. We can have differences here--Democrats, \nRepublicans, conservatives, liberals, moderates--and debate issues. \nWhen it comes to the buildings, when it comes to the people every day \nwho work here, whose names you will never know, who care for the \nfacilities, who guard these buildings, not just the Members and the \nstaffs who work here but the 10,000-plus tourists who come to their \nNation's Capitol every day and come into the buildings. Officer \nChestnut and Officer Gibson, who lost their lives just a few feet from \nwhere I am speaking, were protecting not only the membership when those \nshots fired but protecting hundreds of tourists gathered in the \nbuilding.\n  To see a budget that disregards the importance of having good \nsecurity here, not just for the Senators and Congressmen but for the \ninnocent tourists who come to see their Nation's Capitol, is something \nof which we ought to be very mindful. What the House has done, of \ncourse, was to cut the police force by almost 12 percent, resulting in \na reduction in force of almost 30 percent of the police force on these \ngrounds.\n  I was a young boy in the 1950s in the other Chamber, a few feet from \nthat Chamber, when shots rang out from the gallery, and Members of \nCongress were shot on that day. I was down in Washington on a spring \nbreak. I literally just missed being in the Chamber as a tourist on \nthat day.\n  We have taken a lot of steps since then to try to see to it that \npeople who are armed can't come in here and threaten the lives of \npeople in these buildings. I remember being a relatively new Member in \nthis Chamber when, I thank the Lord, we had all left on a Monday night \nand a bomb went off in the building. Had we been here, there would have \nbeen those, I suspect, who would have been severely injured, if not \nkilled.\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\n  And of course the tragedy involving Officers Chestnut and Gibson and \nthe gunfire in the Capitol Building is a sad commentary on the times in \nwhich we live. We all know this. But to talk about reducing the police \nforce of these grounds by 30 percent, cutting the present force, is \nirresponsible. Hopefully, it will be reversed.\n  I commend our champions of this legislative appropriations bill for \nfighting back and putting their foot down, and saying you are not going \nto tolerate this because it is wrong to do this to the American public.\n\n  The Library of Congress as well would be cut here, the greatest \nlibrary in the world just a few blocks from this Capitol--again, a \ngreat public library. The people of Connecticut may be more sensitive \nto this issue than others are. The very first public library in the \nUnited States was founded in New Haven in the 1600s, so we in my State \nhave a special affection for libraries and their value.\n  The greatest of all libraries in the world is the Library of \nCongress. There is a wonderful exhibit going on as we celebrate the \n200th anniversary of the Library of Congress. I encourage people who \nare coming to Washington to visit the wonderful exhibit of the \nJefferson library. It is Thomas Jefferson's library. It was the \ngreatest private library in the hands of any citizen in this country \nwhen he donated it. Actually, it was sold for a very modest amount \nafter the Capitol was burned in the War of 1812. Thomas Jefferson took \nthe 6,000 volumes that was his library, the greatest private library in \nthe world, and said this ought to be the basis of a great national \nlibrary. At the cost of $23,000, those volumes became the core of the \nLibrary of Congress we now celebrate, as we should, here in our \nNation's Capital. The House proposal to cut into that budget by 1 \npercent, again, doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  The Congressional Research Service, again, is of great value to us as \nwe try to do our work. They are wonderful people. It does not matter, \nwhen you are provided a report, whether it is Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents--they give us the facts, data, hard evidence that we rely \non as we try to do the people's business. We couldn't possibly afford, \nnor should we, to expand our staffs to include all these people who \nserve as our extended staff. The Congressional Research Service, the \nCRS, has been of great value to people in these Chambers over the \nyears. The House proposal eliminating one out of seven employees is an \nexample of an unwise reduction in force.\n  With regard to the General Accounting Office, the House cuts it by 7 \npercent. Again, the General Accounting Office is tremendously valuable. \nI don't know of a single Member who has not relied on the General \nAccounting Office at one time or another to get good, hard, clean facts \nand evidence behind some of the more perplexing problems we face in our \ncountry.\n  As to the Government Printing Office, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, as well, the House has acted very irresponsibly. I commend our \nleaders, as the ranking member on the authorizing committee, the Rules \nCommittee, and express my support for what they are trying to do.\n  I say to the literally dozens and dozens of people who work in these \nbuildings, be they police officers or custodial staff, doorkeepers, and \nthe like, we do not get a chance to say this to you as often as we \nshould but we appreciate immensely what you do. The American public, as \nI said, may never get to know your names, but you preserve their assets \nhere every single day. The majority of us in this Chamber appreciate \nwhat you do. We appreciate the efforts you make around the clock.\n  Many us have been here late in the night and meet these wonderful \npeople, many of them women--women, not young women--who come by and \nclean these offices after everyone leaves, doing the tremendous work \nthat they do. They are never seen by the Members or staff around here. \nI want to tell them today on this floor how much I appreciate the work \nthey do. Again, I am confident I reflect the views of the overwhelming \nmajority of Members in this body.\n  We thank Senator Feinstein and we thank Senator Bennett for their \nefforts. We applaud Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for demonstrating \nonce again their deep appreciation for being good temporary caretakers, \ntemporary custodians, of these facilities and these assets that belong \nto the American public. I am proud to be associated with both of these \nfine leaders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2621 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have reserved time \nfor an amendment which would deal with funding for mailings for open \nhouse town meetings. The budgets today are very restrictive. In years \ngone by, there was an opportunity for a Senator to schedule an open \nhouse town meeting in a county seat and send out postal patron notices \nto everybody in the county. Then, an open house town meeting would be \nheld where a relatively small number of people would appear, but at \nleast everybody in the county had notice that the Senator was coming. \nEveryone had an opportunity to hear a short report about what was going \non in Washington and then an opportunity to ask the Senator questions.\n  We are under considerable fire and criticism on the issue of \nfundraising and the issue of access. For example, when we have \nfundraisers and people attend, they certainly do have access to \nSenators. There is no way to have a fundraiser where people attend \nwithout having that kind of access.\n  The question then arises: Is that kind of access unfair? I believe \nthere is a very good answer to that by having the Senator go to the \ncounty seat, and make it convenient for people in the county to have \naccess to the Senator to ask questions. The concept of having a town \nmeeting to let people express themselves is something that I believe is \nvery important and very fundamental.\n  The budget we have today does not allow for that. I was just \ndiscussing the matter with the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee to see if we might structure something which could be \naccommodated without having a contested amendment and a contested \ndebate and then a rollcall vote.\n  What the Senator from Utah and I were talking about was an analysis \nof how many of our colleagues want to have open house town meetings. \nMany of our colleagues do not choose that as a form of communication \nwith constituents. Others may have only a few open house town meetings. \nThere is a big difference between small States and big States. There is \na different picture that certainly arises in Utah than Pennsylvania.\n  As I said to the Senator from Utah, I would not necessarily be \nconcerned about having the town meetings in the big metropolitan areas \nwhere there is a greater opportunity to communicate with the citizens \nthrough television and through newspaper stories. However, if you take, \nsay, some of the northern tier counties of Pennsylvania or the north \ncentral or southern tier, unless you actually go to the county, it is \nvery hard to make that kind of contact.\n  I would not want the entire year to go by without taking action. As I \ndiscussed with the Senator from Utah, perhaps in collaboration with the \nSenator from California, who is the ranking member on this \nsubcommittee, and the Senators on the Rules Committee, we could try to \nget an estimate and perhaps put a funding mechanism in one of the later \nappropriations bills. Perhaps it could come in the appropriations bill \non Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, which I chair.\n  I do believe Senators would like to have this opportunity. It may \nwell be that it would not be very expensive, depending on how many \nSenators chose it. Maybe we could, on an experimental basis, create a \nrelatively small fund and find some way to administer it so\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\nthe people who want to have the town meetings can but with some \nlimitations so that one or a few Senators do not take too much of the \nfund. Therefore, we could move in the direction of encouraging these \nopen house town meetings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for raising this \nissue because it is a very legitimate issue, and I think it is a \nlegitimate issue for the legislative branch subcommittee to deal with. \nWe did not deal with it in subcommittee and in full committee. It \nbecomes a challenge to try to find the money right now in terms of an \noffset within the bill.\n  The point the Senator from Pennsylvania makes is an extremely valid \none. There are people who, in rural areas particularly, do not really \nhave any sense of opportunity to interact with a Senator unless that \nSenator physically goes to those counties. Then when you try to notify \nthe people that you are coming, you have a real challenge because they \ndo not have the mass media coverage. Yes, they may get a major \nnewspaper from a major metropolitan area, but they do not read it for \nhometown announcements. If you try local newspapers, many times they do \nnot do the job, either.\n  The problem we have in terms of the reactions from members of the \nRules Committee is that the Rules Committee has attempted to create the \nopportunity for this in terms of flexibility for the overall budget and \nsaying to a Senator, ``You have a pot of money you can use either for \nfranking or for stationery, for travel, or some other item,'' and they \nare opposed to earmarking a particular amount of money for this \nparticular purpose.\n  If we sit down with members of the Rules Committee and lay out the \nimportance of what it is the Senator from Pennsylvania is highlighting \nand talk it through to find some creative way, I think we can move in \nthat direction. I pledge to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I will \nwork with him to see if we cannot do that because I agree absolutely \nwith the end he is trying to achieve.\n  I think it is very important that we try to help Members communicate \nwith their constituents in a meaningful kind of way.\n  As I understand it, from the Senator from Pennsylvania, this is not \ntalking about a mass mailing of campaign literature, as we are accused \nof doing under newsletters and use of the franking. This is talking \nabout simply a notice that would go out under the frank with respect to \ntown meetings.\n  I am very sympathetic with that and would be happy to work with the \nSenator and the Senators from the Rules Committee and, of course, \nSenator Feinstein, to see if we can't find a way to devise something \nthat is not overly expensive--because I agree with the Senator, not \nevery Senator would want to use it--but that at the same time we could \nprovide an opportunity for those Senators who would be willing to do \nthe town meeting.\n  So I am happy to deal with the Senator to see if we can't find way to \nwork this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in response to Chairman Bennett's \nsuggestion, I would like to assure the Senator from Pennsylvania, as a \nmember of the Rules Committee, I would be very happy to take a look at \nthis and see what the problem is. The ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee was here and is familiar with the subject. I believe he would \nbe agreeable, as well, to take a look. And we will see what the problem \nis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from California for those statements. Let us proceed on that \nbasis.\n  Picking up on what the Senator from Utah said, it isn't a political \nmailing touting what any of us may think he or she has done. It is \nnotice that the Senator is going to have his or her body at a given \nplace.\n  As open house town meetings go, that can be a fairly high price to \npay, to go out and face the music and face the constituents because \nthey do keep track of our votes. But they have a very hard time \nfollowing us if they live in Coudersport in Potter County or live in \nthe northern tier of Pennsylvania or a southern tier county such as \nFulton. They don't necessarily get any of the major newspapers and are \noutside television range. They may see some national television, but \nthat is not an effective way for Senators to communicate with the \npeople of their States.\n  When you appear at a town meeting, there is a feeling that something \nis going on that is positive. We Members of Congress in the Senate and \nthe House are subject to a lot of criticism as being ``inside the \nbeltway'' and not being accessible. People don't know what we are \ndoing. And then we are going to these fundraisers where people have to \nmake contributions to have access to us.\n  This is something which is not very healthy for a democracy. So let \nus proceed.\n  I will not offer an amendment at this time. I will see if we can work \nit out, starting with the chairman and ranking member on this \nsubcommittee, and moving over to the chairman and ranking member on the \nRules Committee, to try to structure a program which would accomplish \nthe purpose and be affordable.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think, as I \nsaid, he has raised an issue very much worth pursuing and one that we \nwill, in all good faith, go forward on, to see if we can't work out \nsome kind of solution that can get us where it is we need to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4356-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENTS--EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, we come to the time where we have another \n25 minutes before the time comes for voting. I had been expecting the \nSenator from Alaska. He is still tied up in a previous meeting. So we \nwill look forward to hearing from him.\n  It has been an interesting experience for me to serve as chairman of \nthis particular subcommittee on Appropriations. There are those who say \nthis subcommittee does not matter very much because its dollar \nallocation is the lowest of all of the subcommittees in the \nAppropriations Committee, with the exception of the District of \nColumbia. I disagree. I think this subcommittee, in fact, can have as \nmuch impact on the Government as some of the others that have greater \namounts of money to spend because of its area of jurisdiction.\n  I will take a little of the time here to express my gratitude for the \nopportunity of chairing this subcommittee and for those with whom we \nwork. The subcommittee deals with the Architect of the Capitol. That is \na term that most people in the country do not understand. They would \nthink of the Architect of the Capitol as the person who sits down and \ndraws the lines on paper that produces the building of the Capitol. \nThat is what architects do.\n  They do not realize that the Architect of the Capitol is charged with \nthe responsibility of maintaining the Capitol. In this situation, I \nhave been able to go around and meet those people who oversee the \nactivities that go on with respect to maintaining our operation. They \nwork for the Architect of the Capitol, and they are concerned with such \nthings as the air-conditioning, the cleaning, the repairs, the \nrestoration of the Brumidi paintings about which the Senator from West \nVirginia spoke.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  We take it for granted that this beautiful place will always remain \nbeautiful. It takes a virtual army of people working behind the scenes \nto see that this is, in fact, the case.\n  I have spoken of my business experience. I remember one company where \nI worked where a particular manager was under very heavy pressure from \ntop management to show improved results on the bottom line. This \nmanager was determined to do that. Pretty soon the reports started \ncoming in that the bottom line was getting better and getting better, \nand he basked in the glow of the approval that he got for his tough \nmeasures and his great turnaround procedures.\n  Then the bill came due, and we discovered what he had been doing. He \nhad been increasing his bottom line by cutting back on his maintenance \nbudget. And all of a sudden the facilities over which he had \nresponsibility began to show the deterioration. In that company, we \nultimately had to pay enormous capital costs to restore the facilities \nto the level they should have been at by virtue of significant day-to-\nday maintenance. Yes, he could make the bottom line look better \ntemporarily by shutting down the day-to-day maintenance, but, overall, \nhe cost us a great deal of money.\n  That is the responsibility of the Architect of the Capitol: To see to \nit that, overall, this entire complex works. It is not only the \nCapitol. He has the responsibility for the Senate office buildings and \nthe House office buildings.\n  We have watched the renovation of the Dirksen Office Building go \nforward under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol. I am happy \nto be able to report that it is on time and under budget. For those who \nsay that every Federal program is a boondoggle, this is one that is \nmoving forward. As an occupant of a Dirksen Building suite in the \nrenovated area, I can tell you that this office space will be good for \nthe next 30 or 40 years before it has to be done again. It is being \ndone properly, it is being done intelligently, and it is being done \nwithin the allocated budget.\n  Something that I did not know anything about until I became chairman \nof this subcommittee is the Botanic Garden.\n  I have all my life driven by the Botanic Gardens without ever going \nin and without ever having any understanding of what went on inside. \nThe Architect of the Capitol came to me when I got this assignment and \nsaid: Let's go down and take a look at the Botanic Gardens. Well, one \nwalk through the Botanic Gardens made it clear that there had been a \nlot of delay and neglect of ordinary maintenance. This was a major \nmess.\n  Now, under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol, the Botanic \nGardens are being raised up to the level where they should be. One may \nask: Who cares about the Botanic Gardens? I asked the somewhat impudent \nquestion: How many Americans come to the Botanic Gardens? How many see \nthis? Well, if it were in a city other than Washington, DC, it would be \na major tourist attraction. There are literally millions of Americans \nwho go through the Botanic Gardens every year. It had been allowed to \ndeteriorate and had to be brought up to proper standards.\n  I could go on and on about the work of the Architect of the Capitol. \nIt is significant work, and it requires a great deal of effort. I am \ndelighted to be involved in understanding that.\n  I see other Members coming to the floor. I want them to know I am not \nfilibustering, but I don't want the time to go just in a quorum call, \nwhen I have an opportunity to express my gratitude for the assignment \nthat I have. If anyone has something they want to say, just give me a \nsignal and I will conclude quickly.\n  Absent that, I will talk about the Library of Congress. The Library \nof Congress Thomas Jefferson building is one of the hidden jewels, \narchitecturally, in this town. I always tell tourists from Utah, when \nthey come and visit me in my office, to go see the Jefferson building. \nThey say: Well, we are going to go see the major sites. We are going to \ngo to the Vietnam War Memorial. We are going to go to the Lincoln \nMemorial and the Jefferson Memorial and the new FDR Memorial, and so \non. I only have so much time.\n  I say: I don't care how limited your time is. If you have any time at \nall, walk down the street and walk into the Jefferson building.\n  This is the most beautiful building on Capitol Hill except for the \nCapitol itself. It represents in many ways the story of America.\n  My favorite story about the Library of Congress and the building is \none that is told about Boris Yeltsin, when he walked into the Jefferson \nbuilding. He stood there and looked around, and then turned to his \nguide and said: How did you Americans get a building like this? You \ndidn't have any czars?\n  Well, maybe we didn't have any czars, but we had the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and we had the American spirit 100 years ago that said \nAmerica has arrived. America is going to take its place as one of the \nmajor nations of the world. In that spirit of enthusiasm and \nexcitement, they built the Jefferson building to house the Library of \nCongress. That building came in under budget and on time. It stands as \na reminder of the spirit of manifest destiny that we associate with \nTheodore Roosevelt. The building was finished before Theodore Roosevelt \nbecame President, but it was in that era that it happened. That is a \nreminder that all Americans ought to have as part of their history.\n  It has been magnificently restored by the Congress, and by this \nsubcommittee. Admittedly, it was restored prior to my being involved \nwith the subcommittee, but it is something we in Congress should be \nproud of because it is part of the heritage we leave to our children \nand our grandchildren. They can come to Capitol Hill--yes, the Capitol \nand the continuity of democracy that is represented here--but there is \nalso the commitment to knowledge and spreading that knowledge that is \nrepresented by the largest and finest library in the world. It exists \nto serve the Congress. It is sustained by the Congress. It is part of \nthe responsibility of this particular subcommittee.\n  I am delighted with the opportunity of serving in this capacity. I \nappreciate the support we have received not only from the full \ncommittee but from all of the Members of the Senate as well.\n  I see my friend from Connecticut is here. I am happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I commend our colleague from Utah \nfor the job he and the ranking Democrat, Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, have done on this bill. I echo his sentiments about the \nrole we play as custodians of these buildings.\n  I noted earlier that all of us on a daily basis greet students who \ncome to the Nation's Capital as part of the graduation programs of \nvarious schools. I had the wonderful privilege earlier today of meeting \na group of students from Woodstock, a school in Connecticut, as part of \ntheir eighth grade graduation.\n  It is a violation of the rules of the Senate to identify anybody who \nis in the galleries, and I won't do that. I am not going to identify \nany school groups in the gallery. If you happen to notice somebody \ndressed in green up there, you might notice someone who might come from \nthat school along the way. They are very attentive students and \ninterested about these buildings. As I explained to them, these are \ntheir buildings. We are mere custodians of them.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from California. We are doing what we can to see to it that \nthey are secure and well cared for so that future generations will be \nable to enjoy them as much as this generation does.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2603, the \npending legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, as \nreported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Bennett, \nand the distinguished ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for bringing a \nbalanced bill to the floor. The bill supports ongoing Senate operations \nand those of the congressional support agencies we depend upon, such as \nthe\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office, the Library of Congress, the Government \nPrinting Office, and the General Accounting Office. It also sustains a \ncommitment to increased security for the entire Capitol complex and the \nthousands of visitors we receive each day.\n  The bill as reported to the Senate provides $1.7 billion in new \nbudget authority and $1.45 billion in new outlays for the operations of \nthe Senate, joint items, and our related agencies. The House will add \nthe funding for its operations to its version of this bill. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority, funding for House items, and \nother actions are taken into account, the bill totals $2.6 billion in \nboth budget authority and outlays for fiscal year 2001.\n  The Senate bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority, and it is $4 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. \nThe Senate bill is $54 million in budget authority and $53 million in \noutlays above the FY 2000 level. It is $216 million in budget authority \nand $169 million in outlays below the budget request.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the reported bill be inserted in the \nRecord at this point.\n\nS. 2603, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2001, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        General\n                                        Purpose    Mandatory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill \\1\\:\n    Budget authority................       2,500          97       2,597\n    Outlays.........................       2,498          97       2,595\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority................       2,500          97       2,597\n    Outlays.........................       2,502          97       2,599\n2000 level:\n    Budget authority................       2,449          94       2,543\n    Outlays.........................       2,448          94       2,542\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority................       2,716          97       2,813\n    Outlays.........................       2,667          97       2,764\n \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority................  ..........  ..........  ..........\n    Outlays.........................          -4  ..........          -4\n2000 level:\n    Budget authority................          51           3          54\n    Outlays.........................          50           3          53\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority................        -216  ..........        -216\n    Outlays.........................        -169  ..........        -169\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes adjustment for House-only items not considered in Senate.\n \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nUtah, Senator Bennett, for his excellent work on the FY 2001 \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill and the attention he and his \nstaff have paid to my concerns. I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with Senator Bennett on one of my priorities, the issue of \nextending health and retirement benefits to employees of the Library of \nCongress' child care center.\n  As the Senator knows, providing quality and affordable child care is \na very important issue to me. I was, therefore, shocked to learn that \nchild care workers in the Legislative Branch are not all afforded the \nsame benefits. While employees of both the Senate and the House child \ncare centers receive Federal health and retirement benefits, employees \nof the Library of Congress' child care center, the Little Scholars \nChild Development Center, do not. I ask Senator Bennett if he agrees \nthat employees of all Legislative Branch child care centers should be \nprovided benefits in a consistent manner?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing this issue \nto my attention. Like him, members of my staff have also had their \nchildren enrolled in the Little Scholars Center and speak highly of the \nstaff and quality of the care there. In this competitive job market, it \nis very important that Legislative Branch child care centers be able to \nattract and retain quality staff. I share the Senator from Vermont's \ngoal that health and retirement benefits are extended to employees of \nthe Library of Congress' child care center as soon as possible.\n  I inform Senator Jeffords that I have received a copy of a memo, \ndated May 24, from Teresa Smith, Director of the Library's Human \nResource Services, to John D. Webster, Director of the Library's \nFinancial Services, committing to working out a fair and equitable \nagreement on the issue of extending benefits to employees of the center \nwith the governing board of the child care center. Rest assured, my \nstaff and I will be monitoring the Library's progress towards this goal \nwith the intent that this issue be resolved before the beginning of the \nnext fiscal year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank Senator Bennett for his attention to this \nimportant matter and am pleased that he shares my belief that the \nLegislative Branch should set an example of high child care standards \nfor the rest of the Federal government to follow.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmemorandum of which I spoke be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n\n                   library of congress, may 24, 2000.\n\n     To: John D. Webster, Director, Financial Services.\n     From: Teresa Smith, Director, Human Resource Services.\n     Subject: Little Scholars Child Development Center.\n       The purpose of this memorandum is to respond to your \n     request for information regarding the Little Scholars Child \n     Development Center (Center) and to provide preliminary \n     comments regarding the draft legislation that would provide \n     Federal benefits to the Center's staff.\n       The Center began operations in 1993 and has an enrollment \n     of 100 children (13 Library of Congress, 29 Senate, 17 House, \n     17 other Federal, 24 public). The Library and the Library of \n     Congress Child Care Association (LCCCA) have entered into a \n     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to run the Center. The \n     Library and the Architect of the Capitol are responsible for \n     providing facilities and certain administrative support \n     services to the LCCCA. The LCCCA is responsible for hiring \n     the Center's staff and running the program. The Center has a \n     staff of 28 with a payroll of approximately $650,000. The \n     LCCCA pays for current payroll taxes (FICA) and health \n     benefits costs.\n       Human Resource Services (HRS) and Office of General Counsel \n     are now working with the LCCCA to update the MOU. We are \n     committed to working out a fair and equitable agreement in a \n     timely manner and are ready to meet with the LCCCA as soon as \n     arrangements can be made.\n       HRS believes that the proposed legislation is premature \n     because a number of issues should be discussed prior to \n     submitting any legislation and the MOU update needs to be \n     finalized first. For example, the proposed legislation is \n     based upon the Senate child care model, which operates in a \n     different administrative environment than the Library. The \n     Library uses a contractor to handle benefit accounting and \n     does not have a direct accounting relationship with the \n     Office of Personnel Management. In addition to the estimated \n     increase in the Library's government contributions for LCCCA \n     staff of $130,000, the Library would need to significantly \n     change its administrative operations to handle the \n     legislation which may be avoided with a further evaluation of \n     the alternatives. With more time, HRS and the LCCCA may be \n     able to work out a better model for use at the Center. The \n     Library believes that other changes to the Center's legal \n     authority may be appropriate, which would be accomplished \n     more effectively at the same time as any other proposed \n     changes and after an analysis of the practices of other day \n     care centers.\n       In summary, HRS believes that the proposed legislative \n     change is premature and would like to first have the \n     opportunity to work through the MOU issues and then on a \n     joint request for legislative changes.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no other \namendments be in order to the bill. I further ask consent that \nfollowing the vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment, the bill be \nadvanced to third reading, a vote occur on the question of third \nreading, and following that vote, the bill be placed back on the \ncalendar.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the previous agreement be \nmodified to allow for those two back-to-back votes to begin at 10:45 on \nThursday morning, with the same 10 minutes in order prior to the 10:45 \na.m. vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4359-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4359-S4364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRADLEY A. SMITH, OF OHIO, TO BE A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL \n                      ELECTION COMMISSION--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to executive \nsession, and the clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Bradley A. Smith, of \nOhio, to be a member of the Federal Election Commission.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the \nunanimous consent agreement I am allotted 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret, even though this is the time \nthat has been allocated by unanimous consent for the final debate on \nthe nominations, particularly the nomination of Brad Smith, I regret \nthere are no other Senators here to debate the nomination. However, I \nwill proceed in any event because it is an important nomination, an \nimportant issue.\n  There is an irony about the vote we are about to have in the Senate. \nThe Senate is sure to close up shop at a reasonable hour today. Why? \nBecause tonight the Democratic Party will host the largest fund-raiser \nin history at the MCI Center here in Washington. The party expects to \nrake in $24 million in one night, tonight. And this will surpass the \nprevious record for a single fund-raiser of $21.3 million set less than \n1 month ago by the Republican Party. That record fundraiser swamped the \nprevious record, also held by the Republican Party, at an event a year \nearlier, of $14 million.\n  We are in an arms race. The escalation is truly staggering. The \ninsatiable need for bigger and bigger checks is turning our great \npolitical parties into little more than fundraiser machines. Forty-\nseven donors raised or contributed $250,000 or more to go to the \nfundraiser tonight that my party will hold. Back in April, 45 donors \nraised or contributed that amount to join the Republican Party leaders \nat the National Armory. A quarter of a million dollars. Can anyone \nhonestly say the donors who give that money will get no special \ntreatment in return? We all know this money can be corrupting. It \ncertainly provides the appearance of corruption.\n  The Supreme Court knows that contributions of this size can be \ncorrupting. Let me quote the Court, once again, from the Shrink \nMissouri case decided a few months ago:\n\n       There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  There is little reason to doubt the corrupting influence of large \ncontributions on our political system, said the Court.\n  At least one person doubts this. Professor Bradley Smith doubts it. \nListen to what he wrote in a 1997 Law Review article: Whatever the \nparticulars of reform proposes, it is increasingly clear that reformers \nhave overstated the Government interest in the anticorruption \nrationale. Money's alleged corrupting effects are far from proven, \nProfessor Smith says.\n  Brad Smith sees nothing wrong with unlimited contributions to parties \nor even to candidates. He said in a newspaper article that ``people \nshould be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.'' In an \ninterview on MSNBC he said: ``I think we should deregulate and just let \nit go. That is how our politics was run for over 100 years.''\n  That ``100 years'' he is referring to is the 19th century. That is \nthe world Brad Smith would like to see; no contribution is too big for \nus to tolerate in the world he sees.\n  I assure my colleagues that this is not some caricature of this \nnominee's views. These are not distortions nor are they words taken out \nof context. This is what this nominee believes. This is what he has \nsaid over and over and over again, including at his confirmation \nhearing before the Rules Committee. Brad Smith sees nothing wrong with \nthe enormous soft money contributions that both parties are so greedily \nseeking, the kind of contributions my party will rake in, in the \nlargest fundraiser in history, tonight, just a few hours from now. Not \nonly that, he believes to ban soft money would violate the first \namendment of the Constitution.\n\n  Virtually no one still clings to that belief in the wake of the \nSupreme Court's decision in the Shrink Missouri case. Brad Smith does.\n  This nomination may be just as important to the cause of campaign \nfinance reform as any bill that has been before the Senate in recent \nyears. This vote on this nomination is just as significant for campaign \nfinance reform as many of the votes we have had on those bills. I \nsubmit to those Senators who have voted time and time again to ban soft \nmoney--and I do thank them for their votes, and I thank them for their \nsupport of the McCain-Feingold bill--those Senators should think very \ncarefully about what they are doing here.\n  To confirm Brad Smith to a seat on the FEC is to confirm a man whose \nmost deeply held beliefs about the Federal election system are wholly \nat odds with the reforms we are seeking. If we somehow are able to get \npast the filibuster and pass a soft money ban this year, Brad Smith \nwill be on the Commission that is charged by law with the duty to \nimplementing that ban.\n  I emphasize again I hold absolutely no personal animus toward Mr. \nSmith. This is not personal. It is not a matter of personality. I do \nnot question Mr. Smith's integrity. I do not question his honesty. I \ncertainly do not question his right to criticize the laws from outside \nhis perch as a law professor and commentator. However, his views on the \nvery laws he will be called to enforce scare me. It is simply not \npossible for me to ignore the views he has repeatedly and stridently \nexpressed simply because he now claims he will faithfully execute the \nlaws if he is confirmed. He may try to do that, but in matters of \ninterpretation he will certainly come down on the side of big money in \ncampaigns every time.\n  In a 1997 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith wrote \nthe following:\n\n       When a law is in need of continual revision to close a \n     series of ever-changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the \n     law, and not the people, that is in error. Most sensible \n     reform is a simple one: Repeal of the Federal Elections \n     Campaign Act.\n\n  I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm a man to the FEC who \nbelieves the statute that created that body should be scrapped. I urge \nmy colleagues to think about this very hard. Professor Smith's views \nare not anywhere near the mainstream of legal thought on this issue. \nProfessor Smith may be a wonderful professor and scholar, but he should \nnot be on the Federal Election Commission.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about confirming \nBradley Smith to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission or \nthe FEC. The FEC is an independent regulatory agency entrusted with \nadministering and enforcing the Nation's campaign finance laws. Yet, \nBradley Smith believes that the very campaign finance laws he would be \nrequired to administer and enforce should be thrown out.\n  I am not questioning the integrity of this nominee or his fitness for \ngovernment service in general. I also believe we must be careful not to \nreject nominees just because we object to their views. However, when a \nperson like Bradley Smith is put forward, a person whose views seem to \nundermine the very purpose for which he is being nominated, I believe \nwe have a responsibility to speak out. Bradley Smith is not an \nappropriate choice for FEC commissioner and I will be voting against \nthis nomination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be voting today against the \nnomination of Mr. Bradley Smith to serve as a Commissioner of the \nFederal Election Commission. It is with a fair amount of reluctance \nthat I take this position, given the longstanding custom of allowing \neach party to appoint its own choices to this six member commission and \nthe fact that FEC nominees are, by statute, supposed to be the \nrepresentatives of their political parties on that commission. I \nrespect that history.\n  I also believe Mr. Smith is a man of intelligence, integrity, and \ncompetence. So, my vote against his nomination is not a vote against \nhim as a person. Nor will I vote against him because I disagree \nstrongly with most of Mr. Smith's opinions on the campaign\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nfinance system. He favors no contribution limits; I think they are \nessential. He doesn't see a link between corruption or the appearance \nof corruption and the contributions made to candidates and holders of \npublic office; I do. He thinks the Federal Election Campaign Act and \nthe Federal Election Commission should be dismantled; I don't.\n  The reason I will vote ``no'' is because I cannot support the \nnomination of an individual to the position of commissioner of an \nagency which the nominee doesn't think should exist or which has as its \noperating statute one which the nominee thinks should be repealed. I do \nnot relish voting against this nominee to the FEC offered by the \nRepublican leadership but Mr. Smith's opposition to the existence of \nthe institution to which he is being nominated compels me to vote \nagainst him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Professor Bradley A. Smith to fill the open Republican \nseat on the bipartisan Federal Election Commission. In considering the \ntwo FEC nominees, Professor Brad Smith and Commissioner Danny McDonald, \nthe Senate must answer two fundamental questions:\n  Is each nominee experienced, principled and ethical? And,\n  Will the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission?\n  I want to take a minute to rebut some of the myths that have been \nperpetuated by the reform groups over the past several months.\n  Myth No. 1: Professor Smith's First Amendment views are radical and \ndisqualify him for government service at a bipartisan agency.\n  Over 30 renowned First Amendment and Election Law experts, including \npast members of the governing Board of Common Cause, urge Brad Smith's \nconfirmation and attest to the validity of Brad Smith's actual views--\nthat is distinguished from the views that have been attributed to him \nby his critics.\n  Moreover, these renowned scholars are indignant about the \nmisrepresentation of Smith's scholarship. Let me share just a few \nexamples:\n  First Amendment Scholar Michael McConnell of the University of Utah \nLaw School writes:\n\n       [S]ome opponents of the nomination of Bradley A. Smith to \n     the Federal Elections Commission are claiming his scholarly \n     writings regarding the First Amendment and campaign finance \n     laws are irresponsible or otherwise beyond the pale. This is \n     simply partisan nonsense. * * * The merits of his nomination \n     should not be clouded by charges of this sort, which have no \n     scholarly validity.\n\n  Professor Daniel Kobil, a former governing Board Member of Common \nCause in Ohio writes:\n\n       I believe that * * * [the] opposition is based not on what \n     Brad has written or said about campaign finance regulations, \n     but on crude caricatures of his ideas that have been \n     circulated.\n\n  Even one of the scholars who support McCain-Feingold has written in \nsupport of Professor Smith's nomination. Professor Jamin Raskin, a \nsignatory to the McCain-Feingold letter, writes:\n\n       The political reform community would actually be better off \n     with Smith on the FEC. * * * Smith is no party hack, but a \n     serious scholar who cares about political liberty. * * * He \n     is a dream candidate * * * [who] should not be opposed by \n     political reformers.\n\n  In fact, Smith's views on election law are shared by many fine \nscholars, like Kathleen Sullivan, the Dean of Stanford Law School, who \npraised Smith stating:\n\n       I do think Mr. Smith's views are in the mainstream of \n     constitutional opinion. I like to think that I am enough in \n     the mainstream of constitutional opinion that our agreement \n     on many points would place us both there.\n\n  Let me paraphrase Dean Sullivan to rebut those who argue that \nappointing Brad Smith is like appointing a conscientious objector to be \nSecretary of Defense: appointing a First Amendment election law scholar \nto the FEC is, in fact, like appointing a seasoned U.S. Attorney who \nvalues the constitutional liberties of every American citizen.\n  Or what about 46 political scientists who echo Smith and Sullivan's \nconcerns about the current campaign finance laws and some of the \nproposed reforms? I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks. It is signed by 46 \npolitical scientists, including esteemed scholars like Brandice Canes \nof MIT, Michael Munger of Duke, Patrick Lynch of Georgetown, and--from \nthe flagship university in Arizona--University of Arizona professors \nPrice Fishback and Vernon Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my colleagues on the other side vote to reject \nall of these individuals, including the Dean of Stanford Law School, \nwho have questioned the wisdom and workability of our campaign finance \nlaws and the proposed reforms?\n  Myth No. 2: Professor Smith fails to acknowledge the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision in Shrink-Pac.\n  As for this assertion, I would direct my colleagues to pages 20, 31, \n36 and 40 of the published Rules Committee hearing report from March 8 \nof this year. Professor Smith clearly acknowledged the holding of the \nShrink PAC decision, and, in particular explained:\n\n       Had I been on the Commission and the case had come forward \n     under Federal law . . . I would have had no problem voting \n     for [the] enforcement action . . . .\n\n  Of course, the reform groups won't tell you that the Supreme Court \nagreed with Smith's views and declared campaign finance laws \nunconstitutional in cases such as Colorado Republican, and McIntyre v. \nOhio, and just last year in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law \nFoundation, or that, as Professor Nagle of Notre Dame Law School has \nwritten: Smith's ``understanding of the First Amendment has been \nadopted by courts in sustaining state campaign finance laws.''\n  Myth No. 3: Professor Smith will not enforce the law.\n  The letter of Dan Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, a 6 year member of \nthe national governing Board of Common Cause rebuts this myth. He \nwrites:\n\n       [Smith] will understand that his job is to enforce the law, \n     even when he does not agree with it. I doubt if anyone can \n     credibly deny that [Smith] is an individual of high \n     intelligence and energy and unquestioned integrity. When such \n     an individual is nominated for the FEC, he or she should be \n     enthusiastically and quickly confirmed by the Senate.\n\n  Let me address the Democrats' nominee, Commissioner Danny McDonald.\n  Commissioner McDonald and I are clearly in different campaign reform \ncamps. If I follow the new litmus test that is being put forth by some \nin this confirmation debate, then I have no choice but to vigorously \noppose his nomination.\n  I want to be clear that Danny McDonald is not my choice for the \nFederal Election Commission. I have serious questions about his 18-year \ntrack record at the FEC. McDonald's views and actions have been soundly \nrejected by the federal courts in dozens of cases.\n  Two of these cases even resulted in the U.S. Treasury paying fines \nbecause the action taken by McDonald and the FEC was ``not \nsubstantially justified in law or fact.'' And, just this month, the \n10th Circuit struck down yet another FEC enforcement action as \nunconstitutional--finding, I might add, that reformer concerns of \ncorruption were unsubstantiated.\n  I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has displayed a \ndisregard for the law, the courts and the Constitution. And, it has \nhurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally \nprotected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money.\n  Equally troubling, is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently \nchose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee \nwhile serving as a commissioner to the Federal Election Commission.\n  I must say that I have serious questions about whether an FEC \nCommissioner exhibits ``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks \nthe highest position in his political party and simultaneously \nregulates that party and its candidates--and regulates the competitor \nparty and its candidates.\n  All of that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test \nwhereby we ``Bork'' nominations to this bipartisan panel. I am prepared \nto follow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to \nsupport Commissioner McDonald's nomination--assuming that McDonald's \nparty grants similar latitude to the Republicans' choice, Professor \nSmith, which will be voted on first.\n  As an aside, let me say to my distinguished colleague from Arizona \nand my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin: even though we are in \ndifferent\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\ncampaign reform camps and even though we famously disagree on the First \nAmendment and federal election law, I would wholeheartedly support \neither of you to serve as the Democrat's nominee to the Federal \nElection Commission.\n  I urge my colleagues to also reject this new litmus test of barring \ngovernment service for those who question Congress and its laws. \nHarvard Law professor and former solicitor general of the United \nStates, Charles Fried, has summed up this point. This is what Solicitor \nFried had to say:\n\n       I address . . . the proposition that because [Professor \n     Smith] has been critical of the Commission to which he has \n     been nominated and some of the laws which it administers he \n     is somehow disqualified for confirmation to the post of \n     Commissioner. This argument is not only dangerous, but so \n     far-fetched, so out of line with historic practice, that it \n     is hard to believe it is not being deployed strategically \n     only, and that those who urge it in this case would not \n     repeat it were they more in sympathy with the nominee or his \n     philosophical orientation. . ..\n       [I]f these arguments against Mr. Smith should prevail it \n     would have two dangerous consequences. It would limit more \n     and more the administration of laws to zealots. And it would \n     inhibit robust debate about the wisdom of laws, by using \n     views expressed in such debates as weapons used deny the \n     opportunity for public service on the basis of those views. \n     The first danger would give us an administration of zealots; \n     the second an administration of malleable non-entities.\n\n  In conclusion, I believe that Professor Smith's intelligence, his \nwork ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of election law and--to quote \nfrom the statute: his ``experience, integrity, impartiality and good \njudgment'' will be a tremendous asset to the FEC and to the American \ntaxpayers who have been forced to pay for unconstitutional FEC actions.\n  Professor Smith is a widely-respected and prolific author on federal \nelection law, and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the \ntwenty-five year history of the Federal Election Commission. I \nwholeheartedly support his nomination to the bipartisan Federal \nElection Commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              Duke University,\n\n                                        Durham, NC, April 1, 2000.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I have found that one of the main \n     principles of political sciences is that power, like nature, \n     abhors a vacuum. The current reform measures being considered \n     by the Congress, including the McCain-Feingold bill on \n     campaign finance and ``soft money'' regulation, will have the \n     opposite of their intended effects, which (apparently) is the \n     restriction of the power of special interests. The problem is \n     that weakening parties always increases the power of interest \n     groups.\n       This opinion is widely held among social scientists, but \n     the fact that so many people recognize the danger of \n     legislation is not often recognized. As a way of bringing \n     this fact to public notice, I have solicited the signatures \n     of colleagues on the attached latter. Forty-five \n     distinguished scholars of the political process, including \n     six past Presidents of the Public Choice Society, have asked \n     that I list their names as supporters. This I have done, and \n     offer the attached open letter as a means of ensuring that \n     the dangers of wrong-headed reforms can be prevented.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael C. Munger,\n                                   Professor of Political Science.\n\n Scholars' Letter to Congress: Why Campaign Finance ``Reform'' Is Ill-\n                       Advised and Will Not Work\n\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Senate Rules Committee.\n       Dear Senator McConnell and Members of Congress: \n     Restrictions on campaign donations or expenditures do little \n     to limit the total amount spent on campaign and make \n     campaigns less competitive. Such rules entrench incumbents, \n     force donations to take hidden forms, increase corruption \n     through such mechanisms as ``straw donations,'' and make it \n     more likely that wealthy candidates will win election.\n       Campaign finance restrictions are similar to price controls \n     that deal with the symptoms rather than the reasons for the \n     donations and are likewise doomed to fail. With campaign \n     financing amounting to less than one-tenth of one percent of \n     government expenditures, campaign spending does not seem \n     large in either an absolute sense or relative to other \n     product advertising. The restrictions force campaign \n     expenditures to be spent in less effective ways and actually \n     leave voters less well informed.\n       The McCain/Fiengold bill's provisions on parties making \n     independent and coordinated expenditures on behalf of \n     candidates, and prohibitions on issue advocacy that refers to \n     a candidate, as well as restrictions on raising or spending \n     ``soft money'' in connection with elections are typical of \n     the rules that produce these problems. So called \n     ``voluntary'' limits that restrict who can help certain \n     candidates who violate certain rules are anything but \n     voluntary.\n       The different forms contributions can take are essentially \n     infinite and this makes regulation exceptionally difficult. \n     For example, in the extreme case, it would be possible to buy \n     up television and radio stations or newspapers to support \n     particular candidates. Providing favorable new coverage for \n     desired candidates would certainly benefit their candidacy, \n     but it is difficult to see how these kinds of ``in-kind'' \n     donations would be regulated.\n       We advise Congress, before enacting yet more new laws, to \n     investigate whether many of the existing laws may have \n     contributed to the problems we currently face. The new \n     legislation is ill-advised.\n           Sincerely,\n       Professor Brandice Canes, Department of Political Science, \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n       Professor William Fischel, Department of Economics, \n     Dartmouth College.\n       Professor Michael Munger, Department of Political Science, \n     Duke University.\n       Professor G.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the brief time I have remaining, I \nwant to quickly respond to some of the remarks of the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  First of all, the suggestion that the arguments on this side have \nrelied on a caricature of the views of the nominee is simply false. We \nhave been very cautious in the debate to simply rely on Professor \nSmith's actual words from his voluminous writings, and the Senator from \nKentucky in no instance has denied that we accurately quoted Professor \nSmith. These are his views. There has been no distortion and no \ncaricaturing of his views.\n  Second, the Senator denies the nominee's views on the campaign \nfinance law will affect his ability to discharge his duties as an FEC \nCommissioner. Of course, I do not believe that people involved in the \nenforcment of laws have to accept the premise of every single law they \nare charged to enforce, but this nominee rejects essentially the entire \ncampaign finance law of our country, from the notion dating back to \n1907, that is still supposed to be good law today, that a corporation \nshould not be able to give contributions in connection with federal \nelections, to the notion that labor unions should not be able to make \nsuch contributions, according to a 1947 law, to his rejection of the \nfundamental post-Watergate laws restricting the amounts that \nindividuals can give candidates and parties that we are supposed to \nlive under today. Professor Smith is essentially a campaign finance law \nanarchist. He does not believe we should have any campaign finance law. \nThe notion that such a person should be on the FEC makes virtually no \nsense. To take the analogy of the Senator from Kentucky, he says having \nProfessor Smith on the Commission will be like having a prosecutor who \ncares very much about people's constitutional rights. But the real \nanalogy is that this nominee would be a prosecutor who believes we \nshould repeal just about all of the U.S. Criminal Code. That, to me, is \ntoo much.\n  This is not about a litmus test. This is absolutely not about barring \nthis gentleman from public service, as the Senator from Kentucky \nsuggests. If he wants to run for the Senate and pass laws about \ncampaign finance reform, there is an election for the Senate in Ohio \nthis year. He can run. But if his job is to enforce the main body of \ncampaign finance laws in this country, that job cannot be done by \nsomeone who believes those laws are entirely inconsistent with the \nfirst amendment and have no legal merit. Our election laws are too \nimportant to put them at risk in this way. For those reasons, I hope my \ncolleagues reject this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be \ncounted against the time allocated to the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will build on the comments of my \ncolleague from Wisconsin. I heard the Senator from Kentucky talk about \nthe fact that Brad Smith--and I said yesterday he is somebody I like \nand enjoy being with--has been critical of the Federal election laws. \nIt is not just being critical. He has called the Federal Elections \nCampaign Act unconstitutional and undemocratic. That is more than just \nbeing critical.\n  I cannot remember a time when this body confirmed a nominee for any \nexecutive position whose own views were so completely at odds with the \nlaw he was meant to uphold.\n  Let me repeat that. That is what this debate is about. I cannot \nremember a time when this body confirmed a nominee for any executive \nposition whose own views were so completely at odds with the law he was \nmeant to uphold. He believes the Federal election law is \nunconstitutional and undemocratic.\n  I do not have the time today to summarize a complete position. I had \na chance yesterday to speak about this nominee. I say to my colleagues, \nthis vote is not just about Brad Smith; it is about whether or not the \nSenate is committed to reform. I do not think we give people in the \ncountry much confidence that we are committed to reform, that we are \ncommitted to passing legislation which will get some of this big money \nout of politics and which will lead to some authentic democracy as \nopposed to just democracy for the few, when we then turn around and \nconfirm someone to the Federal Election Commission who does not even \nbelieve in any of this campaign finance reform. The Senate would be \nsending a terrible message to the country if we vote for this nominee.\n  I appreciate Brad Smith's right to express his views in writing and \nin person. He is articulate, he is intelligent, but we have a situation \nwhere we have a nominee who basically has said the Federal election \nlaws are undemocratic, that they are unconstitutional, basically \nantithetical to all the values he holds dear about government and \ndemocracy.\n  Why in the world would we then want to confirm such a nominee and put \nhim in a position of enforcing the very laws with which he is so at \nodds? To me it is a huge mistake. This is a vote about reform. This is \na vote about Brad Smith. More importantly, it is a vote about whether \nor not we are serious about reform and getting some of the money out of \npolitics and getting people back into politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to summarize the case against the \nconfirmation of Professor Smith to the FEC.\n  My colleague from Kentucky yesterday stated Mr. Smith has been \ndemonized. That is not true. I have criticized the nominee because I \nstrongly disagree with his view that ``The most sensible reform is a \nsimple one: repeal of the Federal Elections Campaign Act.''\n  I understand Professor Smith is not very old. In fact, Professor \nSmith could not have read the history or known about the abuses that \ntook place in the 1972 campaign associated with the Watergate scandal \nwhich brought about the modern Federal Elections Campaign Act.\n  I strongly disagree with his conclusion that ``campaign reform is not \nabout good government. It's about silencing people whose views are \ninconvenient to those with power. . . .''\n  Professor Smith goes on to say--these are his words:\n\n       The real campaign-finance scandal has little to do with \n     Senator Fred Thompson's investigation. The real scandal is \n     the brazen effort of reformers to silence the American \n     people.\n\n  I take strong exception to that view of history and the motivation of \nthose of us and millions of decent men and women, honest men and women, \nwho believe this situation needs to be cleaned up.\n  This morning's Washington Post has a story about ``MCI Center's Menu: \nRibs and a Record Democratic Fundraiser:\n\n       ``There is no donor fatigue, no Clinton fatigue, no \n     Democratic fatigue,'' said an exhilarated Terence R. \n     McAuliffe, who made 200 calls a day for seven weeks for his \n     crowning achievement as Clinton's mean man in chief.\n       McAuliffe used four telephones at a time--three for aides \n     to dial, to put would-be donors on hold, and one for him to \n     coo into his headset, bringing home the big-dollar bacon.\n       The tribute has 21 vice chairs, who gave or raised \n     $250,000; 42 Friends, who gave $100,000; and 32 hosts, who \n     gave or raised $50,000. But what sets this dinner apart is \n     the altitude of the top donor tier--the co-chairs, who each \n     gave or raised $500,000.\n       There are 26 of them, including 10 labor unions.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Another of the co-chairs is Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) who \n     is not seeking reelection and will become president of New \n     School University, in New York City. Kerrey said such efforts \n     renew his commitment to campaign finance reform. ``When \n     someone puts up half a million, you just cannot persuade \n     people that they aren't getting something for it.''\n\n  Senator Kerrey aptly described the situation that will take place at \nthe dinner at the MCI Center: ribs and a record Democratic fundraiser, \nwhich is a record only because it exceeds the Republican fundraiser \nthat recently was held where $24 million was raised.\n  If on the floor of this body 10 years ago I said there were going to \nbe $500,000 donors, no one would give any credibility to that \nstatement.\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\n  The Supreme Court also disagrees with Mr. Smith. We seem to be \ndebating this issue of campaign finance reform and its validity in a \nvacuum because neither the Senator from Kentucky nor Mr. Smith seem to \nbelieve that, in January of the year 2000, the Court upheld Missouri \ncampaign contribution limitations in a 6-3 opinion. The Court rejected \nMr. Smith's premise that large contributions do not affect votes.\n  This is what Justice Souter wrote for the Court on the issue of the \nconstitutionality of contribution limits:\n\n       In speaking of ``improper influence'' and ``opportunities \n     for abuse'' in addition to ``quid pro quo'' arrangements, we \n     recognized a concern not confined to bribery of public \n     officials, but extending to the broader threat from \n     politicians too compliant with the wishes of large \n     contributors. These were the obvious points behind our \n     recognition that Congress could constitutionally address the \n     power of money ``to influence governmental actions'' in ways \n     less ``blatant and specific'' than bribery.\n       In defending its own statute, Missouri espouses those same \n     interests of preventing corruption and the appearance of it \n     that flowed from munificent campaign contributions. Even \n     without the authority of Buckley there would be no serious \n     question about the legitimacy of the interests claimed, \n     which, after all, underlie bribery and anti-gratuity \n     statutes. While neither law nor morals equate all political \n     contributions, without more, to bribes, we spoke in Buckley \n     of the perception of corruption ``inherent in a regime of \n     large individual financial contributions'' to candidates for \n     political office . . . as a source of concern almost equal to \n     ``quid pro quo'' improbity. . . . Leave the perception of \n     impropriety unanswered and the cynical assumption that large \n     donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of \n     voters to take part in democratic governance. Democracy works \n     ``only if the people have faith in those who govern, and that \n     faith is bound to be shattered when high officials and their \n     appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions of \n     malfeasance and corruption. . . .''\n\n  Mr. President, the event tonight, I promise you, has aroused amongst \nmy constituents suspicions of malfeasance and corruption for any \nobjective observer of the political process.\n  Justice Stevens, in his concurring opinion said:\n\n       Justice Kennedy suggests that the misuse of soft money \n     tolerated by this Court's misguided decision in Colorado \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election \n     Commission, demonstrates the need for a fresh examination of \n     the constitutional issues raised by Congress' enactment of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Acts of 1971 and 1974 and this \n     Court's resolution of those issues in Buckley v. Valeo. In \n     response to his call for a new beginning therefore, I make \n     one simple point. Money is property; it is not speech.\n       Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a \n     multitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a battleground, or \n     even on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has the power to \n     pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks. It does not \n     follow, however, that the First Amendment provides the same \n     measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such \n     goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same \n     results.\n\n  Mr. President, we must consider this nomination, and the message it \nsends to the people of this country, in light of the reality of this \nyear's campaign fundraising excesses.\n  Let me reiterate four points that summarize my opposition to Mr. \nSmith's nomination to become an FEC Commissioner.\n  He has long advocated the repeal of campaign finance regulation. How \ncan he now take an oath to uphold and enforce the very laws he has so \nlong sought to eliminate altogether?\n  He has continually argued the unconstitutionality of restraints on \ncampaign finance regulation. His position has been that the Supreme \nCourt erred in its Buckley v. Valeo opinion which upheld restraints on \ncampaign contributions. Even as recently as his confirmation hearing in \nMarch, after the Supreme Court had again upheld campaign contributions \nlimitations in the Missouri Shrink case, he neither acknowledged that \nmost recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court, nor changed his \nviewpoint as to the constitutionality of contribution regulation. How \ncan he now agree to uphold and enforce laws and regulations which he \nbelieves are unconstitutional?\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that we would confirm as EPA \nAdministrator someone who advocated the repeal of environmental laws. I \ndo not believe we would appoint an Attorney General who believes that \nthe criminal laws are unconstitutional or a conscientious objector to \nbe Secretary of Defense. Why should we confirm Mr. Smith as a \nCommissioner for the FEC?\n  Although he acknowledges the campaign finance abuses of the 1996 \nelection, he sees nothing wrong with giving free rein to such activity \nby eliminating all campaign finance regulation.\n  If we would not conform as EPA Administrator someone who advocated \nthe repeal of the environmental laws, nor confirm an Attorney General \nwho believes that the criminal laws are unconstitutional, or a \nconscientious objector as the Secretary of Defense, why would we \nconfirm Brad Smith as a Commissioner for the FEC?\n  Also in yesterday's debate, Senator McConnell raised questions about \nthe appropriateness of Danny McDonald, the choice of the Democrats as a \nnominee, to serve on the FEC. I appreciate the concerns that my \ncolleague from Kentucky has raised. I totally concur that we should \napply the standards equally for nominees to these most important \npositions. Based upon the issues Senator McConnell has raised, I will \nrethink my position on Mr. McDonald, and vote against his confirmation \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I cannot speak more directly or frankly against this \nnominee. I urge my colleagues who have fought for campaign finance \nreform--my colleagues who believe in the need for integrity in our \nelection system--to vote no on Brad Smith. As the New York Times said \nearlier this year:\n\n       A vote to confirm Mr. Smith is a vote to perpetuate big-\n     money politics. . . . Mr. Smith does not belong on the FEC, \n     and anyone in the Senate who cares about fashioning a fair \n     and honest system for financing campaigns should vote against \n     his appointment.\n\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I have been involved with \nmoving more nominees that almost any other Member of this body. I have \nallowed nominees to move forward, even when I disagreed with the \nnominee. But, Mr. President, this case is different.\n  I do not expect to agree with all the views of those nominated. But \nMr. Smith's views are not just different from mine--again, a fact I \nwould respect--they are radically different from 100 years of court and \ncongressional precedence that some restrictions on campaign \ncontributions are necessary to ensure the integrity of this body and \nthe electoral process as a whole.\n  This is not just my opinion of the law. Let me read from Justice \nBreyer's concurring opinion, in which Justice Ginsberg joined, in the \nmost recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court on campaign finance \nregulation--the Shrink Missouri PAC case:\n\n       If the dissent believes that the Court diminishes the \n     importance of the first Amendment interests before us, it is \n     wrong. The court's opinion does not question the \n     constitutional importance of political speech or that its \n     protection lies at the heart of the First Amendment. Nor does \n     it question the need for particularly careful, precise, and \n     independent judicial review where, as here, that protection \n     is at issue. But this is a case where constitutionally \n     protected interests lie on both sides of the legal equation. \n     . . .\n       On the one hand, a decision to contribute money to a \n     campaign is a matter of First Amendment--not because the \n     money is speech (it is not); but because it enables speech. \n     Through contributions the contributor associates himself with \n     the candidates's cause, helps the candidate communicate a \n     political message with which the contributor agrees, and \n     helps the candidate win by attracting votes of similarly \n     minded voters. . . . both political association and political \n     communication are at stake. . . .\n       On the other hand, restrictions upon the amount any one \n     individual can contribute to a particular candidate seek to \n     protect the integrity of the electoral process--the means \n     through which a free society democratically translates \n     political speech into concrete governmental action. . . . \n     Moreover, by limiting the size of the largest contributions, \n     such restrictions aim to democratize the influence that money \n     itself may bring to bear upon the electoral process . . . In \n     doing so, they seek to build public confidence in that \n     process and broaden the base of a candidate's meaningful \n     financial support, encouraging the public participation and \n     open discussion that the First Amendment itself presupposes.\n\n  Unfortunately, the views of this nominee make him unfit to serve on \nthe FEC. This is not, as I have stated, meant to be personal. I have \nnothing against Mr. Smith personally. I am sure he is a fine \nindividual. But this body is constitutionally mandated to advise and \nconsent on nominations. I take that role extremely seriously. And as \nsuch, I cannot support this nominee, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

DYK, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, TO BE UNITED \n              STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Timothy B. \nDyk, of the District of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday some Republicans opposed Tim \nDyk's confirmation to the Federal Circuit based on the workload of that \ncourt. Last evening I inserted in the Record a letter from the Chamber \nof Commerce that argued for his nomination in terms of the court's \nimportant workload and cases.\n  I am troubled that at a time when we are working through the night to \ntry to preserve a digital signature bill to help encourage electronic \ncommerce and protect consumers, when we are trying to work through \nRepublican holds on the H1-B visa bill and increase the availability of \nhigh tech workers and improve training of American workers, when we are \ntrying to improve on-line privacy and Internet security, I see such \ninsensitivity to the needs of the Federal Circuit and its role in our \neconomy and in our judicial system.\n  We designed the Federal Circuit to be our patent court. It has \nextraordinarily complex cases that are of increasing importance as our \neconomy becomes more and more based on technological developments. \nPrompt and proper adjudication of cases before that court are in many \nways critical to the continued growth of our economy and our economic \nfuture.\n  I see vacancies on that court as high priorities. I know that the \nother Democratic Senators share my view. I have been greatly troubled \nby the perpetuation of this vacancy on the Federal Circuit for more \nthan two years while the Dyk nomination has been held back from Senate \naction. That is wrong. It is unfair to Tim Dyk and his family. It is \nshort-sighted with respect to the important matters on the docket of \nthe Federal Circuit.\n\n  That was the point of the Chamber of Commerce letter last August. \nFilling the vacancy on the Federal Circuit should be a priority of the \nSenate. The Federal Circuit should have all the resources it needs to \ndo its job and resolve intellectual property disputes intelligently, \nfairly, and expeditiously.\n  Nonetheless, in spite of all these considerations and what I had \nhoped was a bipartisan commitment to the growth of our high tech \neconomy, some are arguing that because its caseload numbers are not \ninflated by prisoner petition, criminal cases or scores of simple civil \ncases our nation's patent court ought not to have its needs fulfilled. \nI disagree.\n  Moreover, I have to wonder whether we would even be hearing that \nargument if a Republican President were\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nmaking this nomination. I thank the Chamber of Commerce for showing \nthat business supports the confirmation of Tim Dyk to fill this vacancy \non the Federal Circuit and for not playing politics with this \nnomination. The nature of the Federal Circuit's caseload merits a full \ncomplement of judges as authorized by Congress so that its intellectual \nproperty docket can get the attention that it deserves and that our \neconomy requires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at long last, the Senate is considering \nthe nomination of Timothy Dyk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit. Mr. Dyk is an exceptional nominee who has waited far \ntoo long for action by the Senate. He is a nationally known and \nrespected attorney who has been approved by the American Bar \nAssociation and was well received by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He \ndeserves confirmation by the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority today.\n  Mr. Dyk is an honors graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law \nSchool, where he was a member of the Law Review. After graduation, he \nserved as a Supreme Court law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren, as \nwell as for Justices Stanley Reed and Harold Burton. He served in the \nJustice Department for a year in the early 1960's and has spent the \nlast 37 years as a distinguished and highly respected attorney in \nprivate practice in Washington, D.C.. He has argued cases before the \nSupreme Court and in numerous federal courts of appeals, including five \ncases before the Federal Circuit. He clearly has the qualifications and \nability to serve on that Circuit with great distinction.\n  Mr. Dyk's nomination is supported by a variety of corporations and \norganizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Association of Broadcasters, \nthe Labor Policy Association, the American Trucking Association, Kodak, \nand IBM. He is also supported by the American Center for Law and \nJustice and has been described by that group as ``an exceptional \nadvocate,'' who ``would be a fine jurist on the Federal Circuit.''\n  For a number of years, Mr. Dyk served as lead counsel for the \nLubrizol Corporation in a number of patent litigations. Lubrizol's \nChairman and CEO has written,\n\n       Mr. Dyk was exceptionally effective in briefing and arguing \n     the several appeals in the Federal Circuit that occurred in \n     those cases and demonstrated the ability to provide \n     exceptional service on the federal bench. He also performed \n     an instrumental role in ultimate disposition of those cases \n     through mediation, which he urged on the parties and \n     skillfully guided through extensive and difficult \n     negotiations.\n\n  Mr. Dyk is also an active member of numerous bar organizations, and \nhe has served as Chair of the D.C. Circuit Membership Evaluation \nCommittee of the American Academy of Appellate Lawyers. In addition, he \nis an active participant in the community. In every respect, he is \nwell-qualified for appointment to the Federal Circuit. He should have \nbeen confirmed long ago, and I urge my colleagues to approve his \nnomination today.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Timothy B. Dyk, of the District of Columbia, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Federal Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

McLAUGHLIN, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Mary A. McLaughlin, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Mary McLaughlin to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania. Those of us on the Judiciary Committee know Ms. \nMcLaughlin from her outstanding work as Special Counsel for our \nTerrorism Subcommittee during the Ruby Ridge investigation in 1995. \nDuring those hearings, Ms. McLaughlin demonstrated precisely the \nqualities we want in a federal judge--she is intelligent, fair-minded, \ntough, possesses a judicial temperament, and is deeply committed to the \ncause of justice. Once we put her on the bench, she is going to be a \nterrific federal judge.\n  Our Ruby Ridge subcommittee ran the ideological gamut. Yet Ms. \nMcLaughlin gained the respect and admiration of all of our colleagues \nfrom both parties who worked with her--Senators Specter, Thompson, \nAbraham, Thurmond, Leahy, Feinstein, Grassley, and Craig--for the skill \nand professionalism she brought to her work. Let me make special \nmention of how tough and persistent Ms. McLaughlin was when the Justice \nDepartment was ``less than enthusiastic'' about supplying us with \ndocuments. Largely as a result of her efforts, we obtained the \ninformation that we needed, and our investigation went on to become a \ntrue model of bipartisan cooperation.\n  Beyond her service to the U.S. Senate, Ms. McLaughlin has stellar \ncredentials for a judgeship. She is a senior partner in the leading \nPhiladelphia law firm of Dechert, Price and Rhoads, where her practice \nhas concentrated in a myriad of complex litigation matters. She was a \nrecipient of a 1998 ``Women of Distinction'' Award from the \nPhiladelphia Business Journal, the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, and The Forum of Executive Women. Her career has also \nincluded teaching at the law schools of Vanderbilt University, the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University. In addition, Ms. \nMcLaughlin served for four years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia where, Mr. President, she put criminals behind \nbars. Not surprisingly, given this stellar record, she was unanimously \nrated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Unfortunately, a few outside groups have raised questions about her \ncandidacy based on a small portion of Ms. McLaughlin's pro bono work. \nWhile it is true that she is a person of strong convictions, none is \nstronger than her dedication to the Rule of Law. In other words, I am \nconfident that she will in all cases apply the law, not make it.\n  I wouldn't say that about everybody who has been nominated for a \nfederal judgeship in recent years.\n  Mr. President, Ms. McLaughlin deserves the type of strong, bipartisan \nsupport from the entire Senate that she has already obtained from those \nof us who worked with her on Ruby Ridge. ``There's something about \nMary's'' record of distinguished public service, her professional \nexperience, her legal talents, and her personal integrity that will \nmake her an outstanding Judge on the Eastern District bench. I urge my \ncolleagues to swiftly confirm her.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Mary A. McLaughlin, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania? On this question the \nyeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 86, nays 14, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 112 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--86\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--14\n\n     Allard\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Smith (NH)\n     Voinovich\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                           Executive Calendar\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have every confidence that they will both be \noutstanding federal judges.\n  While I am glad that the Senate has finally confirmed these two \ndistrict court judges, I am deeply concerned about the vacancies in the \nSixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The length of time that nominees \nfor these positions have remained pending is unfair, both to the \nnominees, and to the State of Michigan.\n  There are now three Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. One of \nthe nominees for these vacancies is Helene White, who was nominated \nmore than three years ago, and is still awaiting a hearing. Kathleen \nMcCree Lewis has been pending at the Committee awaiting a hearing for \nmore than eight months. And the third candidate for a Michigan seat has \nnot yet been nominated but hopefully will be at any time.\n  These Michigan candidates are intelligent and hardworking advocates \nof the law, who at a minimum, deserve to have and up or down vote on \ntheir nominations. Yet, Circuit Court of Appeals nominees continue to \nface unconscionable delays in this Senate.\n  The Senate slowdown has a serious impact on the administration of \njustice. In a March 20, 2000 letter to Senator Hatch, Judge Gilbert \nMerritt, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, notes that these vacancies have hampered the Court's ability \nto complete the public's business. The Court, in his words, is \ndeteriorating rapidly due to the high number of judicial vacancies.\n  Judge Merritt writes:\n\n       The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies. \n     Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are \n     vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to \n     keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to \n     our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote \n     has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many \n     years of judge time because of the vacancies.\n       By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will \n     be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the \n     Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due \n     to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the \n     President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to \n     take a vote on any of them.\n       Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The \n     public's business should not be treated this way. The \n     litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this \n     way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated \n     this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating \n     due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant. Each \n     active judge of our Court is now participating in deciding \n     more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is excessive by \n     any standard. In addition, we have almost 200 death penalty \n     cases that will be facing us before the end of next year. I \n     presently have six pending before me right now and many more \n     in the pipeline. Although the death cases are very time \n     consuming (the records often run to 5000 pages), we are under \n     very short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting on these \n     cases. Under present circumstances, we will be unable to meet \n     these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we have no \n     discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case.\n       The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate \n     ``advise'' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, debate \n     and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the \n     Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain \n     silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and \n     vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, \n     understaffed and unable properly to carry out their \n     responsibilities for each year.\n\n  I again urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to promptly hold a \nconfirmation hearing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals nominees \nfrom Michigan. They are highly qualified individuals who deserve to be \nvoted on by this Senate.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF RICHARD TALLMAN\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the \nconfirmation today of Richard Tallman to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In an unusual, if not unprecedented arrangement, particularly \nat this time and for the controversial Ninth Circuit, the White House, \nSenator Murray, and I have worked together quietly to select and \nconfirm absolutely first rate judges from Washington State. Dick \nTallman is no exception.\n  I had not met Mr. Tallman before he was chosen as a finalist for a \ndistrict court vacancy by a Judicial Merit Selection Committee jointly \nappointed by Senator Murray and me. He impressed me tremendously at the \ntime and I was privileged to be able later to recommend him to fill a \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Tallman enjoys broad bi-partisan support within Washington's \nlegal community, including that of the Democratic State Attorney \nGeneral, two former United States Attorneys for Western Washington, the \nFederal Public Defender from Western Washington, the President of the \nNinth Circuit District Judges Association, and the Federal Bar \nAssociation for the Western District of Washington.\n  Prior to starting his own small firm where he continues to specialize \nin white collar criminal defense, Mr. Tallman practiced law for many \nyears at one of the largest private firms in Seattle, Bogle & Gates. \nBefore that he served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the \nWestern District of Washington. He has also been sought out by all \nlevels of state government, serving as a Special Assistant City \nAttorney for Seattle, a Special Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for King \nCounty, as well as a Special Assistant Attorney General for Washington \nState. Over the years, Mr. Tallman has taught and lectured extensively \nto groups of lawyers and non-lawyers on a range of legal topics, \ninstructing groups including the National Park Service, the Washington \nMedical Association, and the Seattle Police Academy.\n  Mr. Tallman's involvement in bar and civic activities is no less \nimpressive than his professional record. In addition to extensive pro \nbono work, he has served as president of the local federal bar \nassociation and as chair of the lawyer delegates to the Ninth Circuit\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nJudicial Conference. He has been active in committees for local, state, \nand federal bar associations, in the selection of judges, bench-bar \nrelations, and in helping women and minorities interested in legal \ncareers.\n  As the accomplishments I have just reviewed attest, Mr. Tallman is an \nimpressive man. What these accomplishments to not convey, however, is \nthe warmth, good humor, and the clear unpretentious intelligence I have \nobserved in my short acquaintance with him. The Ninth Circuit will \nclearly benefit from our action today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of our most important constitutional \nresponsibilities is to provide advice and consent on the scores of \njudicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal \ncourts around the country. Today we made some progress. We confirmed 16 \nnew judges. For that I thank the Democratic leader and the majority \nleader, my counterpart on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and \nall those who worked with us to achieve Senate action on these judicial \nnominees.\n  The Senate has finally begun to consider the judges needed to serve \nthe American people in our federal courts. But before any Senator \nthinks that our work is done for the year, let us take stock: We are \nonly one-third of the way to the number of judges nominated by a \nRepublican President and confirmed by a Democratic majority in 1992, \nand only half way to the levels of confirmations achieved in 1984 and \n1988. Today we finally passed the level of 17 confirmations achieved in \n1996, the year before I became the Ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee. That low water mark is no measure of success, however.\n  Today we face more judicial vacancies than when the Senate adjourned \nin 1994. That means there are more vacancies across the country than \nwhen the Republican majority took controlling responsibility for the \nSenate in January 1995. Over the last six years we have gained no \nground in our efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are \nplaguing the federal courts.\n  In addition, recall that this is the first action that the Senate has \ntaken on judicial nominees since March 9, when the Senate ended 4-years \nof delay and finally voted to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth \nCircuit. For more than two months, for more than 10 weeks, the Senate \nhas not acted to confirm a single judge, not one. That stall accounts \nfor the backlog in judicial nominations that results in there being 16 \njudicial nominations on the Senate calendar today. On the other hand, \nsince March 9, seven additional vacancies have arisen and the Senate \nhas received 17 additional nominations.\n  There remain 36 judicial nominations pending in the Judiciary \nCommittee, plus new nominations that the President is sending us every \nweek. I have challenged the Senate to regain the pace it met in 1998 \nwhen the Committee held 13 hearing and the Senate confirmed 65 judges. \nThat would still be one less than the number of judges confirmed by a \nDemocratic Senate majority in the last year of the Bush Administration \nin 1992. Indeed, in the last two years of the Bush Administration, a \nDemocratic Senate majority confirmed 124 judges. It would take an \nadditional 67 confirmations this year for this Senate to equal that \ntotal.\n  Over the last five years the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed \nthe following: 58 federal judges in the 1995 session; 17 in 1996; 36 in \n1997; 65 in 1998; and 34 in 1999. By contrast, in one year, 1994, with \na Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges. With \ncommitment and hard work many things are achievable.\n  Of the confirmations achieved this year, seven were nominations that \nwere reported last year and should have been confirmed last year. That \nwould have made last year's total slightly more respectable. Instead, \nthey were held over and inflate this year's numbers. In addition, Tim \nDyk, one of the nominees finally being considered today, was nominated \nin 1998 and has been held over two years.\n  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the \nauthorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary \nto deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984, and again in \n1990, Congress responded to requests by the Chief Justice and the \nJudiciary Conference for needed judicial resources. Indeed, in 1990, a \nDemocratic majority in the Congress created scores of needed new \njudgeships during a Republican Administration.\n  Three years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrequested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the \ncountry. Last year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but \nincreased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the \ncountry. Instead, the only federal judgeships created since 1990 were \nthe nine District Court judgeships authorized in the omnibus \nappropriations bill at the end of last year.\n  If Congress had timely considered and passed the Federal Judgeship \nAct of 1999, S.1145, as it should have, the federal judiciary would \nhave nearly 130 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of \nthe needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the \nCongress over the past several years and places the vacancy rate for \nthe federal judiciary at 14 percent (128 out of 915). As it is, the \nvacancy rate is almost 10 percent (65 out of 852) and has remained too \nhigh throughout the five years that the Republican majority has \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  Especially troubling is the vacancy rate on the courts of appeals, \nwhich continues at over 11 percent (20 out of 179) without the creation \nof any of the additional judgeships that those courts need to handle \ntheir increased workloads.\n  Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared more \nthan seven months ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit. I recall when the Second Circuit had such an \nemergency two years ago. Along with the other Senators representing \nStates from the Circuit, I worked hard to fill the five vacancies then \nplaguing my circuit. The situation in the Fifth Circuit is not one that \nwe should tolerate; it is a situation that I wished we had confronted \nby expediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and \nEnrique Moreno last year. I still hope that the Senate will consider \nboth this year.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the \nFifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of \njustice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that \nit desperately needs. I look forward to our resolving this difficult \nsituation. I will work with the Majority Leader and the Democratic \nLeader to resolve that emergency at the earliest possible time.\n  With 20 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country \nand nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the \nFederal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals \nare being denied the resources that they need, and their ability to \nadminister justice for the American people is being hurt. There \ncontinue to be multiple vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Three vacancies \nis too many and perpetuating these four judicial emergency vacancies, \nas the Senate has in this one circuit, is irresponsible. We should act \non these nominations promptly and provide the Ninth Circuit with the \njudicial resources it needs and to which it is entitled.\n  I am likewise concerned that the Fourth, Sixth and District of \nColumbia Circuits are suffering from multiple vacancies.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet our responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities, and look forward to action on \nthe nominations of Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit, Enrique \nMoreno to the Fifth Circuit, Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit \nand Judge Johnnie Rawlinson to the Ninth Circuit. Working together the \nSenate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse \nand fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the federal courts \naround the country.\n  Having begun so slowly in the first five months of this year, we have \nmuch more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial \nnominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 40 more judges this \nyear. Having begun so slowly, we cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond \nrule'' and stop acting on these nominees at the end of the summer in \nanticipation of the presidential election. We must use all the time \nuntil adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\nthe courts to the detriment of the American people and the \nadministration of justice. I urge all Senators to make the federal \nadministration of justice a top priority for the Senate for the rest of \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4370-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this day marks the retirement of a legend \nin broadcast journalism in South Dakota. Steve Hemmingsen, who has \nfaithfully delivered news to living rooms in my home state for over \ntwenty-five years, will give his last regular broadcast tonight.\n  There's an old story about Calvin Coolidge, told shortly after he \nleft the White House. He was filling out a standard form, which asked \nfor standard information. Line 1 asked for his name and address. Line 2 \nasked for his ``Occupation'', for which he answered ``Retired''. Line 3 \nwas titled ``Remarks.'' Mr. Coolidge responded ``Glad of it.''\n  I hope that Steve Hemmingsen will share that sentiment: glad to be \nretired from the rigors of his job--but never fully removed from his \naudience, the thousands of people who have relied on him for their news \nfor more than two decades.\n  Steve grew up just across the border in Minnesota, and after \ngraduating from high school, he landed his first job in broadcasting at \nthe ``Polka Station of the Nation'' in New Ulm. Later, he studied at \nthe Brown Institute and was hired by KELO-TV in 1969. He has been a \nfixture there and on our nightly news ever since.\n  It has been estimated that since Steve began working the 6:00 and \n10:00 pm news at KELO, he has delivered about eighteen thousand \nnewscasts. He's shouldered the responsibility of helping our state get \nthrough some of its most trying times--such as the devastating Rapid \nCity flood in 1972, the tragic plane crash that took the lives of \nGovernor George Mickelson and several of South Dakota's economic \ndevelopment leaders in 1993, the horrible tornado in Spencer two years \nago and countless South Dakota blizzards. When South Dakotans have \nfaced adversity, Steve's steady voice and calm demeanor brought us up \nto speed on the latest events and talked us through each crisis we \nencountered.\n  But Steve has been there through the good times as well. When we \ncelebrated our state's centennial in 1989, Steve reported on the \nnumerous celebrations going on around South Dakota, giving us insight \non where our state had been, and where it was going. When Scotland, \nSouth Dakota's own Chuck Gemar went into space, Steve helped express \nthe collective sense of pride that was felt throughout the state. You \ncould say that during his career at KELO, Steve's familiar voice was \nthe first that brought news of noteworthy events to the people in South \nDakota.\n  Over the last twenty-five years, Steve Hemmingsen has earned the \ntrust of the people of South Dakota. Although Steve and I haven't \nalways seen eye-to-eye on some issues, I have never had a reason to \nquestion his dedication as a broadcaster, his fairness as a reporter or \nhis integrity as a person. In my years in public service, I have had \nthe opportunity to work with hundreds of reporters both in South Dakota \nand across the nation and there is no doubt in my mind that Steve \nHemmingsen is one of the best. Today we congratulate him, but tomorrow \nhe will certainly be missed.\n  It brings me great pleasure to join all of KELO-Land in wishing Steve \nthe best as he signs off tonight. The evening news will never be the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4370-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MITCH ROSE TO LEAVE THE HALLS OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Mitch Rose, my chief of staff, who before \nthat was my press secretary, will leave the Senate within the next few \ndays.\n  Mitch has been a great member of our staff, with his understanding of \nthe nuances of legislation, his ability to articulate concerns, and his \ncourage to challenge debate when he believes strongly in an issue. His \ntalents with words, written and spoken, are really legendary.\n  But no matter how tough the argument, or how serious the discussion, \nMitch's sense of humor always helps to keep things in perspective.\n  It's safe to say that he's not only famous for that sense of humor, \nbut at times, he's infamous.\n  Born in Alaska, a product of a great family and of Alaska's public \nschools, Mitch came to Capitol Hill after graduation from the \nUniversity of Washington, almost 15 years ago.\n  He first went to work for our friend and former colleague Bob Dole, \nand later toiled for the other members of our Alaska delegation, Don \nYoung in the House and Frank Murkowski here in the Senate.\n  When Mitch joined our staff, he took on the added responsibility of \nattending law school at night. His wife, Dale Cabaniss, attended a \ndifferent law school in the evenings, while she worked for Senator \nMurkowski.\n  Mitch's work on aviation and telecommunications issues has been \nparticularly important. As chief of staff, he has kept ahead of the \ncurve on all of our concerns, providing insight and guidance to my \nstaff and me.\n  The Alaska Humanities Forum has created a program named after Mitch, \nbased on his experience as a youngster, when his parents made sure he \nknew how life in a rural Alaska village contrasts with life in urban \nAlaska. The Rose Urban-Rural Alaska Partnership Program will take urban \nyouth to rural villages to promote better understanding of the very \ndifferent ways of life in our small communities. It will provide the \nsame type of opportunity his parents, Dave and Fran Rose, provided for \nMitch when he was a young Anchorage school boy.\n  Mitch is an example, Mr. President, of the best of his generation. \nHe's worked hard, taken on heavy responsibilities at work and at home, \nmaintained close and good relationships with Alaska and Alaskans, and \nwith those with whom he works.\n  He and Dale, who is now a Commissioner of the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority, are the parents of Ben 5, and twins Haley and Shelby, eight \nmonths.\n  There is no question that we will miss Mitch. But there's also no \nquestion that he will be a valuable member of the private sector.\n  My thanks to him for the work he's done, the loyalty he's shown and \nthe friendship he's shared. With so many others who have known him over \nthe years, I wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4370-5", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4370-S4371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JAROSLAV PELIKAN, STERLING PROFESSOR EMERITUS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as a product of the World War II years, I \nrushed through my undergraduate education after that war. In the \nprocess, my education was of the Yogi Berra variety: If I came to a \nfork in the road, I took it.\n  Now, having acquired seniority here, I have privileges I never \ndreamed would be part of my life, and am more and more aware of what I \nmissed by not spending more time in basic educational endeavors.\n  For instance, because of my service on the Senate Rules Committee, it \nis my honor to be chairman of the Joint committee of the Library. This \nposition opened my eyes and ears and filled my mind with joys totally \nunexpected.\n  For instance, my increasing visits with Dr. Jim Billington, Librarian \nof the Library of Congress, a national treasure and our preeminent \nRussian scholar, have led to meeting more and more of the distinguished \nacademics of our time.\n  One of these persons is Jaroslav Pelikan, Sterling Professor Emeritus \nat Yale university and Immediate Past President of the American Academy \nof Arts and Sciences. Sadly, because of business here in the Senate, I \nmissed Dr. Pelikan's brilliant luncheon address to the Bicentennial of \nthe Library of Congress on April 24 of this\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nyear. Arriving late, I was overwhelmed by the comments about his speech \nto the ``Library Legends Luncheon'' and requested a copy of it. The \ntitle of this address was: ``Hospital for the Soul.''\n  Now, I realize why we address those who have received Phd's as \n``Doctor''. On behalf of all who have continued to support our Library \nof Congress, I thank Jaroslav Pelikan for all he has done to earn his \n``Living Legend'' Award. Because of this address, I shall never again \nthink of libraries as simply depositories for books. Our great Library \nof Congress is now the ``World's Hospital for the Soul.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Pelikan's address be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Hospital for the Soul\n\n                         (By Jaroslav Pelikan)\n\n       Thank you for this ``Living Legend'' Award: I promise to \n     take it out and look at it whenever I get a sudden attack of \n     humility. Seriously, though, even someone to whom humility \n     does not come easily would have to be humbled today by the \n     names of all these others who are being honored here--and \n     then of those who are not! And if I ask myself the even more \n     humbling question why it is I who have been asked to speak in \n     the name of these men and women who are becoming my new \n     colleagues, my first thought is that I seem to be the only \n     one among those present whose last name puts him into the \n     same class with Big Bird. (Big Bird's cousin Larry Bird, who \n     is also a Living Legend, was unavoidably detained, and as a \n     sometime Hoosier I with his Pacers well in the playoffs.) Or \n     is the explanation simply that I am, at least as much as \n     anyone here, the offspring of the library? Or perhaps it is \n     that all my life I have been studying various languages, \n     which, while only a small fraction of those represented by \n     the collections of the Library of Congress, do manage to \n     include the ancestral tongues of several of my classmates, as \n     well as ``the universal language'' played so eloquently by \n     Maestro Isaac Stern or by my dear friend Yo-Yo Ma.\n       But of all languages, there is a special place reserved in \n     my mind and heart for Greek, the language of Plato and \n     Sophocles and Sappho (whom Plato called ``the Tenth Muse'')--\n     and the language of the New Testament and of the ``Four \n     Cappadocians'' (Basil of Caesarea, his brother Gregory of \n     Nyssa, their sister Macrina, and Gregory of Nazianzus). So \n     let me turn, as I do so often, to the pleasures of Greek. For \n     in Book One of a work appropriately entitled Bibliotheke \n     [Library], the Hellenistic historian Diodorus Siculus reports \n     that the inscription on the Library of Alexandria read: \n     Pysches iatreion, ``Hospital for the soul''--a profound and \n     brilliant metaphor, even in a language justly celebrated for \n     its metaphors.\n       The library is a hospital for the soul because it is here \n     that the soul can find instruments for diagnosis. Those men \n     and women, physicians of the soul, who have thought deeply \n     and spoken movingly about the illnesses that plague us all \n     have put their case studies permanently on deposit here. It \n     is here in the library that Thomas Jefferson traces so many \n     ailments to the dreadful affliction of not holding together \n     ``an honest heart'' and ``a knowing head''; here in the \n     library that George Eliot devastatingly portrays in \n     Middlemarch, my favorite English novel, the pedant who, she \n     says, ``dreams footnotes'' and who lurks in the soul of every \n     scholar (present company excepted, of course!); here in the \n     library that, in my favorite novel of all, the Grand \n     Inquisitor propounds again the three questions in which ``are \n     united all the unresolved contradictions of human nature'', \n     here in the library that Gibbons, celebrated in the Great \n     Hall, carries out an autopsy on ``the natural and inevitable \n     effect of immoderate greatness'' that bears implications for \n     every other empire, also for the American empire; here in the \n     library that Immanuel Kant probes ``the radical evil that \n     corrupts all maxims,'' making the worse appear the better \n     reason; and here in the library that Beatrice, in her \n     quiet but solemn voice, warns us that all our actions \n     carry consequences regardless of our station, evade them \n     though we may for a very long time. And because, in the \n     deathless words of that celebrated scholar and philosopher \n     Professor Pogo of Okefenokee Swamp (whose sayings are also \n     preserved here in the library), ``We got problems we ain't \n     even used yet,'' men and women in generations yet to come \n     will keep turning here for diagnosis and help. But they \n     will be able to do so only if we in this generation have \n     the foresight and the commitment that Joseph had in Egypt, \n     to store up during the fat years what will be needed \n     during the lean years.\n       It is likewise to the library that the soul can turn for \n     healing, in the collective memory of the human race. Even for \n     the healing of the soul in a special sense, the writers of \n     the New Testament, in trying to find the most towering and \n     luminous metaphor of all to cope with the miracle and the \n     mystery of what had happened to them, turned to the miracle \n     and the mystery of language: ``In the beginning was the \n     Word.'' But by that metaphor they were in fact attaching \n     themselves to the far more comprehensive tradition of what \n     Pedro Lain Entralgo has called ``the therapy of the word in \n     Classical Antiquity,'' the ancient and yet universal \n     recognition that if the diseases of the human mind and spirit \n     are to be cured, they need to be (as we still say) addressed, \n     that means, spoken to, as they are by biography and \n     autobiography and hagiography from many traditions and \n     diverse cultures, including even our own past, as those can \n     be found in the library and only there. Corny though the \n     cynical may find it, these lives do indeed still\n       . . . remind us,\n       We can make our lives sublime.\n       But increasingly we are beginning to recognize that both \n     diagnosis and healing can be vastly more successful if we \n     have been using the resources of the hospital and the health \n     care system all along for prevention, which is why the \n     library must be, as we say nowadays, a ``research hospital'' \n     and a ``teaching hospital.'' Having spent a scholarly \n     lifetime learning and admonishing that there is a fundamental \n     distinction between knowledge and wisdom, I find myself today \n     stressing the even more fundamental, and even more elusive, \n     distinction between knowledge and information. The library \n     functions as a hospital for the soul by teaching us both of \n     those distinctions, making available enormous stores of \n     information, resources of knowledge, and, to those who have \n     the willingness and patience to learn, treasures of wisdom. \n     (Konrad Adenauer once said that he planned to ask the \n     Almighty, ``Why is it, after putting such limitations on \n     human intelligence, that You did not put similar ones on \n     human stupidity?'') As the chroniclers and commentators and \n     critics of all those traditions, scholars dependent on the \n     library, by introducing us to our grandfathers and more \n     recently to our long lost grandmothers, can help us to \n     bequeath these riches to our grandchildren. For in words of \n     Edmund Burke, who still speaks in the library, it can be \n     defined as ``a partnership in all science; a partnership in \n     all art; a partnership in every virtue, and in all \n     perfection. As the ends of such a partnership cannot be \n     obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not \n     only between those who are living, but between those who are \n     living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.''\n       On that particular program for universal health care, my \n     old friend, Mr. Librarian of Congress--and (at least for \n     today) Dr. Surgeon General of the Hospital for the Soul--\n     everyone would, I hope, have to agree, even in an election \n     year. It was, I firmly believe, providential that exactly 200 \n     years ago today, in this city where there would eventually be \n     so many fiefdoms and kingdoms and dukedoms and monuments, the \n     Congress was inspired to found this monumental institution, \n     of which Shakespeare has Prospero say prophetically, ``My \n     library was dukedom large enough.'' For as all the other \n     dukedoms have risen and fallen, the Library of Congress has \n     stood as a monument and a ``hospital for the soul,'' pointing \n     to the life of the mind as the antidote to the twin poisons \n     of political tyranny and moral anarchy.\n       Whenever people ask me, after more than half a century of \n     historical research, reflection, and writing (my Three R's), \n     what are the lessons of the past, I apologize that I can't \n     come up with very many. But there is one, which those of you \n     who know me will not be surprised to learn I find stated most \n     profoundly by Goethe's Faust; and it speaks of the library:\n       ``Was du ererbt von deinen Vatern hast, Erwirb' es, um es \n     zu besitzen.''\n       [What you have as heritage, now take as task; For only thus \n     will you make it your own.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4371-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4371-S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING THOSE WHO DIED ON D-DAY\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we approach the 56th Anniversary of D-\nDay, June 6th, 1944, we should pause to reflect on the valor and \nsacrifice of the men who died on the beaches of Normandy. In the \nvanguard of the force that landed on that June morning, was the 116th \nInfantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division. In 1944 the 116th Infantry \nRegiment, as it is today, was a National Guard unit mustering at the \narmory in Bedford, Virginia. They drew their members from a town of \nonly 3,200 people and the rich country in southwestern Virginia nestled \nin the cool shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n  On the morning of June 6th, 1944, Company A led the 116th Infantry \nRegiment and the 29th Infantry Division ashore, landing on Omaha Beach \nin the face of withering enemy fire. Within minutes, the company \nsuffered ninety-six percent casualties, to include twenty-one killed in \naction. Before nightfall, two more sons of Bedford from Companies C and \nF perished in the desperate fighting to gain a foothold on the blood-\nsoaked beachhead. On D-Day, the town of Bedford, Virginia gave more of \nher sons to the defense of freedom and the defeat of dictatorship, than \nany other community (per capita) in the nation. It is fitting that \nBedford is home to the national D-Day Memorial. But we must remember \nthat this\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nmemorial represents not just a day or a battle--it is a marker that \nrepresents individual soldiers like the men of the 116th Infantry \nRegiment--every one a father, son, or brother. Each sacrifice has a \nname, held dear in the hearts of a patriotic Virginia town--Bedford.\n  Mr. President, in memory of the men from Bedford, Virginia who died \non June 6th, 1944, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed \nin the Record at the end of my statement as a tribute to the town of \nBedford, and every soldier, sailor, and airman, who has made the \nsupreme sacrifice in the service of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER: Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               COMPANY A\n\n       Leslie C.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. Con.

Just \nyesterday, I met with a group of young students who were visiting \nWashington, DC, as part of a legislative conference sponsored by the \nAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee. I was truly impressed by the \nlevel of interest and knowledge of these students.\n  One of the items we discussed was the need for the United States to \nprovide support for Israel as it withdraws from southern Lebanon. I \nsupport the efforts of Prime Minister Barak to withdraw Israeli forces \nfrom southern Lebanon and echo the comments that it is time for all \nforeign military forces to leave Lebanon. Furthermore, the Governments \nof Syria and Iran must be held accountable for acts of terrorism \ncommitted in Lebanon.\n  Mr. President, Israel has demonstrated its commitment to the peace \nprocess and its commitment to comply with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 425. It is now time for the United Nations and the \ninternational community in general to fulfill their obligations to the \npeace process and to ensure that southern Lebanon does not become a \nstaging ground for attacks against Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4372-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ORIGINATION CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Wednesday, May 17, at page S. 4069 of \nthe Record, the distinguished minority leader announced, ``I am going \nto demand that every single appropriations bill that comes to the \nSenate before it can be completed be passed in the House first because \nthat is regular order.'' To be clear he repeated, ``We are going to \nrequire the regular order when it comes to appropriations bills.''\n  The Senator refers to the origination clause of our Constitution Art. \n1, Sec. 7, Cl. 1. The origination clause states that ``All bills for \nraising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.'' The \nmeaning of this clause is widely known, and I do not know why the \ndistinguished minority leader would attempt to make an erroneous claim \nbefore those who know better. I do know why he did not challenge his 99 \ncolleagues to correct this statement, as he did with another. The \nreason is that many could have come forward to tell him he was \nmistaken.\n  When I open Riddick's Senate Procedure, I read that ``[i]n 1935, the \nChair ruled that there is no Constitutional limitation upon the Senate \nto initiate an appropriation bill.'' The House does claim ``the \nexclusive right to originate all general appropriations bills.'' \nSpecific appropriations, however, ``have frequently originated in the \nSenate.''\n  If the Senator intends to say that there is no precedent for the \ninitiation of appropriation bills in the Senate, that is false. Perhaps \nthere is some confusion between ``raising revenue'' and \n``appropriating.'' The former the Senate cannot do. The latter it can.\n  Also, the room the Senate has to work within is broad rather than \nnarrow. The Rules of the House of Representatives note that ``[a] bill \nraising revenue incidentally [has been] held not to infringe upon the \nConstitutional prerogative of the House to originate revenue \nlegislation.''\n  The courts agree with these constitutional interpretations. In fact, \nas recently as 1989, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth District in \nU.S. v. King, 891 F.2d 780, 781 ruled that where a bill does not \nqualify as a revenue bill, it is not subject to the provisions of the \norigination clause.\n  The United States Supreme Court, in Twin City Nat. Bank of New \nBrighton v. Nebecker, 167 U.S. 196, 202. ruled in an 1897 decision, \nwhich is cited as precedent to this day, that ``revenue bills are those \nthat levy taxes, in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for \nother purposes which may incidentally create revenue.''\n  On another occasion, the Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Norton, 91 U.S. \n566, 569 (1875) said that ``[t]he construction of the [origination \nclause] limitation is practically well settled by the uniform action of \nCongress'' and that ``it `has been confined to bills to levy taxes in \nthe strict sense of the word, and has not been understood to extend to \nbills for other purposes which incidentally create revenue.' ''\n  Indeed, in 1997, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth District in \nWalthall v. U.S., 131 F.3d 1289 ruled that the Tax Equity and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) did not violate the originations \nclause.\n  It was not the intent of our Founding Fathers not to allow the Senate \nto decide how to spend government monies. Obviously, we must do that. \nAlmost every action we take requires some money to be spent. What the \nFounding Fathers wanted to achieve with the origination clause was a \ncheck on government by which the most representative body had to \nauthorize the extraction from the people of taxes.\n  The only obstacle I know of to the Senate passing certain \nappropriation bills is the objection of the distinguished minority \nleader. He claims, ``This is getting to be more and more a second House \nof Representatives.'' Who is making it so, I ask.\n  According to Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Sec. \n3.2, p. 134 it is the other body in which ``[i]nfringement of the \nSenate on the constitutional prerogative of the House to initiate \nrevenue measures may be raised * * * as a matter of privilege.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4372-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4372-S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             FAREWELL TO TAIWAN REPRESENTATIVE STEPHEN CHEN\n\n Mr. CRAIG.

One of his more remarkable \naccomplishments has been his ability to promote and strengthen improved \nrelationships between Taiwan and the United States. Over the last two \nyears, he has secured important contacts for Taiwan.\n  Assisted by Mr. Leonard Chao, his chief aide in congressional \nrelations, Representative Stephen Chen has kept us informed of \ndevelopments within Taiwan, including trading relationships, advances \nin human rights, moves toward a complete and open democracy, and the \npeaceful transition of power from the Nationalist Party to the \nDemocratic Progressive Party on May 20th.\n  Representative Stephen Chen and his wife, Rosa, have been cordial \nhosts at Twin Oaks. They have gracefully entertained their guests with \nstories and anecdotes from their many diplomatic postings throughout \nthe world. A master of seven languages, Representative Chen's ability \nto interpret language nuances has invariably impressed his guests. He \nis also known for his unique calligraphic capacity of scripting English \nwith a Chinese writing brush. Along with these skills, Representative \nChen's foremost gift is his diplomatic courtesy--ever so subtly, he \nmakes his guests want to understand more about his family, his country, \nand our world through his views.\n  After nearly fifty years of dedicated diplomatic service to Taiwan, \nRepresentative Stephen Chen and Mrs. Rosa Chen, will retire from public \nservice and return to Taiwan. They can be duly proud of their many \naccomplishments. They will be missed by all who were acquainted with \nthem here in Washington, and we send them off to Taiwan with our best \nwishes and appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL CHILD'S DAY: A TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S CHILDREN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM.

Last night, \nour body passed an important resolution, affirming the sacred role of \nchildren in our society.\n  I have often heard the phrase ``every day is children's day.'' Sadly, \nthis is not always the case. There are too many children in America who \nare hungry, abused, neglected, and abandoned. Despite the best efforts \nof our parents, our foster parents, and our social services networks, \nnot all children feel that they are loved and valued.\n  Today, the United States Senate has taken a monumental step towards \nrecognizing the merit and worth of all of our children.\n  We already give special tribute to the efforts of our mothers and \nfathers. On both Mother's Day and Father's Day, we honor the hard work \nand sacrifices which parents make on behalf of their children and \nfamilies. These are days where we pay homage to our parents, both \nacknowledging and giving thanks for their contributions to both society \nand home.\n  I am pleased that June 4, 2000, will be National Child's Day--a day \nduring which parents and friends alike can affirm the love we share for \nour children. This will be a day devoted to our youth, reminding \nchildren and ourselves of the special, blessed place which they have \nwithin both our hearts and our lives.\n  I would like to give special recognition to those organizations whose \ntireless efforts greatly aided in the success of this resolution, \nspecifically Ms. Lee Rechter, Executive Director of FOCUS (Friends of \nChildren United Succeed) and Mr. David Levy, Director of the Children's \nRights Council.\n  Mr. President, National Child's Day provides a wonderful opportunity \nfor us to celebrate America's children. But, we must also remember that \nevery day should indeed be children's day. Let our expression of love \nand appreciation for our youth not be confined to a single day, but be \nshared with them on June 4th and always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4373-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BISHOP EDWARD PEVEC\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this Sunday, May 28th, the \nCatholic diocese of Cleveland will observe the 50th anniversary of the \nordination of Bishop A. Edward Pevec into the priesthood. I rise today \nto pay tribute to this wonderful man and to offer my thanks for the \nspiritual guidance he has given to Catholics throughout the City of \nCleveland and northeastern Ohio.\n  Born in Cleveland, Ohio on April 16, 1925, Bishop Edward Pevec is the \noldest of four children born to Anton and Frances Pevec, immigrants \nfrom Slovenia. On April 29, 1950, at the age of 25, Edward Pevec was \nordained into the priesthood. Over the fifty years since his \nordination, Bishop Pevec has served northeastern Ohio in a number of \ncapacities. He has been the Associate Pastor at St. Mary Church in \nElyria and at St. Lawrence Church in Cleveland. He has been a teacher, \nassistant principal/vice rector and principal/rector at Borromeo \nSeminary High School in Wickliffe and a graduate instructor at St. John \nCollege in Cleveland. During his service at Borromeo Seminary High \nSchool, Bishop Pevec continued his own education at two well-respected \nCleveland institutions, earning a Masters degree from John Carroll \nUniversity and Ph.D. from Western Reserve University. In 1975, he \nbecame pastor of his home parish, St. Vitus Church in Cleveland, and \nfour years later, became the President-Rector of Borromeo College of \nOhio. In 1982, Edward Pevec was ordained Auxiliary Bishop of Cleveland \nby His Holiness, Pope John Paul II.\n  Over the years, I have personally come to know Bishop Pevec, not only \nas a devout Christian, but as a man of deep caring for all mankind. I \nstill remember the first time that my wife, Janet, and I saw Bishop \nPevec celebrate mass. We were so impressed at the manner in which he \nconducted himself, that I said to my wife on our way out of the church \nthat there's a priest who ought to be a Bishop! We were both grateful \nthat the Holy Father recognized his good work for the diocese of \nCleveland by appointing him Bishop.\n  Bishop Pevec's warmth and compassion have been felt by many in the \nCity of Cleveland over the past half-century, and I am certain his \nlight shall shine upon us for many years to come. I join all my fellow \nCleveland parishioners, and all who have come to know Bishop Pevec in \ncongratulating him on his 50 years of service to the Lord and to his \nfellow man. He is a true inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4373-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4373-S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TOOTSIE FERRELL AND THE DELAWARE SPORTS HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES\n\n Mr. ROTH.

They truly deserve to be recognized for their unique, \nindividual contributions to athletics and to the state of Delaware.\n  The inductees are: Dale Farmer, former executive director of the \nDelaware Secondary Schools Athletic Association; Robert ``Clyde'' \nFarmer, a stand-out pitcher in the local fast-pitch softball leagues of \nthe 1940s and 50s; C. Walter Kadel, who coached and taught physical \neducation to Wilmington's children for more than three decades; Ron \nLuddington, a bronze medal winner in the 1960 Olympics, who now coaches \nfuture skating champions at the University of Delaware ice rink; Betty \nRichardson, who coached championship field hockey teams at Tower Hill \nHigh School, and won championships of her own on the golf course; G. \nHenry White, a star rusher on the gridiron at Cape Henlopen High School \nand at Colgate University; Matt Zabitka, who has covered sports in the \nDelaware Valley for nearly half a century; and Howard ``Tootsie'' \nFerrell, a Delawarean who played with some of the greatest baseball \ntalent of all-time in the Negro League.\n  An editorial in The News Journal newspaper called this group ``a very \ndiverse group of honorees--one of the most varied in its history. The \nSports Hall of Fame now represents all sorts of sports greats--white \npeople, minorities, women * * *.''\n  And it is in that spirit that I want to talk about one of those \ninductees right now.\n  Howard ``Tootsie'' Ferrell was a pitcher in the Negro League who once \nbarnstormed with Jackie Robinson who went on the break the color \nbarrier, and integrate major league baseball. Ferrell got his start \nwith the Newark Eagles in 1947. For the next two seasons, he played \nwith the Baltimore Elite Giants. Following in the footsteps of the \ngreat Jackie Robinson,\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nFerrel's contract was purchased by the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he spent \n3 seasons in the Dodgers' farm system. A nagging injury cut Ferrell's \nbaseball career short. But the real reason ``Tootsie'' Ferrell never \ngot his chance to play in the majors was because of the prejudice that \nkept America's pastime segregated for so many years.\n  It may be hard for younger Americans to imagine a world where the \nbest African-American players were not allowed to play on the same \nfield with the best white players. The first appearance of an official \ncolor barrier in baseball came in 1868, when the National Association \nof Baseball Players voted to bar any club that had non-white members. \nProfessional baseball eventually followed suit. Sadly, by the turn \nof the century there were no black players in organized, professional \nbaseball.\n\n  But exclusion from the ``white'' leagues did not stop African-\nAmericans from playing the game of baseball. Instead, they formed teams \nand leagues of their own. In 1920, an African-American businessman \nnamed Rube Foster organized a collection of independent all-black ball \nclubs into the Negro National League. In 1923, the competing Eastern \nColored League was formed. These two leagues operated successfully for \nyears--delighting crowds, showcasing the talent of African-American \nathletes, and inspiring future generations of baseball players. A new \nNegro National League was organized in 1933, and the Negro American \nLeague was chartered four years later. These leagues thrived until the \ncolor barrier was finally shattered by Jackie Robinson. And although \nall-black teams continued to play for several years, integrated major \nleague baseball eventually put the Negro Leagues out of business.\n  The history of the white major leagues has been well documented. \nUnfortunately, the same is not true of the Negro Leagues. While it is \neasy to look up how many home runs Babe Ruth hit or how many batters \nthe great Walter Johnston struck out, the same cannot be done for Negro \nLeague greats like Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. As time goes by, \nthere are fewer and fewer men left who played ``the other'' game of \nbaseball before the color barrier was broken. That is why it is so \nimportant we honor men like ``Tootsie'' Ferrell. He began his baseball \ncareer in a league that was separate but unequal. He saw this ugly and \nunfair color barrier disappear, just as it eventually would in other \naspects of American society.\n  I congratulate Howard ``Tootsie'' Ferrell for his achievement, and I \ncommend the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame for his induction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4374-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL RONALD R.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nexceptionally distinguished service of Lieutenant General Ronald R. \nBlanck, United States Army, who has distinguished himself as the Army's \n39th Surgeon General and Commander, U.S. Army Medical Command General, \nfrom 1 October 1996 to 31 August 2000.\n  In addition to serving as the principal medical staff advisor to the \nArmy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Blanck also serves as Commander \nof the United States Army Medical Command, which administers a 6.6 \nbillion-dollar worldwide-integrated health care system with 46,000 \nmilitary personnel and 26,000 civilian employees. During his tenure, \nLieutenant General Blanck concentrated on three major areas, readiness, \nquality of healthcare, and innovation, to ensure the provision of \ncomprehensive, quality healthcare to soldiers, retirees, and their \nfamily members. Lieutenant General Blanck implemented a new set of \ncombat support training standards; energized the Army's Medical \nReengineering Initiative; and organized an array of Special Medical \nAugmentation Response Teams to provide global, rapid-deployment \ncapabilities for local, state and federal agencies. He provided \noversight for the Defense Department Anthrax Vaccine Immunization \nProgram; and established a successful, Army-wide Medical Protection \nSystem to track all immunization data. In addition, he established new \npartnerships with civilian trauma centers to provide appropriate hands-\non training and experience for military surgical trauma teams.\n  Lieutenant General Blanck has been a leader in the development and \nuse of clinical practice guidelines and helped implement the Department \nof Defense clinical practice guidelines partnership with the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. As a direct result of his initiatives, Army \nmedical treatment facilities have been accredited by the Joint \nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), with \nscores consistently above 90, the highest in the history of the Army \nMedical Department, with three prestigious Army hospitals receiving \nperfect scores of 100 on their JCAHO surveys during the past year. \nLieutenant General Blanck has championed the use of modern technologies \nby the Department of Defense and the Army Medical Department. He \nsupported an innovative Simulation Center initiative, and promoted the \ndissemination of information about chemical and biological terrorism. \nHe has also enthusiastically advocated the introduction of new, \nadvanced technologies into patient care, including: (1) the Medical \nPersonal Information Carrier which stores soldiers' medical and \npersonal information, (2) a dry fibrin sealant bandage, developed by \nArmy research in cooperation with the American Red Cross, (3) multiple \nand extensive uses of telemedicine, (4) new initiatives to speed \nevacuation of wounded soldiers from the battlefield.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant General Blanck is a great credit to the \nArmy and the Nation. Even with all of the extraordinary accomplishments \nduring his thirty-two years of service, General Blanck will be \nremembered mostly for his great compassion for people, his loyalty to \nhis country and his inspirational leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4374-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4374-S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF DR. PAT JOHNSON, PRINCIPAL OF KENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the students at Kent Elementary \nSchool have witnessed many innovative changes thanks to the hard work \nand foresight of their principal, Dr. Pat Johnson. For the last nine \nyears, Dr. Johnson has been called a strong and supportive leader by \nher colleagues and never ceases to make the mark of excellence high for \nher staff and students. I applaud Dr. Johnson's work in transforming an \nat-risk school into one of excellence.\n  Kent Elementary School serves a low income and highly transient \npopulation, yet Dr. Johnson believes in the abilities of all students, \npreaching her motto that ``Together Everyone Achieves More'' (TEAM). \nThough many students face challenges both at home and in the classroom, \nDr. Johnson uses her positive attitude to inspire her staff toward \nmaintaining an environment that promotes student learning.\n  One example of Johnson's commitment to enhancing student achievement \nwas by creating a school-wide discipline program. Through this program, \ndiscipline problems have dramatically decreased on the playground and \nin the classroom. Dr. Johnson also believes in reinforcing positive \nsocial skills to the children through rewards and student recognition. \nAll of the staff members share in this ``Positive Action'' program, \nmaking teamwork a priority for the children.\n  Dr. Johnson has also implemented block scheduling to maximize student \nlearning. In order to better target students' math and reading skills, \nstudents attend specifically assigned classes that fit their \nappropriate learning levels, giving children the opportunity to move to \nother classrooms as their needs and skill levels improve throughout the \nyear.\n  Student reading levels have also improved because of Dr. Johnson's \nReading Mastery program which focuses on strategies that help students \nreach academic success. Johnson's impact on her students is also \nevident in Kent Elementary's 1998 Washington Assessment of Student \nLearning (WASL) writing scores which were the highest scores in the \nKent School District.\n  Another challenge taken on by Principal Johnson was giving students a \nsense of stability in their lives by creating a ``multi-age format'' in \neach classroom. This system allows students to have the same home-room \nteacher for two years and lowers the student/teacher ratio.\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\n  Clearly Dr. Johnson is a tremendous leader who works to enrich her \nstudents' lives. She has established many new ways to improve student \nlearning and continues to inspire her staff and students to conquer new \nchallenges. Clearly Dr. Johnson is an influential principal who is \nmaking local education in Washington State even stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4375-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AAA OHIO MOTORISTS ASSOCIATION 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH, Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n100th anniversary of the AAA Ohio Motorists Association.\n  On January 8, 1900, seven prominent Cleveland businessmen with ties \nto the automotive industry met in a small room in the Old Hollenden \nHouse Hotel on Superior Avenue to incorporate an organization that \nwould promote and protect their interests in the growth of the \nautomobile. Their belief in the future of this fledgling industry led \nto the founding of the Cleveland Automobile Club. Over the years, as \ncars became more popular, the Club expanded and the name changed, \nfinally becoming the AAA Ohio Motorists Association. But through it \nall, the successor organization to the first meeting of the Cleveland \nAutomobile Club celebrates not only its 100th anniversary this year, \nbut its stature as the oldest automobile club in the world.\n  I have often said that the one organization that I listen to in Ohio \nwhich represents the motoring public is the American Automobile \nAssociation, and I am certain many of my colleagues feel the same way. \nAAA's service to its members is renowned, and there are many cold and \nrainy nights where that service is especially appreciated, via AAA's \nEmergency Road Service. In addition, AAA provides Approved Auto Repair \nservice, AAA Travel Agency and high quality maps and TourBooks. These \nare some of the services that AAA members have depended upon for \ngenerations; services that are possible, in part, because of the many \nfirsts that can be attributed to the association. The Cleveland \nAutomobile Club opened the first travel agency in the State of Ohio; \noperated the first license bureau in the state; and was the first in \nthe United States to use radios to dispatch emergency road service \nvehicles. In addition, the Ohio Motorist magazine, which has been \npublished for 92 years, was recently selected as one of the best \nmagazines in Ohio.\n  Ohio Motorists Association members as well as non-members benefit \nfrom the OMA's support of local communities' traffic, bike and \npedestrian safety programs, including the Helmet Smart and Community \nTraffic Safety programs. Also, the Ohio Motorists Association is a \nleader in the promotion of seat belt safety and courteous, responsible \ndriving.\n  From those first 7 members in Cleveland 100 years ago, the AAA Ohio \nMotorist Association has grown to serve over 650,000 members in nine \ncounties today. As they begin another 100 years, I know that the AAA \nOhio Motorists Association will continue help stranded motorists, plan \ntrips, and perform the many services that members have come to enjoy.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Northeast Ohio, I congratulate the AAA \nOhio Motorists Association on their centennial and look forward to many \nmore years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4375-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with amendments in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate.\n\n       S. 1402.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to the collection of \n     certain kinds of information from patients in a home health \n     care setting; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 20\n\n       Whereas, the quality of health care for home health agency \n     patients is highly desired, the health care provided by the \n     home health agency needs to be examined in order to ascertain \n     whether improvements are necessary, and to determine what \n     aspects to improve; and\n       Whereas, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new \n     Medicare payment system to improve the existing payment \n     system, and must be in place by October 2000. The Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA) will force home health care \n     agencies to collect and report personal and medical \n     information; and\n       Whereas, this sensitive personal information will be \n     collected and used, without the consent of the patients, not \n     only to create the new Medicare payment system, but also to \n     improve quality of care, and eliminate fraud; and\n       Whereas, home health care agencies participating to \n     Medicare and Medicaid are collecting patient information, and \n     data transmission from the states to HCFA has commenced; and\n       Whereas, the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) \n     survey is the 19-page conduit required by HCFA to collect a \n     range of medical and personal questions from more than 9,000 \n     Medicare certified home health care providers to complete in \n     order to assess more than 4,000,000 patients; and\n       Whereas, patients who receive federal benefits must \n     disclose personal information including physical, mental, and \n     functional information: patients' medical history; living \n     arrangements; sensory status; medications; and emotional \n     status through behavioral and psychological profiles. Home \n     health care patients who do not collect federal benefits must \n     also disclose personal information in a scaled back version \n     of the OASIS survey; and\n       Whereas, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asserts \n     that the database will be used to perform outcomes research \n     on home-care patients; and\n       Whereas, the ACLU is concerned with HCFA's collection of \n     data because it cannot justify overriding the Fourth \n     Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the requirements of \n     medical ethics, and the federal regulations on research \n     involving human subjects, which asserts that any research \n     using fully identified information requires fully informed \n     consent; and\n       Whereas, HCFA is unwilling to allow patients to opt out of \n     this data collection system; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That due to HCFA's intrusion of government bureaucracy into \n     private transactions that take place outside of a federal \n     program into personal liberty and privacy, New Hampshire \n     urges Congress to block HCFA's intrusive regulations, and to \n     work to protect the personal liberty and privacy of every \n     American; and\n       That copies of this resolution, signed by the speaker of \n     the house of representatives and the president of the senate, \n     be forwarded by the house clerk to the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, and to the governor of each state.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-525. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Medicare \n     coverage for immunosuppressive drugs; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 153\n\n       Whereas, The medical community has made remarkable \n     advancements in the effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs \n     that are used to prevent organ rejection in transplant \n     patients. This has contributed to the great strides that have \n     occurred in the field of organ transplantation; and\n       Whereas, While these drugs are expensive, the quality of \n     life they afford and the more costly health procedures they \n     can avoid make immunosuppressive medicines a worthwhile \n     investment. In many instances, people previously disabled for \n     long periods of time are able to return to work and live a \n     full life as productive citizens; and\n       Whereas, Under current law, Medicare will provide for \n     immunosuppressive drugs for up to three years following a \n     transplant. It has become apparent to those in the medical \n     community working with patients receiving kidneys, hearts, \n     and livers that this limit puts transplant recipients at risk \n     and is counterproductive. In contrast to the limited coverage \n     for the immunosuppressive drugs, for example, a patient \n     needing kidney dialysis can receive coverage for that \n     procedure indefinitely. Costs for dialysis are significantly \n     higher than for most immunosuppressive regimens. A successful \n     transplant patient is more likely to return to work than many \n     dialysis patients; and\n       Whereas, Congress is presently considering measures that \n     would extend Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs. \n     This step is a most appropriate response to the needs of \n     transplant patients and a more effective long-term approach \n     to a serious health-care issue; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to remove the time \n     limit for Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-526. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to the responsible use of \n     agricultural biotechnology for the benefit of Hawaii's \n     people; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, biotechnology refers to any technique that uses \n     living organisms or parts thereof to make or modify a product \n     or plants, animals, or microorganisms for specific uses; and\n       Whereas, traditional biotechnology, primarily breeding and \n     selection, has been used by humankind for thousands of years \n     for the improvement of plants, animals, and microorganisms; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the last three decades scientific advances in \n     molecular biology have resulted in what is known as \n     recombinant DNA technology or ``genetic engineering'' with \n     the ability to readily move genetic material between more \n     distantly related organisms; and\n       Whereas, the key components of modern biotechnology are \n     genomics, the molecular characterization of all genes and \n     gene products of a species; bioinformatics, the assembly of \n     data from genomic analysis into accessible and usable forms; \n     transformation, the introduction of single genes conferring \n     useful traits into plants, livestock, fish, tree species, \n     etc.; the identification and evaluation of useful traits in \n     breeding by the use of marker-assisted selection; \n     diagnostics, the more accurate and quicker identification of \n     disease-causing agents, or pathogens, by using new diagnostic \n     techniques based on the molecular characterization of \n     pathogens; and vaccine technology, the use of modern \n     immunology to develop recombinant DNA vaccines for improved \n     control against lethal diseases; and\n       Whereas, the papaya industry in Hawaii survived the risks \n     of disease and pest infestations with transgenic seeds made \n     possible from advances in biotechnology; and\n       Whereas, organisms improved, or ``transformed,'' through \n     modern biotechnology are commonly referred to as \n     ``genetically-modified'' or ``bioengineered organisms''; and\n       Whereas, modern biotechnology has several advantages over \n     traditional biotechnology including the ability to transfer \n     a single, specific gene providing a useful trait to a \n     target organism, the more rapid development of varieties \n     containing new and desirable traits, the knowledge that a \n     specific gene or set of genes produce a desired trait, and \n     the availability of the entire span of genetic \n     capabilities among all organisms; and\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n       Whereas, modern biotechnology is being used to increase the \n     productivity of crops and livestock, to improve the quality \n     of life by developing new high-yielding crops that require \n     fewer inputs and conserve natural resources, to increase the \n     food supply for a rapidly increasing human population, to \n     produce more nutritious foods with longer shelf lives, and to \n     continue to provide consumers with high-quality, low-cost \n     food products; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that in 1999 about 100 million \n     acres worldwide were planted with transgenic varieties of \n     more than 20 crop species and the value of transgenic crops \n     grew from $75 million in 1995 to $1.64 billion in 1998; and\n       Whereas, the National Research Council has stated that \n     bioengineered crops should provide no greater risk to the \n     environment than those crops using traditional biotechnology; \n     and\n       Whereas, further advances in modern biotechnology may \n     result in crops, for example, that combat vitamin and mineral \n     deficiencies that afflict hundreds of millions of people \n     worldwide or that can be used to produce life-saving vaccines \n     and biodegradable plastics; and\n       Whereas, a 1999 report of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics \n     concluded that there is compelling moral imperative to enable \n     emerging economies to evaluate the use of modern \n     biotechnology to combat hunger and poverty; and\n       Whereas, a September 1999 Gallup Poll found that Americans \n     most familiar with modern biotechnology are also the most \n     supportive of its use to improve our food supply and that \n     more than three-fourths of Americans are confident in the \n     federal government to ensure the safety of the nation's food \n     supply; and\n       Whereas, federal law requires that all foods and food \n     ingredients, whether produced by traditional or modern \n     biotechnology, must be extensively reviewed for safety by the \n     U.S. Food and Drug Administration and meet the provisions of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act before they can be \n     sold to consumers;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to amending the Constitution \n     to restrict the ability of the federal judiciary to mandate \n     any state or subdivision thereof to levy or increase taxes; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5059\n\n       Whereas, Unfunded mandates by the United States Congress \n     and the executive branch of the federal government \n     increasingly strain already tight state government budgets if \n     the states are to comply; and\n       Whereas, To further compound this assault on state \n     revenues, federal district courts, with the blessing of the \n     United States Supreme Court, continue to order states to levy \n     or increase taxes to supplement their budgets to comply with \n     federal mandates; and\n       Whereas, The court's actions are an intrusion into a \n     legitimate legislative debate over state spending priorities \n     and not a response to a constitutional directive; and\n       Whereas, The Constitution of the United States of America \n     does not allow, nor do the states need, judicial intervention \n     requiring tax levies or increases as solutions to potentially \n     serious problems; and\n       Whereas, This usurpation of legislative authority begins a \n     process that over time could threaten the fundamental concept \n     of separation of powers that is precious to the preservation \n     of the form of our government embodied by the Constitution of \n     the United States of America; and\n       Whereas, Fifteen states, including Alabama, Alaska, \n     Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, \n     Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, \n     Tennessee and Utah, have petitioned the United States \n     Congress to propose an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States of America that reads as follows: ``Neither the \n     Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the United States \n     shall have the power to instruct or order a state or \n     political subdivision thereof, or and official of such state \n     or political subdivision, to levy or increase taxes.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein: That the Kansas \n     Legislature respectfully requests and petitions the Congress \n     of the United States to propose submission to the states for \n     their ratification an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States of America to restrict the ability of the \n     United States Supreme Court or any inferior court of the \n     United States to mandate any state or political subdivision \n     of the state to levy or increase taxes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is hereby directed to \n     send enrolled copies of this section to the President of the \n     United States; the President pro tempore of the United States \n     Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives; each member of the Kansas Congressional \n     Delegation; each member of the United States Supreme Court \n     and the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit \n     and all federal district court judges for the district of \n     Kansas; and each member of the Kansas Supreme Court and the \n     Kansas Court of Appeals and all Kansas district court judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4378-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n       The following executive reports of committee were \n     submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       General John A.

A bill to lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the trade normalization with cuba act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Roberts, Dorgan, and Lincoln, to introduce the Trade \nNormalization With Cuba Act of 2000.\n  For 40 years, we have implemented a series of policies designed to \nend Fidel Castro's leadership of Cuba. The instruments we have used \nhave included a trade embargo, an invasion of Cuba, assassination \nattempts, and multilateral pressures. None of these measures has moved \nCuba any closer to democracy and a market economy. In fact, the result \nhas been just the opposite. Castro is as entrenched as ever. The \neconomy is in tatters. The Cuban people are suffering.\n  For four decades, Castro has suppressed his own citizens. He has been \nresponsible for the imprisonment and mistreatment of thousands, and the \nemigration of hundreds of thousands. He has dispatched Cuban troops \naround the world to support revolution.\n  During the Cold War, Cuba was an integral member of the Soviet bloc. \nCastro was an eager and active participant in the proxy battles fought \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union throughout Africa, Asia, \nand Latin America.\n  The Cold War has been over for a decade. The embargo, which had the \ngoal of forcing Castro out of power, has failed totally. And it will \ncontinue to have no impact on the longevity of Castro's rule.\n  What has the embargo and American policy actually done? It has \ncertainly done nothing to advance liberty and democracy for the Cuban \npeople. And there are no prospects that it will.\n  What has the embargo done? First, it prohibits all trade with Cuba. \nIt does include an exception for the sale of food and medicine. \nHowever, the requirements are so complex and burdensome on U.S. \nsuppliers that very little food or medicine has been exported to Cuba. \nWe hurt the Cuban people. We hurt American business, American farmers, \nand American workers. And we have had no impact on the regime.\n  We have succeeded in alienating virtually all potential allies who \nwould be willing to work with us in developing a realistic policy to \ninfluence change in Cuba--the nations of the European Union, Canada, \nthe Organization of American States, the United Nations, even the Pope.\n  Another accomplishment of our policy of our trade embargo, we now \nhave a law, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, that \nprohibits lifting the embargo until there is a transition government in \nCuba that does not include Castro. This is an ``all or nothing policy'' \nthat cannot work in the real world.\n  Unilateral trade sanctions don't work. This is as true with Cuba as \nit has been with China, Myanmar, Iraq, or North Korea. In some cases, \nit hurts the people in those countries. And it hurts Americans, our \nfarmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses.\n  Forty years of sanctions have accomplished nothing in Cuba. It is \ntime for the Congress to recognize that. I fully support the efforts \nbeing made again this year in both the Senate and the House to remove \nthe unilateral restraints we have put on our export of food and \nmedicine to a number of countries, including Cuba. This bill is not a \nsubstitute for those efforts. Rather, this bill is directed only toward \nCuba, and goes far beyond liberalization of food and medicine exports.\n  Thomas Jefferson said ``Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny \nand oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the \ndawn of the day.'' Current US policy turns Jefferson's statement on its \nhead. Our effort to isolate Cuba through the trade embargo and other \npolicies has failed to bring human rights improvement, has provided a \npretext for Castro's continued repression, makes the United States the \nscapegoat for Castro's failed economic policies, and hurts the Cuban \npeople.\n  It is time to put together a responsible strategy to improve the \nhuman condition in Cuba and set the stage for increased freedom and \nrespect for human rights once Fidel Castro leaves the scene.\n  Obviously, Cuba will not change overnight with the removal of the \ntrade embargo. But this bill is a first step down the road to a \npeaceful transition to a democratic society and a market economy in \nCuba.\n  Before I conclude, I want to recognize my friend, Congressman Charles \nRangel, who has been a leader in trying to end the embargo and move \ntoward normalization of relations with Cuba. I look forward to working \nclosely with him to make this happen.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support our effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2618. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell \ncertain land to the town of Kingston, Nevada, for use as an emergency \nmedical air evacuation site and other public uses; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   emergency landing strip conveyance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Town of \nKingston Emergency Landing Strip Conveyance Act.\n  The Town of Kingston, Nevada, currently uses federal land as an \nemergency landing strip at Kingston in southern Lander County, Nevada. \nKingston is a rural town located on a small island of private land in \nthe center of the state and is surrounded by both United States Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public lands. The isolation \nconstrains the growth, economic diversity, and public services \navailable to those who live in or visit Kingston. Medic Air of Reno has \nan agreement with local Fire and Rescue to provide 24-hour emergency \nmedical service to this landing strip. BLM has extended the existing \nairport lease to the Kingston Town\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nBoard until September 30, 2000, but cannot renew the lease because the \nstrip does not meet FAA standards.\n  This Act will convey a total of 144.88 acres to the Town of Kingston. \nSeventy acres will be conveyed at fair market value and 74.88 acres at \nno cost. The 70 acres contains the main landing strip. The 74.88 acres \ncontains the balance of the approach and the disposal of this land for \nno consideration will benefit the United States by disposing of an \nisolated, segregated parcel that would be difficult to manage for \npublic use. It is my sincere hope that Congress will pass this bill \nthereby allowing a win-win situation for both the United States and \nKingston, Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the lease by the Secretary of the Interior of certain \n     land to the town of Kingston, Nevada, for use as an emergency \n     airstrip is about to expire;\n       (2) rather than renew the airport lease (which would \n     require certification by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration), the Secretary and the Town desire that the \n     parcel on which the main landing strip is situated be sold to \n     the Town for fair market value as determined by the \n     Secretary;\n       (3) adjacent to that parcel is other land, most of which, \n     if the airstrip parcel is sold to the Town, would be isolated \n     from other land administered by the Secretary and would \n     therefore be difficult for the Secretary to manage;\n       (4) it would in the best interests of the United States and \n     the Town for the Secretary to convey to the Town both the \n     airstrip parcel and the adjacent parcel, at the fair market \n     value of the airstrip parcel; and\n       (5) the parcels have been determined to be suitable for \n     disposal in the Shoshone-Eureka Resource Management Plan and \n     Environmental Impact Statement.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Adjacent parcel.--The term ``adjacent parcel'' means \n     the parcels of land in the State of Nevada, comprising 74.88 \n     acres, described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T16N, R44E, \n     section 31, lot 4, E1/2NESE, S1/2SWNESE, S1/2S1/2NWSE.\n       (2) Airstrip parcel.--The term ``airstrip parcel'' means \n     the parcel of land, with a landing strip running on an \n     easterly bearing and a portion of a landing strip running on \n     a southerly bearing, in the State of Nevada, comprising 70.00 \n     acres, described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T16N, R44E, \n     section 31, N1/2SESW, N1/2SWSE, N1/2SESE, SESESE.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Land Management.\n       (4) Town.--The term ``Town'' means the town of Kingston, \n     Nevada.\n       (c) Conveyance.--In consideration of payment of the fair \n     market value of the airstrip parcel, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall convey to the Town, subject to valid existing \n     rights, all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to the airstrip parcel and the adjacent parcel, \n     totaling 144.88 acres.\n       (d) No Reservations.--The patent by which the conveyance \n     under subsection (c) is made shall contain no reservations.\n       (e) Lease Extension.--If for any reason the conveyance \n     under subsection (c) is not completed before September 30, \n     2000, the term of the airport lease, as in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, shall be considered to be extended \n     until the date of the conveyance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2619. A bill to provide for drug-free prisons; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   The Drug-Free Prisons Act of 2000\n\n  Mr LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation--with \nSenators Robb and Kennedy--that will provide state and local \ngovernments additional tools to fight drug use in our nation's prisons. \nIt is critical that our prisons be drug-free, both because lawbreaking \nwithin our correctional system is a national embarrassment, and because \nprisoners who are released while still addicted to drugs are far more \nlikely to commit future crimes than prisoners who are released sober. \nThis bill includes numerous provisions that will provide needed help to \naddress drug abuse in prisons throughout the country.\n  The bill establishes a new grant program that authorizes the Attorney \nGeneral to make $75 million a year in grants to state and local \ngovernments to support comprehensive drug testing and treatment for \nprisoners and other offenders. It would also permit states that \ncurrently receive money under the Violent Offender Incarceration and \nTruth in Sentencing Grant Program (VOI/TIS) to use those funds to pay \nfor drug testing and treatment, so long as the state receiving the \nfunds has penalties in place to address drug trafficking in prisons. In \naddition, the bill would reauthorize appropriations for the Residential \nSubstance Abuse for State Prisoners (RSAT) grants program for the next \nfive years, and establish exemptions to the general four-year time \nlimit on Byrne grants for state and local law enforcement programs \ninvolving drugs.\n  The bill also re-establishes the drug courts program and re-\nauthorizes funding for it. The majority repealed the program in the \nOmnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, in a \npartisan bashing of Democratic programs. In my view, effective programs \ndealing with drug abuse should not be used as political footballs. That \nis why the Administration, with the strong support of the Department of \nJustice, has continued to seek funding for the program, and why the \nCongress has continued to fund drug courts in every year's \nappropriations acts. This has been the right decision, and we should \nundo the repeal.\n  Drug courts provide the opportunity to deal systematically with \nnonviolent drug offenders at a substantial savings to taxpayers. \nInstead of jailing these nonviolent offenders, the courts can order \nalternative punishments that are mixed with mandatory testing and drug \ntreatment and human services such as education or vocational training. \nMeanwhile, imprisonment is held out as a stick to ensure good behavior. \nTo qualify for federal assistance, a drug court program must mandate \nperiodic drug testing during any supervised release or probation \nperiods, provide drug abuse treatment for each participant, and must \nhold out the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration \nfor noncompliance or failure to show satisfactory process. Violent \noffenders are defined quite broadly, so we can be confident that we are \nnot funding programs that put dangerous people back on the streets. \nDrug courts hold out the promise of providing a way that we can reach \nout to younger offenders who are using drugs before they turn to a life \nof crime, helping to save lives and significant government resources.\n  The bill permits state and local governments to spend up to 25 \npercent of unexpended VOT/TIS grants from fiscal years 1996-2001 to \nimplement graduated sanctions, including victim and community \nrestitution, intensive community supervision, regular drug testing, and \nshort-term incarceration. Such graduated sanctions initiatives would \nfree up additional prison space for violent offenders, and States would \nhave to use this program for that purpose. Indeed, the purpose of this \nproposal is to ensure that States have sufficient flexibility to \nguarantee that violent criminals serve their full sentences, the goal \nof the Truth in Sentencing grants.\n  Drug abuse in prisons is a serious problem. The National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA) recently \nfound that drug and alcohol abuse was implicated in the crimes and \nincarceration of 80 percent of those currently serving time in \nAmerica's prisons. This finding shows that we have a prison population \nthat has a history of substance abuse, and will seek out opportunities \nto continue using drugs while imprisoned. Of course, if prisoners are \nusing drugs in prison, this will create serious behavioral and other \nproblems that corrections officers will have to address, at no small \nrisk to them.\n  The problem does not end there. The same CASA study shows that \ninmates who are illegal drug and/or alcohol abusers are the most likely \nto be repeat offenders. In fact, the study concluded that 61 percent of \nstate prison inmates who have two prior convictions are regular drug \nusers. The strong link between drug use and recidivism cannot be \nignored. Prison should provide an opportunity for us to break this \ncycle and therefore reduce crime. We can do this through a concerted \neffort to test prisoners for drug\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nuse--and penalize those who test positive--and provide adequate drug \ntreatment so that prisoners can lead productive, non-criminal lives \nupon their release. As Joseph Califano, former Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare and current president of \nCASA, recently said: ``Releasing drug-addicted inmates without \ntreatment helps maintain the market for illegal drugs and supports drug \ndealers.'' And there is every indication that the number of prisoners \nneeding drug treatment is increasing even faster than the prison \npopulation as a whole. According to CASA, from 1993 to 1996, the number \nof inmates needing substance abuse treatment rose from 688,000 to \n840,000. There is no reason to believe the problem has abated.\n  Indeed, just last December, the National League of Cities adopted a \nresolution on the importance of drug testing and treatment in prisons. \nThe League cited studies showing that among inmates who completed drug \nabuse treatment programs, only 3.3 percent were rearrested within the \nfirst six months after release, compared to 12.1 percent of inmates who \ndid not receive treatment.\n  It is clear that if we do not take steps to stop the revolving doors \nof our nation's prison system, we will continually be forced to spend \nmore and more public money to construct more and more prisons. To avoid \nthat result, we need to determine through testing which inmates are \naddicted to drugs and alcohol, reduce the availability of drugs in \nprisons, and ensure that inmates have access to the treatment they need \nwhile incarcerated.\n  Some have advocated that every prisoner be tested before being \nreleased, a proposal that, to my knowledge, no State has adopted. As \nlaw enforcement officials in our States know, such testing would be \nextraordinarily expensive and unnecessarily broad. The better and more \nrealistic approach is to provide resources that will enhance States' \nability to do targeted testing, allowing corrections officers to use \ntheir judgment as to which prisoners are most likely to be abusing \ndrugs while providing a deterrent effect for prisoners generally. That \nis the approach of this legislation I introduce today.\n  I realize some of my colleagues may be concerned about funds \noriginally designated for prison construction costs being used for drug \ntesting and treatment. Let me assure you that states will retain \ncomplete flexibility under this bill as to how they allocate their \nTruth in Sentencing and Violent Offender Incarceration grant funds. But \na powerful case can be made that it is in the fiscal interests of the \nStates to take advantage of the opportunity this bill offers. According \nto the CASA study, it would cost States about $6,500 per year to \nprovide comprehensive and effective residential drug treatment services \nto an inmate. In return, the study shows that society will see an \neconomic return of $68,800 for each inmate who successfully completes \nsuch a program and returns to the community sober and with a job. This \nfigure represents the savings in the first year based on the much lower \nlikelihood that the former inmate will be arrested, prosecuted, or \nincarcerated, and includes health care savings and the potential \nearnings of a drug-free individual.\n  Funding both testing and treatment allows us to take a carrot-and-\nstick approach to a persistent national problem. We cannot hope to get \na handle on our drug problem so long as drug abuse and drug trafficking \npersist in our prisons. We cannot afford the false choice between \ntreatment and testing; both are needed to keep order in our prisons and \nsafety in our streets.\n  This view is confirmed by the people who work with these issues every \nday in my State of Vermont. For example, James Walton, Vermont's \nCommissioner of Public Safety, and John Perry, the Director of Planning \nfor the Vermont Department of Corrections, wholeheartedly support this \nproposal. I have always valued their counsel, as they have first-hand \nknowledge of the real law enforcement needs in my state. They both feel \nstrongly that the bill will give law enforcement the tools it needs to \ntest and treat offender populations, both in jail and in the community. \nI hope and expect that this bill will have the same effect across the \ncountry.\n  For that reason and all of the above reasons, I urge the Senate to \ntake prompt action on this bill and support this effort to make our \nprisons drug-free.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 2620. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 2000 Vassar Street in Reno, Nevada, as the ``Barbara \nF. Vucanovich Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n               barbara f. vucanovich post office building\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Barbara F. \nVucanovich Post Office Building Naming Act.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich was \nthe first female elected to represent the State of Nevada in Congress. \nShe was first elected in 1983 and retired in 1996, after serving in the \nHouse of Representatives for 14 years. In her final year, she was an \ninfluential member of the House Appropriations Committee and the \nChairwoman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction. Barbara and I \ncame to the House together as a result of the 1982 election. We both \nrepresented all of Nevada; not solely Congressional Districts. Barbara \nwas a fine member of Congress. I miss her.\n  Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to introduce this bill to \ncommemorate Barbara Vucanovich's exemplary service to the State of \nNevada and the United States of America by renaming the main post \noffice in Reno, Nevada, as the ``Barbara F. Vucanovich Post Office \nBuilding.'' Representatives Gibbons and Berkley introduced identical \nlegislation in the House on April 4, 2000. Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn \nand former Senator Paul Laxalt join Nevada's congressional delegation \nin thanking Barbara Vucanovich for her dedicated public service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF BARBARA F.

Chafee, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2621. A bill to continue the current prohibition of military \ncooperation with the armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia until \nthe President determines and certifies to the Congress that certain \nconditions are being met; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n            East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to keep a promise that I \nmade on this floor a few months ago.\n  In January, I came to the floor to talk about the tragic events that \noccurred last fall in East Timor. I spoke about the need to encourage \nthe new Indonesian government in its commitment to reform and its \nresolve to reject the climate of impunity. I withdrew an amendment that \nwould have codified the administration's suspension on military and \nsecurity assistance for Indonesia East Timor, although I believed then \nand strongly believe today that Indonesia has not yet met the basic \nconditions that should be prerequisites for any restoration of military \nties with Indonesia.\n  At that time, Mr. President, I pledged to continue to monitor events \nin Indonesia and in East Timor closely. And I pledged to come to this \nfloor if what I saw troubled me.\n  Let me tell you what I see today.\n  First, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, there have been no trials \nyet. No one has been brought to justice for the atrocities committed in \nEast Timor\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\nlast year. I recognize that the Indonesian government has taken some \ncourageous steps in investigating the atrocities that took place in \nEast Timor, and I commend the Indonesian government for its efforts to \ndate. The Indonesian government and the U.N. have succeeded in signing \nan agreement to exchange witnesses and evidence that could lead to the \nprosecution of those responsible for the violence in East Timor. A \nnumber of dedicated individuals within the new government continue to \nwork courageously for reform, justice, and accountability. But I note, \nthat obervers have been disturbed by the number of civilian and \nmilitary police officers that the government has appointed to the team \ncharged with investigating human rights abuses in East Timor. And the \nsimple fact remains--no one has yet been held accountable in a court of \nlaw for the acts committed by the military and militias in East Timor \nlast year.\n  A second concern is there has been no change in the situation in West \nTimor. Today, half a year after the referendum, some 100,000 people are \nstill living in the refugee camps of West Timor, afraid of what will \nhappen to them should they attempt to return home. Some will likely \nchoose to stay in Indonesia, but all reports from the area indicate \nthat many want to return home but do not because of continued \nintimidation from militia groups.\n  Within the refugee camps, since January there have been about a dozen \nincidents in which international agencies attempting to deliver aid to \nthe refugees were attacked. According to recent reports, one militia \ngroup is so well-organized that it prints a newsletter of fabricated \nhorror stories aimed at dissuading refugees from returning to East \nTimor.\n  This week the plight of these refugees--at this point the most \nvulnerable of the original masses--was made even more difficult as they \ncontend with the heavy rains and floods that have already killed at \nleast 148 people. Over a hundred are still missing. When the flood \nwaters recede, these people should have every opportunity to put their \nlives back together, free from threats and from fear.\n  I look at these facts and I consider that the administration has \nchosen to take a first step toward lifting its suspension on all forms \nof military assistance and contacts by inviting the Indonesians to \nparticiapte in a joint exercise, and I am indeed troubled.\n  Today I am introducing a bill, the East Timor Repatriation and \nSecurity Act of 2000. The bill codifies the suspension of military and \nsecurity assistance to Indonesia until certain conditions are met--the \nsame conditions that have been articulated in the past; the same \nconditions contained in last year's foreign operations appropriations \nbill.\n  The bill would permit military and security assistance to resume only \nwhen the President determines and submits a report to the appropriate \ncongressional committees that the Government of Indonesia and the \nIndonesian Armed Forces are:\n  Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed \nforces and militia groups against whom there is credible evidence of \nhuman rights violations;\n  Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed \nforces against whom there is credible evidence of aiding or abetting \nmilitia groups;\n  Allowing displaced persons and refugees to return home to East Timor, \nincluding providing safe passage for refugees returning from West \nTimor;\n  Not impeding the activities of the United Nations Transitional \nAuthority in East Timor;\n  Demonstrating a commitment to preventing incursions into East Timor \nby members of militia groups in West Timor; and,\n  Demonstrating a commitment to accountability by cooperating with \ninvestigations and prosecutions of members of the Indonesian Armed \nForces and military groups responsible for human rights violations in \nIndonesia and East Timor.\n  These certainly are not unreasonable conditions. They work in favor \nof the forces of reform within Indonesia. And by linking military and \nsecurity assistance to these benchmarks, Congress will ensure that the \nU.S. relationship with Jakarta avoids the mistakes of the past, and \nthat U.S. foreign policy comes closer to reflecting our core national \nvalues.\n  To those who believe that all is well, to those who would prefer to \nforgive and forget, to those who think that the issue is yesterday's \nnews, I would simply reiterate the simple facts. There have been no \ntrials for the perpetrators of abuses in East Timor, and the situation \nin the refugee camps has remained unacceptable. Quite recently, Admiral \nDennis Blair, commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific, \nreaffirmed what Secretary of Defense Cohen articulated last year--the \nU.S. will not resume a military relationship with Indonesia until the \nmilitary personnel responsible for the devastation in East Timor are \nbrought to justice, and the U.S. will not resume a military \nrelationship with Indonesia until the refugee crisis in West Timor has \nbeen resolved. Specifically, Admiral Blair called on the Indonesians to \ndisband and cut off support to the militia members still terrorizing \nthe refugees. It is critical that the U.S. insist on nothing less. In \nfact, we should insist on more--the militia members guilty of \natrocities should be brought to justice.\n  It is clear that these conditions have not yet been met. But the \nadministration's new proposals for joint exercises with the Indonesians \nundermine Admiral Blair's words. The substance of the exercise \ncurrently being planned does not necessarily trouble me, but its \nsignificance does. The administration looks as if it suffers from a \nlack of resolve and from a wavering sense of commitment.\n  Indonesia is an extraordinarily important country--strategically and \neconomically. Its future course will undoubtedly affect the United \nStates. For this very reason, we must stand firm, and insist upon \nrebuilding U.S.-Indonesian ties on the firm foundation of respect for \nthe rule of law and for basic human rights.\n  It is because I believe this so strongly--and I know that many of my \ncolleagues share my views--that I have come back to the floor to raise \nthis issue again. I am keeping my promise. I am watching the situation \nin East and West Timor very closely, and I still do not like what I \nsee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2622. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage stronger math and science programs at elementary and \nsecondary schools; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the national science education incentive act of 2000\n\n  S. 2623. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish and expand programs relating to science, \nmathematics, engineering, and technology education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             the national science education enhancement act\n\n  S. 2624. A bill to establish and expand programs relating to science, \nmathematics, engineering, and technology education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   the national science education act\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce sweeping \nlegislation to reform and improve math, science, engineering and \ntechnology education in American schools.\n  The fields of science, math, engineering and technology are critical \nto U.S. economic success. Unfortunately, there is growing concern that \nwe do not measure up as evidenced by studies that show our students \ncannot compete internationally. In fact, over half of students in our \nesteemed graduate schools are from other countries. Our economic future \ndepends on science and we must ensure that our schools are preparing \nstudents for the technological jobs that await them.\n  So many aspects of our national success depends on our technological \nsavvy. For instance, our strong economy has certainly prospered because \nof technology advances. The economic boom, witnessed by average \nconsumers and Wall Street analysts alike, has high stakes in our \ncontinued technology success. Meanwhile, our workforce is increasingly \nstaffed by people from other countries. Later this year, Congress will \nbe asked to again raise\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nthe quota of H-1B visas. While these workers are key to our economic \nsuccess, we must address this problem and grow our own high-tech labor \nforce. Moreover, we cannot forget how adversely our national security \ncould fare if our country were to fall behind in technological \npursuits. A key piece of our national security is at stake--the \nstrength of our military is built upon our technological superiority.\n  There is a fundamental need for this legislation. I have introduced \nthe following three bills to help improve the quality of science and \ntechnology teachers and curriculum through incentives and better \ntraining:\n  The National Science Education Act. These provisions, utilizing the \nNational Science Foundation, set up Science Master Teachers and offer \ngrants to place one in every elementary school.\n  The National Science Education Enhancement Act. Recognizing that we \nmust keep good teachers and help them grow in their career, this bill \nuses the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to set up Science \nTeacher Mentors and Summer Professional Development Institutes. It also \nexpands the Eisenhower National clearinghouse to provide that this \ninformation be available on the Internet.\n  The National Science Education Incentive Act. This bill provides tax \ncredits to help teachers with up to $10,000 of tuition and encourage \nthe private sector education contributions such as computers, \ntechnology service, teacher training and teacher externships.\n  My legislation is mirrored in the House of Representatives with bills \nby Representative Vernon Ehlers, the vice chairman of the House Science \nCommittee and author of ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National \nScience Policy.'' Furthermore, I am pleased to have the support and \nable assistance of the Senior Senator from Maine, Senator Olympia J. \nSnowe in joining me to introduce this bill.\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this effort to reform and improve math, science, engineering \nand technology education in American schools. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Science Education \n     Incentive Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As concluded in the report of the Committee on Science \n     of the House of Representatives, ``Unlocking Our Future \n     Toward a New National Science Policy,'' which was adopted by \n     the House of Representatives, the United States must maintain \n     and improve its preeminent position in science and technology \n     in order to advance human understanding of the universe and \n     all it contains, and to improve the lives, health, and \n     freedoms of all people.\n       (2) It is estimated that more than half of the economic \n     growth of the United States today results directly from \n     research and development in science and technology. The most \n     fundamental research is responsible for investigating our \n     perceived universe, to extend our observations to the outer \n     limits of what our minds and methods can achieve, and to seek \n     answers to questions that have never been asked before. \n     Applied research continues the process by applying the \n     answers from basic science to the problems faced by \n     individuals, organizations, and governments in the everyday \n     activities that make our lives more livable. The scientific-\n     technological sector of our economy, which has driven our \n     recent economic boom and led the United States to the longest \n     period of prosperity in history, is fueled by the work and \n     discoveries of the scientific community.\n       (3) The effectiveness of the United States in maintaining \n     this economic growth will be largely determined by the \n     intellectual capital of the United States. Education is \n     critical to developing this resource.\n       (4) The education program of the United States needs to \n     provide for 3 different kinds of intellectual capital. First, \n     it needs scientists and engineers to continue the research \n     and development that is central to the economic growth of the \n     United States. Second, it needs technologically proficient \n     workers who are comfortable and capable dealing with the \n     demands of a science-based, high-technology workplace. Last, \n     it needs scientifically literate voters and consumers to make \n     intelligent decisions about public policy.\n       (5) Student performance on the recent Third International \n     Math and Science Study highlights the shortcomings of current \n     K-12 science and mathematics education in the United States, \n     particularly when compared to other countries. We must expect \n     more from our Nation's educators and students if we are to \n     build on the accomplishments of previous generations. New \n     methods of teaching mathematics and science are required, as \n     well as better curricula and improved training of teachers.\n       (6) Science is more than a collection of facts, theories, \n     and results. It is a process of inquiry built upon \n     observations and data that leads to a way of knowing and \n     explaining in logically derived concepts and theories.\n       (7) Students should learn science primarily by doing \n     science. Science education ought to reflect the scientific \n     process and be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and \n     concept-based.\n       (8) Children are naturally curious and inquisitive. To \n     successfully tap into these innate qualities, education in \n     science must begin at an early age and continue throughout \n     the entire school experience.\n       (9) Teachers provide the essential connection between \n     students and the content they are learning. High-quality \n     prospective teachers need to be identified and recruited by \n     presenting to them a career that is respected by their peers, \n     is financially and intellectually rewarding, and contains \n     sufficient opportunities for advancement.\n       (10) Teachers need to have incentives to remain in the \n     classroom and improve their practice, and training of \n     teachers is essential if the results are to be good.

Work-study amendments.\nSec. 202. Study.\nSec. 203. Report to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As concluded in the report of the Committee on Science \n     of the House of Representatives, ``Unlocking Our Future \n     Toward a New National Science Policy,'' which was adopted by \n     the House of Representatives, the United States must maintain \n     and improve its preeminent position in science and technology \n     in order to advance human understanding of the universe and \n     all it contains, and to improve the lives, health, and \n     freedoms of all people.\n       (2) It is estimated that more than half of the economic \n     growth of the United States today results directly from \n     research and development in science and technology. The most \n     fundamental research is responsible for investigating our \n     perceived universe, to extend our observations to the outer \n     limits of what our minds and methods can achieve, and to seek \n     answers to questions that have never been asked before. \n     Applied research continues the process by applying the \n     answers from basic science to the problems faced by \n     individuals, organizations, and governments in the everyday \n     activities that make our lives more livable. The scientific-\n     technological sector of our economy, which has driven our \n     recent economic boom and led the United States to the longest \n     period of prosperity in history, is fueled by the work and \n     discoveries of the scientific community.\n       (3) The effectiveness of the United States in maintaining \n     this economic growth will be largely determined by the \n     intellectual capital of the United States. Education is \n     critical to developing this resource.\n       (4) The education program of the United States needs to \n     provide for 3 different kinds of intellectual capital. First, \n     it needs scientists and engineers to continue the research \n     and development that is central to the economic growth of the \n     United States. Second, it needs technologically proficient \n     workers who are comfortable and capable dealing with the \n     demands of a science-based, high-technology workplace. Last, \n     it needs scientifically literate voters and consumers to make \n     intelligent decisions about public policy.\n       (5) Student performance on the recent Third International \n     Math and Science Study highlights the shortcomings of current \n     K-12 science and mathematics education in the United States, \n     particularly when compared to other countries. We must expect \n     more from our Nation's educators and students if we are to \n     build on the accomplishments of previous generations. New \n     methods of teaching mathematics and science are required, as \n     well as better curricula and improved training of teachers.\n       (6) Science is more than a collection of facts, theories, \n     and results. It is a process of inquiry built upon \n     observations and data that leads to a way of knowing and \n     explaining in logically derived concepts and theories.\n       (7) Students should learn science primarily by doing \n     science. Science education ought to reflect the scientific \n     process and be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and \n     concept-based.\n       (8) Children are naturally curious and inquisitive. To \n     successfully tap into these innate qualities, education in \n     science must begin at an early age and continue throughout \n     the entire school experience.\n       (9) Teachers provide the essential connection between \n     students and the content they are learning. High-quality \n     prospective teachers need to be identified and recruited by \n     presenting to them a career that is respected by their peers, \n     is financially and intellectually rewarding, and contains \n     sufficient opportunities for advancement.\n       (10) Teachers need to have incentives to remain in the \n     classroom and improve their practice, and training of \n     teachers is essential if the results are to be good. Teachers \n     need to be knowledgeable of their content area, of their \n     curriculum, of up-to-date research in teaching and learning, \n     and of techniques that can be used to connect that \n     information to their students in their classroom.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Science Education \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As concluded in the report of the Committee on Science \n     of the House of Representatives, ``Unlocking Our Future \n     Toward a New National Science Policy,'' which was adopted by \n     the House of Representatives, the United States must maintain \n     and improve its preeminent position in science and technology \n     in order to advance human understanding of the universe and \n     all it contains, and to improve the lives, health, and \n     freedoms of all people.\n       (2) It is estimated that more than half of the economic \n     growth of the United States today results directly from \n     research and development in science and technology. The most \n     fundamental research is responsible for investigating our \n     perceived universe, to extend our observations to the outer \n     limits of what our minds and methods can achieve, and to seek \n     answers to questions that have never been asked before. \n     Applied research continues the process by applying the \n     answers from basic science to the problems faced by \n     individuals, organizations, and governments in the everyday \n     activities that make our lives more livable. The scientific-\n     technological sector of our economy, which has driven our \n     recent economic boom and led the United States to the longest \n     period of prosperity in history, is fueled by the work and \n     discoveries of the scientific community.\n       (3) The effectiveness of the United States in maintaining \n     this economic growth will be largely determined by the \n     intellectual capital of the United States. Education is \n     critical to developing this resource.\n       (4) The education program of the United States needs to \n     provide for 3 different kinds of intellectual capital. First, \n     it needs scientists and engineers to continue the research \n     and development that is central to the economic growth of the \n     United States. Second, it needs technologically proficient \n     workers who are comfortable and capable dealing with the \n     demands of a science-based, high-technology workplace. Last, \n     it needs scientifically literate voters and consumers to make \n     intelligent decisions about public policy.\n       (5) Student performance on the recent Third International \n     Math and Science Study highlights the shortcomings of current \n     K-12 science and mathematics education in the United States, \n     particularly when compared to other countries. We must expect \n     more from our Nation's educators and students if we are to \n     build on the accomplishments of previous generations. New \n     methods of teaching mathematics and science are required, as \n     well as better curricula and improved training of teachers.\n       (6) Science is more than a collection of facts, theories, \n     and results. It is a process of inquiry built upon \n     observations and data that leads to a way of knowing and \n     explaining in logically derived concepts and theories.\n       (7) Students should learn science primarily by doing \n     science. Science education ought to reflect the scientific \n     process and be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and \n     concept-based.\n       (8) Children are naturally curious and inquisitive. To \n     successfully tap into these innate qualities, education in \n     science must begin at an early age and continue throughout \n     the entire school experience.\n       (9) Teachers provide the essential connection between \n     students and the content they are learning. High-quality \n     prospective teachers need to be identified and recruited by \n     presenting to them a career that is respected by their peers, \n     is financially and intellectually rewarding, and contains \n     sufficient opportunities for advancement.\n       (10) Teachers need to have incentives to remain in the \n     classroom and improve their practice, and training of \n     teachers is essential if the results are to be good. Teachers \n     need to be knowledgeable of their content area, of their \n     curriculum, of up-to-date research in teaching and learning, \n     and of techniques that can be used to connect that \n     information to their students in their classroom.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the \nperformance standards and certification process for organ procurement \norganizations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n      THE ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nDodd, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Wellstone, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Dorgan, Senator Lieberman and Senator Moynihan, to \nintroduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act of 2000 \nto improve the performance evaluation and certification process that \nthe Health Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ \nprocurement organizations.\n  Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a \ncritical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to \nour efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for \ntransplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular \ngeographic region for coordinating the identification of potential \ndonors, requests for donation and recovery and transport of organs. The \nprofessionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss donation \nwith family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of donated \norgans. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and making \narrangements for their distribution according to national organ sharing \npolicies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education to \nmedical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and \ntissue donation to increase the availability of organs for \ntransplantation.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) 1999 report on organ \nprocurement and transplantation, a major impediment to greater \naccountability and improved performance on the part of OPOs is the \ncurrent lack of a reliable and valid method for assessing donor \npotential and OPO performance.\n  The current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, \npopulation-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on \ndonors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a \nstandard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors \nrecovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys \ntransplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and \nlungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per \nmillion. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every \ntwo years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean \nfor four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a \nparticular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without \nHCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate.\n  The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all \nhave criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure \nOPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance \nstandard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of \nacquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total \npopulation, not the number of potential donors, within the OPO's \nservice areas.''\n  OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, \nunderlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose \nsignificant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure \norgans, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment \nis that it does not account for these variations. An extremely \neffective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential \ndonors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because \nit has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of \npeople infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for \nconsideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO \nmay appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service \narea\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nwith a high proportion of potential donors.\n  For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and \naccidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region \nto region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic \naccidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Mississippi, \nhowever, it was 30.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous \nadvantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine.\n  Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may \nwell result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent \nperformers. Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the \ncertification process for OPOs lacks a clearly defined due process \ncomponent for resolving conflicts--an OPO that has been decertified has \nno opportunity for appeal to the Secretary of HHS on either substantive \nor procedural grounds. The current system therefore forces OPOs to \ncompete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, with no guarantee \nof an opportunity for fair hearing based on their actual performance. \nThis situation pressures many OPOs to focus on the certification \nprocess itself rather than on activities and methods to increase \ndonation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of the \nprogram. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter than \nother certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little \nopportunity to examine trends and even less incentive for OPOs to mount \nlong-term interventions.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has four major objectives. \nFirst, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process \nfor OPOs and on the use of population-based performance measurements. \nUnder our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in \nplace through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified \nas of January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements \napart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules \ngoverning OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are \nto rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence \nof organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and \nrecertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are \npromulgated. Third, the bill provides an opportunity for an OPO to \nappeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural \ngrounds, and fourth the bill extends the current two-year certification \ncycle to four years.\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed \nimprovements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify \nand assess OPO performance, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us \nin supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2626. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \naccess to tax-exempt debt for small non-profit health care and \neducational institutions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n improving access to tax-exempt debt for small non-profit health care \n                     and educational institutions.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will help small health and educational institutions \nmore effectively finance the cost of essential services and new \nfacility construction. By modifying the laws that restrict the \ndeductibility of ``bank eligible'' bonds, the bill I am introducing \ntoday will increase access to tax-exempt financing for small non-profit \norganizations that need it most, like small local hospitals and small \ninstitutions of higher education.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 unintentionally discriminated against \nsmall educational, health care and other non-profit institutions that \nwant to sell small amounts of tax-exempt debt to community banks. \nBefore 1986, banks and financial institutions could deduct the interest \nincurred to carry a tax-exempt bond. This benefit enabled banks to \npurchase tax-exempt bonds at attractive rates. The 1986 tax act \nrepealed bank deductibility, although an exception was retained for \nsmall issuers that issue bonds of $10 million or less each year.\n  This exception was designed to preserve bank deductibility for small \nbeneficiaries, but in practice is of assistance only to private \nplacements issued by small local issuers. The small issuer exception \nhas proven to be of little value in many States, like Vermont, where \nstatewide health care and higher education bond issuing authorities \ntypically issue many millions of dollars of debt each year. My bill \nwill modify the small issuer exemption by granting the bond issuers the \nright to apply the small issuer exemption at the level of the ultimate \nbeneficiary of the funding. Consequently, a small college or health \ncare facility borrowing less than $10 million in tax-exempt debt in any \none year could elect tax-exempt status for the debt, even if it is \nissued by a statewide issuing authority. This would make the debt more \nattractive to local banks, and could result in significant savings for \nthe beneficiary institution over the life of the bond.\n  My bill focuses the benefit of the small issuer exemption on smaller \nnon-profits, without regard to whether the bond issuer is government \nentity issuing more than $10 in bonds per year. Small non-profits are \nimportant community institutions; they stand to benefit from greater \naccess to tax-exempt debt. Wall Street and large banks may have little \ninterest in small amounts of debt from small institutions, which can \nprove costly to administer. The bank across the street from a local \ncollege or health care clinic, however, may have greater confidence and \ninsight in the institution. My bill would allow those banks to carry \ntax-exempt debt at attractive rates and maintain commitments to the \npeople and institutions in their local communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2627. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfunding for rehabilitation of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier \nNational Park, to authorize funds for maintenance of utilities related \nto the Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n         THE GLACIER NATIONAL PARK REHABILITATION DEMONSTRATION\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide funding for \nthe rehabilitation of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National \nPark, authorize funds to address the maintenance backlog facing the \npark's sewer and drinking water infrastructure, and allow the Secretary \nto enter into a demonstration project to rehabilitate the historic \nhotels in Glacier National Park using private funds.\n  This legislation is a companion to a bill recently introduced by \nRepresentative Rick Hill in the House of Representatives. The bill \nwould provide $20 million for much-needed water and sewer \ninfrastructure upgrades, which could extend the park's yearly operating \nseason to six months. Extending the season is extremely important to \nensure that revenue will be generated to rehabilitate these historic \nstructures in Glacier National Park.\n  Additionally, the legislation will allow the Secretary of the \nInterior to enter into an extended concessionaire agreement so that the \nconcessionaire will be eligible for tax incentives that will make the \nmulti-million dollar investment in these historic lodges affordable. \nThe National Park Service is supportive of this effort and would \nbenefit from the added flexibility to exempt competitive concessions \ncontracts from the current 20-year maximum contract length. Permitting \nthis exemption would allow concessionaires to qualify for historic \npreservation tax credits and dedicate funds toward Many Glacier Hotel \nand the Lake McDonald Lodge.\n  The marriage of public and private investment allowed by this pilot \nproject is the only workable solution that we have found that will save \nthe park's historic structures in a timely manner. With a multi-billion \ndollar backlog of maintenance projects in our National Parks, it is \nhighly unlikely the rehabilitation projects could be funded using \npurely public funds. Glacier Park is a place that all Montanans hold \ndear, and its historic hotels are a significant part of its rich \nheritage. After years of use, these hotels are now\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\nin dire need of rehabilitation, and unfortunately the funds just aren't \navailable at the federal level. This pilot project offers us a unique \nopportunity to begin the work necessary to maintain Glacier Park's \npreeminent place in our national park system and preserve it for \ngenerations to come. The legislation still ensures a competitive \nconcessionaire program, but will also ensure that America's citizens \nare able to enjoy these century old buildings for generations to come.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes funding to rehabilitate the \nGoing-to-the-Sun Road. This highway is a true feat of engineering, and \none of the most beautiful roadways in the world. It is the centerpiece \nof Glacier National Park, and must receive this added attention as soon \nas possible to avoid risking public safety and increasing the eventual \ncost of rehabilitating the road to acceptable standards.\n  I look forward to swift consideration of this legislation and the \nsupport of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK:\n  S. 2628.

Broyhill Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 james t. broyhill post office building\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will shortly offer legislation \nauthorizing the naming of the Post Office 114 Ridge Street Lenoir, \nN.C., for The Honorable James T. Broyhill, one of North Carolina's more \ndistinguished servants, philanthropists, and businessmen.\n  Congressman Richard Burr and Congressman Cass Ballenger are offering \ncompanion House legislation, which is cosponsored by the entire North \nCarolina delegation in that body.\n  He was born in Lenoir, NC on August 19, 1927 to the late J.E. and \nSatie (Hunt) Broyhill. He is a 1950 graduate of the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Business Administration.\n  After graduation he served as Vice-President of Broyhill Furniture \nIndustries and as a member of the Lenoir Chamber of Commerce, which he \nserved as President from 1955 to 1957. As many Senators are aware, \nBroyhill Furniture Industries has a worldwide reputation as one of the \nfinest furniture manufacturers in the world.\n  Mr. President, in 1962, Jim Broyhill was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives where he served 12 terms ending in June of 1986. During \nhis service in the House he was the Ranking Member of the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee and was instrumental in guiding Republican \nlegislative efforts through that committee.\n  In May 1986 he won the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat \nvacated by Senator John P. East. Following Senator East's tragic death \nin June of 1986, Jim Broyhill was appointed to the U.S. Senate by then \nGovernor Jim Martin to serve the remainder of Senator East's term. His \ncommittee assignments include seats on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  While he was unsuccessful in his 1986 election bid for the U.S. \nSenate, but this did not dampen his willing commitment to help others \nin North Carolina. In addition he was selected (by then Governor Jim \nMartin) to serve as Chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development \nBoard. In 1989, he was appointed by Governor Martin to serve as North \nCarolina's Secretary of Commerce, which he held until 1991.\n  He then retired to Winston-Salem. His wife is the former Louise \nRobbins and has three fine children; and they have three children: \nMarylin Beach, James Edgar Broyhill II, and Philip R. Broyhill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the enabling legislation \n(S. 2629) be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 117\n\n       Whereas on June 25, 1991, the Republic of Slovenia declared \n     its independence;\n       Whereas on December 23, 1991, the Parliament of the \n     Republic of Slovenia adopted the State's new constitution \n     based on the values of human rights, market economy, rule of \n     law, and democracy;\n       Whereas on April 7, 1992, the United States formally \n     recognized the Republic of Slovenia;\n       Whereas, since its independence, Slovenia has demonstrated \n     an excellent record on human rights;\n       Whereas Slovenia has developed a successful and growing \n     market economy and enjoys the highest per capita gross \n     domestic product in Central and Eastern Europe;\n       Whereas the European Union has recognized Slovenia's \n     economic prosperity and the strength of its democracy by \n     initiating accession negotiations with Slovenia as well as by \n     putting into effect Slovenia's Association Agreement with the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas Slovenia has demonstrated its commitment to bring \n     peace, security, stability, democracy, and economic \n     prosperity to Southeastern Europe through its membership in \n     NATO's Partnership for Peace, the Central European \n     Initiative, the Central European Free Trade Association \n     (CEFTA), and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe;\n       Whereas Slovenia has been an active contributor to peace \n     support operations around the world, including the NATO \n     Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO's Kosovo \n     Force, and United Nations peacekeeping operations in Cyprus \n     and Lebanon;\n       Whereas Slovenia made invaluable contributions to NATO's \n     Operation ALLIED FORCE by providing NATO access and use of \n     its airspace and ground transportation systems and by \n     assisting the NATO efforts to provide Albania humanitarian \n     relief during the air campaign against Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas Slovenia has contributed financial and humanitarian \n     aid to the assistance effort in Kosovo, including refuge for \n     more than 3500 people who had fled the region as a \n     consequence of the violence that occurred in Kosovo;\n       Whereas Slovenia promotes regional cooperation through its \n     contributions to the Trilateral Multinational Land Force, a \n     multinational brigade established with Italy and Hungary;\n       Whereas Slovenia, a leader in the effort to remove land \n     mines from the war-torn regions of the former Republic of \n     Yugoslavia, established the highly effective International \n     Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance; and\n       Whereas the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, \n     passed by the Senate on July 25, 1996, identified Slovenia, \n     along with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, as being \n     among the NATO applicant states most prepared for the burdens \n     and responsibilities of NATO membership; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) it is the policy of the United States \n     to--\n       (1) support the integration of the Republic of Slovenia \n     into transatlantic and European political, economic, and \n     security institutions, including the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and the European Union; and\n       (2) continue and further reinforce the partnership between \n     the United States and Slovenia, particularly their joint \n     efforts to bring lasting peace and stability to all of \n     Europe.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Republic of Slovenia is to be commended for--\n       (A) its commitment to democratic principles, human rights, \n     and rule of law;\n       (B) its transition from a communist, centrally planned \n     economic system to a thriving free market economy; and\n       (C) its partnership with the United States and NATO during \n     the recent conflicts that have undermined peace and stability \n     in Southeastern Europe; and\n       (2) the accession of the Republic of Slovenia to full \n     membership in transatlantic and European institutions would \n     be an important step toward a Europe that is undivided, whole \n     and free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/24/senate-section/article/S4393-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4393-S4394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                MIKULSKI (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3166\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nKennedy, and Mr. Durbin) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 2603) \nmaking appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes;
