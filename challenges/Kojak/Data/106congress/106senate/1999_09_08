Mr. President, before going to the main topic of my \nremarks, I wish to briefly speak about a story today in the papers that \nI just think Senators, Democrats and Republicans, must take note of. \nThis is the report. Top executives of CBS and VIACOM will be huddling \ntoday with top officials of the Federal Communications Commission. CBS-\nVIACOM executives will be lobbying the FCC to approve their proposed \nmerger and to relax FCC restrictions on media concentration.\n  Mr. President, I think that FCC Chairman Kennard has done an \nexcellent job, but I do believe this private meeting would be improper \nand inappropriate. I think the meeting should be held in public. I \nthink the public needs to know what is going on. I say this because I \ncannot think of anything more frightening in a representative democracy \nthan to continue to see this consolidation of media, these media \nmergers, and this concentration of power over the flow of information.\n  I think this is a terribly important question. I think it goes to the \nheart of the functioning of our democracy. Our democracy depends upon \ncitizen access to a wide and divergent range of views and information. \nWe depend upon a free and independent media that will hold both private \nand public power accountable to people. This dramatic surge in media \nconcentration makes this more difficult. It makes it more difficult for \nour media to perform these essential functions. I believe we are seeing \na breathtaking, frightening concentration of power in the media over \nthe flow of information, and I think it constitutes a direct threat to \nour democracy.\n  I hope this meeting and this debate will take place publicly and that \nthere will be meaningful coverage by the major media in our country of \nthis proposed merger of CBS and Viacom. The public needs to be engaged \nin this debate. This is a serious and important question. Media \nconcentration is a real threat to our representative democracy.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10538-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take a brief period of time \ntoday, I say to my colleagues and to the Chair who cares deeply about \nthis issue as well, I intend to take the time I need to give a report \nto the Senate and to the country about what is happening in \nagriculture. I say this to the Chair who I know cares deeply about \nthis.\n  I have spent most all of August organizing with farmers. I have spent \nalmost all my time in our agricultural and rural communities. I can \ntell my colleagues that we are now experiencing an economic convulsion, \nand on our present course we are going to lose a whole generation of \nfarmers and producers. This is not just a battle or a struggle for a \nfair price for family farmers, it is a struggle for the survival of our \nrural communities.\n  I spent time in northwest Minnesota, in southeast Minnesota, in west \ncentral Minnesota, and then in southwest Minnesota, at one farm \ngathering after another. The good news is that many farmers turned out \nfor our meetings, and that made me proud as a Senator. The bad news is \nthat people are in such economic pain. The bad news is that people are \nin such desperate shape. The bad news is that people who have worked so \nhard and are asking for nothing more than a decent price so they can \nhave a decent standard of living to give their children the care they \nknow they need and deserve are not getting a decent price.\n  This Congress has to take action, and it has to take action this \nfall. We can get the emergency financial assistance out to people. \nBecause of the way we are doing it, too much assistance will be going \nto some people who do not need it as much, and not enough will be going \nto many people who need it more. But it is a price crisis and we have \nto get the price up. We need to take the cap off the loan rate. We need \nto give the producer some leverage in the marketplace--with a farmer-\nowned reserve--and the ability to extend the payback period of the loan \nrate. We need to give our producers a fair shot. We need to get the \nprices up. Our farmers do not have cash-flow and they are going to be \ndriven off the land.\n  I believe our country will deeply regret what is now happening in \nagriculture. It is a food scarcity issue. Who is going to farm the \nland? Are we going to have affordable food? Is it going to be food that \nis healthy and safe for our families? What about the environment? What \nabout the whole idea of pattern of land ownership?\n  So much is at stake for America, but I do not think this crisis, of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is aware, is breaking through. No amount of \nself-reliance is going to help the farmers, given the prices they are \ngetting for wheat, corn, and soybeans. Our livestock producers are \nfaced with the most outrageous situation: they find themselves \nconfronted with a few packers who control almost all of the market in \nterms of whom they can sell to.\n  Yesterday in Iowa we had an important hearing with Senator Grassley \nand Senator Harkin, and we had several hundred farmers there. I said \nthat we should have a moratorium on all mergers and acquisitions and \nmarketing agreements between agribusinesses with revenues over $50 \nmillion until the Congress reviews the antitrust laws. I am going to \nbring this moratorium to the floor, speaking about concentration of \npower.\n  Whatever happened to the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and the work \nof Senator Kefauver? What does it mean when we have a few packers and \nthey control almost all of the market? What does it mean, with our \nlivestock producers facing extinction and IBP and ConAgra and a lot of \nthese large outfits making record profits?\n\n  Mr. President, this is an injustice. I am telling Democrats and \nRepublicans, we have to make it a priority and we have to push through \nlegislation over the next 2 months that will make a difference. A lot \nof these farmers are going to be gone if we don't. I speak today to \ngive a brief report, although I am going to start coming to the floor \nand talking at great length about the number of farmers we are losing.\n  Tracy Beckman, who directs the Farm Services Administration, has \nfigures on all our counties, on what an emergency situation this is, on \nwhat a crisis situation this is, and on what we can do. We can take the \ncap off the loan rate. We can rewrite the farm bill. Freedom to Farm \nhas become the ``Freedom to Farm for No Money,'' the ``Freedom to \nFail.'' We have to change the farm bill. We have to take some antitrust \naction. We have to be on the side of family farmers and producers. We \nhave to make sure they get a fair price. We have to have a fair trade \npolicy and we need to do it now. Speeches are not enough.\n  Rural American farmers, when you come here next week, turn up the \nheat. When you meet with Senators and Representatives, turn up the \nheat. Ultimately, it is going to take rural America raising heck in \norder to turn this situation around.\n  This August, for me, was the most difficult during my time in the \nSenate. It was the most emotional 3 weeks I ever spent with people in \nmy State. I say to the Senator from California, who is a good friend, \nwhat happens at these farm gatherings is that people will say to you: \nThanks for caring, it makes me feel good. And you reach out to shake \ntheir hand, and they are crying, just crying because they are going to \nlose everything. Their farm has been in the family for generations. It \nis where they work, it is where they live, and they are going to lose \nit all. The implement dealers, the bankers, the educators, the hospital \npeople, and the health care people all say: Our rural communities are \ngoing to be ghost towns.\n  This is needless suffering. This does not have to be. This is not \nAdam\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\nSmith's invisible hand. It is not some law of gravity. The only \ninevitability about what is happening to family farmers is the \ninevitability of a stacked deck. If we change policies and give them \nleverage so they can get a decent price in the marketplace, if we take \non some of these conglomerates and put free enterprise in the food \nindustry, and if we move forward on trade policy, we can make a huge \ndifference.\n  This is an issue that goes to the heart and soul of what America is \nabout. America, if you are listening to what we are saying in the \nSenate, this is all about the country, this is about food scarcity, \nthis is about getting food at a price you can afford. It is about who \nis going to own the land. This is about whether or not we are going to \nhave a rural America. This is about whether we are going to have a few \nconglomerates muscle their way to the dinner table and exercise their \npower over all phases of the industry--over the producers, over the \nconsumers, over the taxpayers--or whether we are committed to a family \nfarm structure in agriculture.\n  I come from a State, Minnesota, where family farmers are really \nimportant. They are so important to my State, but they are important to \nour country. I hope and pray over the next 2 months we will take action \nin Congress that will make a positive difference and will change this \npolicy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Feingold and Senator Reed each be given 10 minutes \nat the conclusion of Senator Dorgan's time. Of course, if people from \nthe other side want that courtesy, we will be happy to support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Wellstone leaves the floor, \nI thank him. I thought his comments were very poignant, and what he is \naddressing is some of the unfinished business of this body, things we \nhave to take care of. Certainly one of them is the problems of the \nfamily farmer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10539-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today, first of all, to say it is \ngood to be back in the Senate because I am very hopeful we can do \nsomething, in the remaining days and weeks we have, to make life better \nfor the people we represent. I also have had some wonderful interaction \nwith the people of my State. They have some very strong opinions on \nmany of the issues facing us.\n  I think the message I got more than anything was, can't you get \ntogether on both sides of the aisle and address the issues that impact \nour daily lives? I certainly think that is an appropriate sentiment.\n  That is not to say that the Congress shouldn't be doing its oversight \ninvestigations, be it the Waco incident or what has occurred in Russia. \nI am not against any of that. I am for that. But we have to do \neverything around here. We have to do the oversight, but we also have \nto pay attention to business.\n  There is an article in today's Washington Post written by Elizabeth \nDrew, who wrote a book called ``The Corruption of American Politics: \nWhat Went Wrong and Why.'' She has a very interesting article called \n``Try Governing for a Change.'' She says to Congress: Welcome back. We \nhope you had a nice vacation. We hope you will use the few weeks that \nremain to govern, rather than to position yourselves politically.\n  That is my message today. We have unfinished business. I will go \nthrough some specifics. I am not going to just stand up and talk in \ngeneralities. I want to be specific.\n  One of the first things we have to deal with is school safety. Our \nchildren are back at school. We have provisions in the juvenile justice \nbill that are now in conference that can make schools safer. We also \nhave provisions in the commerce bill that will make schools safer. What \nare some of these?\n\n  The Gregg-Boxer amendment that is in the Commerce bill, which would \nprovide $200 million for school safety activities, including security \nequipment, hiring more police officers, and violence prevention \nprograms for our children, is a bipartisan provision. It passed \noverwhelmingly. It ought to move forward. We ought to have that help \nfor our schools.\n  The gun control provisions in juvenile justice that are so very \nimportant and, might I add, are not radical--they are very moderate--I \nwant to see us pass.\n  We closed the gun show loophole that allowed criminals to get guns at \ngun shows without going through background checks. We banned the \nimportation of high-capacity ammunition clips which are used in \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. We required child safety devices be sold \nwith every handgun. We required the Federal Trade Commission and the \nAttorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry is \nmarketing its products to our students, our children. We made it \nillegal to sell or give a semiautomatic weapon to anyone under the age \nof 18. That is an assault weapon.\n  These are very simple. They are very straightforward. We passed them \nin the Senate, and they are in conference. I have yet to see that \nconference committee meet. I certainly hope it will. I look forward to \nthe opportunity for getting the people's business of protecting our \nchildren done. That is school safety.\n  We have a lot of other unfinished business. There are not that many \nthings but they are all very important. We have the issue of saving \nMedicare--a very important part of the President's proposal, saving \nMedicare. We have to get down to it. We have to do it. We have the \nissue of paying down the debt. We have a huge debt. We have an \nopportunity with the surplus to pay it down and save all those interest \npayments on the debt that we continue to pay out every single day, $1 \nbillion a day just to pay the interest payment on the debt that has \naccumulated since the 1980s. We ought to pay that down.\n  On the minimum wage, I was amazed to see a report in the Los Angeles \nTimes about the condition of people who live in Los Angeles County. I \nknow my friend, the Chaplain, is from that area. More than 20 percent \nof Los Angeles County residents live below the official poverty line. \nThat is $16,450 a year for a family of four. This is reflective of a \nlot of people in our Nation. It is not just Los Angeles. When most \npeople think of Los Angeles, they think of Hollywood. They think of \nmillionaires. They have to understand what is happening to real people.\n  Twenty percent are living in poverty. One out of every three children \nin Los Angeles lives in poverty. If you go to Los Angeles and see \nlittle children, one out of three of them is living in poverty. That is \nup from one out of four in 1990.\n  You might say: Well, maybe it is just minority kids. No, it is a lot \nof children, across the board. It is 21 percent of Anglo children \nliving in poverty; 21 percent of Asian American children are living in \npoverty in Los Angeles; 33 percent of African American children are \nliving in poverty in Los Angeles; 43 percent of Latino children are \nliving in poverty in Los Angeles; 12 percent of elderly people are \nliving in poverty in Los Angeles, an increase from 9 percent in 1990; \n2.7 million residents of Los Angeles County have no health insurance.\n  What I am saying is, when we talk about the minimum wage, this is \nreal. Most of these people are working very\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\nhard. What is happening in our society today is people are working hard \nat the very bottom levels. I think the least we can do in this \nincredible economic climate that so many of us are benefiting from is \nto raise that minimum wage, save Medicare, help our seniors, pay down \nthe debt, help the future, pass these safety provisions so our kids are \nsafe in school, and pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a watered \ndown bill in the Senate but they are going to pass a good one in the \nHouse. Get them into conference and pass it, bring it out.\n  Finally, campaign finance reform is so important. Of all these issues \nI have mentioned, I am sad to say our majority leader has only put one \non the agenda for his must-do list. That is campaign finance reform. I \nam glad it is there. It is there because there was a threat to shut \ndown this place if it wasn't on there, but I am glad it is on the list. \nAll of these other things are not there.\n  What is worse, when you look at the most important thing the \nRepublican majority wants to do, it is going to hurt all these other \nthings, because it is a huge tax cut of $800 billion that is going to \nhelp the people at the upper echelons and hurt everyone else. There \nwon't be any money for Medicare. There won't be any money to save that \nprogram. There won't be any money to pay down the debt so we can be \ngood to our grandchildren and their children. There won't be anything \nfor education. There won't be anything for the environment.\n  I say to my friends, let's do what the people want us to do. Let us \ntake care of business.\n  There was an extraordinary field poll done in California. I think it \nis very instructive, and it is amazing in the scope of what it said.\n\n  It said that more than 80 percent of the people of California agreed \nwith the President's approach to the budget, which, as we know, is to \ntake that surplus and use a third of it for tax cuts for the middle \nclass, a third of it for Medicare, and a third of it for education, the \nenvironment, health research. Now, this means the majority of \nRepublicans agree with the President on this point.\n  I think we have a golden opportunity to come together on issues that \nmean a lot to the people: school safety, a Patients' Bill of Rights, \ncampaign finance reform, raising the minimum wage, saving Medicare, \npaying down the debt, targeted tax relief to the middle class, not to \nthose at the very top who are doing very well.\n  And the reason I shared the survey with you on the poverty in Los \nAngeles is that while the economy is terrific and is going very well in \nCalifornia, the gap between the rich and the poor is growing mightily. \nThose of us who care about our fellow human beings cannot turn our \nbacks on this, regardless of our party, because it is a recipe for \nproblems in the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I know my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, has a lot to say on these and other matters. Again, I \ncompliment my friends who are taking the lead on the East Timor \nsituation. We have unfinished business to do. Let's get it done and do \nit across the party aisle and go home proud of our accomplishments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10540-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on October 6, 7, and 8, there will be a \nmeeting in Vienna, Austria. It will be among countries that have \nratified something called the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nThat treaty is embodied in this document I hold in my hand.\n  Now, what is the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty? It is a \ntreaty negotiated by a number of countries around the world; 152 \ncountries, in fact, have signed the treaty and 44 countries have \nratified the treaty. It is a treaty designed to prohibit any further \nexplosive testing of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world, at any \ntime, under any condition.\n  This treaty ought to be an easy treaty for this country and this \nSenate to ratify. But we have not done so. At a time when India and \nPakistan explode nuclear weapons literally under each other's chins--\nthese are two countries that don't like each other--at a time when we \nhave evidence of more proliferation of nuclear weapons into the hands \nof countries that want access to nuclear weapons with which to, in some \ncases, defend themselves, perhaps in other cases to terrorize the rest \nof the world, this country ought to be exhibiting leadership. It is our \nmoral responsibility to provide leadership in the world on these \nissues. This country ought to provide leadership on the issue of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  We have not ratified this treaty. At the meeting in Vienna, countries \nthat have ratified it will participate in discussing the implementation \nof this treaty, and this country will not be an active participant. \nGreat Britain, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Italy, Norway, Poland, and \nFrance will be but we will not. We are the largest nuclear superpower \non Earth and we have not ratified this treaty.\n  What about nuclear weapons and nuclear war? I was in the presence of \na nuclear weapon recently at a military installation. If you stand a \nfoot or two away from a nuclear weapon and look at it, it is a \nrelatively small canister-looking device that, upon explosion, will \ndevastate portions of our Earth.\n  Going back nearly 40 years to an address by John F. Kennedy, he said \nsomething about nuclear weapons. In fact, he quoted Nikita Khrushchev:\n\n       Since the beginning of history, war has been mankind's \n     constant companion. It has been the rule, not the exception. \n     Even a nation as young and as peace-loving as our own has \n     fought through eight wars. A war today or tomorrow, if it led \n     to nuclear war, would not be like any war in history. A full-\n     scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes, with \n     the weapons now in existence, could wipe out more than 300 \n     million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold \n     numbers elsewhere. And the survivors, as Chairman Khrushchev \n     warned the Communist Chinese, ``the survivors would envy the \n     dead.'' For they would inherit a world so devastated by \n     explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot even \n     conceive of its horrors.\n\n  This country and Russia have 30,000 nuclear weapons between them. \nOther countries want nuclear weapons, and they want them badly. To the \nextent that any other country cannot test nuclear weapons, no one will \nknow whether they have a nuclear weapon that works. No one will have \ncertainty that they have access to nuclear weaponry. That is why the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty is so critical.\n  Now, where is it? Well, it is here in the Senate. It has been here \n716 days, with not even 1 day of hearings. Not one. Virtually every \nother treaty sent to the Senate has been given a hearing and has been \nbrought to the Senate floor and debated and voted upon. The issue of \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons and the stopping of explosive \ntesting of nuclear weapons is not important enough to be brought to the \nSenate floor for a debate. It has been over 700 days. Not 1 day of \nhearings.\n\n  In October, this country, which ought to be the moral leader on this \nissue, will not be present as a ratified member at the implementing \nmeetings for this treaty. Shame on us. We have a responsibility to do \nthis. There are big issues and small issues in this Congress. This is a \nbig issue and cannot be avoided.\n  Now, I am not here to cast aspersions on any Member of the Senate. \nBut I waited here this morning to have the majority leader come to the \nfloor--and he was not able to come to the floor--to describe the agenda \nthis week. When\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nhe comes to the floor, I intend to come to the floor and ask him when \nhe intends to bring this treaty to the floor. If he and others decide \nit will not come to the floor, I intend to plant myself on the floor \nlike a potted plant and object. I intend to object to other routine \nbusiness of the Senate until this country decides to accept the moral \nleadership that is its obligation and bring this treaty to the floor \nfor a debate and a vote.\n  In a world as difficult as this world is, when countries such as \nIndia and Pakistan are detonating nuclear weapons, it is inexcusable, \nwhen so many other countries are trying to gain access to nuclear \nweapons for themselves, that this Senate, for over 2 years, has not \nbeen willing or able to allow a debate on a treaty as important as is \nthis treaty. The banning of nuclear explosive testing all around the \nworld at any time, anyplace, anywhere is critically important for our \nfuture, for our children, and for their children.\n  Now, my colleagues know--at least I hope some know--that I am fairly \neasy to work with. I enjoy the Senate. I enjoy working with my \ncolleagues. I think some of the best men and women I have had the \nprivilege of working with in my life are here on both sides of the \naisle. I have great respect for this body. But this body, in some ways, \nis very frustrating as well because often one or two people can hold up \nsomething very important. In this circumstance, I must ask the majority \nleader--and I will today when given the opportunity when he is on the \nfloor--when will we have the opportunity to debate this Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  That meeting in October should not proceed without this country \nproviding a leadership role. The only way that can happen is for us to \nhave ratified the treaty. China and Russia have not ratified the \ntreaty; that is true. They are waiting on this country. India and \nPakistan are now talking about detonating more nuclear weapons; that is \ntrue. They are asking others to implore one or the other to ratify this \ntreaty. Both countries are waiting for this country's leadership. What \nkind of credibility does this country have to go to India and Pakistan \nand say to them, ``You must ratify this treaty,'' and when they turn to \nus to say, ``Have you?'' we would say no? Somehow, the Senate could \nnot, in 700 days, even hold 1 day of hearings on the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  We have to do better than that. I am sorry if I am going to cause \nsome problems around here with the schedule. But frankly, as I said, \nthere are big issues and there are small issues. This is a big issue. \nAnd I am flat tired of seeing small issues around this Chamber every \nday in every way, when the big issues are bottled up in some committee \nand the key is held by one or two people. Then we are told: If you do \nnot like it, tough luck; you don't run this place. It is true, I don't \nrun this place, but those who do should know this is going to be a \ntough place to run if you do not decide to bring this issue to the \nfloor of the Senate and give us the opportunity to debate a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This will not be an easy road \nahead for the Senate if you decide that this country shall not exercise \nthe moral leadership that is our responsibility on these matters.\n  If I might with the remaining minute or so mention an editorial in \nthe Washington Post from yesterday, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Why a Test Ban Treaty?\n\n       The proposed nuclear test ban treaty has been around so \n     long--for 50 years--and has been so shrouded in political \n     foliage that many people have forgotten just what it entails. \n     The current debate about it centers on the Clinton \n     administration's differences with the Russians on the one \n     hand and with the Republicans on the other. But in fact the \n     appeal of the treaty is a good deal simpler and more powerful \n     than the debate indicates. This treaty would put an end to \n     underground nuclear tests everywhere; tests above ground \n     already are proscribed either by treaty or by political \n     calculation. Its merits shine through.\n       Testing is the principal engine of nuclear proliferation. \n     Without tests, a would-be nuclear power cannot be sure enough \n     the thing would work to employ it as a reliable military and \n     political instrument. Leaving open the testing option means \n     leaving open the proliferation option--the very definition of \n     instability. The United states, which enjoys immense global \n     nuclear advantage, can only be the loser as additional \n     countries go nuclear or extend their nuclear reach. The \n     aspiring nuclear powers, whether they are anti-American rogue \n     states or friendly-to-America parties to regional disputes, \n     sow danger and uncertainty across a global landscape. No \n     nation possibly can gain more than we do from universal \n     acceptance of a test ban that helps close off others' \n     options.\n       At the moment, the treaty is hung up in the Senate by \n     Republicans desiring to use it as a hostage for a national \n     missile defense of their particular design. This is curious. \n     The obstructionists pride themselves in believing American \n     power to be the core of American security. Why then do they \n     support a test ban holdup that multiplies the mischief and \n     menace of proliferators and directly erodes American power? \n     The idea has spread that Americans must choose between a test \n     ban treaty and a missile defense. The idea is false. These \n     are two aspects of a single American security program, the \n     one being a first resort to restrain others' nuclear \n     ambitions and the other a last resort to limit the damage if \n     all else fails. No reasonable person would want to cast one \n     of these away, least of all over details of missile program \n     design. Those in the Senate who are forcing an either-or \n     choice owe it to the country to explain why we cannot employ \n     them both.\n       The old bugaboo of verification has arisen in the current \n     debate. There is no harm in conceding that verification of \n     low-yield tests might not be 100 percent. But the reasonable \n     measure of these things always has been whether the evasion \n     would make a difference. The answer has to be that cheating \n     so slight as to be undetectable by one or another American \n     intelligence means would not make much difference at all.\n       The trump card of those who believe the United States \n     should maintain a testing option is that computer \n     calculations alone cannot provide the degree of certitude \n     about the reliability of weapons in the American stockpile \n     that would prudently allow us to forgo tests. This is a \n     matter of continuing contention among the specialists. But \n     what seems to us much less in contention is the proposition \n     that, given American technological prowess, the risk of \n     weapons rotting in the American stockpile has got to be a \n     good deal less than the risk that other countries will test \n     their way to nuclear status.\n       The core question of proliferation remains what will induce \n     would-be proliferators to get off the nuclear track. \n     Certainly a ``mere'' signature on a piece of paper would not \n     stay the hand of a country driven by extreme nuclear fear or \n     ambition. Two things, however, could make a difference. One \n     is if the nuclear powers showed themselves ready to accept \n     some increasing part of the discipline they are calling on \n     non-nuclear others to accept, so that the treaty could not be \n     dismissed as punitive and discriminatory. The other is that \n     when you embrace the test ban and related restraints on \n     chemical and biological weapons, you are joining a global \n     order in which those who play by the agreed rules enjoy ever-\n     widening benefits and privileges and those who do not are \n     left out and behind.\n       President Clinton signed the test ban treaty, and achieving \n     Senate ratification is one of his prime foreign policy goals. \n     More important, ratification would make the world a safer \n     place for the United States. Much still has to be worked out \n     with the Republicans and the Russians, but that is detail \n     work. The larger gain is now within American reach.\n\n  The editorial says the following:\n\n       The core question of proliferation remains what will induce \n     would-be proliferators to get off the nuclear track. \n     Certainly a ``mere'' signature on a piece of paper would not \n     stay the hand of a country driven by extreme nuclear fear or \n     ambition. Two things, however, could make a difference. One \n     is if the nuclear powers showed themselves ready to accept \n     some increasing part of the discipline they are calling on \n     non-nuclear others to accept, so that the treaty could not be \n     dismissed as punitive and discriminatory. The other is that \n     when you embrace the test ban and related restraints on \n     chemical and biological weapons, you are joining a global \n     order in which those who play by the agreed rules enjoy ever-\n     widening benefits and privileges and those who do not are \n     left out and behind.\n\n  The point is that this country must demonstrate moral leadership on \nthis issue and must do it now.\n  Seventy to eighty percent of the American people support the \nratification of this treaty. Most American people understand that this \nissue is about who is going to have access to nuclear weapons in the \nfuture. And, incidentally, on the issue of nonproliferation of nuclear \nweapons, which is about as important an issue as there is for us, this \nis a baby step. If we can't take the baby step of ratifying this \ntreaty, what on Earth will be the result of tougher, more difficult \nthings we are called upon to do?\n  This isn't Republican or Democrat. It is a responsibility for all \nMembers of the Senate to say it is outrageous that after 700 days, a \ntreaty that has been signed and sent to the Senate has not been \nratified or had one day of hearings. We have an obligation and a \nresponsibility. We, in my judgment, have\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\na right to expect this be brought to the floor for a debate and a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to talk for a brief bit of time \non the Interior appropriations bill and on some matters that are very \nimportant to people throughout this country, particularly in the West. \nBut let me begin by making a comment about what the Senator from North \nDakota has just said. In fact, he has said that he is going to threaten \nto bring the business of the Senate to a halt unless he gets his way, \nand what he wants to do is have a debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  There are a lot of important things facing this country. But to quote \nfrom the President of the United States, who very recently gave a talk \nabout putting first things first, it seems to me that most of the \nAmerican people would like to put first things first, and that would \ninclude matters such as the continuation of the running of the \nGovernment for the next year which would require us to pass \nappropriations bills to fund the various Departments of the Government, \nnot the least of which is the Department of the Interior which is what \nwe are going to be talking about next. There will be plenty of time to \ndebate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  But in terms of the priority of this country, I think our colleagues \nneed to understand that treaty can't even go into effect until 100 \npercent of the major countries of the world sign it. There are many \ncountries that haven't signed it. It is going to be years before that \ntreaty goes into effect. There is no rush for the United States to have \nto take up that treaty.\n  To be threatened with stopping all business of the Senate until it \ncan debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I hope my colleague will \nreconsider his position on that. We talk about what I consider to be \nfirst things first, and that would be to finish our business here, \nwhich is, first of all, to get the appropriations bills passed and sent \nto the President for his consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10542-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10542-S10544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the appropriations bills we have yet \nto act upon is the Interior appropriations bill, as Senator Thomas \npointed out. He comes from the State of Wyoming. I come from the State \nof Arizona. Practically every State west of the Mississippi is \nsignificantly impacted by this bill because, as I am sure you are well \naware, Mr. President, coming from the State of Montana, more than a \nthird of this Nation's lands are owned by the Federal Government. Most \nof those are in the western United States. Many of those lands are \nunder the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior.\n  This is an extraordinarily important bill for the people of our \nStates. I just want to discuss one aspect of it that is very important \nfor my State of Arizona and other States in the western United States.\n  We have a very difficult condition in our national forests now. They \nhave been probably--I think it is not too strong a term--``mismanaged'' \nover the years. It has been a combination of things. It has been the \ncombination of the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of the Interior, the grazing on public lands, the way that \nfire suppression has taken off, and some other things which have \nresulted in the condition where, instead of healthy forests of large \ntrees that have great environmental value and value to the other flora \nand fauna in the forest and which present a relatively safe situation \nin terms of forest fires, we now have a situation in the West where our \nforests are literally becoming overgrown.\n  They are becoming so thick and dense with small-growth trees that:\n  (A) They are very fire prone.\n  (B) They are not resistant at all to disease and to insects.\n  (C) They are not environmentally pleasing at all.\n  (D) None of the trees grow up to be very large because they are all \ncompeting for the moisture and the nutrients in the soil.\n  The net result is a situation that is very different from that which \npertained at the turn of the century when we had very healthy forests \nof very large trees that were spaced quite a distance apart, with \nmeadows in between, with a lot of good grass that livestock and wild \nanimals could graze on, and which were not prone to forest fire because \nthe fire would work along the ground when it occurred. It would reduce \nthe fuel load on the ground, but it would never get to be the kind of \ncrown fire we have just seen on television that has been experienced in \nseveral States in the West, not the least of which is in California.\n  You get the crown fires when you have a lot of brush on the ground. \nYou have these small, dense trees and many come under the boughs of the \ngreat big trees. The fire starts on the ground and goes right up to the \ncrown of the other trees. We have all seen from those television \npictures the explosive power of the fires. It is a horrendous \nsituation. It threatens life and limb as well as the destruction of the \nforest and all that is within it.\n  We have to find a way to better manage our forests. We have been for \nsome time urging the Department of Agriculture and the Department of \nthe Interior to work on a management program which essentially involves \nthe thinning of these small-diameter trees, leaving the large-diameter \ntrees--leaving the old growth but thinning out the small-diameter \ntrees, and then doing controlled burns to get rid of the fuel load, and \nafter that letting nature take its course.\n  We have found from experimentation--primarily through Northern \nArizona University, Dr. Walley Covington, and others who have done the \nresearch and demonstration projects we have funded--that the trees \nbecome more healthy. The pitch content of the trees increases \nsignificantly. So they are less susceptible to bark beetles and other \nkinds of insect damage. The grasses grow up underneath the trees as \nthey didn't do before. The protein content of the grasses is \nsignificantly higher. So it is much better grazing for the forest \nanimals. In every respect, from an environmental point of view, it is a \nbetter situation than that which pertains today.\n  This takes money because you have to pay to go in and do the \nthinning. Each one of these projects requires a substantial amount of \nmoney.\n  So far, the research has been done on small plots of land. But \naccording to the General Accounting Office, we have about 25 to 30 \nyears maximum to treat all of our forests or we are going to be into a \ncontagion situation with very little hope of saving these forests. In \nfact, we have about 39 million acres of national forest lands in the \ninterior West that are at high risk of catastrophic fire, and only this \nbrief period of maybe 25 years to effectively manage these forests.\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\n  There are two major impediments to solving the problem. One is agency \ninertia. It has taken a long time to get the agencies up and running. \nSecretary Babbitt has been supportive of this concept. There are \nextremists in the environmental community who want to prevent any \nmanagement of the forest. Many fine environmental groups are supportive \nof participation in this program, but there are extremists who file \nlawsuits to try to prevent any management.\n  I have asked Forest Service Chief Dombeck to support a dramatic \nincrease in forest restoration. In fact, the Forest Service plans to \nimplement three to four large-scale projects of 100,000 to 300,000-acre \nsize during fiscal year 2000. The fiscal year 2000 budget for the \nForest Service called for reducing fuels on only 1.3 million acres, \ndown from 1.5 million planned for 1999.\n  The GAO estimates a very substantial increase in funding will be \nnecessary, probably up to $725 million annually, in order to adequately \naddress this problem. I strongly support increased restoration funding \nfor this fuels reduction program, including the Forest Service new \nline-item request for the forest ecosystem restoration improvement \nfund. This will be used to support forest restoration projects where \ncurrent funding is not available or feasible, particularly in a \nsituation where the materials are available to be cut have no \ncommercial value.\n  I plan to continue my efforts to support this. I know the Senator \nfrom Wyoming is strongly supportive of managing our national forests--\nboth the forests under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of Interior--in a very sensible fashion. \nWe are just now starting this. It has taken a few years to get consent \non the right way to do this. We have a lot more funding to provide. We \nneed much more agency support for this forest restoration if we are \ngoing to save the national forests of this great country.\n  I think this is very important not only for the people in the West \nbut throughout the country. I think it deserves our attention and our \npriority.\n  I appreciate the opportunity for discussion this morning, and I thank \nthe Senator from Wyoming for reserving time to talk about these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the \nuniqueness of the public lands of the West. It is very clear there are \ngreat differences among the States in terms of land management, the \nkinds of land ownership that exist, and the delivery of health care.\n  Wyoming is a large State. I think we are the eighth largest State in \nthe United States yet the smallest in population. We have small towns. \nThere are twice as many people in Fairfax County as there are in the \nState of Wyoming. The point I make is ``one size fits all'' in many \nareas of operation does not work effectively in delivering services. I \nthink that is especially true when we start talking about the \nmanagement of resources and the management of lands.\n  This chart shows the Federal land holdings by State. The color brown \nrepresents almost all New England States with less than 1 percent of \ntheir total land surface held by the Federal Government. Blue \nrepresents States with 1 percent to 5 percent, including much of the \nSouth and the Midwest. Five to 10 percent are the purple-colored \nStates. In the West, the yellow-colored States have up to 65 percent of \nthe State's surface belonging to the Federal Government. It is a unique \nproposition. Furthermore, there are States in green that go beyond \nthat. This map shows almost 83 percent of Nevada--actually I think it \nis probably 87 percent of Nevada's surface--belonging to the Federal \nGovernment. The same is true in Alaska.\n  There is a great deal of difference in how we do this. The lands \nbelong to everyone. The economy of the States depends on Federal \ndecisions that are made, including the jobs for everyone who lives \nthere. Local county governments take care of all services transpiring \non Federal lands.\n\n  Let me show you an enlarged map of Wyoming. This map gives you an \nidea of the amount of land in Wyoming belonging to the Federal \nGovernment or public lands. This is an Indian reservation. Purple \nrepresents national parks. We are very proud of them. The green \nrepresents U.S. forest reserves. The interspersed yellow represents \nland managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Where the railroads went \nthrough in the early years are checkerboard lands, with every other \nsection being owned by the Federal Government. There are control and \naccess problems for all of these areas.\n  We depend highly upon the dollars made available through the Interior \nappropriations. We have had much involvement with the decisions made by \nthe land management agencies in these areas, whether it be BLM or \nothers. I want to emphasize how important it is to talk about some of \nthese important issues.\n  For example, these lands are basic lands. BLM lands were largely \nresidual that remained after the Homestead Act expired. They generally \nare lands in the plains of our State. The homesteaders came in along \nthe rivers and creeks, taking the most productive lands. The other \nlands remain managed by the BLM. To remain an agricultural unit it is \nalways necessary to have the productive lands and the other lands for \ngrazing. We use them for multiple use.\n  Everyone in Wyoming wants to use the lands for wildlife, for the \npreservation of wildlife, hunting, hiking. Indeed, they can be used \ntogether. It is sometimes difficult to find agreement. Multiple use, \nwhether for mineral production or not--all the lands yield minerals; \nmostly oil, trona, soda ash or coal; Wyoming is the largest producer of \ncoal in the country which most people don't realize--is income for the \nState and the Federal Government with their royalties.\n  We have currently and in this bill we will talk about funding for the \nFish and Wildlife Service which manages the Endangered Species Act. \nThis is a very difficult area. Everyone wants to preserve critters, \nanimals, and plants that are endangered. At the same time, there are \nsome questions when we have an animal in some danger. First, the \ngrizzly bears or wolves; now we have the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse \nlisted as endangered. It becomes almost a threat to the private land \nowners who are restricted from using their lands as they desire because \nof the potential threat of endangerment.\n  These are the issues we deal with. We deal with PILT payments, \npayments in lieu of taxes. Fifty percent of the State belongs to the \nFederal Government. There are no taxes as in private lands. In this \nbill, there is funding for PILT payments. We will have an amendment to \nraise it.\n  The counties provide hospital service, the counties provide policing, \nthe counties provide all the services to these lands but have received \nno revenue as the case would be if they had been private lands. These \nare the things with which we deal.\n  Much of this supports grazing. Ranchers in Wyoming have permits. They \npay so much per animal unit for grazing. We have a problem now because \nthe Forest Service or the BLM has not done a NEPA study for permit \nrenewal. Unfortunately, they have not been able to complete the NEPA \nstudies. Now we are faced with the question: Does the grazing lease \nexpire because there has not been a study?\n  There will be an amendment that says you can go ahead and extend the \ngrazing lease and let the BLM go ahead and make the study; it doesn't \npreclude the study. The study will still be made, but it allows the \ngrazing to continue because it is no fault of the grazer the study has \nnot been made.\n  The Senator from Arizona talked about forests and forest management. \nObviously, in many cases there is some kind of harvesting of mature \ntimber. If it is not harvested and managed in the way you take it out, \nthen it burns.\n  I just came back from spending several days in Yellowstone Park where \nwe had a gigantic fire in the late eighties. It is discouraging to see \nhow long it takes to reforest an area of that kind.\n  We are dealing again in this bill with financing what is called the \nclean water action plan which has to do with nonpoint source water \ncontrols. One hundred eleven ideas, put forth by EPA to do some things \nlike that, frankly, are going to be extremely difficult and will have \nmuch to do with the utilization and multiple use of these lands because \nyou have to have the water to do that.\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\n  We talk about droughts in the East. Frankly, this kind of area does \nnot get as much rainfall in a normal year as we did in a drought. This \nis 14 inches per year. The water, the runoff, and the irrigation are a \nvery real part of it.\n  We are going to move into this area this afternoon. I am very pleased \nwith what has been done. The Senator from Washington has put together a \nbill which I think has great merit. We are trying to do some things \nthat will make it more workable in terms of oil royalties, grazing \nfees, and some of the other things that do become controversial.\n  I urge people to take a look at the situation, even though they do \nnot live here, and try to understand why some of these things need to \nbe handled a little bit differently because of the situation we have in \nthe West.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to talk about this bill. I \nbelieve we have used our time, or very close to it. I yield back the \ntime if we have not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now go into executive session to \nconsider Executive Calendar orders numbered 173 and 175.\n  The nominations will be stated.\n\n\n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Adalberto Jose Jordan, \nof Florida, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, and Marsha J. Pechman, of Washington, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Western District of Washington.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to express my enthusiastic \nsupport for the nomination of Judge Marsha J. Pechman to serve on the \nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n  Ms. Pechman was chosen by a selection committee jointly appointed by \nmy colleague, Senator Murray, and myself, and was jointly recommended \nby the two Senators from the State of Washington to President Clinton. \nThe President has therefore engaged fully in the normal advice and \nconsent process for choosing Federal judges for this vitally important \nlifetime position.\n  Judge Pechman has significant judicial experience. She has served as \na superior court judge in King County, Washington, for a period of 11 \nyears, handling a wide range of cases, taking an active role in \nimproving the administration of justice, and instructing and teaching \nother judges and lawyers. Before becoming a judge, Marsha Pechman \nworked as a deputy prosecuting attorney in King County and was later \nmade a partner in a significant, major law firm in the city of Seattle.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with my colleague from the State of \nWashington and myself in approving a first-rate nomination on the part \nof the President, Judge Marsha Pechman, to serve as United States \nDistrict Court Judge for the Western District of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leadership for \nallowing the Senate to consider and confirm two more outstanding \njudicial nominations today. Marsha Pechman and Adalberto Jose Jordan \nhad confirmation hearings on July 13. They were favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee long before the August recess.\n  I regret that they were not confirmed at that time along with the \nother 11 judicial nominees on the Senate calendar who are still \nawaiting Senate action. With these confirmations today--and I predict \nthey will be confirmed--the Senate will finally have confirmed more \nthan a dozen judges this year. By comparison, last year at this time \nthe Senate had confirmed 39 judges, not just 13; by this time in 1994, \nthe Senate had confirmed 58 judges, not just 13.\n  In the past I have challenged the Senate to try to keep up with Sammy \nSosa's home run pace. He has 58 home runs so far this year. We are \nbehind not just his home run pace but the home run pace set by National \nLeague pitchers.\n  The Senate has ready for action the nominations of Marsha Berzon to \nthe Ninth Circuit, Justice Ronnie White to the District Court in \nMissouri, and many other qualified nominees.\n  The current nomination delayed the longest is that of Judge Richard \nPaez. He has been held up for over 3\\1/2\\ years, yet can anybody on \nthis floor state with confidence that if he were allowed to have a \nrollcall vote, he would not be confirmed. The Judiciary Committee twice \nreported the nomination favorably. If we were honest and decent enough \nin the Senate to allow this man to come to a vote after 3\\1/2\\ years, \nhe would be confirmed. It is a scandal, a shame on the Senate that we \ndo not confirm this nominee.\n  His treatment recalls the criticism the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, William Rehnquist, has made of the Senate. He pointed out that \nafter a period for review nominations should be voted up or voted down. \nHe pointed out that too many nominations were being held up too long. \nThe nomination of Judge Richard Paez is currently Exhibit A.\n  We are not doing our job. We are not being responsible. We are being \ndishonest, condescending, and arrogant toward the judiciary. It \ndeserves better and the American people deserve better.\n  We have less than 8 weeks in which the Senate is scheduled to be in \nsession the remainder of the year. We have our work cut out for us if \nwe are to consider the 49 judicial nominations pending at the start of \nthis week and others who are being nominated over the next few weeks.\n  In spite of our efforts last year in the aftermath of strong \ncriticism from the Chief Justice of the United States, the vacancies \nfacing the Federal judiciary are, again, approximately 70 and the \nvacancies gap is not being closed. We have more Federal judicial \nvacancies extending longer and affecting more people. Judicial \nvacancies now stands at over 8 percent of the Federal judiciary. If one \nconsiders the additional judges recommended by the Judicial Conference, \nthe vacancies rate would be over 15 percent.\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed \nfor two and three years. We are seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked \nand delayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred \nfrom seeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see \ntheir work put on hold while they await the outcome of their \nnominations. Their families cannot plan.\n  The President spoke about the vacancies crisis again last month. \nCertainly no President has consulted more closely with Senators of the \nother party on judicial nominations. The Senate should get about the \nbusiness of voting on the confirmation of the scores of judicial \nnominations that have been delayed without justification for too long. \nWe must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the \nlongstanding vacancies that plague the federal courts and disadvantage \nall Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the Senate will \nnow proceed to vote. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Adalberto Jose Jordan, of Florida, to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida?

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 35th \nanniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was signed into law on \nSeptember 3, 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and to announce the \nformation of a Senate Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus. The \nWilderness Act became law seven years after the first wilderness bill \nwas introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The final \nbill, sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, passed the \nSenate by a vote of 73-12 on April 9, 1963, and passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 373-1 on July 30, 1964. The Wilderness Act \nof 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ``to \nsecure for the American people of present and future generations the \nbenefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.''\n  The law reserves to Congress the authority to designate wilderness \nareas, and directs the federal land management agencies to review the \nlands under their responsibility for their wilderness potential.\n  The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest \nService land in 54 wilderness areas. Now, after passage of 102 pieces \nof legislation the wilderness system is comprised of over 104 million \nacres in 625 wilderness areas, across 44 States, and administered by \nfour federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service in the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As we in this body know well, the passage and enactment of \nlegislation of this type is a remarkable accomplishment. It requires \nsteady, bipartisan commitment, institutional support, and direct \nleadership. The United States Senate was instrumental in shaping this \nvery important law, and this anniversary gives us the opportunity to \nrecognize this role. I am honored today to be joined on the floor by \none of the three Senators remaining in this body who have the \ndistinguished honor of having voted for this legislation, the Senior \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd). I look forward to his remarks at \nthe conclusion of my own. The Senior Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senior Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), who also \nvoted for this legislation, have asked that their remarks regarding \nthis anniversary be included in the Record. Their remarks will also \nappear in the Record together with my remarks on the Wilderness Act \nanniversary.\n  In addition, I understand that the Ranking Member of the Energy \nCommittee (Mr. Bingaman) has a statement on the anniversary.\n  Under the Wilderness Act, wilderness is defined as ``an area of \nundeveloped federal land retaining its primeval character and influence \nwhich generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces \nof nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable.'' \nThe concept of the creation of a national wilderness system marked an \ninnovation in the American conservation movement--wilderness would be a \nplace where our ``management strategy'' would be to leave lands \nessentially undeveloped.\n  Congress lavished more time and effort on the wilderness bill than \nalmost any other measure in conservation history. The original bill \nestablished 9.1 million acres of federally protected wilderness in \nnational forests. From June 1957 until May 1964 there were nine \nseparate hearings on the proposal, collecting over six thousand pages \nof testimony. The bill itself was modified and rewritten sixty-six \ndifferent times. Twenty different Senators made statements on the \nlegislation. Much of the delay in reaching a final version\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\nstemmed from the conflicts between the scope of the bill's restrictions \non mining, grazing, oil and other extractive activities on designated \nwilderness areas and the need for the law to be flexible in the light \nof pre-existing activities. The bill's supporters argued that the \nmeasure gave legal sanction to the areas already being managed by the \nForest Service as primitive areas. More importantly, they successfully \nargued that Congressional action was necessary because the wilderness \nthat exists is its own finite resource.\n  More than a century of development had brought greatly changed \nconditions to both public and private lands throughout the country. \n``If the year were 1857 instead of 1957,'' one supporter of the bill \nwrote in the Living Wilderness, the Wilderness Society's newsletter, \n``I'd say definitely no [to a wilderness bill]. But given the almost \ntotal dominance of developed civilization, I am compelled to work for \nsaving the remnants of undeveloped land.'' I think those remarks apply \njust as well to the state of our federal lands today, more than thirty-\nfive years later.\n  My interest in this law stems from the fact that Wisconsin has \nproduced great wilderness thinkers and leaders in the wilderness \nmovement such as Aldo Leopold, Sigurd Olsen, John Muir and former \nSenator Gaylord Nelson. Senator Nelson was a co-sponsor of the \nWilderness Act of 1964, along with former Wisconsin Senator William \nProxmire. I am proud to now hold the Senate seat that Senator Nelson \nheld with distinction from 1963 to 1981. As a Senator from Wisconsin, I \nhave a special depth of feeling about this issue.\n\n  The testimony at Congressional hearings and the treatment of the bill \nin the press of the day reveals Wisconsin's crucial role in the long \nand continuing American debate about our wild places, and the \ndevelopment of the Wilderness Act. The names and ideas of John Muir, \nSigurd Olson, and Aldo Leopold, especially Leopold, appear time and \ntime again in the legislative history.\n  Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, chairman of what was then \ncalled the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, stated that his \nsupport of the wilderness system was the direct result of discussions \nhe had held almost forty years before with Leopold, who was then in the \nSouthwest with the Forest Service. It was Leopold who advocated, while \nwith the Forest Service, the creation of a primitive area in the Gila \nNational Forest in New Mexico in 1923. The Gila Primitive Area formally \nbecame part of the wilderness system when the Wilderness Act became \nlaw. In a statement in favor of the Wilderness Act in the New York \nTimes, then Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall discussed ecology \nand what he called ``a land ethic'' and referred to Leopold as the \ninstigator of the modern wilderness movement. At a Senate hearing in \n1961, David Brower of the Sierra Club went so far as to allege that \n``no man who reads Leopold with an open mind will ever again, with a \nclear conscience, be able to step up and testify against the wilderness \nbill.''\n  For others, the ideas of Olson and Muir provided a justification for \nthe wilderness system, particularly that the country's strength depends \nupon blending contact with the primitive into a civilized existence \nbecause the frontier played such a central role in the our history.\n  Passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964 has not terminated the American \ndebate over the meaning, value and need to protect wild country. As I \nmentioned, the wilderness system has dramatically expanded under both \nRepublican and Democratic leadership. The number of wildernesses \nestablished and acres designated by each Congress has varied greatly \nfrom year to year. There have been only nine individual years since \npassage of the Wilderness Act when no wildernesses were designated, and \n1965 to 1967 was the only period of three consecutive years in which no \nwilderness legislation was passed by Congress. In 1984, during the \nReagan Administration, 175 wildernesses were established, more than \ndouble any other year's addition. Despite the record number of new \nwildernesses in 1984, the largest number of wilderness acres was \ndesignated in 1980 with passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, which added over 56 million acres to the National \nWilderness Preservation System. Combined with other wilderness laws \npassed that year, nearly 61 million acres of wilderness were designated \nin 1980, more than 6 times the number of acres passed in any other \nyear.\n  Significant additions to the system continued up until 1994, when \nCongress passed the California Desert Protection Act. Despite this \naccomplishment, Congress has gotten out of the habit of passing \nwilderness bills which protect our remaining wilderness-quality federal \nlands. In the 105th Congress, the Senate's actions were much more \nmodest--we added about 160 acres to the Eagles Nest Wilderness in \nColorado.\n\n  However, Congress has much bolder bills before it, with bipartisan \nsupport, such as the bills to designate 9.1 million acres in Utah and \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness. \nIn addition, President Clinton proposed a new omnibus National Parks \nwilderness bill in his State of the Union. We need to address these \nmeasures, and to revitalize the tradition of statewide and state \ndelegation led wilderness bills.\n  In order to get the Senate in a position to act on wilderness issues, \nI hope to raise awareness of the importance of wilderness in the \nSenate. I have been working to organize a Wilderness and Public Lands \nCaucus that will help the Senate to renew its bipartisan commitment to \nthe active protection of wilderness and public lands. Today I am \ndelighted to announce that Senator McCain, Senator Durbin, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Murray, and Senator Bayh will be joining me in this \neffort. I encourage any member of the Senate interested in learning \nabout and working on these issues to join our caucus, and I am grateful \nto these members who are willing to lend their time and leadership.\n  I feel it is time to promote and re-develop expertise on these issues \nin the Senate. In the early days of the Wilderness Act many Senators \nhad expertise on these issues, and ad hoc coalitions formed to pass \nlarge bills with provisions for a number of states. However, now that \nthe Senate has lost its zeal for the continuing work of identifying and \ndesignating wilderness areas this expertise has dwindled. Without a new \ndedication to re-building this expertise, wilderness and public lands \nissues will remain increasingly divisive, despite a resurgent public \ninterest in our wilderness and an increased public desire for Congress \nto extend additional protection to federal lands of wilderness quality.\n  I intend for the caucus to meet as necessary during each Senate \nsession in pursuit of several objectives:\n  To assist members in defending existing wilderness areas, and other \nfederal land resources already protected in the public trust, from \nactivities that have the potential to significantly affect the \nqualities for which they were designated.\n  To support and provide advice to members seeking opportunities to \ndesignate new wilderness areas.\n  To provide members with a bipartisan forum in which to discuss \nwilderness and other public land protection and management issues and \nlearn from others' expertise.\n  To educate members about the Wilderness Act and other federal land \nmanagement statutes, and to improve understanding of the appropriate \nuses of various federal land management designations and the federal \nfinancial and management requirements needed to implement them.\n\n  Mr. President, many would agree that more must be done to protect our \nwild places. One of the things that needs to be done, particularly on \nthe cusp of the Millennium, is to examine and improve the ability of \nthis body to understand and grapple with these issues in the public \ninterest. This is a great institution, with a strong conservation \nhistory, which has produced the Wilderness Act, one of the gems of \nconservation law. I am actively committing to working on wilderness \nissues because I believe it to be in the Wisconsin tradition, and, as a \nSenator, I am trying to use the tools I have been given by the people \nof Wisconsin to build the leadership needed to defend these places.\n  In conclusion, I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo \nLeopold in his 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac. He said, ``The \noutstanding scientific discovery of the Twentieth Century is not the \ntelevision, or radio, but rather the complexity of the land organism. \nOnly those who know the most\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\nabout it can appreciate how little is known about it.'' We still have \nmuch to learn, but this anniversary of the Wilderness Act reminds us \nhow far we have come and how powerful a collegial commitment to public \nlands can be in the Senate.\n  I am very pleased and honored to be able to yield the remainder of my \ntime to one of the three Senators who is here to vote for this \nlegislation, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, \nfor bringing us together today to celebrate the passage of the \nWilderness Act of 1964. Too often, the pressing events of the day \nprevent us from remembering so many important pieces of legislation. I \nam happy that we are able to take a moment to recognize a historic \npiece of legislation.\n  Let me begin with a look backward over the well-traveled road of \nhistory. It is only fitting that we turn our faces backward so that we \nmight be better informed and prepared to deal with future events. On a \nwhole range of important issues, the Senate has always been blessed \nwith Senators who were able to rise above political parties, and \nconsider first and foremost the national interest. There are many \nworthy examples throughout the Senate's history.\n  My friend and former colleague, Senator Mike Mansfield, and other \ndistinguished Members of the Senate understood this point well. \nPolitical polarization, a simple zero-sum strategy by one party to \nachieve a short-lived victory which demonizing the other party, is not \nnow, and has never been, a good thing for the Senate. I know that \nAmericans have always loved a good debate. I believe that this is one \nof the lessons that we can take from the passage of the Wilderness Act \nof 1964. Members on both sides of the issue focused on the more \nsubstantive and stimulating policy challenges rather than allowing pure \npolitics and imagery to enter into the fray.\n  The debate on the Wilderness Act of 1964 serves as a great example of \nthe Senate's charge in taking a leadership role and working over the \nlong term to pass historic pieces of legislation. I believe the bill's \nchief sponsor, Senator Clinton Anderson from New Mexico, understood \nthis point well when he said, upon consideration of the conference \nreport, on August 20, 1964:\n\n       What we have done we have done not only to meet the urgency \n     of the moment, but for the future. In no area has this \n     Congress more decisively served the future well-being of the \n     Nation that in passing legislation to conserve natural \n     resources and to provide the means by which our people could \n     enjoy them. One of the brightest stars in the constellation \n     of conservation measures is the wilderness bill * * *. The \n     path of the wilderness legislation through Congress has \n     sometimes been as rugged as the forests and mountains \n     embraced by the wilderness system.\n\n  The Senate understood there was a need to protect America's unique \nplaces, and Members worked to craft a proposal over a number of years \nthat could achieve that end. Senator George McGovern, another key \nsupporter of the Wilderness Act, observed:\n\n       I think each of us has been enriched at one time or another \n     through our experiences with natural undisturbed areas of the \n     country * * * its comparatively uncluttered open spaces, its \n     lakes and woods, have special appreciation for the purpose of \n     the wilderness preservation system. As the population of our \n     country grows and as our city areas become more contested, it \n     is all the more imperative that we look to the preservation \n     of great primitive outdoor areas where people can go for \n     recreational and inspirational experience.\n\n  The U.S. population has since grown by more than 70 percent since the \nWilderness Act of 1964 was enacted. In addition to land preservation, \nthe act has encouraged the discovery of America's history, promoted \nrecreation, provided for its diverse wildlife and ecosystems, and \nsatisfied people's urge for solace and a return to wild places. The \ndefinition of wilderness according to the act is ``an area where the \nearth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man \nhimself is a visitor who does not remain.'' Initially endowed with 9.1 \nmillion acres of public lands, the wilderness system today encompasses \nmore than 104 million acres in forty-four States.\n  My home state of West Virginia remains wild and wonderful because of \nCongress' actions. Covered from end to end by the ancient Appalachian \nMountains, West Virginia remains, to me, one of the most beautiful one \nof the most unique of all places and I have seen lot of places \nthroughout the world in my time. It is the most southern of the \nnorthern States and the most northern of the Southern states; the most \neastern of the Western States and the most western of the eastern \nStates; where the east says good morning to the west, and where Yankee \nDoodle and Dixie kiss each other good night. The luscious mountains \ngently roll across that land, providing an elegant sense of mystery to \nthe landscape. The wilderness of my State has given West Virginians a \nfreedom to explore. This freedom has been secured and protected so that \nfuture generations--like my baby granddaughter, her children, and her \nchildren's children--will be able to say Montani Semper Liberi, \nMountaineers are always free!\n\n  Four wilderness areas have been designated in West Virginia since the \n1964 act. Each area captures and preserves uniquely a beautiful aspect \nof a State that has, I believe, more than its fair share of native \nloveliness. God must have been in a spendthrift mood when he made West \nVirginia!\n  In the Otter Creek Wilderness Area, consisting of 20,000 acres so \ndesignated in 1975, you can follow the same twisting trails that early \nsettlers to the area wove through the dense forest. Amid the stands of \ntowering White Oaks, dark hickory, and ghostly poplar trees, you may \ndiscover stunted groves of apple trees, remnants of an early settler's \norchard. Maybe Johnny Appleseed came that way.\n  Also designated in 1975, the Dolly Sods Wilderness Area preserves \n10,000 acres of Canada that somehow migrated south and chose to settle \nin West Virginia. Heath thickets, bogs, and low-growing evergreens \ncombine to establish a wide open feeling akin to more northerly climes \nsuch as those of Minnesota. Offering scenic vistas, Dolly Sods is a \nfamed spot in which to enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, and nature \nwatching.\n  The Cranberry Wilderness Area proves the regenerative power of \nnature. Its 35,864 acres were logged in the early part of this century, \nwith the valuable timber shipped by steam locomotives to a mill in \nRichwood. It also suffered severe wildfires which raged over much of \nthe area. In order to restore it to its natural condition, the Forest \nService purchased the land in 1934--the year I graduated from high \nschool. Now grown into a mature forest, the Cranberry Wilderness Area \nreceived its official designation in 1983.\n  Consisting of more than 12,000 acres, Laurel Fork Wilderness Area was \nonce a profitable source of lumber at the beginning of the century. \nLaurel Fork has since been preserved and is a source of the Cheat \nRiver. Designated in 1983, Laurel Fork Wilderness has a wide blend of \nwildlife and foliage special to Appalachia. Among the Birch, Beech, and \nMaple trees which grow in the area, live the native species of West \nVirginia such as white-tail deer, wild turkey, bobcat, and even black \nbear.\n  I might note that perhaps one of the most majestic of wildlife \nspecies protected by these wilderness areas throughout the U.S. is the \nbald eagle. Symbolizing America's freedom and strength, the bald eagle, \nin fact, has been recently removed from the endangered species list, \nand will continue to soar for future generations of Americans.\n  The Wilderness Act of 1964 enabled West Virginians to preserve the \nnatural beauty of their State for themselves and for the nation * * * \nnow and forever. I believe that Senator Anderson summarized it best \nwhen he said:\n\n       Deep down inside of most Americans is a love of the out-of-\n     doors. * * * It is an effort to protect and preserve, \n     unspoiled, just a little bit of the vast wilderness which \n     stretched ocean to ocean on this continent less than 300 \n     years ago, so that this love of the great, unspoiled, out-of-\n     doors which is a part of us can be gratified.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize a number of former \ncolleagues who took a leadership role in passing the Wilderness Act of \n1964. Many of them were fairly close friends of mine. There was Senator \nAnderson, whose name I have spoken earlier, Thomas\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nKuchel, Hubert Humphrey, Henry Jackson, Frank Church, Frank Lausche, \nPaul Douglas, Harrison Williams, Jennings Randolph--my former colleague \nfrom West Virginia--Joseph Clark, William Proxmire, Maurine Neuberger, \nLee Metcalf, George McGovern, David Nelson--they took a leadership role \nin guiding this piece of legislation through the Senate. The Senate has \nconsidered many thousands of pieces of legislation on a myriad of \ntopics over the last several years. I am proud to stand here today and \nsay that this piece of legislation, the Wilderness Act of 1964, stands \nas a great example of what this body can accomplish when it sets its \ncollective mind to it. These were the sponsors of the Wilderness Act in \nthe 88th Congress.\n  In closing, I want to welcome my colleagues back from the prairies \nand the plains, the mountains and the hollows and the hills, the broad \nvalleys. We have much work to do in these coming weeks and we can learn \nmuch from the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the dedication and commitment \nof those Senators who worked to fulfill their vision by enacting that \ngreat piece of legislation, their vision of a future continent which \nwould be preserved for the men and women who would come after them.\n  Far too often these days, we get caught up in the partisan wranglings \nof tax cuts, educational needs, national security demands, Social \nSecurity changes, health care reform, and much, much more--all of which \nsubjects are extremely important. The public has become concerned about \nwhat it is that we actually do in this Chamber. In reflecting upon the \nWilderness Act of 1964, I find a great example of what this body can \nachieve when it puts its whole mind and its whole spirit into it. Again \nI thank my colleague for his kindness in inviting me to participate \nhere this afternoon in recalling our footsteps down the long hall of \nmemories.\n  In closing, I am reminded of the words of one of America's foremost \nconservationists and outdoorsman, John Muir--\n\n       Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting \n     at once to work and rest! Days in whose light everything \n     seems equally divine, opening a thousand windows to show us \n     God. Nevermore, however weary, should one faint by the way \n     who gains the blessing of one mountain day: whatever his \n     fate, long life, short life, stormy or calm, he is rich \n     forever. . . . I only went out for a walk, and finally \n     concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, \n     was going in. One touch of nature . . . makes all the world \n     kin.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating this impressive anniversary of the Wilderness Act of \n1964. Thirty-five years ago, Congress passed this benchmark \nlegislation, which has opened the door for extensive new protections of \nwilderness areas throughout the nation.\n  In 1924, the U.S. Forest Service named the Gila National Forest in \nNew Mexico as the first wilderness area. As years passed, it became \nincreasingly clear that a more comprehensive strategy of protection for \nthese priceless areas was needed. Between 1957 and 1964, nine \ncongressional hearings were held, resulting in sixty-six rewrites of \nthe original bill. This enormous amount of attention can be credited to \nthe strong grassroots support for preserving these magnificent \nresources. As a result, Congress passed the Wilderness Act. It was \nsigned into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, and \nestablished over nine million acres of wilderness areas throughout the \ncountry.\n  The act defined wilderness as ``an area where the earth and its \ncommunity of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a \nvisitor who does not remain.'' Although sharply restricting human \nactivities in these areas, the Act also paid tribute to a piece of our \nnational identity. To Americans, the wilderness is a place to \nrediscover what it means to be American. As Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam O. Douglas once noted, ``Roadless areas are one pledge of \nfreedom.'' From the time of the first settlers, the nation's wilderness \nareas have been symbols of freedom and human ingenuity that \ncharacterize the American dream.\n  In his classic work, Wilderness and the American Mind, Roderick Nash \nobserved the close relationship between our citizens and such areas, \nstating ``Take away wilderness and you take away the opportunity to be \nAmerican.'' The Wilderness Act has protected these priceless \nundeveloped areas, and it has preserved these magnificent resources for \nour time and for all time.\n  Since this law was enacted, Congress has created over six hundred \nwilderness areas, totaling more than one hundred million acres in \nstates across our nation. These are areas that cannot be developed or \ndestroyed, but will retain the original splendor of their natural \nbeauty.\n  It was a special privilege for me to support the Wilderness Act in \n1964, as one of the most far-reaching actions by Congress to preserve \nour environmental heritage. All of us take pride in the many beautiful \nareas designated under the Act.\n  Finally, I commend all those who have done so much to uphold the \ngreat tradition of the Wilderness Act, by working in the agencies that \nare committed to protecting the nation's wilderness. As the act itself \nso eloquently states, they continue to ``secure for the American people \nof present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource \nof wilderness.''\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr President, it is a pleasure to have this opportunity \nto speak on the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964 and on \nthe establishment of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n  When the Wilderness Act was being debated on the Senate floor in \n1963, I was a freshman Senator. Following Hawaii's admission to the \nunion in 1959, I served one partial and one full term in the House of \nRepresentatives and then was elected to the Senate in 1962. So, in \nearly April of 1963, I was a 39-year-old freshman Senator in the first \nyear of my first term in the Senate.\n  The Wilderness Act, however, was not new to the Senate when it came \nto the floor in April 1963. The first wilderness proposal was \nintroduced late in the 84th Congress in 1956. Following extensive \nhearings, testimony, debate and revisions, a wilderness bill was passed \nby a wide margin in the Senate on September 6, 1961. However, it was \nnot until my freshman year in the Senate that we passed a wilderness \nbill that ultimately went on to become law the next year in 1964.\n  Just prior to the vote in the Senate on April 9, 1963, one of the \nfloor managers of the bill, the Honorable Frank Church of Idaho, said, \n``the Senate is about to vote on the question of the passage of a bill \nwhich, if enacted into law, will be regarded as one of the great \nlandmarks in the history of conservation.'' You can imagine the effect \nof such far reaching and nationally significant discourse on a young \nman from a new state in the middle of the Pacific.\n  I have been around for a while. Yesterday was my 75th birthday. But I \nam not so jaded as to have lost sight of the important principles upon \nwhich the Wilderness Act was founded.\n  The bill was ultimately signed into law on September 3, 1964. To me, \nit seems like just yesterday, but a lot has happened since then. The \nWilderness system was originally endowed with 9.1 million acres of \nnational forest lands. In 35 years, that has grown to more than 104 \nmillion acres managed by four federal land management agencies.\n  Hawaii, obviously a very small State, has just 142,370 acres of \nfederally designated wilderness area. This is about 1/10 of 1% of the \ntotal designated wilderness area in the country. However, let me tell \nyou about Hawaii's wilderness and other natural areas.\n  Hawaii is the only State with bona fide tropical rain forest. \nAlthough over half of Hawaii's original native rain forest has been \nlost or replaced by introduced species, planted landscapes, or \ndevelopment, a great deal remains. Perhaps 3/4 of a million acres of \nrain forest is left in Hawaii.\n  Rain forest is just the start, however. There are actually about 150 \ndistinct ecosystem types in Hawaii. These ecosystems are so distinctive \nthat the Hawaiian Islands constitute a unique global bio-region. These \necosystems range from 14,000-foot snowy alpine deserts, to subterranean \nlava tube systems with eyeless creatures, to windswept coastal dunes.\n  All told, perhaps half of the 150 ecosystem types in Hawaii are \nconsidered in trouble, imperilled by human-related changes in the \nlandscape. Most of the loss has occurred along the coasts\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nand in the lowlands, where the majority of human habitation exists \ntoday.\n  Hawaii is also considered to be the extinction capital of the United \nStates. About 90% of Hawaii's native plants and animals occur nowhere \nelse in the world, and nearly 1000 different kinds of Hawaiian plants \nand animals are threatened by extinction. Approximately 75% of the \nrecorded extinctions in the United States are from Hawaii. Also, about \n40% of the birds and 30% of the plants presently on the U.S. endangered \nspecies list are native to Hawaii.\n  One of Hawaii's federal wilderness areas is the 19,270-acre Haleakala \nWilderness Area on the Island of Maui, which was designated in 1976. \nThis area is part of the 28,655-acre Haleakala National Park. During \nthe August recess, I participated in the dedication of 1,500 acres of \npristine tropical habitat, which was added to Haleakala National Park \nthanks to the support of my Congressional colleagues who approved funds \nlast year for its acquisition. So, Haleakala continues to grow.\n  The major feature of this park is the dormant, though not extinct, \nMount Haleakala and its volcanic crater within. Stretching from an \nelevation of 10,000 feet to the sea, the park also includes unrivaled \nnative forest and stream habitat, and abundant Native Hawaiian \nhistorical and cultural features.\n  The other Federal wilderness area is the 123,100-acre Hawaii \nVolcanoes Wilderness Area, which is part of the larger 230,000-acre \nHawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. This park, \nestablished in 1916, displays the results of 70 million years of \nvolcanism and rises from sea level to the summit of the earth's most \nmassive volcano, Mauna Loa at 13,677 feet.\n  Within the park is the world's most active volcano, Kilauea, which \noffers scientists insights into the birth of our planet and visitors \nviews of dramatic volcanic landscapes. Molten lava from the Puu Oo \nvent, on the flank of Kilauea volcano, flows seven miles through a lava \ntube to the coast where it enters the ocean, causing the sea to \nactually boil. Volume of flow averages about 400,000 cubic meters per \nday continuously adding new land to the island. 1999 is 16th year of \nthis ongoing eruption of Kilauea.\n  More than just these designated federal wilderness areas, Hawaii has \na total of 270,000 acres in the national park system; 35,000 acres in \nfederal fish and wildlife refuges; and 109,000 acres in state natural \narea reserves. Added to this are other areas managed privately for \nconservation purposes, including approximately 25,000 acres managed by \nThe Nature Conservancy of Hawaii.\n  Wilderness is defined in the law as areas ``where the earth and its \ncommunity of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a \nvisitor who does not remain.'' With all of the unique and imperilled \nspecies and habitat in Hawaii, I certainly understand the value of \nprotecting our wild and natural areas, whatever the definition might \nbe.\n  The message that I would like to leave with my colleagues as we think \nabout the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act is that we all wish to \nbe environmentalists. We often differ on the details of \nenvironmentalism; sometimes greatly. Some of the most impassioned \ndiscussions in this body have to do with environmental issues. Some of \nus do not receive the highest score from the League of Conservation \nVoters. However, I do not think any of my colleagues would say that \nenvironmental conservation is a frivolous pursuit. It is merely a \nquestion of degree.\n  So where does that leave us? I know we will continue to debate so-\ncalled anti-environmental riders, the future of the Endangered Species \nAct, and maybe even reforms to the 35-year-old Wilderness Act. But let \nus not close our minds to our perceived adversaries, nor lose sight of \nwhat I believe we all agree upon.\n  Our natural environment is a finite resource that needs to be \nprotected and nurtured for generations to come. There are no simple \nsolutions, but with this common goal in mind, we will make progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10549-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10549-S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gorton for permitting me \nat this time to speak as in morning business before they get on with \nthe important business of the Interior appropriations bill. I want to \ntake this time because I was unable to be here earlier when Senator \nFeingold, Senator Reed, I think, and Senator Boxer spoke on the issue \nof East Timor. I want to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues \nwhat I saw during my recent trip to East Timor with a delegation that \nincluded Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Congressman McGovern of \nMassachusetts. We were in East Timor on August 20 and 21, just a little \nover 2 weeks ago. The purpose of our trip was to assess the conditions \nin East Timor leading up to the August 30 referendum.\n  It was a trip that in some ways was uplifting but at the end--I could \nsmell it in the air--I had a foreboding of things to come. On the first \nday we traveled to the capital of East Timor, Dili and spent the night \nthere. The next day, under the auspices of the United Nations, we took \na helicopter to Maliana, and then from Maliana to Suai before returning \nto Jakarta. What was so uplifting about it was to see so many people \nwilling to risk their lives to be able to vote; people whose homes were \nburned down, their lives threatened, families threatened, and yet they \nwere going to vote.\n  When the vote was taken, over 98 percent of those registered came out \nto vote. Mr. President, 78 percent of the people of East Timor voted \nfor independence and not to stay with Indonesia, a clear-cut victory \nfor independence and, I can say from firsthand meetings with U.N. and \nU.S. officials as well as with people on the ground in East Timor, that \nhad it not been for the open assaults by the militias and intimidation \nand threats, that 78 percent probably would have been about 90 percent \nfor independence.\n  When I left East Timor, Senator Reed and Congressman McGovern and I \nall called on the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force \nimmediately to East Timor, either on the day of the vote or the day \nafter the vote. We all had a sense of what might come if there was not \na stable force on the ground to prevent the violence from happening in \nthe first place.\n\n  Upon returning to Jakarta, we met an hour and a half with President \nHabibie of Indonesia, and I will have more to say about that in a \nminute. We conveyed to him our concerns with the security situation in \nEast Timor. He assured us time and time again in the hour-and-a-half \nmeeting that Indonesia would maintain order in East Timor. I was there \nwith Congressman McGovern and with U.S. Ambassador Roy. President \nHabibie assured us the Indonesian Army would maintain peace, harmony \nand law and order after the vote was taken.\n  My fears of what would happen have been confirmed in the most \nhorrific manner. As we have all witnessed on CNN and in the newspapers \nover the past several days, the militias have gone on a killing rampage \nacting on the orders and with the assistance of the Indonesian military \nand the Indonesian police forces.\n  I must tell my colleagues, when we were in Maliana, for example, a \ncouple days before we were there, the militias had put on street \ndemonstrations right in front of the U.N. compound armed to the teeth \nwith guns. Amongst these militias were the Indonesian military and the \nIndonesian police in clear violation of the agreement they had signed \nwith Portugal and the United Nations on May 5, 1999. Every U.N. \nobserver with whom I spoke, every single one without exception, said \nthe militias were backed by and armed by the Indonesian military and \nthat the military and the civilian police were supporting the militias \nopenly.\n  Now that these militias have gone on a rampage, one must ask, where \nis the Indonesian military and where is the Indonesian police? The \nIndonesian military had 10,000 to 15,000 military people there. They \ncould have stopped it. They either chose not to or they are actively \nsupporting this murderous rampage. Either is unacceptable.\n  They are attacking unarmed civilians. They are rounding up refugees,\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\nputting them in trucks, and trucking them to unknown destinations. They \nare tearing families apart. Just as we saw in Kosovo, the same thing is \nhappening in East Timor. Husbands are separated from wives, parents \nseparated from their children and carted off in trucks into the back \ncountry, and no one knows what is happening to them. The same thing is \nhappening as happened in Kosovo.\n  When we were in East Timor, we spent an evening with Bishop Belo, the \nCatholic bishop of East Timor. I will point out a bit of history.\n  East Timor for the last I think it was 400-some years was under \nPortuguese domination. About 200 years ago, Portugal formally annexed \nEast Timor. It was a colony of Portugal up to 1975 when Portugal left. \nIndonesia brutally invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the next \nyear. The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's annexation of \nEast Timor.\n  Through the years since then, the East Timorese have suffered \nmightily. Over 200,000 East Timorese, it is estimated, were brutally \nslaughtered by the Indonesian military over these years. But they \npersisted. They persisted in wanting their independence. In 1991, \nsadly, East Timor got worldwide attention when Indonesian troops opened \nfire on mourners who were at a funeral for an independence supporter in \nDili. It was a big funeral. There were 200 men, women, and children \nslaughtered by the Indonesian military in 1991.\n  Through all of this, Bishop Belo, East Timorese by birth and \nupbringing, ordained a Catholic priest in Portugal, came back to East \nTimor, elevated by Pope John Paul II to be a bishop.\n  Two years ago on June 18, Bishop Belo was in Washington and said a \nmass of peace and reconciliation at St. Peter's Church. A number of us \nwere there that morning. That was the first time I had the occasion to \nmeet Bishop Belo.\n  Of course, the year before that, in 1996, Bishop Belo and Jose Ramos \nHorta jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for their peaceful resistance \nthrough the years to the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. A year \nafter that, Bishop Belo was here and said mass at St. Peter's, as I \nsaid, and we were there.\n  It was for me a very touching moment, to spend an evening in Bishop \nBelo's home in Dili with Senator Reed and Congressman McGovern, to have \ndinner in his home and talk with him about what was happening in East \nTimor and to hear him pour out his heart about how many people had died \nand the suffering of the East Timorese people and his hopes and his \nprayers. We held hands around the table and he led us in a prayer that, \nregardless of what the outcome of the vote would be, East Timorese \nwould not kill each other and that the Indonesian military would \nquietly leave.\n  I am saddened to say that 3 days ago the militias entered the \ncompound of Bishop Belo and burned his house down, the very house in \nwhich we had dinner not more than two weeks ago. He was able to escape \nand is now in Australia.\n  We sat in Bishop Belo's dining room and saw all the mementos he had. \nHe had a picture of himself shaking hands and being greeted by \nPresident Clinton, a bust of President Kennedy that was given to him by \nRepresentative Patrick Kennedy who visited there a few years ago, a \nsigned picture from President Bush who had met with him, and, of \ncourse, his Nobel Peace Prize. Now that house has been reduced to \nashes.\n  There were several thousand East Timorese in his compound being \nprotected by the church. Eyewitnesses saw the militias killing people \nand some were being put on trucks--this is where the families were \nseparated--and taken out into the countryside.\n  On Monday, I spoke with Jose Ramos Horta, his corecipient of the \nNobel Peace Prize. He said in the 500-year history of East Timor, the \nchurch has never been attacked. There have been wars and there has been \nfighting, but the church has never been attacked. He even said that \nwhen the Japanese took over East Timor during World War II they never \nattacked the church.\n  As bad as that is, I have an even sadder story to tell.\n  We went to the community of Suai, which is in the southwestern part \nof East Timor, because we had heard there were about 1,500 people who \nhad taken up refuge in a church compound. This was now 9 days before \nthe vote. We wanted to go there and see for ourselves. So Senator Reed, \nCongressman McGovern, and I went there.\n  Truly, there were 1,500 people in this compound.\n  The buhpati, as he is called, the mayor, the person who runs the \ncity, had cut off the water. It was very hot, and he had cut off the \nwater to these people. Who were these people? These were people who had \nbeen driven from their homes because the militias feared that they were \ngoing to vote for independence. Men, women, children, families, all \ngathered in this churchyard, had their water cut off.\n  Then the U.N. tried to get through a truckload of food. They wouldn't \neven let the food get through. The two priests who were protecting \nthese people were Father Hilario and Father Francisco. This is a \npicture I had taken with them at the church compound. Father Hilario \nand Father Francisco, two of the nicest individuals you ever want to \nmeet, both Catholic priests, only doing their job protecting people. \nThey weren't speaking out for independence or anything like that. They \nwere simply doing their job as the parish priests.\n  I learned this morning that yesterday the militias entered their \nhouse, took these two priests out and killed them, 2 weeks after we saw \nthem. Unarmed, they were. Militias took them out and brutally killed \nthem. That is what is happening in East Timor today.\n  We have a responsibility that goes back 23 years. When Indonesia \nfirst invaded East Timor in 1975, the United States took the position \nthat we supported Indonesia. I was at that time a Member of the House \nof Representatives and, with other Members of the House, introduced a \nresolution condemning Indonesia for their brutal invasion of East Timor \nat that time. In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands, almost \n200,000 East Timorese lost their lives to the brutality of the \nIndonesian military. Through it all, they maintained their cohesion. \nThey maintained their peaceful resistance. On August 30, 98 percent of \nthe registered voters came out to vote in the face of machetes and \nbullets and threats. Despite being driven from their homes and having \ntheir homes burned down; they voted 78 percent for independence.\n  If we stand for anything, we should stand for the right of self-\ndetermination and independence when people exercise their right to \nvote. That is what we stand for as Americans. That is our philosophical \nfoundation.\n  It was a free and fair vote, even though the militias were \nintimidating people.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It seems to me that for the bastion of democracy, those \nof us in this country who believe so deeply in the right of the secret \nballot, the right of people to be able to vote for their futures, to \nsee this happen and for us to stand back and do nothing is shameful. We \nought to be on the front lines of asking the United Nations to go in \nthere with a peacekeeping force now.\n  I had asked the United Nations and the Clinton administration to put \npressure on the U.N. to send a peacekeeping force to East Timor on the \nday of the vote or the day after the vote. If we had done that, we \nwouldn't have had these killings that have gone on. We could have had a \nlittle bit of preventive action. But, no, we didn't do it. We said we \nhad to wait until the Indonesians asked us to come in. It is clear that \nthe Government of Indonesia is not going to keep law and order there. \nIt is clear from every eyewitness account we have that the Indonesian \nmilitary is behind the militias and their brutal attacks on innocent \ncivilians. So now it is incumbent upon the world community to answer \nthe call to go to East Timor to restore peace and stability.\n  I will shortly be introducing a resolution to that effect that \nbasically congratulates the East Timorese on their vote, condemns the \nviolence, and calls upon our U.N. Ambassador to seek the United Nations \nSecurity Council's immediate authorization to deploy an international \nforce to East Timor to restore peace and stability.\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\n  Already Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Thailand, Pakistan, \nMalaysia, and the Philippines have all said they will contribute \nforces. Today, we learned that China has basically said they are open \nminded on this issue. Well, now is the time for the United States to \ntake some leadership.\n  I call upon President Clinton to be forceful in calling upon the \nUnited Nations to send an international force immediately to East \nTimor, and we should contribute to this force. We should not shirk our \nresponsibilities in this matter either.\n  To do nothing now would be to fly in the face of everything for which \nthis great country stands for. We were one of those actively \nencouraging the Indonesians, the Portuguese, the United Nations, and \nthe East Timorese to reach this agreement to allow this vote. We \nsupplied funding and observers for the vote. The Carter Center was \nactively involved in East Timor, ensuring it would be a free and fair \nvote and counting the ballots. If we now walk away, if we now say, \nwell, we can't do anything unless Indonesia invites us in to a place \nthat they annexed with brutal force 23 years ago then we are less of an \nAmerica than we have been in the past.\n  I am deeply saddened by the death of these two priests. I didn't know \nthem well, but I spent some time with them, spoke with them, asked them \nabout what they were doing, asked them about the conditions in their \nparishes. They were gentle souls just doing their job as shepherds of \ntheir flocks, yet taken out and brutally murdered.\n  Lastly, I understand that by tomorrow, the United Nations will remove \nthe 212 people they have there now. I am again asking the President to \ncall upon Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, to not \npull out our U.N. people who are there. If we do, we will have no eyes \nand no ears; we will have no presence at all in East Timor, and the \nkilling rampages we have witnessed over the last several days will only \nmushroom.\n  I hope the U.N. will keep its people there. I hope the United States \nwill put every ounce of our leadership behind the United Nations to \nsend an international force there within the next 48 hours. If we do, \nwe can save thousands of lives. And we can restore peace and stability. \nWe can tell the rest of the world that when you have a free and fair \nand open election under U.N. auspices, we are not going to let thugs \nand murderers take it away from you. That is the kind of America I \nthink we ought to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, debate on the Interior appropriations bill \ntook place on two separate occasions before the August recess. Two \nsignificant amendments have already been voted upon. We now have a \nunanimous consent agreement for listing all of the amendments that are \nin order, and they are 66 in number.\n  A substantial share, perhaps 20 or more of those amendments, will \neither be accepted or will be a part of one omnibus managers' amendment \nat the end of this debate. I suspect several others will not actually \nbe brought up for discussion in the Senate, but it seems apparent to \nthis Senator, as manager of the bill, that as many as a dozen may \nrequire some amount of debate and very likely a vote.\n  Up to four of those amendments are amendments that were included as a \npart of the bill as it was reported by the Subcommittee on Interior \nappropriations and by the full Appropriations Committee, which fell \nunder the revised rule XVI. One of those is an amendment originally \ndrafted by the Senator from Missouri. He will bring it up at this \npoint.\n  I have asked the Democratic manager, Senator Byrd, to get me a list \nof amendments that Members of his party wish to bring up. He is in the \nprocess of doing that at the moment. But this is an announcement that \nwe are now open and ready for business. It may be that we will, from \ntime to time, set amendments aside so we can hear debate on others. The \nmajority leader may decide to stack votes on some of these amendments. \nBut this is a very short week. We are starting this at 4 o'clock on \nWednesday afternoon. We have all day and into the evening tomorrow for \nthese debates. The majority leader has announced, due to the Jewish \nholiday, that there will be no votes on Friday. I hope we will have \nmade substantial progress on the bill by the end of tomorrow's session \nof the Senate. That is possible, of course, only if Members on both \nsides--both Republicans and Democrats--are willing to bring their \namendments to the floor.\n  The one other amendment I have discussed seriously at this point is \none by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, on gambling. That amendment is ready to be \naccepted. Now I see two Members on the floor. If the Senator from \nFlorida--who was told he could go first--would like to bring his \namendment up now and submit the rest of the various statements on it, I \nunderstand the amendment will be accepted in relatively short order. Is \nmy understanding correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is my understanding, and we are prepared to proceed \nwith our amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I yield the floor and suggest the Senator from \nFlorida seek to be recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kasey \nGillette of our staff have floor privileges for the duration of the \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1577\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from implementing \n          class III gaming procedures without State approval)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Enzi, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1577.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON CLASS III GAMING PROCEDURES.\n\n       No funds made available under this Act may be expended to \n     implement the final rule published on April 12, 1999, at 64 \n     Fed. Reg. 17535.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, which has been cosponsored \nby Senators Enzi, Bryan, Reid, Voinovich, Grams of Minnesota, Lugar, \nSessions, and Bayh, has been before the Senate on several previous \noccasions. It essentially goes to the issue of what will be the process \nto determine whether on Indian properties there shall be allowed class \nIII gambling. Class III gambling is the type of gambling that occurs in \nLas Vegas and Atlantic City. It is what we would characterize as casino \ngambling. Currently, for that gambling to occur, there has to be a \ncompact entered into between the representatives of the Indian tribe \nand the Governor of the State in which the proposed casino would be \nlocated. This is all part of the Indian Gaming Act passed by the \nCongress in the past.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, earlier this year, on April 12, issued \na regulation that essentially said if he determined the States were not \nnegotiating\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\non these compacts in good faith, then he could remove that power from \nthe States, and the Secretary of the Interior would decide whether \nthere should be class III gambling under the aegis of Indian tribes.\n  I personally think that is a very bad idea. It disrupts the basic \nprinciple of federalism, the responsibility which this Congress has \nplaced with the States and the tribes to reach an agreement.\n  In my own State of Florida, we have a prohibition in our constitution \nagainst casino gambling. Three times since 1978 there have been \nattempts to amend the constitution and change that provision, and each \ntime they have been overwhelmingly defeated. This would have the effect \nof overturning three constitutional expressions of opinion by the \npeople of Florida, and similar expressions of opinion by citizens of \nother States, to have the Secretary of the Department of the Interior \ninsert his or her will as to casino gambling within that State.\n  At this time, unless there is further debate, I will yield my time. \nWe will not necessarily ask for a rollcall vote on this matter if it \ncan, as in the past, be resolved by a voice vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. This amendment has \none very simple purpose: To ensure that the rights of Congress and all \nfifty states are not trampled on by an unelected cabinet official.\n  This amendment is very straightforward: it prohibits Secretary \nBabbitt from expending any funds from this act to implement the final \nregulations he published on April 12 of this year. The regulations at \nissue would allow Secretary Babbitt to circumvent the rights of \nindividual states by approving casino-style gambling on Indian Tribal \nlands. This amendment would prohibit this power grab.\n  Mr. President, this is the fifth time in two years that I have been \ninvolved in amendments of this nature. I myself have offered four \nprevious amendments to stop this power grab by the Secretary of the \nInterior, and four times this Senate has approved these amendments by \nvoice votes. I think this body has spoken with a clear voice that it \ndoes not believe an unelected cabinet official should bypass Congress \nand all fifty states in a decision as great as whether or not casino \ngambling should allowed within the state borders.\n  Mr. President, recently I was invited to testify before the Indian \nAffairs committee on a bill Senator Campbell has introduced to amend \nthe statute that governs gambling on Indian Tribal lands, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act. While I do not agree with all the changes \nSenator Campbell has proposed to IGRA, I applaud the Chairman for \ntaking the initiative to attempt to make changes the proper way--by \nproposing a bill, holding hearings, receiving public input from all the \nstakeholders, and moving the legislation through both houses of \nCongress. I have a few ideas on how I believe the bill could be \nimproved, and I welcome the invitation of Senator Campbell to offer \nsome suggestions to his bill.\n  In contrast to this legislative process--the proper way to make \nchanges to substantive law--Secretary Babbitt wants to make changes by \nadministrative fiat. His regulations are a slap in the face to the \ngovernments of all fifty states, to Congress, and to all the Indian \nTribes that have negotiated Tribal-State compacts with the States in \nwhich they are located. The Secretary's rules effectively punish those \ntribes which have played by the rules. The Secretary's action will open \nthe floodgates to an approval process based more on political influence \nthan on proper negotiations between the states and the tribes. Who will \nbe the winners under Secretary Babbitt's new regime? Will it be the \nTribes that donate enough money to the right political party? In \ncontrast to the Secretary's rules, the Graham-Enzi amendment would \nensure that an unelected Secretary of the Interior won't single-\nhandedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change \nto IGRA is done the right way--legislatively.\n  I have already had occasion on this floor to remark on the painful \nirony of the timing of Secretary Babbitt's power grab. In March of last \nyear, Attorney General Janet Reno requested an independent counsel to \ninvestigate Secretary Babbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-state \ngambling license to an Indian Tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have \nto wait for Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her \ninvestigation before any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident \nthat serious questions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's \njudgment and objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. We \nshould not turn over sole discretion of casino gambling on Indian \nTribal lands to an individual who has shown such carelessness in \nadministering his trust responsibilities to all the Indian Tribes \nwithin his jurisdiction.\n  The very fact that Attorney General Reno believed there was specific \nand credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient \nto make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant \nhimself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the states in the \narea of Tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this investigation \nshould have taught us an important lesson: we in Congress should not \nallow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to \nusurp the rightful role of Congress and the states in addressing the \ndifficult question of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary has not given any indication in the 16 \nmonths since the independent counsel was appointed that he should be \ntrusted with new, self-appointed trust responsibilities over Indian \nTribes. On February 22nd of this year, United States District Judge \nRoyce Lamberth issued a contempt citation against Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt and Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, \nKevin Gover, for disobeying the Court's orders in a trial in which the \nInterior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were sued for \nmismanagement of American Indian trust funds.\n  In his contempt citation, Judge Lamberth stated, and I quote,\n\n       The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would \n     fail to obey orders for production of documents, and then \n     conceal and cover up that disobedience with outright false \n     statements that the court then relied upon. But when that \n     litigant is the federal government, the misconduct is even \n     more troubling. I have never seen more egregious misconduct \n     by the federal government.\n\n  This conduct has raised such concern that both the Chairman of the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee and the Chairman of Senate the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee have held hearings and proposed \nlegislation to call Secretary Babbitt to task for his mismanagement of \nthese funds and his disregard for the rulings of a federal court. The \nSecretary's continued violation of his trust obligations to Indian \nTribes should serve as a wake-up call to all of us in the Senate. This \nis not the time to allow the Secretary to delegate to himself new, \nunauthorized, powers.\n  I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing \nTribal-State compacts. The amendment does not, in any way, prevent \nstates and Tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are \nwilling to agree on class III gambling on Tribal lands within a State's \nborders. This amendment does ensure that all stakeholders must be \ninvolved in the process--Congress, the Tribes, the States, and the \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming \nwould be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent \na lot of money. The even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a \nlot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the \nspokesman for the opposition. When we first got our meager organization \ntogether, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor \nof gambling. When the election was held casino gambling lost by over 62 \npercent--and it lost in every single county of our state. The 40 point \nswing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue \nand implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. That's a pretty solid \nmessage. We don't want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote \nin my state have debated it and made their choice. Any federal \nbureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will only inject \nanimosity.\n  Why did we have that decisive of a vote? We used a couple of our \nneighboring states to review the effects of\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\ntheir limited casino gambling. We found that a few people make an awful \nlot of money at the expense of everyone else. When casino gambling \ncomes into a state, communities are changed forever. And everyone \nagrees there are costs to the state. There are material costs, with a \nneed for new law enforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are \nsocial costs. And, not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but \nonce it is instituted, the revenues can be addictive too. But I'm not \nhere to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to \nmaintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative solution, \nrather than have a bureaucratic mandate.\n  Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society \nas a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A state's law \nenforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously \nimpacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. \nTherefore, a state's popularly elected representatives should have a \nsay in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on \nIndian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an \nunelected cabinet official. Passing the Graham-Enzi amendment will keep \nall the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all the \nparties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the time \nit needs to hear all the sides and work on legislation to fix any \nproblems that exist in the current system. I urge my colleagues to \nstand up for the constitutional role of Congress--and for the rights of \nall fifty states--by supporting this amendment.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye, may wish the opportunity to speak, and perhaps more likely \nwill wish the opportunity to put a statement in the Record. I don't \nbelieve that affects the proposition that the amendment will be \naccepted by voice vote. But I ask that we not take that voice vote at \nthis time, until we are apprised of the desires of the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  Under the circumstances, the Senator from Missouri being here, I ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized and that we set this amendment \naside to deal with another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1621\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1621.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, line 10, add the following before the period \n     ``:Provided, That within the funds available, $250,000 shall \n     be used to assess the potential hydrologic and biological \n     impact of lead and zinc mining in the Mark Twain National \n     Forest of Southern Missouri: Provided further, That none of \n     the funds in this Act may be used by the Secretary of the \n     Interior to issue a prospecting permit for hardrock mineral \n     exploration on Mark Twain National land in the Current River/\n     Jack's Fork River--Eleven Point Watershed (not including Mark \n     Twain National Forest land in Townships 31N and 32N, Range 2 \n     and Range 3 West, on which mining activities are taking place \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act): Provided further, \n     That none of the funds in this Act may be used by the \n     Secretary of the Interior to segregate or withdraw land in \n     the Mark Twain National Forest Missouri under section 204 of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1714)''\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment, as the manager has already \nstated, deals with a matter that was approved in the committee and was \ntaken out by a procedural move. The amendment requires a study of \nmining in the Mark Twain National Forest in south-central and southeast \nMissouri. It requires that it be conducted to address the scientific \ngaps identified by scientists in the Departments of the Interior, \nAgriculture, and others.\n  While the relevant information is collected, the amendment delays any \nprospecting or withdrawal decisions for the fiscal year.\n  This amendment is a commonsense amendment. It is a modern amendment. \nIt enables the full-blown process to go forward before any decisions \nare made.\n  This amendment does not permit mining. It does not permit \nexploration. It does not amend, weaken, or touch environmental \nstandards.\n  It prohibits exploration and withdrawal. It requires a scientific \nstudy of the scientific gaps identified by the agencies. It maintains \nthe NEPA requirement for full-blown environmental impact statements \nwhich any withdrawal by the Secretary would preclude.\n  This amendment preserves, as I said, the requirement of the full-\nblown NEPA process. And a full-blown impact statement will ultimately \ndictate whether any mining should or should not take place if an \napplication is made, if there are deposits of lead discovered.\n  By the time any mining could take place, Senator Thurmond might be \nthe only Senator remaining in this Chamber.\n  The amendment does not give miners their way who want clearance for \nprospecting now.\n  It does not give the zero-growth opponents their way. Contrary to \nprecedent and current law, they want no economic activity on these \npublic lands which are multiple-use lands in the State of Missouri.\n  Anyone who understands this issue understands that bulldozers are not \nready to roll, nor should they be. They don't even know yet what lead \nmight be available. There are too many unanswered questions to make a \nfinal decision. Regrettably, some on the extreme want to preclude an \nopportunity to answer those questions.\n  The fundamental question that this amendment addresses is whether \nsomeday, if we were to find lead in those areas, additional lead could \nbe mined safely in the State of Missouri. That is a critical question \nand that is one that should be answered by the scientists.\n  We are not here to legislate a decision and it should not be hijacked \nby administrative decree.\n  Some suggest that we know enough already to make what would be a \npermanent decision for the 1,800 miners who are under the gun for the \n10 counties in south Missouri that depend upon this mining. They say we \nknow enough already to prevent any further mining in an area which has \n90 percent of the domestic lead deposits. So we would export lead \nproduction overseas.\n  This past month I met with the bipartisan county commissioners, \nDemocrats and Republicans, who are elected by and responsible to the \npeople in the counties they serve. They make up the Scenic Rivers \nWatershed Partnership. They are closest to the issue. They have the \nmost at stake. They are the ones who represent the recreational \ninterests. They are the ones who represent the timber interests. They \nrepresent the forest interests. They represent the interests of schools \nand roads which depend upon the royalties that come from mining. And \nthey support this amendment. They said we must have a full-blown study.\n  There is a technical team that has been set up.\n  A multiagency technical team was established in 1988. It has the USDA \nForest Service, the National Park Service, EPA, U.S. Geological Survey \nWater Resources Division and the Geologic Division, the Mineral \nResources Division, the Mapping Division, the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources, and the Department of Conservation. It has the \nprivate companies involved; it has the University of Missouri, Rolla; \nand it has the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  What do these scientists and engineers who have begun the study say?\n  First, they say:\n\n       The technical team believes that there is insufficient \n     scientific information available to determine the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the Mark Twain \n     National Forest area. This is a consensus opinion that the \n     technical team has held from the beginning through the \n     present. Due to the lack of scientific information available \n     to assess the potential impacts of lead mining, the technical \n     team proposed that a comprehensive study be conducted.\n\n  That is contained in a letter to me dated July 30, 1999, from Charles \nG. Groat, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, the Office of the \nDirector, the\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior in Reston, VA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Geological Survey,\n\n                                  Reston, Virginia, July 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond:  This is in response to your letter of \n     July 20, 1999, to Mr. Jim Barks, related to mining in the \n     Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) area. In your letter, you \n     ask that we provide a brief and clear assessment as to the \n     quality of information that was compiled by the interagency \n     technical team charged with building a ``relevant database to \n     assess mining impacts and base future decisions.'' You ask \n     that we, ``specifically address the question as to the \n     adequacy and relevance of information currently available to \n     provide a solid scientific foundation for any decision to \n     justify either withdrawal or mining in the region.''\n       In 1988, an interagency technical team was assembled to \n     guide the identification, collection, and dissemination of \n     scientific information needed to assess the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. Since \n     1989, the team has been chaired by Bob Willis of the Forest \n     Service. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has actively \n     participated on the team from the beginning, with Mr. James \n     H. Barks, USGS Missouri State Representative, serving as our \n     representative.\n       The technical team believes that there is insufficient \n     scientific information available to determine the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. This is \n     a consensus opinion that the technical team has held from the \n     beginning through the present. Due to the lack of scientific \n     information available to assess the potential impacts of lead \n     mining, the technical team proposed that a comprehensive \n     study be conducted.\n       In January 1998 at the request of the technical team, the \n     USGS prepared a proposal for a multi-component scientific \n     study to address the primary questions about the potential \n     environmental impacts of lead mining in the MTNF area. Mr. \n     Barks provided a copy of the proposed study to Brian \n     Klippenstein of your staff at his request on July 9, 1999. \n     Neither a requirement for full environmental review to \n     support a Secretarial decision nor a source of funding has \n     been established. For these reasons the proposed study has \n     not been initiated.\n       Please let us know if we can provide additional information \n     or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles G. Groat,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is further backup and supportive \ninformation that I can provide. But, in summary, my amendment provides \nthe money for the research that the technical team says it needs, and \nit preserves the current rigorous environmental process which will take \nyears to complete. If lead is discovered, if it is economically viable, \nand if the company decides to develop a mining plan and apply for \nmineral production, then the whole process will have to start.\n  To vote for this amendment is to vote to let the scientists get what \nthey say is necessary to make an informed decision, and it is a \nconsensus of all of those agencies I outlined that they don't have the \ninformation. I think it is also a strong consensus of all the agencies \nthat we must protect the environmental resources of the region.\n  As one who has floated and fished on the streams in the Mark Twain \nNational Forest, I can tell you that it is a real gem. I flew over much \nof the area and I visited on foot much of the area in the last month. I \ncan tell you that it is a beautiful wilderness. But it is a multiple-\nuse area. It is used for recreation; it is used for timber; it is used \nfor mining. We flew over some 160 exploratory drilling sites. But you \ndon't see them because they grow back. As a matter of fact, I had my \npicture taken in one of the exploratory sites.\n  There is an exploratory site 2 years after the exploration stopped. \nIt is growing back. In another few years you won't even be able to tell \nit is there.\n  That is why the scientists said that exploratory drilling has no \nimpact. So it is not even an issue. It has no environmental impact. \nThat is not a problem.\n  There are those who do not live in the area who say that no economic \nuse can be made. But I believe that for the good of the country, for \nthe good of the area, to satisfy our needs, to provide the work for \n1,800 miners in the area, to provide the support for the schools, for \nthe communities, for the roads and infrastructure in the area, we must \nfollow the long established, rigorous evaluation process designed to \nallow environmentally acceptable activities and prohibit those that \nwould be adverse to the environment.\n  If you listen to the scientists, as we have, you know that it takes \nmore information than is currently available to make that \ndetermination. These questions deserve to be answered before we mine, \nor before we slam the door in the face of the regions' residents and \nforce our country to become exclusively reliant on foreign sources of \nthis vital mineral.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is a commonsense \namendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1577\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I was off the floor. What is the pending \nbusiness? Are we going back to the Graham amendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now on Senator Bond's amendment. We \nleft the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent to return to the Graham \namendment so that I may speak in opposition to it for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I don't think anyone has more disagreement with Secretary Babbitt \nthan I do as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. Certainly Indian \ntrust funds have been an issue on which we have been at odds for \nliterally months with the Secretary. In addition to that, as a member \nof the Energy Committee, I have had my disagreements with him on \ngrazing, water, and many other things, too. But there are at least four \nreasons to oppose this amendment.\n  I hope my friend, the Senator from Florida, will consider withdrawing \nit.\n  First, after the Supreme Court decided in Seminole v. Florida that \nIndian tribes cannot sue States for unwillingness to negotiate Indian \ngaming agreements, it created a terrific problem, as many Members know. \nWe have spent a considerable amount of time in our committee, with me \nas the chairman of that Committee on Indian Affairs, looking for ways \nthat States and tribes can come to some consensus.\n  We have a pending bill, S. 985. We have worked on it very hard. We \nwant the legislative process to proceed. The Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct requires tribes to have compacts before they can operate class III \ngaming. Right now, unfortunately, the States hold all the cards since \nthe court decided the States do not have to negotiate in good faith.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is now in Federal court over his \nability to issue the kind of procedures that this amendment seeks to \nstop. As the Senator from Florida probably knows, these procedures can \nonly be put into effect if they are published in the Federal Register. \nThe States of Alabama and Florida have sued the Secretary of the \nInterior if this case moves ahead in the courts. It is in the interest \nof all parties, States and tribes, for the United States to allow the \ncourts to decide once and for all if the Secretary has this authority.\n  I point out, the House has already rejected a similar amendment. I \nhave a letter dated August 2 from the Secretary of the Interior. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As you know, a floor amendment has \n     been submitted for intended action on the FY 2000 Interior \n     appropriations bill which would preclude the Department from \n     expending any funds to implement the Indian gaming regulation \n     published in the Federal Register on April 12, 1999. The \n     question of our authority to promulgate that regulation is in \n     litigation in the Northern District of Florida in a case \n     brought by the States of Florida and Alabama. I urge you to \n     oppose the amendments in recognition of the fact that the \n     matter is now in the courts, and we have agreed to refrain \n     from implementing the regulation in any specific case until \n     the federal district court has an opportunity to rule on the \n     merits of the legal issues. We believe that this matter is \n     best dealt with by the courts and we are eager for a judicial \n     resolution.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n       The regulation will have narrow application. It applies, by \n     its terms, only (1) when an Indian Tribe and a State have \n     failed to reach voluntary agreement on a tribal-state gaming \n     compact; and (2) when a State successfully asserts its \n     Eleventh Amendment immunity from a tribal lawsuit and thus \n     avoids the mediation process expressly provided in the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act. The regulation will be implemented on \n     a case-by-case basis, controlled by the facts and law \n     applicable to each situation. As noted above, we are already \n     in litigation in federal court in Florida over the lawfulness \n     of the regulation.\n       In a letter dated May 11, 1999, I explained our concern \n     that we do not think a legal challenge to the regulation is \n     ``ripe'' for adjudication until the Department had actually \n     issued ``procedures'' under it. Since that time, we have \n     sought to dismiss a legal challenge on ripeness grounds. We \n     intend to go forward with processing tribal applications \n     under our regulation and to issue ``procedures'' if they are \n     warranted. It is important to note that any such \n     ``procedures'' become affective only when published in the \n     Federal Register. As noted above, we have agreed to refrain \n     from publishing any procedures until the federal district \n     court has an opportunity to rule on the merits of the legal \n     issues.\n       The House of Representatives rejected an amendment that \n     would have precluded implementation of the rule and I hope \n     that the full Senate will do the same. As you know, in the \n     past, I have recommended that the President veto legislation \n     containing similar provisions.\n       Thank you for your assistance on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In that letter, the Secretary indicates the final rule \nwill not be implemented and no tribal agreements will be authorized \nuntil the courts decide the real issue of whether he has authority to \nissue these procedures. That may take several years.\n  I ask the legislative process proceed and we not short circuit it \nwith this amendment. I ask the Senator from Florida to withdraw that \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senators from Florida and Wyoming, Mr. \nGraham and Mr. Enzi. This is an amendment that prevents the Interior \nDepartment from implementing new regulations that seriously threaten \nthe rights of States to regulate gaming activities within their \nborders.\n  This amendment reinstates the prohibition on the Secretary of the \nInterior, which expired on March 31, from approving casino gaming on \nIndian land in the absence of a tribal-State compact. A similar \nprovision was adopted unanimously by the Senate as part of the fiscal \nyear 1998 Interior appropriations bill as well as the fiscal year 1999 \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nenacted in 1988 divides Indian gaming into three categories. The \namendment offered for consideration on the Senate floor today addresses \nthe conduct of class III gaming; that is, casino gaming, slot machines, \nvideo poker, and other casino-type games.\n  Under IGRA, the Congress very clearly intended to authorize Indian \ntribes to enjoy and to participate in gaming activities within their \nrespective States to the same extent as a matter of public policy that \nthe State confers gaming opportunities generally to the State.\n  There are two clear extremes. In one case, we have the States of Utah \nand Hawaii. Those are the only two of the 50 States that I am aware of \nthat permit no form of Indian gaming. It is very clear that because \nthose two States as a matter of public policy confer no gaming \nopportunities upon its citizenry, Indian tribes in Utah and Hawaii have \nno ability to conduct gaming activities within the class III \ndescription, the so-called casino-type games.\n  Equally clear at the other end of the spectrum is my home State of \nNevada. Nevada has embraced casino gaming since 1931. It is equally \nclear in Nevada law that the Indian tribes in my own State are entitled \nto a full range of casino gaming. Indeed, compacts have been introduced \nto accomplish that purpose.\n  Under IGRA, the class III gaming activity is lawful on Indian lands \nonly if three conditions are made:\n  No. 1, there is an authorized ordinance adopted by the governing body \nof a tribe and approved by the Chairman of the National Gaming Indian \nCommission;\n  No. 2, located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by \nany person, organization, or entity--I want to return to that because \nthat is the key here--located in a State that permits such gaming for \nany purpose by any person, organization, or entity.\n  No. 3, are conducted in conformance with a tribal-State compact.\n  As I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair fully understands, \nthe implementation of IGRA requires that compact be negotiated and \nentered into between the Governor of the State and the tribe within \nthat State that is seeking to conduct class III activity. When IGRA was \nenacted in 1988, Congress was careful to create a balance between State \nand tribal interests. One of the fundamental precepts of IGRA is that \nStates and tribes must negotiate agreements or compacts that delineate \nthe scope of permissible gaming activities available to the \ntribes. Again, the intent of IGRA is clear and I support its concept. \nVery simply stated: To the extent that a State authorizes certain \ngaming activity as a matter of public policy within the boundaries of \nthat State, Indian tribes located within that State should have the \nsame opportunity. There is no fundamental disagreement about that.\n\n  However, a situation has arisen in a number of States in which Indian \ntribes have tried to force Governors to negotiate extended gaming \nactivities that are not authorized or permitted by law within that \nState; for example, a State that may authorize only a lottery might be \npressed by a tribe to permit slot machines--clearly something that IGRA \ndid not contemplate. It is in that area that we have had some very \nserious disagreements.\n  The new Interior Department regulations destroy the compromise that \nis reflected in IGRA. It is in my view a blatant attempt by the \nSecretary to rewrite the law without congressional approval. The rule \nthat has been promulgated allows the Secretary to prescribe \n``procedures'' which the Interior Department characterizes as a legal \nsubstitute for a tribal-State compact, in the event a State asserts an \n11th amendment sovereign immunity defense to a suit brought by a tribe \nclaiming a State has not negotiated in good faith.\n  The effect of this rule for all intents and purposes nullifies the \nState's constitutionally guaranteed sovereign immunity by allowing the \nSecretary of the Interior to become a substitute Federal court that can \nhear the dispute brought by the tribe against the State. Ironically, \nthe new rule permits a tribe to sue based on any stalemate brought \nabout by its own unreasonable demands on the State, such as insisting \non gaming activities that violate that State's law.\n  I support this amendment because I believe, as do the Governors and \nthe States Attorney General, that the Secretary does not possess the \nlegal authority he has sought to grant to himself under this rule, and \nthat statutory modifications to IGRA are necessary in order to resolve \na State's sovereign immunity claim.\n  In a letter to the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the \nNation's Governors stated they strongly believe that no statute or \ncourt decision provides the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nInterior with the authority to intervene in disputes over compacts \nbetween Indian tribes and States about casino gambling on Indian lands. \nIn light of this strongly held view, the States of Florida and Alabama \nhave already filed suit against the Secretary to declare the new rule \nultra vires.\n  The most troubling aspect of the new rule is that the Secretary of \nthe Interior grants himself the sole authority to provide for casino \ngaming on Indian lands in the absence of the tribal-State compact.\n  As a former Governor, I appreciate the States' concern with the \ninherent conflict of interest of the Secretary in resolving a major \npublic policy issue between a State and Indian tribe while also \nmaintaining his overall trust responsibility to the tribe.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the Secretary of the Interior would \nin effect be the arbiter where a dispute arose between the tribe and \nthe Governor in which the tribe was asserting a claim to have more \ngaming activity than is lawfully permitted in the State. The Secretary \nof the Interior, who\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nholds a trust responsibility to the tribe, would in effect be making \nthe determination in that State as to what kind of gaming activity \nwould be permitted. I cannot imagine something that is a more flagrant \nviolation of a State's sovereignty and its ability, as a matter of \npublic policy, to circumscribe the type of gaming activity permitted. \nThe States have asserted a wide variety of these. Some States, as I \nindicated earlier, provide for no gaming activity at all. Others \nprovide for a full range of casino gaming, as does my own State. Other \nStates permit lotteries. Still others authorize certain types of card \ngames. Others permit a variation of horse or dogtrack racing, both on- \nand off-track.\n\n  So a State faces the real possibility, under this rule, if it is not \ninvalidated--and I believe legally it has no force and effect, but we \nwant to make sure this amendment prohibits the attempt of the Secretary \nto implement it--in effect, the Secretary of the Interior would have \nthe ability to set public policy among the respective States as to what \ntype of gaming activities could occur on Indian reservations within \nthose States. We are talking now about class III casino gaming. Even \nthough a State Governor and the legislature and the people of that \nState may have determined, as a matter of public policy, that they want \na very limited form of gaming--a lottery or racetrack betting at the \ntrack as opposed to off-track--the Secretary would have the ability, \nwhen a tribe asserted more than the State's law permitted, to, in \neffect, resolve that. I cannot think of anything that is more violative \nof a fundamental States rights issue in terms of its sovereignty and \nits ability as a matter of public policy to make that determination.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that statutory changes to IGRA are \nin order, in light of recent court decisions. I am hopeful that \nCongress will see fit to reassert its lawmaking authority in this area \nby reexamining IGRA, rather than sitting on the sidelines while the \nSecretary of the Interior performs that task.\n  But, in the meantime, it is imperative that the Congress prohibit the \nSecretary from approving class III gaming procedures without State \napproval. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the \ncarefully crafted amendment by my colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, and Senator Enzi from Wyoming--an amendment to preserve the \nrole for States in the conduct of gaming on Indian lands.\n  It is fair, it is balanced, and it is reasonable. It is consistent \nwith the overall intent of IGRA, which was adopted in 1988 by the \nCongress, to permit class III gaming activities when the three \nconditions which I have enumerated are met, ultimately with a compact \nnegotiated by the Governor and the tribe within that State. In the \nabsence of such an agreement, the Secretary of the Interior must not be \nallowed to determine that State's public policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is still the opinion of the managers \nthat this amendment is likely to be accepted by voice vote. We still \nhaven't directly heard from the Senator from Hawaii, however, who may \nbe nearby. I hope when he finishes we can cast such a vote.\n  We have heard, on the other hand, the senior Senator from Illinois \nwishes to speak against the Lott amendment proposed for him by Senator \nBond and will ask for a vote on that. So we will await his presence and \nhis speech on that subject before there is any attempt to bring that \namendment to a vote. But for all other Members with the other 64 \namendments, now that we have started to deal with two of them, we would \ncertainly appreciate their coming to the floor and showing a \nwillingness to debate. The Democratic manager, Senator Byrd, and I are \ncertainly going to be happy to grant unanimous consent to move off of \none amendment and onto another, I am sure, to keep the debate going \nwith the hope of making progress on the bill.\n  With that, however, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, the \nmanager of the bill, in urging Senators to come to the floor and debate \nthese amendments. It is my understanding, as it is his, that the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, wishes to speak \nagainst the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBond, and he will certainly have that opportunity.\n  I trust the offices of Senators--I am sure they are watching and \nlistening--will pass on to the respective Senators this urgent message \nthat we are trying to state here, that we are here, we are here to \ndiscuss amendments, debate them, agree to them, vote them down, vote \nthem up, amend them further, or whatever. But Senators need to come to \nthe floor and make their wishes known so that this valuable time will \nnot be lost. So I urge our Senators to act accordingly.\n  Now I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, with the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom Florida, I rise in opposition to the amendments he proposes to the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  As similar amendments have done in prior years, this amendment seeks \nto prevent Indian tribal governments from engaging in activities that \nhave been authorized by the U.S. Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  My colleagues know well that there has been a serious impasse in the \noperation of federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act--IGRA--since \n1996.\n  In that year, the Supreme Court concluded that the means by which \ntribal governments could have recourse to the Federal courts if a State \nrefused to negotiate for a tribal-State compact violated the states' \neleventh amendment immunity to suit.\n  Thus, while there are presently over 128 tribal-State compacts as \nmany as 24 States, in those States where tribal-State compact \nnegotiations had not been brought to fruition by 1996, the Court's \nruling gave those States a trump card in the negotiations.\n  Those States--and there are only a few--now had a means of avoiding \ncompliance with the Federal law altogether. They could refuse to \nnegotiate any further, or refuse to negotiate at all, with the \nknowledge that tribal governments had no remedy at law and no recourse \nto the Federal courts.\n  We have tried to address this matter through legislation, and indeed, \nthe chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, currently has a bill pending in the Senate which specifically \naddresses this matter and establishes a process for resolving this \nimpasse.\n  In the interim, the Secretary of the Interior has stepped into the \nbreach--first by soliciting public comment on his authority to \npromulgate regulations for an alternative process if tribal-State \ncompact negotiations should fail, and then by following the \nadministrative procedures to assure that everyone with an interest had \nan opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.\n  That was the open and public and well above-board process that was \nfollowed, and it seems to me only fair that if a State refuses to \nnegotiate with a tribal government,--that there be some other means by \nwhich an indian government can secure its right under Federal law to \nconduct gaming activities.\n  Mr. President, if there were a proponent of this amendment that could \ntell us what equitable alternative they would propose for those tribal \ngovernments that will be directly affected by this amendment, I would \ngive that alternative my earnest consideration.\n  But all that I see going on here is an effort to assure that the \nwindfall enjoyed by those States that had not entered into compacts by \n1996, never have to do so.\n  I suggest that if what we are about here is to render the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act a nullity, then let's be direct and forthright \nabout it.\n  Let's repeal the Federal law.\n  Let's have the Supreme Court's ruling in Cabazon be the order of the \nday and of every day to come.\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n  I, for one, will not be party to this obvious effort on the part of \nsome States to evade the mandates of the Federal law.\n  There is nothing constructive being advanced today. There is no \neffort to assure some balance in the positions of the respective \nsovereigns, tribal and State governments, and as such, I must strongly \nand respectfully oppose the adoption of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the following statement was ordered \nprinted in the Record:\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator Graham, in offering \nthis important amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Interior \nappropriations legislation. This is an amendment that should be \nsupported by anyone who is concerned about the issue of gambling, and \nwho also believes that the Federal Government often goes too far in \nexerting its will on the individual States. I think that the amendment \nwe offer today, which will prohibit taxpayers money from being expended \nto implement the final rule published on April 12, 1999 at 64 Federal \nRegister 17535, is an important amendment because if it passes it will \nprohibit the Secretary of the Interior from unilaterally approving the \nexpansion of casino gambling on Tribal land throughout this country, \nincluding States, like Alabama, in which a Class III gambling compact \nhas not previously been negotiated.\n  Allow me to briefly share some of my thoughts on the importance of \nthis amendment. As Attorney General of Alabama, I cosigned a letter \nwith 25 other Attorneys General that was sent to the Secretary of the \nInterior in regards to his promulgation of the rule we seek to block \ntoday. Every Attorney General who signed that letter shared the opinion \nthat the Secretary of the Interior did not have the legal authority to \ntake action to promulgate regulations which gave him the authority to \nallow casino gambling in this manner. In fact, I previously warned the \nSecretary that if he attempted to implement this rule, he would \nimmediately be sued by States throughout this country in direct \nchallenge to these regulations, resulting in a terrible waste of \nresources on both the State and Federal level. Unfortunately, my \nprediction has come true, as the States of Florida and Alabama have \nfiled suit to block the implementation of this rule.\n  This is an important issue for my State, which has a federally \nrecognized tribe and which has not entered into a tribal-State gambling \ncompact. Alabama's citizens have repeatedly rejected attempts to allow \ncasino gambling to occur within our State. However, under the rules \nthat the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated, he has given \nhimself the authority to unilaterally decide whether tribes within the \nState will be allowed to open casinos, regardless of the opinion of the \nState itself, despite his obvious conflict of interest, and even in the \nabsence of any bad faith on the part of the States. I fail to see how \nthe Secretary of the Interior can cede himself the authority to make \nthis determination for the people of Alabama. Allow me to quote two \npoints from the legal analysis prepared by the States of Florida and \nAlabama which highlight these issues:\n  The States of Florida and Alabama point out in their lawsuit that \n``under IGRA, an Indian tribe is entitled to nothing other than the \nexpectation that a State will negotiate in good faith. If an impasse is \nreached in good faith under the statute, the Tribe has no alternative \nbut to go back to the negotiating table and work out a deal. The rules \nsignificantly change this by removing any necessity for a finding that \na State has failed to negotiate in good faith. The trigger in the rule \nwould allow secretarial procedures in the case where no compact is \nreached within 180 days and the State imposes its Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.''\n  Additionally the States' challenge points out the problems associated \nwith the Secretary of Interior's conflict of interest. In their \nargument the States point out that ``the rules at issue here arrogate \nto the Secretary the power to decide factual and legal disputes between \nStates and Indian Tribes related to those rights. Pursuant to 25 USC \nSection 2 and Section 9, the Secretary of the Interior stands in a \ntrust relationship to the Indian tribes of this nation. The rules set \nup the Secretary, who is the Tribes' trustee and therefore has an \nirreconcilable conflict of interest as the judge of these disputes. \nTherefore, the rules, on their face, deny the States due process and \nare invalid.''\n  Both of these points help to illustrate just how badly flawed the \nregulation proposed by the Secretary of the Interior is, and help \nunderscore why Congress should be vigilant in ensuring it cannot be \nutilized.\n  Why is this issue so important to my State? Because in giving himself \nthe ability to decide whether to allow tribal Class III gambling in a \nState, the Secretary of Interior has given himself the ability to \nimpose great social and economic burdens on local communities \nthroughout Alabama. Let me share with you a letter that the mayor of \nWetumpka, Jo Glenn, whose community is home to property owned by a \ntribe, wrote me in reference to the undue burdens her town would face \nif the Secretary were to step in and authorize casino gambling. Mayor \nGlenn writes:\n\n       Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could \n     not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. \n     The demand for greater social services that comes to areas \n     around gambling facilities could not be adequately funded. \n     Please once again convey to Secretary Babbitt our city's \n     strong and adamant opposition to the establishment of an \n     Indian Gambling facility here.\n\n  Mayor Glenn's concerns have been seconded by other communities. Let \nme share with you an editorial that appeared in the Montgomery \nAdvertiser in regards to regulations being discussed today. The \nAdvertiser wrote:\n\n       Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State \n     involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy handed imposition \n     of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow \n     gambling here is too significant a decision economically, \n     politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive \n     State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the \n     others that would undoubtedly follow in other parts of the \n     State--has implications far too great to allow the critical \n     decisions to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a \n     hand in this high stakes game.\n\n  Mr. President, the States of Alabama and Florida were correct to \nchallenge this regulatory proposal, and the writers of the above quoted \nletter and editorial were correct when they voiced their objections to \nit. We should not allow the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate \nrules giving himself the authority to impose drastic economic, \npolitical and social costs on our local communities, and we should take \nsteps now to ensure that he is unable to do so. I urge my colleagues' \nsupport for the Graham-Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 12, 1999, Thomas Jefferson must \nhave turned over in his grave. That Monday, the Secretary of the \nInterior promulgated a regulation which had the potential to \nunilaterally strip the duly elected Governors of America of their \ndecision-making authority on the issue of casino gambling.\n  That day, the Secretary published regulations that would circumvent \nthe State-tribal compact negotiation process by allowing tribes to \napply directly to the Department of Interior for the approval of Class \nIII gaming. If the Secretary determines that the State and tribe have \nnot been able to reach an agreement, he, alone, can grant the tribes \nthe authority to engage in Class III gaming.\n  Class III gaming is the sort of gambling you might find in Atlantic \nCity or Las Vegas--blackjack, slot machines, craps, roulette.\n  It's an old story, Mr. President: Washington knows best. But in an \nera when we have correctly determined that political decisions are best \nmade at the State and local level, this complete abrogation of States' \nrights is particularly outrageous. Today, Senator Enzi and I are taking \nsteps to reverse the Interior Department's power grab. Our amendment to \nthe Interior Appropriations bill would preserve the fundamental right \nof every State to decide whether or not it wants Class III Indian \ngaming within its borders. It would block these efforts to unilaterally \napprove tribal casino-style gambling applications by prohibiting the \nuse of Department of Interior funds for the implementation of the \nSecretary's final rule.\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\n  The final rule publication on April 12 is fraught with long-term \nconsequences. If we allow the long-standing tribal-State negotiation \nprocess to be bypassed, we will undermine a dialogue which has promoted \ngreater understanding between both parties in the negotiation of gaming \ncompacts.\n  This amendment does not limit the ability of tribes to obtain Class \nIII casino-style gambling provided that tribes and States enter into \nvalid compacts pursuant to existing law.\n  But even more importantly, Department of Interior's action calls into \nquestion the basic right of States to make decisions that are in the \nbest interest of their residents. In the State of Florida, our \nConstitution prohibits this sort of gambling, and in 1978, 1986, and \n1994, Floridians overwhelmingly rejected casino gambling in three \nseparate statewide referendums. State and local law enforcement \nofficials are equally vehement in their opposition.\n  Mr. President, our amendment has the support of the National \nGovernors Association, National Association of Attorneys General, \nNational League of Cities, and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures.\n  Four times in the past three years, an amendment similar to this one \nhas been offered in the Senate, and all four times it has been \naccepted. Should it fail this time, the Interior Department will have \nunfettered power to grant Class III gaming compacts over State \nobjections, even in State where casino gambling is against State law, \nincluding in States like Florida, where casino gambling is prohibited \nby the State constitution.\n  This amendment neither affects existing tribal-State compacts nor \namends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It does protect States' rights \nand ensures that elected State leaders--not unelected Federal \nofficials--have the right to negotiate gaming compacts based on public \nsentiment.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Enzi, our cosponsors, and \nmyself in supporting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as far as I know, that concludes debate on \nthe Graham-Enzi amendment. As far as I know, Members are willing to \naccept a voice vote on the amendment. So unless someone else rises, I \nsuggest the President put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1577.\n  The amendment (No. 1577) was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the purpose of issuing a \n  notice of rulemaking with respect to the valuation of crude oil for \n               royalty purposes until September 30, 2000)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), for herself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, \n     Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1603.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL FOR ROYALTY PURPOSES.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to issue a notice of final rulemaking with respect to the \n     valuation of crude oil for royalty purposes (including a \n     rulemaking derived from proposed rules published at 62 Fed. \n     Reg. 3742 (January 24, 1997), 62 Fed. Reg. 36030 (July 3, \n     1997), and 63 Fed. Reg. 6113 (1998)) until September 30, \n     2000.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nShelby be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on my behalf, \nand in addition to Senator Shelby, Senators Domenici, Lott, Nickles, \nBreaux, Murkowski, and Landrieu.\n  This amendment will continue an existing provision that will prevent \nthe Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, MMS, from \nimplementing an overreaching and unwise new oil royalty valuation \nsystem. This moratorium was adopted by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee and continues the same restrictions that have been passed by \nthe Senate and the House and signed by the President three times \npreviously.\n  I add that it has been bipartisan, and the initial moratorium and its \nsubsequent extensions have been supported by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, and the same is true on the House side. This will be the \nfourth time that Congress will have to act to stop this action by the \nMinerals Management Service. I regret that, and I wish there did not \nhave to be a first time. But this moratorium is absolutely necessary in \norder to stop the MMS from overriding its regulatory authority by \nimposing a backdoor tax on the production of oil from Federal leases.\n  We have heard about judges legislating from the bench. This is, I \nthink, legislating from the cubicle. This new rule violates both the \nlanguage and the intent of Federal law governing the assessment and \ncollection of Federal royalties from oil and gas drawn from Federal \nlands in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Everyone agrees the existing rules are too complex and burdensome, \nand Congress and the industry groups had welcomed a revision of the \nrules. But the proposed rule 3 years ago which MMS announced without \nprior notice to Congress could impose even more costly regulations on \noil producers and effectively enact a royalty rate hike or tax increase \nwhich the agency simply does not have the authority to do. While the \nlarger oil companies might be able to absorb these costs, hundreds of \nsmall independent producers probably will not. This new rule hits them \nat a time when they are still reeling from the historically low oil \nprices we have seen lately.\n  Anyone who has any kind of oil production in their States knows that \nhundreds of thousands of oil-related jobs in our country have gone out \nof existence in the last 6 months. We all know that oil prices went \ndown to $10 a barrel. We have not seen that in this country for 40 \nyears. We know that small independent producers had to go out of \nbusiness, thus throwing hundreds of thousands of people off the \npayroll.\n  In addition, there are two recent developments that justify more than \never before the extension of the moratorium. First, the MMS itself says \nit needs more time to review its rule; second, a serious ethical and \nlegal question has recently been raised about the rulemaking process.\n  Earlier this year, the Minerals Management Service did reopen the \ncomment period for their rule for 30 days. During that period of time, \nthey received extensive comments dealing with the many facets of this \nissue, and they have not yet finished reviewing and considering those \ncomments.\n  Because they have held workshops and various oil industry \nrepresentatives and others interested in this issue have been able to \nmeet together, it is going to take time for the agency to digest the \ninput they have. I hope there is a window in which the Minerals \nManagement Service will be able to sit down and come up with something \nthat is fair and will not put more of our oil industry jobs off the \nbooks and into foreign countries.\n  Remember, today we import more than 50 percent of the oil needs of \nour country. We are certainly not doing anything to help our own oil \nindustry keep oil jobs in America, and it is a security risk to any \ncountry that cannot produce 50 percent of its energy needs.\n  I think everything we can do to keep this industry strong is a \nsecurity issue for our country, and it is certainly a jobs issue.\n  Unfortunately, extending the moratorium through the next fiscal year \nis the only way we are going to be able to get this agency to produce a \nworkable\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\nrule that stays within the bounds of the law. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  In fact, I want our oil industry to pay its fair share of royalties \nto the people of our country. Our taxpayers deserve that. That is \nexactly what we are trying to do with the MMS. But the MMS has been \nvery heavy handed, and they act as if businesses going out of existence \nis preferable to having a fair royalty rate in which the industry would \npay its fair share and we would keep jobs in America.\n  Several of my colleagues and I strongly urged MMS to sit down with \nMembers of Congress and industry representatives to discuss these \nissues. It did so last year. Some progress was made, and I thought we \nwere coming toward a compromise. Unfortunately, the Department of the \nInterior brought the progress to an abrupt halt. The only way we will \nbe able to sit down with the agency is if there is a moratorium until \nthere is a satisfactory resolution of this issue by the MMS and the \nMembers of Congress who are interested in keeping oil jobs in America.\n  In addition, I and other Members of Congress only recently became \naware of a situation that, frankly, calls the entire rulemaking process \ninto serious question. This spring it was revealed that a self-\nproclaimed government watchdog group called Project on Government \nOversight, or POGO, gave $350,000 each to two Federal officials: One at \nthe Department of the Interior and the other at the Department of \nEnergy, apparently in connection with their work on the royalty \nvaluation issue.\n  This matter is presently under criminal investigation at the \nDepartment of Justice, and it is the subject of an investigation by the \nDepartment of the Interior's inspector general. Until these \ninvestigations are complete, the prudent course would be for the \nInterior Department to take a voluntary action to suspend its plan to \nfinalize the new royalty valuation rule. Unfortunately, the Department \nhas indicated it is not willing to do this. I can't imagine an agency \nthat has admitted or at least acknowledged that one of its employees in \nthis rulemaking process took $350,000 as part of a payment in a lawsuit \nfrom this government watchdog organization, and the agency is not even \nwilling to say we should call a moratorium on this whole process until \nwe get to the bottom of this. That is why, when things such as this \nhappen, people don't trust their Government.\n  I can't imagine the Interior Department not volunteering to take this \naction and sit down with us and make sure that this rulemaking process \nhas integrity.\n  The Interior Department's proposed rule defies the law and the intent \nof Congress. This disregard for the law is what is at the heart of our \nobjection to the proposed new rule, not the $11 million the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the proposed rule will generate \nin new income for the agency.\n  Federal law requires for purposes of royalty payments the value of \noil drawn from Federal land is to be assessed at the wellhead; that is, \nwhen the oil is drawn from the ground. The MMS, however, continues to \ntry to assess the value of the oil away from the wellhead, after the \noil has been transported, processed, and marketed, each of which must \noccur before the oil can be sold. In effect, the MMS is trying to get a \nfree ride on these costs rather than allowing companies to deduct them \nfrom the price they ultimately receive for the oil. So you are asking \npeople to pay a tax on their cost of doing business. That does not make \neconomic sense. It certainly doesn't pass the fairness question.\n  There isn't any question that the existing system of computing \nFederal oil royalties is overly complex. No one disputes that. Under \nthe current system, oil producers are often unclear as to what their \nroyalty payments are supposed to be, and even the MMS is often at a \nloss as to what they are owed. But rather than propose a simpler method \nof ascertaining royalty payments, the MMS has proposed an even more \ncomplex and protracted litigation over just what the new rule requires.\n  While the proposed rule could bring in increased Federal revenues, \nthe increased payments could also be eaten up by the need to hire an \narmy of new Federal auditors to ensure compliance with the complex new \nsystem. Furthermore, if companies decide not to go forward with their \ndrilling because they can't make any kind of profit, there will be no \nrevenue to the schoolchildren in our country because there will be no \noil royalty extracted from those companies. So the new rule is going to \nbe a regulatory thicket that really is not going to help the situation, \nwhich is the problem of a too complex regulation today.\n  Let me also emphasize this amendment has nothing to do with the \nentirely separate issue of whether or not any particular oil company \nhas paid the royalties it owes under the existing system.\n  I have heard a lot of rhetoric on this issue. I have heard my \ncolleagues talk about the lawsuits and the settlements and companies \nthat haven't paid their fair share. If any oil company has not paid its \nfair share under the existing regulation, I want it to be prosecuted. I \nwant it to have to pay. That is not an issue in this regulation. The \nonly issue before us today is what is going to be the oil royalty \nvaluation process and is Congress going to have the right to raise \ntaxes or is an unelected bureaucrat who is not accountable going to \nhave that right.\n  Federal land and the mineral resources within that land belong to us \nall. Proper royalties must be paid for the right to extract those \nresources. Since 1953, those payments have totaled over $58 billion. \nThat is what we have collected in oil royalties. But enforcement of the \nlaw and writing the law are two separate things. The MMS seems to have \nforgotten that it is the responsibility of Congress, not the government \nbureaucrats, to determine what the royalty is. That is why we must \ncontinue this moratorium until Congress says this is the right \napproach.\n  The new rule imposes upon Federal lease producers a duty to market \ntheir oil without allowing the cost to be deducted. Oil does not sell \nitself. There are overhead costs associated with listing the oil for \nsale, locating buyers, facilitating the sale, and then ensuring that \nthe oil is delivered to that buyer. Federal law and existing \nregulations only require that the lessee place the oil in marketable \ncondition; that is, that the oil is ready to be sold by removing water \nand other impurities from it. But lessees are allowed, under current \nlaw, to deduct the costs associated with transporting and marketing the \noil.\n  The new rule, as contained in the MMS' own explanation, states that \nthe producers must market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee \nand the lessor. This, then, would mean producers would no longer be \nallowed to deduct these costs in order to arrive at true wellhead \nvalue, as called for by Federal law. There is no other way to slice it. \nThis constitutes a backdoor royalty rate hike; in effect, a tax \nincrease on Federal lands producers.\n  Secondly, the MMS rule would not allow for the proper deduction of \ntransportation costs. Oil producers typically have to bear the cost of \ntransporting the oil to the buyer, either by pipeline or truck. \nPresently, those costs are determined by using a methodology recognized \nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has regulatory \nauthority over interstate oil pipelines. So the new MMS rule would \nactually reject the Federal Government's own cost guidelines and impose \na new, untested system for determining transportation costs.\n  So it comes down to a simple decision: Do we want unelected \nbureaucrats enacting policy with regard to our Federal lands, or do we \nwant Congress to establish these policies? There have been other bills \nintroduced that would deal with this issue. I hope we can come to an \nagreement. But I don't think we can forget what has happened to the oil \nindustry over the last 2 years. In fact, this is coming at a time when \noil and gas production in our country is at an all-time low. In March \nof this year, we saw oil prices in parts of our country going down to \neven $7 or $8 a barrel.\n  While the price of oil has since begun to come back up--and today \nstands at about $20 a barrel--the impacts of a year and a half price \ncrash are reverberating throughout the United States. Since the price \nof oil first fell in late 1997, over 200,000 oil and gas wells have \nbeen shut down. Most of these, of\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\ncourse, were the low-yield marginal or ``stripper'' wells that will \nnever again be opened because it is not economically feasible to do it.\n  In March of this year, crude oil production in the lower 48 States \nfell to 4.8 million barrels per day, the lowest level in 50 years. The \nnumber of oil rigs in service in the United States fell to just over \n100 for the last week in July, the lowest number in service since \nrecords have ever been kept.\n  During this time, foreign oil imports rose steadily and now account \nfor 57 percent of consumption, well above the 36 percent import level \nwe saw during the 1974 oil embargo that nearly shut down the American \neconomy.\n  The oil crisis has also had a devastating impact on American jobs. \nSince November 1997, we have lost over 67,000 jobs just in the \nexploration and production sectors of this industry, which represents \n20 percent of the total number of jobs in this field. In January 1999 \nalone, 11,500 oil and gas jobs were lost. If one looks back to 1981, \nthe numbers are even more alarming: Over half a million good-paying \nAmerican jobs have been lost in the oil and gas industry.\n  There are those who would say this is going to hurt our \nschoolchildren, that they are not going to get the revenues from our \npublic lands. This is very important in my home State. There are dozens \nof school districts that rely heavily on oil production; property taxes \nfall with the price of oil. Statewide school districts will collect an \nestimated $154 million less in revenues this year than last. That is \n$154 million worth of teachers' salaries, books, computers, you name \nit. That is what we are talking about in Texas when we talk about the \nimpact of oil on education.\n  So if we are going to hit the oil business again, what is it going to \ndo to the schoolchildren of our country? Is it going to take another \n$154 million hit in my State? Do you know that they had to let teachers \noff in midyear in many counties in Texas because they didn't have the \nmoney because of oil companies going out of business and having no \nincome whatsoever? So when my colleagues say the schoolchildren are \ngoing to lose $60 million, perhaps, in California alone, I point my \ncolleagues' attention to the fact that we have lost $154 million this \nyear in Texas, and we are cutting teachers off in midyear and shutting \ndown schools because our oil industry is on its knees.\n\n  During 1998, while the average yield for stocks in the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average was a positive 18 percent, the yield for oil and gas \nstocks was a negative 36 percent. So what does that do to the elderly \ninvestor, or the person who is investing in mutual funds? What does \nthat do to an industry that is very important for the retirement \nsecurity of millions of our citizens?\n  For companies inclined toward exploration and production, earnings \nand stock values have fared even worse. The yield on independent \nrefiner stocks, down 40 percent. The yield on exploration and \nproduction stocks, down 63 percent. The yield on drilling stock, down \n64 percent. These stock values reflect huge losses by oil companies \nover the past year and a half. Corporate earnings of the 17 major U.S. \npetroleum companies fell 41 percent between the first quarter of 1998 \nand the first quarter of 1999. Fourth quarter losses for 1998 and the \nfirst quarter of 1999 were some of the largest witnessed in industry \nhistory. Some companies have lost over $1 billion during each of these \nquarters.\n  So we are not just talking about the loss of revenue to our \nschoolchildren. We are not just talking about the stability of the \nretirement pension plans of millions of Americans. We are talking about \nflat bad policy. We are talking about cutting off an industry that is \nessential to our security, essential to the retirement security of \nindividuals in this country, essential to job security for thousands of \nworkers; and we are talking about blithely saying let the bureaucrats \nwho aren't accountable increase the taxes without congressional \nresponsibility.\n  Congress didn't say that last year, they didn't say it the year \nbefore, and they didn't say it the year before that. They said: No, you \nwill be accountable because we do care about the schoolchildren of this \ncountry, we do care about the people living on retirement incomes in \nthis country, and we do care about those who have mutual funds that \ninclude oil industry stocks; we want them to be stable, we want them to \npay their fair share, and we believe their fair share includes not \npaying taxes on their expenses. It is economics 101.\n  So I am asking my colleagues, for the fourth straight time, to come \nforward and vote to keep this moratorium so Congress can exercise its \nfull responsibility, so that we will not put people out of business \nbecause the margins are so low and because they have been hit so hard \nover the last year and a half.\n  We are joined by many groups who care about the economic viability of \nour country: Frontiers of Freedom, the National Taxpayers Union, \nAmericans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy, the Alliance for America, People for the USA, \nSixty-Plus, the Blue Ribbon Coalition, the American Land Rights \nAssociation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Center \nfor Public Policy Research, Rio Grande Valley Partnership.\n  The moratorium that I am proposing to extend will force the \nDepartment to take the time to craft a rule that works and accurately \nreflects the will of Congress--a rule that will be fair to the \nschoolchildren of our country, a rule that will be fair to the \ntaxpayers of our country, a rule that will make the oil industry pay \nits fair share, but a rule that will not make the oil industry pay an \nincreased tax on their expenses. That is unheard of in economics in our \ncountry, nor good business sense. It is confiscatory taxation, and we \nwill not stand for our retirees having their investments obliterated by \ntaxes that are unfair. The buck stops here. It does not stop on the \nbureaucrat's desk; it stops here, because we are responsible for \nkeeping the jobs in this country. We are responsible for fair taxation \npolicy. We are responsible for the schoolchildren of our country. And \nthe way to keep these companies paying their fair share, creating the \njobs, and creating safe retirement systems for the people of our \ncountry is to keep the moratorium on and force the Department of the \nInterior to do the will of Congress, which is what it is supposed to \ndo. If we don't stand up for our responsibility, who will? Who will \nstand up for Congress' responsibility if the Senate doesn't?\n\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment which has been adopted three \ntimes before, and which I hope will be adopted again, so that we will \nkeep the oil jobs in our country, so that we will keep the retirement \nsecurity of the mutual funds that depend on oil companies being stable, \nso that we will keep the schoolchildren of our country having the \nability to get revenue that is fair, and to make the oil industry pay \nits fair share. That is what this amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know there are Senators who are \nwaiting to speak on other measures. I am only going to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  I congratulate Senator Hutchison on the argument she offered today. \nShe indicated that the last three times we have done this, I have \neither been the sponsor and she the cosponsor, or vice versa.\n  I am here today to again indicate that whoever follows us and talks \nabout the fact that we ought to stick big oil, or we ought to make sure \nthere are no longer any slick deals, as I see some of these comments \nthat are going to be made here on the floor, let me suggest that if you \nare taxing anything in the United States and you are doing it wrongly \nor unfairly or without justification under the law, then it doesn't \nmatter whether somebody is going to lose money if in fact Congress says \nyou have to stop doing that.\n  That is what we have here. We are going to have Senators argue that \nthere are certain oil companies that are not going to have to pay. \nThere have been settlements where they have paid. But the truth of the \nmatter is, the intention of this law is, if you are going to change it \nmaterially, Congress is supposed to be involved.\n  We have tried to get involved. In fact, for 6 months we have mutually \nattended hearings with the MMS and the oil producers and talked about \nwhat was wrong with these regulations and\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nrules. Everybody on both sides was saying, let's fix them; let's modify \nthem; let's change them. Frankly, I think the oil people who were at \nthose meetings who have talked with us and have gone to hearings in the \nEnergy Committee are more than willing to listen to realistic, \nreasonable changes.\n  But essentially what has happened is, the MMS decided to change the \nrule which historically based royalties on prices at the wellhead. They \ndecided they would go downstream from that wellhead, and they invented \na new concept called ``duty to market.'' They decided that they are \ngoing to decide what expenses are allowed in moving that gas downstream \nto where the marketing occurs. They are deciding what the values are at \nthat point. And we could go through a litany of situations where the \noil industry believes the decisions are not fair, not market oriented, \nor not consistent with business practices. Frankly, I think some--\nbecause it is oil, or big oil--think it just doesn't matter, stick \nthem.\n  Frankly, as I indicated before, we want to stand here and say: Why \ndon't you get serious about fixing those regulations? And we will get \noff your back.\n  That is what is going to happen. Until they do it realistically and \nwe get some word that they have been fair and reasonable in the way \nthey are setting these royalty costs and prices that yield dollars in \ntaxes to the oil industry, until we find out there are some changes \nmade, we are going to be here on the floor saying this is a new add-on \ntax to an industry that maybe 15 years ago we could talk about as if \nwhat you taxed them didn't matter. But we know that we have a falling \nproduction market in the United States. It is more and more difficult \nto produce these products. It is more and more expensive and cheaper \noverseas. Some of us don't want to see the American industry taxed any \nmore than is absolutely reasonable and fair.\n  These regulations are not right. They are not fair; they are not \nbased on marketplace concepts, or we wouldn't be here.\n  I know some are going to want to debate this for a very long time. \nMaybe we will even have to ask for the debate to be closed. But we are \nnot going to give up very easily.\n  We ask Senators who pay close attention. It is not a matter of what \nwe could get out of this industry or what somebody alleges they would \nhave paid in the settlement. It is a question of whether the new rules \nand regulations are right and consistent with fair market concepts or \nnot. As you figure the royalty, are you inventing costs and prices and \ndisallowing deductions and the like that have no relationship to \nreality? We think that is what these are.\n  We would be happy to come back again and debate. I will be glad to be \nhere. But for now I yield the floor. I thank Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may say so, I appreciate that \nthis is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment. Sometimes it is Domenici-\nHutchison because we both have worked so hard on this issue over the \nlast 3 years. I appreciate the leadership of my colleague from New \nMexico who feels the loss of oil jobs just as my State of Texas does. \nIt is a team effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1583\n\n (Purpose: To strike Section 329 from a bill making appropriations for \n  the Department of Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n                       ending September 30, 2000)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I call up an amendment that has been filed \nat the desk on behalf of myself and Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Cleland, \nChafee, and Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb), for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \n     Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 1583.\n       Beginning on page 116, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through line 21.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I did not ask that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with because it was so short and to the point.\n  The amendment simply strikes section 329 from the Interior \nappropriations bill we are now considering. Section 329 is a rider that \nis intended to overturn recent decisions handed down by the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court in Washington \nState dealing with national forests.\n  These courts were asked to examine the activities of the Forest \nService and BLM to determine whether, in allowing certain timber sales \nfrom public lands, they complied with their own regulations and \nresource management plans that were developed under the National Forest \nManagement Act. The courts found that they did not comply and \ndisallowed the sales until they did.\n  The forest plans guide the Federal decision-making, so that one \nactivity in the national forests such as logging does not occur in \ndetriment to other uses. These plans apply only to national forest \nland--Federal land--not private land. This is land held in trust for \nall people and all uses, and the Forest Service and BLM are charged \nwith ensuring that decisions involving these public treasures are made \nwisely.\n  We in Congress continually insist that Federal regulators operate \nusing good science. But there is no good science without good data.\n  Section 329, which my amendment would strike, would relieve the \nForest Service from the obligation to develop any new data. And we \ncannot have good decisions without good science and good data.\n  After decades of managing our forests primarily for the production of \nlogs, we are now managing forests for a variety of uses. But we cannot \ndo that without baseline data on threatened and endangered species.\n  We are changing the way we manage forests and the way we look at \nforest uses. Preserving habitat and providing recreation also have \nbecome increasingly important.\n\n  These changes are not easy. Proponents of this section, that my \namendment would strike, fear that the requirements that we make sound \ndecisions based on sound science and good data will lead to less \nlogging. This is simply not true. Managing forests for their various \nuses, which include harvesting timber, requires an understanding of the \nentire system, including the plants, animals, even the pests that \nsometimes inhibit or damage growth.\n  To improve forest management, in December of 1997 the Chief of the \nForest Service appointed an independent committee of scientists to \nadvise him on ways to bring better science into forest planning. The \npanel's findings strongly recommended the use of scientific evidence in \nmanaging forests. The panel repeatedly advised that monitoring is \ncritical to sustaining forest health.\n  In the cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the courts simply \nrequire the Federal Government to undertake the monitoring that their \nown forest plans and rules require. Supporters of section 329 argue \nthat the courts in these two cases have deviated from rulings by other \ncourts where challenged timber sales were allowed to proceed. In other \ncases--and here is the important difference--the courts had enough data \nto rule in favor of the Forest Service. There was evidence to show that \nwhile the data gathered may not have been exhaustive, at least it was \nadequate.\n  In the most recent cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the \ncourts, after noting deference to the Forest Service, recognized the \njob simply had not been done adequately or at all. The courts didn't \nrule that each and every species had to be monitored. They simply said \nto the Federal Government: You have to follow your own rules. You have \nto gather the data in which a sound decision can be based.\n  For example, the Eleventh Circuit decision delayed seven timber sales \nin the southern Appalachian forest in Georgia until the Forest Service \ncompleted an evaluation of the impact the sales would have on the \nforest environment.\n  The purpose of the information gathering is to ensure that the Forest \nService makes an informed decision before it allows the removal of \nexpanses of\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\ntimber that could be crucial to survival of endangered or threatened \nspecies or that could affect overall forest health.\n  In a similar action, a Federal judge in Washington State has delayed \nover 25 timber sales until the Forest Service completes the survey work \nrequired by the Northwest Forest Plan.\n  In the case involving the southern Appalachian forest, the Forest \nService failed to develop the required baseline data on a number of \nspecies in both the endangered and the threatened category and in a \ncategory known as ``indicator'' species. For example, the Forest \nService had no population inventory information at all for 32 of 37 \nspecies in one category. The court of appeals ruled that in proffering \nthe tracts of timber for sale, the Forest Service failed to comply with \nits own regulations. The court didn't just determine that the data was \ninadequate; the court determined that the data was nonexistent.\n  Under most forest plans, the Forest Service develops lists of \nindicator species to provide a basis for monitoring. These lists have \nspecies such as deer, bear, bass, and trout. These species are \nrepresentative of all the other species in the forest. The list is \nshort and it is designed to be easy to monitor.\n  In the Eleventh Circuit case, the Forest Service developed such a \nlist but then failed to gather any information on most of the species \non the list. In the Northwest, the court found that the Forest Service \nsidestepped similar requirements of the forest plan.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan is the legal and scientific framework that \nallows timber sales to go forward in the old growth forests of the \nNorthwest. As our colleagues will recall, lawsuits in the early 1990s \nbrought logging in that region to a complete halt. The Northwest Forest \nPlan, which was the result of lengthy and often painful negotiations, \nallowed timber sales to go forward, provided that there was an adequate \nbasis to make an informed decision. The agreement provides the best \nhope of sustained yield and multiple use. This latest ruling by the \nWestern District Court of Washington is a reminder that the agreement \nis the operating plan for the forests, and that guidance memorandum \ncannot exempt the Forest Service from its duty. This ruling will delay \ntimber sales but only until the Forest Service completes the work laid \nout in the plan.\n\n  Of the 80 surveys in question, all but 13 have protocols developed \nthat will allow survey work to move forward. These decisions are not a \nresult of overstepping by the courts. They are a result of the courts \nexamining the rules the Forest Service laid out for itself and merely \nrequiring the Forest Service to operate by the rules it adopted.\n  Let me quote from the Eleventh Circuit decision:\n\n       While the Forest Service's interpretation of its Forest \n     Plan should receive great deference from reviewing courts, \n     courts must overturn agency actions which do not scrupulously \n     follow the regulations and procedures promulgated by the \n     agency itself.\n\n  I suggest to our colleagues who support section 329 that we should \nnot as a result of one court decision turn our backs on the necessity \nof developing good information on plant and animal populations in our \nnational forests. This data is the basis of the good science we keep \ntalking about. It will add to our knowledge. In fact, most forest \ndistricts already have a substantial amount of data and continue to \ndevelop more. The majority of sales are moving forward under the \nexisting rules and plans. It would be a mistake to let delays in a few \ntimber sales negate all of the important work that is now being done. \nSection 329 effectively stops data gathering for the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  In addition, section 329 establishes a new standard to be applied by \nthe Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for determining \nwhen to approve timber sales. However, according to the agencies that \nare required to implement the change, rather than speed timber sales \nup, it would slow them down. To understand the effect of this change, \nwe ought to hear from those who will be responsible for implementing \nthe change.\n  In a statement issued jointly by the Secretaries of Agriculture and \nInterior they say:\n\n       [I]f this rider were adopted, tens of thousands of \n     individual management activities and planning efforts would \n     be subject to a new legal standard.\n       This would have the unintended effect of increasing project \n     costs and increasing delays in order to conduct time-\n     consuming reviews of administrative records to document \n     compliance with the new standard.\n       Increased litigation and delay could also be expected as \n     plaintiffs seek to define the new standard in court.\n       In an effort to free up a limited number of timber sales in \n     Georgia and the Pacific Northwest, the Senate would \n     unnecessarily override the Federal Court ruling, agency \n     regulations, and resource management plans requiring the \n     Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain and \n     use current and appropriate information for wildlife and \n     other resources before conducting planning and management \n     activities.\n       Moreover, the bill language applies not just to timber \n     sales decisions and required surveys in the forests of the \n     Southeast and Pacific Northwest, but to all activities for \n     which authorization is required on all lands managed by the \n     Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service.\n       As such, it could result in far-reaching, unintended \n     negative consequences.\n\n  In short, the Secretaries who would be required to implement the new \nstandard write that:\n\n       Section 329 is unnecessary, confusing, difficult to \n     interpret, and wasteful.\n       If enacted, it will likely result in costly delays, \n     conflicts, and lawsuits with no clear benefit to the public \n     or the health of public lands.\n\n  The Forest Service, which is charged with implementing the court's \nruling, is acting. In the southern Appalachian forests, they are \nmodifying the forest plan and have developed guidance to help meet the \ncourt's directives. In the Northwest, they are completing a \nsupplemental environmental impact statement that will respond to the \ncourt's concerns.\n  Incidentally, the SEIS was in process before the court ruled because \nthe Forest Service had already recognized that the plan needed \nadjusting, and the plan has mechanisms in it to accommodate change.\n  The Forest Service does not believe this rider is necessary in order \nto approve timber sales. In fact, they believe it will interfere with \ntimber sales.\n  I want to emphasize an additional problem with section 329. It does \nnot just apply to timber sales. Again, according to the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and the Interior:\n\n       The provision which applies for one year would apply to all \n     of the nearly 450 million acres of land managed by the two \n     agencies and would apply to all management activities \n     undertaken by the bureaus, not just timber sales.\n\n  We should not be putting a rider on an appropriations bill to lower \nthe standard for government agencies in the hope that it might pass \nunnoticed. One of the reasons people get cynical about their government \nis that it does not always do what it says it will do. In this case, we \nwould lower the bar for agencies that do not want the bar lowered. The \nForest Service believes that it can do the job right. We would do a \ndisservice to this body and to the people who expect us to protect our \nnational treasure by not demanding that Federal agencies make informed \ndecisions with adequate data.\n  What section 329 proposes to do is lower the standard the first time \nthat agency fails to meet it. I believe this is the wrong approach. I \nbelieve we should strike section 329 from this appropriations bill and \nthat the Federal Government should comply with the laws we have passed \nand the rules it has established and the plans it has adopted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nvery important comments. I rise in very strong opposition to the \nHutchison amendment that was laid aside and about which, as I \nunderstand it, probably we will have to vote on a cloture motion. I \nawait the word of the chairman on that.\n  I want to tell my colleagues that this is a very serious matter. I \nhope they will listen very carefully as to why the arguments against \nthe Hutchison amendment are so important. I am going to say some very \nstrong things on the floor. But everything I say will be backed up by \nfact, backed up by quotes, backed up by court cases, backed up by \nrecent history on oil royalty payments.\n  What the Hutchison amendment will do for the fourth time is to stop \nAmerican taxpayers from receiving the\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\namount of oil royalties they are owed by the oil companies. Let me \nrepeat that. The Hutchison amendment will stop the American taxpayers \nfrom receiving the fair share of oil royalties that they deserve. If it \ndoes pass, and I hope it does not, it will sanction that. It will say \nto the oil companies: It's OK, you continue, big oil companies, \nunderpaying your oil royalties. We know they have a plan to underpay. \nWe know that. We have heard it from people who have blown the whistle \non the oil companies.\n  If we go with the Hutchison amendment, our fingerprints are on this \ndefrauding of the taxpayers. This is very serious business. I ask my \ncolleagues to pay attention, because when this issue was last before \nus, we did not have a whistleblower who worked for the oil companies in \ncourt, saying that the oil companies, in essence, defrauded the \ntaxpayers and they planned to do so. We have that information. I will \nlay it before the Senate.\n\n  What is an oil royalty payment? Right here you see what a royalty \npayment is. The oil companies sign an agreement with the Federal \nGovernment that when they drill on Federal lands in any State of the \nUnion, be it onshore or offshore, they must pay a fair percentage, 12.5 \npercent, of the value of that oil over to the Federal Government. It is \nlike paying rent. It is not a tax; it is a royalty payment.\n  If you do not own the place in which you live, you pay rent. Imagine \nif you decided on a daily basis what that rent ought to be. No, no, \nno--you would go to jail or you would be evicted because you have \nsigned a contract to pay a certain amount of rent. The oil companies \nhave signed a contract to pay a certain amount of rent based on the oil \nthey extract from Federal lands. Here it is. It ``shall never be less \nthan the fair market value of the production.'' Keep that in mind, \n``fair market value of the production.'' They have to base their \nroyalty payment on the fair market value of the oil.\n  Senator Domenici was on the floor and he said beware of colleagues \nwho start talking about Congress' slick deal with the oil companies. He \nsaid beware.\n  I am not saying it; USA Today said it. USA Today said it is ``time to \nclean up Big Oil's slick deal with Congress.'' They say, in their view, \n``industry's effort to avoid paying full fees hurts taxpayers [and] \nothers.''\n  Here is what USA Today says on the subject in this article. They knew \nthe Hutchison amendment was coming and this is what they said.\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent \n     discount off the marketplace. Over time, that would add up to \n     really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to \n     make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.\n\n  They go on to say the fact that ``big oil has contributed more than \n$35 million to national political committees and congressional \ncandidates.'' They say that is ``a modest investment in protecting the \nroyalty-pricing arrangement which has enabled the industry to pocket an \nextra $2 billion.''\n  This is a very bad situation. If you vote for the Hutchison \namendment, you are aligning yourselves with a planned effort to defraud \ntaxpayers. I do not know how many of my friends want to go home and \nface their constituents and make that argument. This is what USA Today \ncontinues saying:\n\n       That's millions of dollars missing in action from the \n     battle to reduce the Federal deficit and from accounts for \n     land and water conservation, historic preservation, and \n     several Native American tribes. In addition, public schools \n     in 24 States have been shortchanged: States use their share \n     of Federal royalties for education funding.\n\n  They conclude by saying:\n\n       . . . the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of \n     this deal for far too long.\n\n  We have a chance to stand up for the consumer, for the taxpayers, \nagainst cheaters, against people who would knowingly defraud taxpayers, \nif we do not support the Hutchison amendment, if we oppose it.\n\n  We heard the Senator from Texas say: Oh, my God, things are terrible \nfor oil. We are suffering in the oil industry.\n  What she does not tell you is something very important: 95 percent of \nthe oil companies are not affected by the rule the Interior Department \nwants to put into place which will fix this problem. The Hutchison \namendment stops them in their tracks and prohibits them from fixing \nthis perpetual underpayment of royalties. That is what the Hutchison \namendment does.\n\n  She says big oil and oil across the board is hurting. Ninety-five \npercent of the oil companies are not affected. They are decent. They \nare paying their fair share of royalties. It is the 5 percent that are \ndoing this slick thing that are, instead of paying their royalty based \non a market price, they are paying it based on a posted price which \nthey post. They decide what the price is, and we know they are cheating \nus. How do we know that? That is a tough thing for a Senator to say, \nbut I want to prove it to you.\n  First of all, we know this for sure: Seven States have already won \nbattles in court against oil companies. The seven States have said that \nthe oil companies are underpaying their royalty payments to the Federal \nGovernment and the States' share of those royalty payments, therefore, \nare lower. The oil companies have settled with these States.\n  If they were doing the right thing, do you think they would be \nsettling for $5 billion so far? I doubt it. If they were so innocent, \ndo you think they would be shelling out--``shelling'' is a good word--\n$5 billion to seven States? By the way, the Federal Government is suing \nas well. We do not want to have to keep these battles in court. The \nInterior Department wants to fix these problems so nobody will have to \nsue anymore. There will be a fair payment. So one reason we know they \nare cheating us is they are settling these cases all over the country.\n  There is another reason we know. This one is very direct and this one \nis new. I urge my colleagues at their peril to pay attention to this \nmatter, please:\n\n       A retired Atlantic Richfield employee has admitted in court \n     that while he was Secretary of ARCO's crude pricing \n     committee, the major's posted prices were far below fair \n     market value.\n\n  He goes on to say--Anderson is his name:\n\n       He admitted he was not being fully truthful 5 years ago \n     when he testified in a deposition that ARCO's posted prices \n     represented fair market value. He said: ``I was an ARCO \n     employee. Some of the issues being discussed were still being \n     litigated. My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen \n     numerous occasions, the nail that stood up getting beat \n     down.'' Said Anderson, ``The senior executives of ARCO had \n     the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the \n     day of judgment, and that's what we did.''\n\n  Here is a retired former employee of one of the oil companies that \nhas been ripping off the taxpayers admitting it in a court of law--he \ncould go to jail if he lies--swearing on a Bible, an oil company man, \nthat they sat around and agreed to understate the value so they could \nget away with it and wait for the day of judgment. Talk about a smoking \ngun, here it is. This is new information, and yet Senator Hutchison is \nasking you to stand with those people, one of whom admitted they \nactually had a plan to defraud the taxpayers.\n  This is a very serious issue. It is not politics. It involves a plan \nto understate the market price. It is wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask my colleague, the Senator from California, \nif she will clarify several things so those following the debate \nunderstand the parameters of this issue. In every instance here are we \ntalking about private oil companies drilling for oil on public lands?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, I say to my friend. These are private \noil companies that have signed an agreement with the Federal Government \nto pay the royalty payment based on the fair market value when they \ndrill on land that is owned by the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask the Senator from California, it has been my \nexperience in Illinois that coal mining companies and oil exploration \ncompanies will go out and buy private land, at least an easement or \nright to drill on private land, and pay compensation to the landowner \nfor that purpose. But in this situation, we are dealing with land owned \nby the people of America----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That these companies are using to make a profit; is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And their payment to the taxpayers for the use of our \nland, the land owned by the taxpayers across America, is this royalty; \nis it not?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator from California explain the impact, then, \nof the Hutchison amendment, how this will affect the royalty that is \npaid by the oil companies that want to drill for oil and make a profit \nfrom that oil off land owned by taxpayers?\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the Hutchison amendment does is it puts off for the \nfourth time any move by the Interior Department to fix the problem we \nare facing with this underpayment of the royalties that are due the \ntaxpayers.\n  The Interior Department has held a series of 17 meetings across the \ncountry. They have met with the oil companies, they have met with \nMembers of Congress, they have done everything, and they are ready to \nfinalize a rule. Every time they are ready to promulgate a rule to fix \nthis problem, up comes one of the Senators from the oil States who \nsays: Oh, wait, wait, wait, it is too complicated; it isn't a good \nidea.\n  It isn't a good idea from the oil companies' perspective because as \nwe just heard this one whistleblower say, they want to put off the day \nof judgment and use this float to make more and more money. But my \nfriend is right in his questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, let's consider two \npossibilities. If the royalty is based on the price of oil, there is a \npossibility that the royalty payments might go down if it is \nrecalculated; there is a possibility that it might stay the same, or it \nmight go up.\n  But I take it from this amendment that the oil companies that are \npushing this amendment are so certain that their payments to the \nFederal Government are going to go up that they want to stop the \nFederal Government from recalculating the royalties.\n  The net impact of this, and the Senator from California can correct \nme, is that the oil companies are being protected from paying their \nfair share of rent or royalties for using public lands, and the \ntaxpayers, because of this amendment, are the losers. We are the ones \nwho do not get the royalties back from those who want to drill all the \noil out of land that we own and not pay the taxpayers of this country \nfor the right to do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I can put it in specific dollars. \nAlready the Hutchison amendment, since she first offered it and our \ncolleagues backed her on it, has lost taxpayers $88 million, and if she \nsucceeds in this, although Senator Hutchison has pared it back to a \nyear, another delay of a year, it is another $66 million. That is a lot \nof millions of dollars. Taxpayers already have lost $88 million, and \nthey are about to lose another $66 million unless we can stop this. The \nInterior Department is with us 100 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Hutchison amendment prevails and is not defeated--\n--\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield on \nthat point because I think there has been an error in the amount that \nwe are talking about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can say to my colleague, the Senator from Texas, I \nwas only asking a question of the Senator from California who I believe \nhas the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I will address this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a letter that backs up those numbers which I will \nput in the Record. I will continue to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I am getting to is, if the Hutchison amendment \nis adopted, then basically we are giving a discount to these oil \ncompanies from the amount they owe taxpayers for drilling oil out of \npublic lands and selling it at a profit; is that the net impact of this \namendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know we are in an era of surpluses where we are trying \nto figure out ways to give away money, but I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia why would we decide to give money to oil companies at this \npoint? Why adopt an amendment that would give them additional profits \nfor drilling oil on lands owned by the taxpayers, the people of \nAmerica?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is a special interest rider. \nI have to say that, with all due respect. By the way, it doesn't give \nmoney to all the oil companies. It only gives it to the top 5 percent, \nthe ones that are vertically integrated. Ninety-five percent of the oil \ncompanies are not affected, and they are paying the fair market value. \nThey are paying the royalty based on the fair market value.\n  I ask unanimous consent, before yielding to the Senator for more \nquestions, to have printed in the Record a letter from the Secretary of \nthe Interior, which was based on the original Hutchison amendment, \nwhich addresses the question of the dollars lost. It is very clear what \nwill be lost. In her additional amendment of 21 months, they calculate \nit at $120 million, and we are just paring it back to the 1-year \nnumber. We also have a letter from the Office of Management and Budget \nwhich clearly states that the rider, as it is before us now, will cost \ntaxpayers about $60 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those two documents printed in the \nRecord when I complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object. I do want the Senator to be \nable to enter her documents in the Record, but I want to also have \nentered in the Record that the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated it would be $11 million. That would be the cost to the \ntaxpayers; that is, if the oil companies continue to drill. So she \nmay----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may we have regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't ever remember having one Senator object to \nanother Senator putting a document in the Record. I am kind of shocked \nat that.\n  I ask, again, unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the two \nFederal agencies versus the one that back us up on our documentation. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to have those printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will not object, as long as the Record also shows \nthe CBO has said $11 million and that assumes people are not going to \ngo out of business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator \nentering into the Record anything she wants, but I can say very clearly \nthat we know what this is costing.\n  The Senator herself admits it is $11 million taken out of taxpayer \npockets. We believe it is $66 million.\n  I continue to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that these \npayments, these royalties come through the Federal Government and back \nto many of the States. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. In other words, if there is oil being drilled \nin Texas, it is on Federal lands, but the Federal lands are within \nTexas. Texas gets 50 percent of the royalty payment. I know in \nCalifornia, it is 50 percent if it is onshore and about 25 percent if \nit is offshore. In many of the States, including California, these \nfunds go directly into the classroom and to the schools.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So in some of the States, for example, Texas and \nCalifornia, if the Hutchison amendment passes, there will be fewer \ndollars from these royalty payments coming back to the States of the \ntwo Senators engaged in this debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, and into the classrooms.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, it is my understanding from her \nprevious statement that many of the States have sued the oil companies \nsaying: You didn't pay enough. You owed us more in royalties. You \nunderpaid the amount you were required to pay for drilling for oil on \nfederally owned public lands for profit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is correct. To be very specific, I will tell \nthe Senator, the oil companies that are being so defended here have \nagreed in court to pay up not $1 billion, not $2 billion, but $5 \nbillion to these States; in essence,\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nagreeing that they undervalued. Alaska got $3.7 billion, for example; \nCalifornia, $345 million. By the way, private owners are also \ncomplaining, and they have resolved some of the disputes for $194 \nmillion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, as a followup \nquestion, so I understand it completely, these private oil companies go \non to public lands, drill for oil which they sell for a profit. They \nare charged a royalty based on the price of the oil. The impact of this \namendment by the Senator from Texas would be to say to the Department \nof the Interior: You cannot recalculate the royalty to raise it. So we \nare protecting these oil companies from an increase in what they are \ngoing to pay taxpayers for drilling on public land, which means more \nmoney in their pocket. The losers are not only Federal taxpayers but \nStates such as Texas and California and their taxpayers who lose the \nbenefits of the money that might come back to them from these \nroyalties?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is right. But it is even worse than that \nbecause a royalty payment is a contract. The oil companies have signed \na contract. It says very clearly ``fair market value.'' It is not that \nthe Interior Department wants to increase the percent, for example, \nthat is paid; they just want to make sure the contract is carried out.\n  It says: The value of production for purposes of computing royalty on \nproduction from this lease ``shall never be less than the fair market \nvalue of the production.'' So all they are trying to do is correct a \nserious problem. And we know, because I can show my colleague another \nchart on posted prices versus the market prices of ARCO, I will show \nhim what has happened. Right now the oil companies, these 5 percent of \nthem that are cheating us, they base their royalty payment on what they \ncall posted prices. They create the price. If we could show this to the \nSenator, look at the difference between the market price and the posted \nprice. This is one oil company, but I could show my friend, every \nsingle one of these oil companies, by some kind of magic action, they \nhave the same spread. And if you heard what the ARCO executive said, \nthe former executive, they did this on purpose. They made the posted \nprices below the market price.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I only have three questions, and I will stop.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate my colleague asking as many questions as he \nwants.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator made reference to a Wall Street Journal \narticle where a former official from ARCO said--was this under oath or \nwas it just a public statement in terms of their efforts to try to \nreduce the royalty payments to the Federal Government for this private \ncompany to drill oil on public land and make a profit?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The article that I quoted is Platt's Oilgram News--an oil \nindustry newsletter. In fact, my colleague is right, they talk about a \ncourt case in which a retired Atlantic Richfield employee admitted in \ncourt----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under oath.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Under oath, penalty of perjury, that while he was \nsecretary of ARCO's crude pricing committee, the major's posted prices \nwere far below the market value.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this gentleman, no longer employed, conceded the point \nwhich you have been making during the course of this debate, that these \noil companies are really cheating the Federal Government, the taxpayers \nof this country, because they are using our public lands and not paying \na fair royalty payment for the oil they are extracting and selling at a \nprofit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely right. They are basing their royalty \npayment on a price that is not reflective of the fair market value. It \nis a price they made up. It is as if one day you woke up and let's say \nyou paid rent, which my friend probably does here in Washington, DC, \nand you just decided one day that the fair market value of the rent was \nlower than your lease.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. My landlord wouldn't allow that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He would not allow that. He would probably evict you. Yet \nwhat do we have here in this Senate. We have Senators standing up \ncondoning this kind of behavior.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, in my home State of \nIllinois, there are many small oil producers that are going through \nvery difficult times. Some of them may not survive. There has been an \nargument made that we have to give this break, in the Hutchison \namendment, to these oil companies to help these small producers and \nhelp the oil industry.\n  If I vote against the Hutchison amendment and go home to Illinois and \nface these small oil companies that are trying to survive in difficult \ntimes, will they be saying to me: You have just cut off the flow of \nmoney to us? What companies are affected by this Hutchison amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, let me say there are 777 companies that are not \nimpacted at all by this Interior rule, but there are 44 companies that \nare impacted. Let me say to my colleague, I voted to help the small oil \ncompanies. I was proud to support the Domenici amendment. We took it up \nrecently when we helped the steel companies. If we want to help the oil \ncompanies because they are having tough times, I will be right there. \nIf there are reasons to help smaller companies, I am right there. And I \nhave always been right there.\n  But it seems to me we can't stand on the floor of the Senate and help \nthe largest oil companies--most of these are the largest; not all, but \nmost--5 percent of the oil companies that are out-and-out cheating the \ntaxpayers. We know it because it has been testified to in a court of \nlaw, and we know it because they have been settling these cases all \nover the country. My friend should feel very comfortable when he \nopposes the Hutchison amendment case that he is impacting only 5 \npercent.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware of the fact that the Los Angeles \nTimes, on July 20 of this year, in analyzing this debate, concluded by \nsaying, ``not since the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s has the stench \nof oil money reeked as strongly in Washington as it is in this case''?\n  I ask the Senator from California, isn't it odd that on an \nappropriations bill we are considering a string of riders that are of \nsuch import and controversy, putting them on a spending bill instead of \nhaving a hearing so the oil companies could come in and try to defend, \nif they would like to, so the Department of the Interior can come in \nand basically explain why they think taxpayers across America are \nripped off by this amendment? It seems to me to be an odd state of \naffairs that we have seven, eight, or nine different riders on this \nbill which really go to important, substantive issues that have not \nbeen addressed by this Congress during the course of this year. Does \nthe Senator agree with me that this is an exceptional procedural issue \nto be taking up on a spending bill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I think it is not appropriate. I hope the Senator \nfrom Texas will not proceed with this. She knows if she does--and we \nare very open about this--we are going to be on our feet a long time. \nSo we are going to have a cloture vote to see where this all comes out. \nI want to say this to my friend and then I will yield to my friend from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I just have a question on procedure, not on the substance, \nif the Senator would not mind yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do mind yielding at this point. I don't want to lose my \ntrain of thought.\n  My friend is so right in his understanding of what this means. This \nis an example of legislating on an appropriations bill. This Hutchison \namendment was put into the committee and stripped out because of the \nway it was put into the committee. It was stripped out. It has been \ndefined and technically changed, and now it is being offered. But it is \nstill the same thing. You know, you can put a dress on a hippopotamus \nand it still looks like a hippopotamus. That is what this is. This is a \nvery ugly amendment.\n  I want to mention one thing in answering the question. I was very \npleased that my friend read the Los Angeles Times editorial. It is a \nnewspaper that now has Republican ownership. I think that is very \nimportant. I want to read a couple of other statements from it. I see \nmy friend from\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nWisconsin is here. Is he going to ask me a question as well?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This Los Angeles Times article says, ``The Great American \nOil Ripoff.''\n  It says:\n\n       America's big oil companies have been ripping off Federal \n     and State governments for decades by underpaying royalties \n     for oil drilled on public lands. The Interior Department \n     tried to stop the practice with new rules, but Congress has \n     succeeded in blocking their implementation, and will again if \n     the Senate bill calling for a moratorium on the new rules \n     proposed by Senators Hutchison and Domenici comes up before \n     the Senate.\n\n  It has and here we are.\n\n       The large integrated oil companies, not the small \n     independent producers, have been cheating the State and \n     Federal Treasuries by computing their royalties on the so-\n     called ``posted rights'' rather than the fair market price.\n\n  That is what we are talking about, computing royalties on posted \nrights, rather than fair market price.\n\n       It could be as much as $4 or $5 a barrel lower. \n     The Interior Department estimates this practice costs the \n     taxpayers up to $66 million a year.\n\n  Senator Hutchison says it is $11 million, and that is a lot; but we \nthink it is $66 million, and so does the OMB.\n\n       Two years ago, Interior drew up rules that would stop the \n     underpayment but Congress has blocked implementation.\n\n  They go on to explain:\n\n       The bottom line is, Congress should not buckle to the \n     pressure of the oil companies, and the Hutchison amendment \n     should be defeated.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield briefly, I will leave the \nSenators to debate this. We have the Robb amendment on the floor. \nSeveral of us came to debate that, expecting it would be stacked for a \nvote in the morning. Obviously, you are going to continue this debate \ninto tomorrow. I wonder what your plan is for the evening because it is \npredicated upon a unanimous consent agreement that we want to craft. If \nyou plan to debate late into the evening, we will not stay.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, we don't.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There are four Senators, including the Presiding Officer, \nwho came to the floor because the Senator from Virginia was on the \nfloor with his amendment. We hoped to debate that within the next 35 to \n40 minutes if the Senator will consider yielding the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't have any intention of talking more than 40 \nminutes. I will be yielding for a question. I thought the Senator came \nbecause he was drawn into this debate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No. I just say I think it is a rather baseless debate, \nwith a lot of politics.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will stay out of the substance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to use a little bit of humor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am more interested in the timing for this evening, on \nbehalf of five Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I told my friend the time. I don't intend to go over 40 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not only do I not think this is baseless, I want to touch \nall the bases so the Senator from Idaho can understand why we think \nthis is worthy of debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask the Senator from California this: We had a big debate about \nwelfare reform and welfare ``Cadillacs.'' We are talking about welfare \n``tankers'' here--$11 million--or $66 million going to these major oil \ncompanies. I say to the Senator from California, how many times have we \ndone this? How many times have we postponed this decision by the \nDepartment of the Interior to give to the taxpayers of this country the \nfair share they are entitled to for these oil companies to use our \nlands--the lands of people who live in Illinois, California, Idaho, and \nTexas--to drill oil. How many times has the industry come in and, with \nan amendment similar to the one before us, tried to stop this \nrecalculation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is the fourth time this amendment has come before \nthe body. I have to say to my friend, I don't think it has ever gotten \nthe attention it needs. To come in and say it is a baseless debate, \nwhen we are talking about as much as $66 million on top of the $88 \nmillion we have already lost from the three other times this amendment \ncame before us, is unbelievable to me. It is unbelievable that we close \nour eyes to this kind of purposeful rip off, and to call it a baseless \ndebate, I find that amazing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from California will further yield, is not \nthe fact that these States have come forward in court and sued the oil \ncompanies successfully evidence of the fact that the oil companies have \nbeen underpaying the Federal taxpayers, as well as the State taxpayers, \nand this amendment will continue that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct. Let me reiterate what I said. \nIn cases all across this country, there have been settlements in seven \ndifferent States, and $5 billion has been collected from the oil \ncompanies in these settlements. Now, if the oil companies had such \nclean hands and they were paying their fair amount of royalties, I \nassure my friend they would not part with $5 billion--I didn't say \nmillion, I said $5 billion. I don't even know what $5 billion looks \nlike in a room. All I can say to my friend is, it is more than we spend \non Head Start in a year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from California this because I share \nher strong opposition to this amendment, which would allow oil \ncompanies to continue to underpay the U.S. Government in royalties for \ndrilling on public lands. It is my understanding this rider was \nmodified by the managers' amendment. But, as originally drafted, the \nrider blocks the implementation of new Interior rules to stop these \nunderpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last \nCongress; is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. This is the fourth time that this Interior \nDepartment ``fix'' to ensure fair royalty payments has been stopped in \nits tracks, unless we defeat the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I know the Senator from California is obviously \nconcerned about big windfalls for the oil companies. The Interior \nDepartment estimates that underpayments by the oil companies cost the \ntaxpayers up to $66 million a year. I am wondering if she is aware of \nsome of the largest oil companies that benefit from it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be very pleased if the Senator could put that \ninto the Record because I haven't done that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. They are not small mom-and-pop, independent producers. \nThey are companies like Exxon, Chevron, BP Oil, Atlantic Richfield, and \nAmoco. I ask the Senator if she is aware of some of the campaign \ncontributions that entities such as this put forward in order to \nachieve this end.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad the Senator put out some of the names of \nthe big oil companies that would be impacted by this Interior rule that \nSenator Hutchison is trying to get. Fully 95 percent of the oil \ncompanies are not impacted. Only 5 percent are impacted. The 95 percent \nof the others are paying their fair share of royalty payments. That is \nsomething to be happy about. They are good corporate citizens paying \ntheir fair share of royalty payments based on fair market value just as \nthey signed in their lease agreements with the United States of \nAmerica. But it is the 5 percent of most of the large ones that are \ngetting away with it.\n  I say to my friend that he is a champion of campaign finance reform. \nI am so proud to be associated with him on that issue.\n  I can only say to my friend that this issue was mentioned in the USA \nToday editorial, dated Wednesday, August 26, 1998, that big oil has \ncontributed more than $35 million to national political committees and \ncongressional candidates. They make the point. These are their words, \nnot my words. They say that is a modest investment for protecting \nroyalty pricing arrangements which enables the industry to pocket an \nextra $2 billion.\n  My friend is on a certain track. I think it is important.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am grateful for the Senator's tremendous leadership \non this.\n  She may be aware that from time to time I do something that I call \n``calling of the bankroll''--interest in companies that contribute \nlarge sums of\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nmoney in terms of campaign contributions.\n  I am wondering if the Senator is aware that during the 1997-1998 \nelection cycle oil companies gave the following in political donations \nto the parties and to Federal candidates:\n  Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in \nPAC money.\n  Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 \nin PAC money.\n  I wonder if the Senator is aware that Atlantic-Richfield gave more \nthan $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 in PAC money.\n  BP Oil and Amoco, two oil companies which merged into the newly \nformed petroleum giant, BP Amoco, gave a combined total of $480,000 in \nsoft money, and nearly $295,000 in PAC money.\n  This is just some of the information we have. I don't know if the \nSenator was aware of these figures.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that I was not aware of those specific \nfigures. It is very rare that I feel that if Congress goes along with \nsomething it is really part of an ugly situation. I feel that way here. \nI feel that we have enough information now to take a stand with the \nInterior Department, with the consumers, and with over 70 groups that \nstand with us against the Hutchison amendment.\n  I hope my friend will listen to some of these groups because my \ncolleague, my friend from Texas, listed groups that were with her. I \nthink it is important that we compare these groups, who they stand for, \nand who they speak for. They are with us on our side trying to stop \nthis oil company rip off, stop the Hutchison amendment: American \nAssociation of Educational Services Agencies, American Association of \nSchool Administrators, the American Lands Alliance, the Americans Ocean \nCampaign, the Better Government Association, Common Cause, Consumer \nProject on Technology, Council of State School Officers, Friends of \nEarth, Funds for Constitutional Government, Government Accountability \nProject, Green Peace, the Mineral Policy Standard, National \nEnvironmental Trust, National Parks and Conservation Association, the \nNational Rural Education Association, the National Resources Defense \nFund, the Navajo Nation, Ozone Action, Public Citizens, Congress Watch, \nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Safe Energy \nCommunication Council, the Surface Employees International Union, and \nthe Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\n  They are with us on this.\n  The United Electrical-Radio Machine Workers of America.\n  These are just some of the groups that are opposed to the Hutchison \namendment, for one basic reason: They believe the big oil companies, \nthe 5 percent of them, are cheating the taxpayers.\n  These are all public interest groups.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I finally ask the Senator to make the comparison \nbetween the list that she just read. By and large these are very \nimportant groups that represent the average people of this country. \nThere is no way four of them could get together and give $2.9 million \nas these four corporations I just described did. Obviously these four \ncorporations want this rider to be a part of the Interior \nappropriations bill. It is the powerful political donors. They may well \nget their way despite the credibility of groups and interests that the \nSenator just indicated.\n  I, again, very much thank the Senator from California for her \nleadership on this.\n  I rise today to share my concern about the number and content of \nlegislative riders to address environmental matters contained in the FY \n2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. I hope that all provisions which \nadversely effect the implementation of environmental law, or change \nfederal environmental policy, will be removed from this legislation \nwhen it returns to the floor.\n  I believe that the Senate should not include provisions in spending \nbills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nenvironmentally beneficial regulations from being promulgated by the \nfederal agencies that enforce federal environmental law.\n  I want to note, before I describe my concerns in detail, that this is \nnot the first time that I have expressed concerns regarding legislative \nriders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact \non our nation's environment.\n  For more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable bipartisan \nconsensus to protect the environment through effective environmental \nlegislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the \nAmerican people to protect the quality of our public lands and \nresources. That responsibility requires the Senate to express its \nstrong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in \nspending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nbeneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated or enforced \nby the federal agencies that carry out federal law.\n  The people of Wisconsin have caught on to what's happening here. They \ncontinue to express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in \nspending bills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are \nbeing made without the benefit of an up or down vote.\n  Wisconsinites have a very strong belief that Congress has a \nresponsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters effecting the \nenvironment. We should be on record with regard to our position on this \nmatter of open government and environmental stewardship.\n  I have particular concerns regarding several riders contained in this \nbill. I will site three examples of provisions of concern to me. I am \nconcerned that we failed to strip the rider on the mining millsite \nissue. This is the second rider of this type we have considered. In \nSection 3006 of Public Law 106-31, the 1999 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, Congress exempted the Crown Jewel project in \nWashington State from the Solicitor's Opinion. This rider, in contrast \nto the previous rider, applies to all mines on public lands.\n  I am also concerned that we have chosen to again include a grazing \npolicy rider as well. It requires the Bureau of Land Management to \nrenew expiring grazing permits under the same terms and conditions \ncontained in the old permit. This automatic renewal will remain in \neffect until such time as the Bureau complies with ``all applicable \nlaws.'' There is no schedule imposed on the Agency, therefore necessary \nenvironmental improvements to the grazing program could be postponed \nindefinitely. This rider affects millions of acres of public rangelands \nthat support endangered species, wildlife, recreation, and cultural \nresources. The rider's impact goes far beyond the language contained in \nthe FY 1999 appropriations bill, in which Congress allowed a short-term \nextension of grazing permits which expired during the current fiscal \nyear. As written, this section undercuts the application of \nenvironmental law, derails administrative appeals, and hampers \napplication of the conservation-oriented grazing Guidelines.\n\n  I also want to voice my opposition to the amendment that would allow \noil companies to continue to underpay the U.S. government in royalties \nfor drilling on public lands. I understand that this rider was modified \nby the manager's amendment, but as originally drafted the rider blocks \nthe implementation of new Interior Department rules to stop these \nunderpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last \nCongress.\n  This is a huge windfall for the oil companies--and as it is with so \nmany special interest provisions that find their way into our \nlegislation, to the wealthy donors go the spoils, while the taxpayers \nget the shaft. The Interior Department estimates that these \nunderpayments by the oil companies cost the taxpayers up to $66 million \na year. And the oil companies that enjoy this cut-rate drilling are not \nsmall independent producers. On the contrary, the oil companies that \nbenefit are among the largest in the world. Names like Exxon, Chevron, \nBP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield.\n  I'd like to take a moment to Call the Bankroll on these companies, \nsomething I do from time to time in this chamber to remind my \ncolleagues and the public about the role money plays in our legislative \ndebates and decisions here in this chamber.\n  During the 1997-1998 election cycle, oil companies gave the following \nin political donations to the parties and to federal candidates:\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\n  Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in \nPAC money;\n  Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 \nin PAC money;\n  Atlantic Richfield gave more than $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 \nin PAC money;\n  BP Oil and Amoco, two oil companies which have merged into the newly \nformed petroleum giant BP Amoco, gave a combined total of more than \n$480,000 in soft money and nearly 295,000 in PAC money.\n  That's more than $2.9 million just from those four corporations in \nthe span of only two years, Mr. President. They want this rider to be \npart of the Interior Appropriations bill, and as powerful political \ndonors they are likely to get their way.\n  I'd like to discuss one final rider, which undoubtedly deserves its \nown Calling of the Bankroll. Though I understand that this rider has \nnow been modified by the substitute amendment, the underlying bill \ninitially prohibited the use of funds to study, develop, or implement \nprocedures or policies to establish energy efficiency, energy use, or \nenergy acquisition rules. Unchanged, this language would have blocked \nfederal programs which cut federal agencies' energy expenditures, save \ntaxpayer funds, and contribute to reductions in pollution.\n  In conclusion, I think that delay of mining law enforcement is \nindefensible, as are the other changes we are making in environmental \npolicy without full and fair debate. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin demanding that this bill be cleaned up in Conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and commend my friend from Illinois. I \nthink their questions and their caring are very important to this \ndebate. We have to take a stand on the floor of the Senate once in a \nwhile for average people--people who are faceless in this institution. \nThey think it is dominated by the special interests. My friend from \nWisconsin who works so hard every day to get the special interest money \nout of this Senate has made a very important point--that the very \ncompanies that are going to benefit from the Hutchison amendment have \ngiven huge contributions to Federal candidates and to Federal \ncommittees.\n  If you put that together, as my friend points out, with the retired \nARCO employee testimony under oath that he lied 5 years ago--he \nadmitted he was not truthful when he testified in the deposition that \nARCO-posted prices represented fair market value. He goes on to \nhonestly say he was afraid he would lose his retirement. He was afraid \nhe would be fired. You put together the contributions from big oil with \nthe testimony of this former ARCO employee, who sat in the room when \nthe decision was made to stop taxpayers from getting their fair share--\nwhen you put that together with the recent settlements by many States \nwith the oil companies, the oil companies saying to the States: Take \nyour lawsuit out of here. We will pay you billions of dollars to go \naway. We will not go to court to try to make the case that oil royalty \npayments are fair. You put all of that together, and it adds up to a \nbad situation.\n  I would be so proud of this Senate if we stood together on behalf of \nthe people and on behalf of the consumers against the bad actors in the \noil industry, who according to this employee, said we will put off \njudgment day. We will go take our chances.\n\n       The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they \n     would take the money, accrue for the day judgment, and that's \n     what we did.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  He said this:\n\n       I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued \n     to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the \n     process during the suggestions stage.\n\n  I know colleagues are here on other matters. I just felt it was very \nimportant to lay out the case against the Hutchison amendment. I will \nlay it out again and again and again if I have to. I hope I don't have \nto. I really could. I hope we can vote against cloture and hopefully \nrid this bill of this special interest rider that helps the 5 percent \nof the oil companies that are bad actors.\n  The 95 percent who are paying their fair share are doing fine; they \nwill not be impacted by the Interior Department. It is just that 5 \npercent.\n  This is an important debate. It is not a baseless debate. It is \ndebate on behalf of the hard-working taxpayers. It is a debate on \nbehalf of everyone who pays rent or a mortgage payment every month. \nImagine one day waking up and saying to the bank: Guess what. I don't \nlike my mortgage payment. I'm paying less because it is no longer the \nfair market value as the day I signed up.\n  I think the bank would say: Renegotiating the interest rate is fine; \nbut if you don't pay your fair share, we are taking you to court and we \nwill repossess your house.\n  We cannot allow the top 5 percent of oil companies to act in an \nirresponsible fashion. I hope my colleagues will join with me, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Wellstone, Senator Murray, and many \nother Senators who feel very strongly about this and vote down the \nHutchison amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pertinent letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriation Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the \n     Senate Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of \n     the bill, your consideration of the Administration's views \n     would be appreciated. These views are necessarily preliminary \n     because they are based on incomplete information, since the \n     Administration has not had the opportunity to review the \n     draft bill and report language.\n       The allocation of discretionary resources available to the \n     Senate under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply \n     inadequate to make the necessary investments that our \n     citizens need and expect. The President's FY 2000 Budget \n     proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet such \n     needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by \n     making savings proposals in mandatory and other programs \n     available to help finance this spending. Congress has \n     approved, and the President has signed into law, nearly $29 \n     billion of such offsets in appropriations legislation since \n     1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such \n     proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves \n     forward. In addition, we urge the Committee to reduce \n     unrequested funding for programs and projects in this bill.\n       The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to \n     accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the \n     302(b) allocations. However, it is our understanding that the \n     Committee bill makes major reductions to critical requests \n     for the President's Lands Legacy Initiative and for key \n     tribal programs. We also understand that the bill may include \n     a number of environmental provisions that would be \n     objectionable to the Administration--and would likely not be \n     approved by Congress, if considered on their own. We strongly \n     urge the Committee to keep the bill free of extraneous \n     provisions and to address the following issues:\n       Lands Legacy Initiative/Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     (LWCF). The Administration strongly opposes the \n     Subcommittee's decision not to fund major portions of the \n     President's Lands Legacy Initiative. Overall, only $265 \n     million (33 percent) of the $797 million requested in this \n     bill for the Initiative would be funded. The bill would \n     provide no funding for State conservation grants and planning \n     assistance, and only a portion (11 percent) of the requested \n     increase for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation \n     Fund. It would also make significant cuts in State and \n     Private Forestry grants. Federal land acquisition funding \n     would be cut by more than half from the Lands Legacy request, \n     from $413 million to $198 million. It would be short-sighted \n     to gut this important environmental initiative, given the \n     growing bipartisan recognition of the need for the federal \n     government, the states and the private sector to protect open \n     spaces and preserve America's great places.\n       Land Management Operations. The Administration commends the \n     action of the Subcommittee to address the operational and \n     maintenance needs of land management agencies in Interior and \n     USDA. The Administration is concerned, however, with cuts in \n     key conservation programs. For example, the bill would reduce \n     requests for the Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered \n     species program by $13 million (12 percent) and the Forest \n     Service forest research program by $48 million (25 percent). \n     Increased funding for key programs within the Forest Service \n     operating program, such as wildlife and fisheries habitat and \n     rangeland management, could be offset with reductions in \n     unrequested and excessive funding for timber sale preparation \n     and management.\n       Environmental and Other Objectionable Riders. The \n     Administration strongly objects to objectionable \n     environmental and other riders. Such riders rarely receive \n     the level of congressional and public review required of\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\n     authorization language, and they often override existing \n     environmental and natural resource protections, tribal \n     sovereignty, or impose unjustified micro-management \n     restrictions on agency activities. We urge the Committee to \n     oppose such provisions. For example, the Administration would \n     strongly oppose an amendment that may be offered that would \n     prohibit implementation of the oil valuation rule. Such a \n     prohibition would cost the American taxpayer about $60 \n     million in FY2000.\n       Millennium Initiative to Save America's Treasures. The \n     Administration strongly objects to the lack of funding for \n     this $30 million Presidential initiative to commemorate the \n     Millennium by preserving the Nation's historic sites and \n     cultural artifacts that are America's treasures.\n       National Endowment for the Arts/National Endowment for the \n     Humanities. The Administration strongly objects to the \n     proposed funding levels for the National Endowment for the \n     Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. The \n     Subcommittee's proposed $51 million (34 percent) reduction \n     from the request would preclude NEA from moving forward with \n     its Challenge America initiative which emphasizes arts \n     education and access to under-served communities across \n     America. The $38 million (25 percent) reduction from the \n     request would preclude NEH from expanding its summer seminar \n     series to provide professional development opportunities to \n     our nation's teachers as well as broadening the outreach of \n     its humanities programs. The Administration urges the \n     Committee to approve funding for the Endowments at the \n     requested levels.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express my grave concern over \n     the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY \n     2000 reported by the Committee on Appropriations Bill for FY \n     2000 reported by the Committee on Appropriations. If the bill \n     were presented to the President as it was reported from the \n     Committee, I would recommend that the President veto the \n     bill.\n       The bill contains a number of objectionable legislative \n     provisions, three of which I'd like to highlight. The \n     amendment on mill sites adopted by the Committee permanently \n     extends the Mining Law's existing near-giveaway of Federal \n     lands to include as much acreage as a mining company thinks \n     it can use for mountains of mine waste and spoil. The \n     amendment further tilts the Mining Law against the interests \n     of the taxpayer and the environment, ignoring the need for \n     comprehensive reform.\n       The extension of the moratorium on issuance of new rules on \n     oil valuation will delay these rules for an additional 21 \n     months. Revision of the way royalties are collected is \n     urgently needed to assure the taxpayer a fair return. \n     Extension of the moratorium cuts off the dialogue on how best \n     to do this and will needlessly cost the taxpayers about $120 \n     million in lost royalty payments.\n       It is also my understanding that the Committee adopted an \n     amendment that could limit the implementation of the \n     President's June 3 Energy Efficiency Executive Order to \n     reduce Federal energy costs. Restricting the agencies' \n     ability to improve energy efficiency in our buildings will \n     prevent the Federal Government from saving taxpayer dollars, \n     cutting dependence on foreign oil, protecting the environment \n     through improved air quality and lower greenhouse gas \n     emissions, and expanding markets for renewable energy \n     technologies.\n       Although I appreciate your efforts in re-working the \n     discretionary spending allocations in order to increase the \n     spending limits for the Interior bill in the face of the \n     limitations placed on you under the Budget Resolution, the \n     funding amount proposed by the Senate denies funding to \n     protect America's open spaces and great places for the future \n     through the President's Lands Legacy initiative, as well as \n     critical requests for land management, trust reform, other \n     Indian programs, and science.\n       Overall, the reductions to the budget request seriously \n     impair the Department's ability to be a responsible steward \n     of the Nation's natural and cultural resources and to uphold \n     our trust responsibilities to Indians. The 2000 budget sets a \n     course for the new millennium providing resources that are \n     needed to accommodate increasing demand and use of our public \n     lands and resources. In this decade, visits to parks, refuges \n     and public lands have increased up to 31 percent; the number \n     of students in BIA schools has increased 33 percent; and the \n     BIA service population is up by 26 percent.\n       In this regard, the Committee proposal does not provide \n     sufficient increases to fully operate our National Parks, \n     restore healthy public lands, rebuild wildlife and fisheries \n     resources, clean up streams in support of the Clean Water \n     Action Plan through Abandoned Mine Land grants, or improve \n     the safety of schools and communities for Indians. At the \n     funding level provided, we will be unable to meet the needs \n     expressed by Congress for better stewardship of public lands \n     and facilities, resolution of the Indian trust issue, and \n     improved schools and quality of life in Indian Country. \n     Further, the Committee eliminated funding for the Save \n     America's Treasures program that preserves priority historic \n     preservation projects of national scope and significance.\n       I urge you to reconsider the contents of the Interior bill \n     and work with the Administration and me towards a more \n     balanced approach. I look forward to working with you to \n     address these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Babbit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe the matter before the Senate now \nis the amendment of Senator Robb, and I ask consent of the Senator from \nCalifornia that her presentation, including all of her questions and \nanswers, be included in the Congressional Record immediately after the \nspeeches of Senators Hutchison and Domenici so that the debate on that \nsubject be continuous, and that other speeches during the course of the \nevening be consolidated in the Record on the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his excellent idea. We should keep \nthis debate seamless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Second, I have a unanimous consent agreement under which \nthere will be two votes on the Bond amendment and a vote on the Robb \namendment tomorrow morning that apparently have been cleared.\n  Before I present that, I say we will be in session long enough this \nevening for anyone who wishes to do so to speak on the Bond amendment. \nI believe the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak. The Senator from \nMissouri (Mr. Bond) may return for that subject. Senator Hutchison \nwishes to speak again on her amendment. There may be other speeches on \nthat. There are three or four people here to speak on the Robb \namendment. I want all of the speeches on each of these subjects to be \nconsolidated into one point in the Record.\n  This unanimous consent agreement is not going to limit anyone's right \nto talk on any of these subjects this evening as long as they wish.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield for a question, what is my \nfriend's plan of action on the Hutchison amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe a cloture motion on the Hutchison amendment \nwill be filed tomorrow to ripen sometime early next week. There will be \nlots of time for a discussion of that amendment before any vote on \ncloture takes place.\n  I hope during most of tomorrow, however, we will deal with other \namendments that can be completed and dispensed with. By the time we get \nto a vote on the cloture, we are pretty close to the end of debate on \nthis bill. I don't know if that is true or not. We will have dealt \ntoday in whole or in part with 4 of the 66 amendments that are reserved \nfor the Interior appropriations bill. I trust some will go faster than \nmany of those today.\n  I will state the unanimous consent agreement. Then I intend to speak \nbriefly on the Robb amendment. I believe the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Craig will also speak on that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nvote scheduled at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, notwithstanding rule XXII, the \nSenate resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill and \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nBond amendment No. 1621; following that vote, there will be 2 minutes \nequally divided on the pending Robb amendment No. 1583. I ask unanimous \nconsent no amendments be in order prior to these votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. In light of this agreement, I am able to announce for the \nmajority leader that there will be no further votes today but that \nthere will be three votes at 9:30 tomorrow morning and immediately \nthereafter.\n  I will speak to the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Washington be kind enough to yield \nfor a unanimous consent request so we can make a record of the sequence \nof speakers?\n  I have been here for a while but other Senators have, too. I want to \nspeak to the Bond amendment and I certainly yield to the chair of the \nsubcommittee for his comments on the Robb amendment.\n  Is it appropriate to ask unanimous consent that after the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nWashington completes his remarks, I be given no more than 10 minutes to \nrespond to the Robb amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1583\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with respect to the Robb amendment which \nwould strike section 329 of the bill before the Senate, perhaps the \nbest way to begin my remarks on it is to read that relatively short \nsection.\n  It reads as follows:\n\n       For fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture with \n     respect to lands within the National Forest Service and the \n     Secretary of the Interior with respect to lands under the \n     jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, shall use the \n     best available scientific and commercial data in amending or \n     revising resource management plans for offering sales, \n     issuing leases, or otherwise authorizing or undertaking \n     management activities on lands under their respective \n     jurisdictions provided that the Secretaries may at their \n     discretion determine whether any information concerning \n     wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving any \n     such plan, sale, lease, or other activity and, if so, the \n     type of collection procedures for such information.\n\n  It seems to me there are fundamentally three subjects involved in \nsection 329. The first is, of course, that it applies only to fiscal \nyear 2000, the year covered by this appropriations bill. The second \nsubject is that the two Secretaries managing these national lands shall \nuse the best available scientific and commercial data in dealing with \nthe plans they have for those lands. I can't imagine that there is any \nobjection on the part of the proponents of this current amendment to \nthat language. The third subject says that the Secretaries may, at \ntheir discretion, determine whether any additional information \nconcerning wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving \nthese plans.\n  In other words, section 329 doesn't require these Secretaries to do \nanything. It simply grants them the discretion to act in a reasonable \nfashion.\n  A number of court decisions, pursuant both to the National Forest \nManagement Act and perhaps even more significantly to forest plans \nalready prepared by this Clinton administration and under the \nsupervision of these Secretaries, have stated essentially that before \nany contract is entered with a private organization for the harvest of \ntimber in national forests or on Bureau of Land Management lands, an \nextraordinarily expensive wildlife census must be taken, a census at \nleast as detailed as the census of the people of the United States to \nbe taken next year--on reflection, a census much more elaborate than \nthe census of the people of the United States next year, as we are \ngoing to be asked to spend about $4 billion to count every person in \nthe United States.\n  The cost of carrying out the activities required by our courts on our \nnational forests, if we go forward, would be somewhere between $5 \nbillion and perhaps $9 billion. These are matters that deal simply with \nendangered species. We already have injunctions and orders for the \nFederal Government with respect to protecting endangered species and \nnot allowing them to be harmed by any of these commercial \nactivities. These are, in effect, censuses of everything that exists in \nthe forest, vertebrate and invertebrate, plant and animal species -- \nthe entire works. There are, of course, other decisions on the other \nside of this issue. Section 329 attempts to deal reasonably with these \nrequirements.\n\n  The very groups that brought these actions, various environmental \ngroups, have made two arguments over the course of the last 10 or 12 \nyears that perhaps predominate over the balance of their arguments. The \nfirst is that we should stop engaging in timber sales in which the \nFederal Government--either the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land \nManagement--lose money; that below-cost timber sales are not a wise \ninvestment of the resources of the United States of America. At the \nsame time, of course, they advocate positions, and have succeeded in \nfront of some courts with those positions, the net result of which will \nbe that there can never be a timber sale that is not below cost. The \ncost of any one of these surveys on any public lands will exceed the \nvalue of the timber located on the land. That, of course, in turn, is \nin pursuit of the second goal of many of these environmental \norganizations, specifically including the Sierra Club, and that goal is \nthat there should be no harvest, no harvest under any circumstances, on \nany of our public lands of any of our timber resources. That is a \nformal position of many of the environmental organizations including \nthose that have been plaintiffs in this litigation.\n  The net result of these decisions is the success of that latter \npolicy. The United States of America is not going to spend $9 billion, \nor $5 billion, engaging in these particular surveys. It is not a \nprovident expenditure of our money. There is no money in this \nappropriations bill for such elaborate courses of action under any set \nof circumstances.\n  As a former head of the Forest Service under President Clinton, Jack \nWard Thomas said: This whole idea is designed to make this survey and \nmanagement system unworkable. Scientists are not looking for these \ncreatures in the first place. The Clinton forest plan, which has \nreduced by about 80 percent harvests on the public lands--in the \nPacific Northwest, in any event, it already set aside 84 percent of our \nnational forests essentially as wildlife refuges. The other 16 percent \nhas been considered by this administration for a harvest in the Pacific \nNorthwest of about 1 billion board feet a year. This was the \nPresident's forest plan, his promise in his campaign in 1992 to the \npeople of the Northwest, somewhere between one-fifth and one-sixth of \nwhat was the historic harvest.\n  The President has not been able to keep that promise, even using his \nadministration's present forest policies. He has not reached that \nparticular goal. The harvest under these decisions will be zero because \nthe cost of preparing the sales will simply be too great.\n  This is not a policy--the policy of the present enjoined forms of \nwildlife surveys--that comes from an administration that has been hell-\nbent for leather to harvest trees in the forests either in the Pacific \nNorthwest or in the Southeast, the location of the 11th Circuit, by any \nstretch of the imagination. Nor is this discretion being given to \nofficials in the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the \nInterior who are bound and determined to cut the last tree. This, I \nwant to repeat, is a 1-year provision--that is to say it will apply \nonly through most of the rest of the Clinton administration--granting \ndiscretion to the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, to use their present relatively reasonable \nsystems of determining whether or not some small portions of the 16 \npercent of the national forests not set aside for wildlife purposes can \nbe the subject of timber harvesting contracts. It does not require the \nadministration to follow exactly the procedures it has been following \nwith the Northwest forest plan and its plans for other forests at all. \nIt simply says if in their discretion they think they have done enough, \nthey can go ahead and meet their own very modest goals of at least \nproviding a modest harvest of our timber in our national forests. That \nis all. It is neither more nor less than that. It is not a mandate. It \nis authority to very green, very pro-environmentalist Departments of \nAgriculture and Interior to engage in activities of this nature.\n\n  It is very clear the goal of these lawsuits and the goal of the \norganizations that have brought these lawsuits is not to get these \nsurveys done. The goal is to see to it that the cost of entering into \npreparing for any contract for the harvest of timber is so high that \nnone of them will be worth doing. But the effects of those lawsuits, \nand therefore the effects of this amendment, do not apply only to \ntimber harvesting contracts by any stretch of the imagination. They \nwill apply to any new or different use of any portion of our national \nforests and of our BLM lands. They will apply equally to the building \nof campsites or the improvement of campsites or other recreational uses \nof the forest system itself. As a consequence, the effect of these \npresent lawsuits is to make de facto wilderness areas out of all of our \nnational forest areas and to prohibit any improvement for human \nrecreation, other than that allowed of wilderness areas itself, as well \nas of any timber harvest. It is an extraordinary set of policies that \nare essentially advocated by the Robb\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\namendment, a set of policies based on the proposition from some \nnational environmental organizations that there should be no productive \nuse, no economically productive use, of our national forest system \nwhatsoever.\n  The section 329, which really should not have been contested at all, \nis simply to grant this Clinton administration, for 1 year, the right \nto go ahead with the extremely environmentally sensitive forest plans \nthat it has structured during the course of the last 6 years, not only \nin the Northwest part of the United States but in the Southeast part of \nthe United States and Texas and in every other place, either BLM lands \nor Forest Service lands, and allows them to go ahead. If the President \ndoes not want them to go ahead, if the policies are those advocated by \nthese organizations in these lawsuits, nothing in this section 329 \nprohibits them from adopting those policies. But what it does require \nis that it will require the President to say: Whatever I told the \npeople of the Northwest, whatever I told the people of other parts of \nthe country about a balance, about the proposition that there were \ncertainly some of our national forests that were appropriate for \nproductive use, for the provision of jobs and for the provision of \ntimber resources of the United States, I now have changed my mind. We \nare not going to do it at all.\n  If he wants that as a policy, it is not barred by section 329. But he \nwill not be able to hide behind a court decision and say he is trying \nto do something and trying to abide by a court decision that is \nimpossible, that sets conditions that are impossible economically to \nmeet. We are not going to spend the amount of money necessary to \nconduct these surveys. The surveys are not needed. They are not worth \nit. We either choose to deal reasonably with these issues and allow \nthis President and this administration to conduct the modest harvests \nthat they have thought were appropriate, or we are saying we are not \ngoing to have any harvest at all, and in all probability we aren't \ngoing to have any new recreational activities on our national forests \nas well.\n  Simply stated, that is the issue: Do we trust this administration not \nto go overboard in the nature of harvesting, do we believe this \nadministration to be environmentally oriented or not?\n  Most of us, and I think I speak for the Presiding Officer as well as \nmyself, do not think these forest plans are appropriately balanced as \nthey are, but they do provide for some economically productive use of \nour forests, a productive use that is totally barred under these \ncertain court decisions, whether they are correct or not correct, and \nwhich we allow the administration to politely and courteously either \nabide by or say no, we have a better and more balanced way of doing it.\n  I think it is overwhelmingly appropriate to reject this amendment, to \ntrust this administration not to go overboard in timber harvests by any \nstretch of the imagination, and to allow it to keep the promises it has \nmade for a period of more than 6 years to the people of timber-\ndependent communities all over the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1621\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for recognition. I misspoke earlier. I \nwish to speak to the Bond amendment, not the Robb amendment.\n  The Bond amendment is another one of these legislative riders on \nspending bills. It is an attempt to change environmental policy with an \namendment to the appropriations bill for the Department of the \nInterior. The reason it is being done this way, of course, is it avoids \nany committee hearing, any opportunity for any witnesses or public \ninput.\n  There are seven, eight, or nine different environmental riders that \nhave been attached to this spending bill. The administration has \nindicated that unless they are removed, there is a strong likelihood \nthat an otherwise good bill will be vetoed by the President because \nriders, such as the one I am about to address, go way too far.\n  One might wonder why I am addressing the issue of a national forest \nin Missouri since I represent the State of Illinois. I am from \ndownstate Illinois. I was born in East St. Louis, and the Ozarks are an \nimportant recreational area for everyone who lives in the region. It is \nnot only a regional treasure but a national treasure which has been \nrecognized by a designation as a national forest.\n  Last year, the attorney general of Missouri, Jay Nixon, joined \nenvironmental groups in petitioning the Secretary of the Interior \nasking him under his authority, under the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act, to remove from access to mining 400,000 acres in the \nMark Twain National Forest.\n  Those of us who live in that region know this is an especially \npopular area of the Ozarks. The watersheds of the Current, Jacks Fork, \nand Eleven Point Rivers are in this region. Many of my friends and \nfamily go to the Ozarks for canoeing. They love it because of its \npristine beauty, and they believe the attorney general, Jay Nixon, was \ncorrect when he petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to preserve \nthis area and to stop it from being used for lead mining.\n  This is Federal public land that a private company, a lead mining \ncompany, wants to come in and mine for profit. The Interior Department \nhas the authority to say no, it is important environmentally and we \nshould not allow this kind of commercial use. That is what they would \ndo were it not for the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, wants to remove the authority of \nthe Department of the Interior to protect the Mark Twain National \nForest from lead mining. Is this a popular concept? It probably is with \nsome companies. Not only the attorney general of Missouri but the \nGovernor of Missouri has written protesting this action being taken by \nthis Bond amendment.\n  Governor Mel Carnahan from Jefferson City, MO, has written and said:\n\n       I believe you will agree the watersheds of the Current, \n     Jacks Fork and Eleven Point rivers are among the most \n     beautiful and pristine areas of Missouri. These crystal clear \n     streams are great recreational assets which should be \n     protected for future generations to enjoy.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The environmental risk of lead mining and potential for \n     toxic contamination of these pristine waterways are well \n     understood. The Interior Secretary's authority to \n     protect sensitive public lands should be preserved.\n\n  He says to my colleague from Missouri:\n\n       I respectfully request you withdraw your amendment.\n\n  But that amendment has not been withdrawn. It will be voted on \ntomorrow.\n  I can say further there are groups across Missouri that oppose this \ninvasion of a pristine area, a watershed of the Mark Twain National \nForest, for the purpose of lead mining. The St. Louis Post Dispatch, \nthe largest newspaper in the State, has editorialized against this and \nhas said, frankly, that this is an effort to allow this company to come \nin and mine an area which is of critical importance to the people of \nMissouri.\n  The Kansas City Star, an equally influential paper, has come to the \nsame conclusion that the Bond amendment is a mistake, a mistake which \nthreatens the watersheds of the crystal clear streams of the Current, \nJacks Fork, and Eleven Point Rivers.\n  For those who believe this lead mining operation is somehow \nantiseptic and will not leave a legacy, I say they are wrong, and the \nscientific studies have proven that. We know what is going to happen if \nwe allow these companies to come in and mine lead in this beautiful \narea. We know the potential for contaminating the streams. We know the \npotential for leaving behind the waste from their mining operations.\n  Some might argue that it is worth it because it creates jobs, and yet \nstudy after study reaches the opposite conclusion.\n  This is primarily a tourist area, a recreational area recognized all \naround the Midwest. To defile it with lead mining to create a handful \nof jobs for mining purposes is to jeopardize the attraction of this \narea for literally thousands of people in the Midwest and across the \nNation. That is why it is such a serious mistake. I daresay if this \namendment had been offered on an ordinary bill, there would have been a \nlong line of people to come in and testify, not only environmentalists \nwho\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\noppose the Bond amendment, but certainly those who are in authority in \nthe State of Missouri, Governor Mel Carnahan, Attorney General Jay \nNixon, as well as many other groups of ordinary citizens who believe \nthis is a national treasure that should not be defiled so one company \ncan make a profit.\n  On the spending bill for the Department of the Interior, this is \nanother one of the environmental riders designed to benefit a private \ninterest at the expense of American taxpayers who own this public land, \nat the expense of families who enjoy this recreational area, at the \nexpense of people who look forward to a weekend on the Current River \nbecause of its beauty.\n  Frankly, this is a big mistake, and I hope the Senator from Missouri \nwill have second thoughts before he calls it up for a vote tomorrow \nmorning. I hope he will listen carefully to the leaders in the State, \nas well as the environmental groups, who are standing up for one of the \nmost precious resources in Missouri.\n  I hope he will join them in saying the Mark Twain National Forest and \nthe watershed of these great rivers are worth protecting, worth \npreserving, and should not be allowed to be invaded by a lead mining \ncompany that wants to come in and mine on Federal public lands at the \nexpense of this great national resource.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nmotion to strike Section 329 of the Interior appropriations bill. This \nsection is necessary to counter an extremely adverse ruling by the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has just been described by my \ncolleagues, as well as a preliminary injunction recently handed down by \nJudge Dwyer in the U.S. District Court.\n  The case before Judge Dwyer involves the implementation of the \nClinton-Gore Northwest Forest Plan, which was unveiled in 1993. At the \ntime, President Clinton said that it ``provides an innovative approach \nfor forest management to protect the environment and to produce a \npredictable and sustainable level of timber sales.''\n  The real travesty here is that the supporters of Section 329 are \ntrying to fulfill the commitments made by this Administration in 1993, \nand we are now doing so over the objection of the Administration.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan was supposed to be the Clinton \nAdministration's historic compromise between timber harvesting and the \nenvironment. For National Forests covered by the Plan, timber harvests \nwere reduced by 80 percent. Apparently, that wasn't enough for those \nwho want no timber harvests, because they are again challenging \nimplementation of the Plan in Court.\n  While Judge Dwyer issued a preliminary injunction against the sales \ndirectly challenged in the case, the effect of his August 2, 1999, \nruling is much broader.\n  The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have made a \ndecision not to award any previously-auctioned sales until the lawsuit \nis resolved. Further, the agencies do not plan to offer any additional \nsales until their supplemental EIS on survey and manage is completed \nand approved.\n  While the Forest Service claims this will be completed by February of \n2000, history tells us that this EIS will be appealed and litigated. In \nfact, the Forest Service hasn't produced a region-wide EIS for the \nNorthwest for 10 years that hasn't been litigated.\n  The current or planned sales affected by Judge Dwyer's ruling contain \nabout 500 million board feet of timber. Since there will be no future \nsales until the EIS is completed, the total volume affected could be 3 \ntimes that high.\n  Further, because many of these sales have already been awarded, if \nthey are enjoined and operations are delayed, or if the government is \nforced to cancel these sales, the government will be potentially liable \nfor hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\n  Because so little volume has been sold to date, and is therefore \navailable to purchasers, the injunction of this volume will lead to \nimmediate mill closures, increasing the government's liability for \ndamages.\n  The issue in this case involves the Administration's implementation \nof one part of the Clinton-Gore Forest Plan, concerning surveys for 77 \nrare species of fungi, lichens, mosses, snails, and slugs, and for a \nsmall mammal called the red-tree vole. Six years into the 10-year plan, \nthe agencies still do not know how to conduct surveys for 32 of the \nrare species.\n  None of these species is threatened or endangered. Although these \nsurveys are only one piece of the Plan, the consequences of the case \nare potentially enormous.\n  The real fallacy of the survey and manage requirement is that we are \nonly going to survey on those lands where ground-disturbing \nactivities--such as recreational improvements and timber sales--are \nplanned. In the National Forests covered by the President's Plan, this \namounts to about 12 percent of the total forest base that is still \navailable for multiple use.\n  This is not going to tell us about the overall health of these \nspecies, since we aren't going to be looking for these species in the \nremaining 88 percent of the land base.\n  Unfortunately, it could also apply to needed forest restoration \nactivities such as prescribed burns and reforestation on other selected \nparts of the forests, thereby delaying these activities and increasing \ntheir costs.\n  It is unfortunate that the Clinton-Gore Administration ever included \nthis provision in the Northwest Forest Plan.\n  But having done so, it is a travesty that the Administration's \nfailure to effectively implement the plan has resulted in another \ninjunction that will further erode our timber communities.\n  With respect to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, it \nrequires surveys for all ground-disturbing activities.\n  This means not only timber sales, but recreation improvements and \nforest management activities. Some preliminary cost estimates put the \nnationwide implementation of the Eleventh Circuit court ruling at $9 \nbillion. It is a Trojan horse rolled in by candidate Clinton to destroy \nan industry.\n  Therefore, we should make the public policy decision that we will \nallow forest managers to use the best available commercial data in \namending or revising resource management plans, as Section 329 \nstipulates.\n  This is the standard for data under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The language in Section 329 does not preclude the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture from gathering additional data.\n  It simply gives the Secretaries more discretion to meet land \nmanagement objectives in a timely manner.\n  Section 329 is designed to give the Clinton administration officials \nexactly the flexibility in land management that they argued for in \ncourt.\n  I am deeply saddened that in the face of the economic crisis about to \nbe visited on my constituents, the President isn't 100 percent behind \nretaining this language.\n  This isn't an agonizing choice for me at all. If I have to choose \nhere between surveying for red tree voles or keeping hundreds of \nOregonians employed in family-wage jobs, I will vote for families.\n  I know that there are those who don't think the language in Section \n329 is the best language possible.\n  I will commit to work with my colleagues and the Administration to \nsee if we can improve this language. But I will strongly oppose efforts \nto strike it.\n  I urge anyone who has a National Forest in their State to support \nretention of Section 329.\n  If the Eleventh Circuit Court ruling is ever applied nationwide, we \nwill have tied the hands of professional land managers with an \nexpensive, time-consuming and ineffective requirement.\n  I believe my colleague from Virginia has the best of motives, but I \nonly wish he could go with me to rural Oregon and see the human \nconsequences of what he proposes.\n  I began my political career in 1992 running for a rural seat in the \nOregon State Senate. It was the same election year that now-President \nBill Clinton sought the Presidency. I watched as an opponent of his \ncampaign with admiration for the skill with which he came to my State \nand reached out to those in the rural communities and made some very \ndramatic promises, some promises which he said would protect\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\nthe environment and ensure a sustainable harvest of timber.\n  He carried my State. He carried your State, Mr. President, with these \nsame promises because a lot of people wanted to believe in him.\n  I have noted with great interest that recently the President --and I \napplaud him for this--has gone to rural Appalachia. I don't know \nwhether he went to parts of the State of the Senator from Virginia. I \nknow he went to West Virginia, and he decried poverty levels that are \nlamentable and awful. But there are parts of my State as a result of \nhis forest policies which are in worse shape than those he visited in \nAppalachia.\n  I rise today with a lot of emotion in my heart because I think the \ntruth has not been told and promises have not been carried out.\n  I have recently come from a town hall meeting in Roseburg, OR, where \npeople are finally looking at oblivion because their jobs are directly \ndependent upon the sales that have now been enjoined by Judge Dwyer in \nthe district court of the Ninth Circuit.\n  I hope I can reach the heart of every one of my colleagues because \nthis stuff matters in human terms. I wish they would have a more honest \napproach and say: We don't want any more harvest of timber; let's shut \nit all down. At least that would be honest. This isn't.\n  I wish they could see the kids in John Day, OR, who go to school 4 \ndays a week because they can't afford to open the school for 5. I want \nmy colleagues to understand what they are voting for. If you distill \nthis down, this is about pitting a survey of fungus, snails, and slugs \nagainst children and families who need streets and schools.\n  Now, lest you think the last pine tree in Oregon is about to go down, \nI am sorry to disabuse you. You can't stop timber from growing in my \nState. We went to the CRP area not far from where I live. There are \nwheat fields that formerly were in wheat that were left to go to \nnature, and there are Ponderosa trees going up everywhere. They are 12 \nfeet high now.\n  I know what the New York Times says. I know what the Washington Post \nsays. But like some of my colleagues, they have never been to my State. \nThey have never looked into the eyes of the schoolchildren who, \nfrankly, don't have an adequate education because the Federal \nGovernment made promises to them and their county officials and their \nschool officials that are being denied to them in a very dishonest and \ndisingenuous way.\n\n  I am angry. It is not right. It is not right to go win an election \nand then supposedly put up a program that is to provide for the \nenvironment, to provide a sustainable yield, and then through \nsubterfuge make sure it doesn't happen, when you have a year to go in \nyour term, when you are decrying poverty elsewhere in this country, but \nyou are creating it in my backyard.\n  I don't think the Senator from Virginia would offer this motion to \nstrike if he could go with me to Roseburg, OR. It has been a long time, \nhas been a lot of heartache, a lot of pain, but it is getting old. It \nis almost over. Here you and I are defending the President's plan, \ntrying to help him live up to his promises. I want the American people \nto know that the Clinton-Gore forest plan, at the beginning at least, \nwas honest enough to say: The traditional harvest you have had, we are \ngoing to cut it by 80 percent, by 80 percent. The reality is, it is not \neven 10 percent of what is delivered, and now what we are seeing is \nthere is going to be nothing delivered.\n  That isn't right. A sustainable yield of 20 percent is all that was \npromised, and yet even that apparently is another mirage.\n  Well, I know the President wishes we didn't have to do a rider, but \nit is the only tool left because we are running out of time. Your \nproposal is for a year to allow the Federal courts to allow these sales \nto go forward. Without the Clinton-Gore forest plan, these sales would \nbe fine; these meet the Endangered Species Act, but somehow in the \ncreation of this plan, they have put in a survey system that isn't \neconomical. It isn't going to happen. It isn't even necessary. It is a \nfraud. It is a way to undermine their own promises.\n  Well, history tells us this is not going to happen now. I regret to \ntell the people of rural Oregon that the Clinton forest plan is a \nfailure to them.\n  Another irony. I heard my colleague from Virginia say he read a \nletter from the Forest Service about their new-found position on this \nissue. Why didn't they argue that in court? If it was an argument to be \nmade a month ago, why isn't it still a good argument. They have \nreversed course. Why? Is it only about politics? I think people are \nsick of that. I think people are ready to be told the truth, and they \nthought they had been told the truth by the President, at least when it \ncame to his forest plan. I regret to tell them that apparently they \nhave not been.\n  What is at stake? In Judge Dwyer's ruling, about 500 million board \nfeet of timber. By the way, to my colleagues on the other side, if you \nthink by killing the forest industry in this country you are somehow \nsaving the environment, you are the best friend the Canadians and the \nNew Zealanders have ever had because the U.S. demand and use of timber \nis not going down. It is going up. We have just exported those jobs. So \nwe pat ourselves on the back that we somehow have taken care of our \nforests, even though it is growing at record rates and subject to \ncatastrophic fire. Even though we pat ourselves on the back, we are \npillaging our neighbors' land.\n  I am simply saying, the promise of the President to have a \nsustainable harvest and a good environment are possible, but it isn't \npossible with this. We are trying to help the President make it \npossible.\n  I am saying what is being asked for by the courts now, as required by \nthe Clinton-Gore forest plan, is a survey for 77 rare species of fungi, \nlichens, mosses, snails, slugs, and for a small mammal called the red \ntree vole. Well, the agencies don't know how to conduct these things. \nThey don't even know some of these species. The amount of land that is \nat issue is 12 percent of 100 percent of the land, so 88 percent of the \nland is not going to be surveyed, only the area where they are digging \naround. No one contends that any of these things are endangered at all. \nWhat is endangered is rural people, creating a new Appalachia with \nchronic poverty. We are doing it in my State while he decries it in his \nState. That isn't right, not when they have been promised something \nbetter.\n  I conclude my remarks by pleading with my colleagues not to put in an \nartificial requirement that we will not fund, which is not necessary \nand which can be adequately provided for, by the way you described it, \nby giving to the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture the power \nto do what they already do under the Endangered Species Act, by giving \nthem that power and allowing these things to go forward and keeping \nsome promises. Why don't we keep some promises around here?\n  I want my colleagues to know this is about a survey versus families. \nIt is about snails and slugs versus streets and schools. I ask you to \noppose the motion to strike this amendment. What is being done here is \nwrong. It has human consequences, and we in this Senate ought to be \nbigger than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the impassioned \nplea of my friend from Oregon. Last week, we sold a lumber mill in \nMontana. Darby Lumber went down because they could not get logs. Mills \nare hauling logs in from Canada, 500 miles, and it is like my friend \nfrom Oregon said--we are decimating our neighbors' lands because we \nhave not had the nerve to be honest with the American people.\n  To give you an idea, up in the northwestern part of Montana, we are \ngrowing about 120 million board feet of lumber a year. The Forest \nService makes plans to harvest about 19 million board feet. The truth \nis, America, we will be lucky if we harvest 6 million board feet.\n  Opposition to section 329 flatly contradicts previous positions taken \nby the environmental community and this administration on the best \nmethods for protecting wildlife. Section 329 would restore to the \nadministration the authority to plan and account for wildlife \nprotection by surveying habitat--a method employed for over two decades \nand that has been approved by seven Federal courts, including three \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\ncourts of appeal. The recent Eleventh Circuit decision contradicted \nthis consensus judicial opinion and would require the agency to provide \nprotection to wildlife by counting--not once but twice--the number of \nmembers of each of 20 to 40 management indicator and sensitive species \nbefore undertaking any ground-disturbing activities in our national \nforests--be it timber harvesting, be it watershed restoration, be it \ntrail building, be it maintenance, or be it for the prevention of fire. \nI guess this is one reason you can't run a pretty good ranch or a \npretty good farm that depends on renewable resources by a committee, \nfor the difference of opinion on how we should do things. If left to \nthat, we would never get in a crop. America would never have a \nsubstantial, sustaining supply of food.\n\n  The emphasis the Forest Service has placed on habitat availability \ninstead of counting the members of individual species is exactly the \npolicy advocated by the environmental community. I wonder, at this time \nwhen they change the policy, what is the motive here? What is the \nmotive? Is it us against them? I don't think so. I don't know of \nanybody who stands in this body to decimate the environment. But I \nwonder, of all the fires that are burning in the West today, if a \nlittle management on fuel buildup could not have prevented some of \nthose. But somebody thought a mouse was too important that we can't \ndisturb the land, and it burns.\n  Virtually every environmental organization has insisted the law be \nreformed to address habitat protection and away from narrow species-by-\nspecies focus. Indeed, the provision in the Endangered Species Act that \nthe environmentalists most frequently quote in both the Senate and the \nHouse, and in Federal courtrooms across the country, is the first \nphrase in the statement of purpose in section 2(b):\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby \n     ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened \n     species depend may be preserved.\n\n  Now, we can argue on philosophy, but I think we are arguing on \npolitics, and what is at stake is families. Also, what is at stake is \nthe forest itself. I invite the Senator from Virginia to go with me \nthis weekend. I will take him up in the Yak, where we have infestation \nof the pine beetle, dying trees, and a forest that would just shock \nhim. It would absolutely shock him to his shoes. He would be \ndevastated, looking at that forest. Yet the environmental community has \nmade up its mind that we are not going to harvest; we are going to let \nit burn. I don't think that is why the Senator from Virginia wore the \nuniform as long as he did, to protect that kind of mismanagement of the \ncountry he so loves, or even the people he so loves.\n  The administration has been even more adamant in insisting on a \nhabitat approach to wildlife protection. That is what they told us when \nthey first came to office. It has championed two land management \nconcepts--ecosystem management and biological diversity protection--\nthat rely entirely on methodologies which concentrate on habitat rather \nthan individual species. Certainly, ecosystem management is a fancy way \nof saying habitat management. I don't have very many of those fancy \nwords; I have to write them down.\n  But it is funny what you can see from horseback. Sometimes you can \nsee over tall mountains and tall buildings and over very high-minded \nideas that don't work. They have never worked; they never will work. \nSo, too, when biological diversity is considered, conservation \nbiologists insist on treating habitat as the source of wildlife and \nplant diversity and resist focusing on individual species. They have \nalways done that.\n  We have embraced that philosophy and that approach. That means we can \ndo something about managing our land in the highest standard of \nenvironmental protection and still harvest the crop with which the God \nabove has so blessed this country.\n  Finally, the capstone of this administration's wildlife policy is the \nhabitat conservation planning and incidental take, permitting it is \nconducting with private landowners helping them provide habitat for \nendangered species.\n  How can a man stand here and even talk about endangered species when \nyou have only one crop that you get paid once a year for and you see \nwolves killing right out of your own pasture not 300 feet away from \nwhere you live? And there is not a thing you can do about it.\n  Does anyone want to go out and face that man and tell him and his \nfamily, well, we have some folks that like to hear that yipping and \nhowling? After they get done with their kill, they will go across the \ncreek, which is only about 400 yards, and they will lay there and they \nwill rest until they get hungry again. That is almost unbelievable to \nme.\n  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about \nsomething that doesn't work. We are talking about people who are very \nsmart and very intelligent but have little or no wisdom--higher than \nthee, elitist--who prevent men and women who were born of the soil, \nborn of the land, worked the land, and will die and go back to the \nland. I guess one could say we are all just circling the brink because \nthat is where we are going to go. Maybe you never know how that is \ngoing to turn out.\n  Despite the solid momentum away from attention to single species and \ntoward consideration of habitats, we now see the very advocates of this \napproach criticizing it in their attacks on section 329. I wonder how \nthey will feel when they are successful in stripping 329 from the bill \nonly to discover that the U.S. Forest Service--one of the first \nagencies to adopt a habitat approach to wildlife protection--must now \nabandon it to follow the expensive--in fact, it is too expensive. We \nknow that the money will never be appropriated. So it will not be done. \nIt is an outdated process of counting individual members of one species \nafter another, like I said, not once but twice. I am just asking that \nwe have an attack of common sense--just common sense, everyday common \nsense that the rest of America uses every day just to subsist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to visit with my \ncolleague from Virginia who has offered an amendment to strike section \n329 of the Interior appropriations bill. I am pleased that he is on the \nfloor. I am extremely pleased that he listened with great attention to \nthe Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Montana, and that he will \nlisten to this Senator from Idaho whose State is 63 percent owned by \nthe Federal Government and whose policy as to how those lands are \nmanaged is determined on the floor of the Senate by this Senator, the \nSenator from Virginia, and others.\n  I listened to the Senator this afternoon as he offered his amendment \nto strike section 329. I must tell you that I listened with a degree of \nfrustration, certainly in no disrespect to the Senator, but to what I \nsensed was a lack of understanding of what has brought us to this issue \nand why the Appropriations Committee found it necessary at this moment \nin time to speak out and to clarify public policy that the Senator from \nVirginia is trying to undo.\n  The Senator from Montana, the Senator from Oregon, myself, and others \nfrom large public land and forest States have grown tremendously \nfrustrated not by just this administration but by public policy that \nputs all of us at odds. That arguably does not provide the kind of \nenvironmental protection many of us would like and that would allow the \nbalance between environmental protection and under that important \numbrella the effective use or utilization of our resources like timber.\n  So we had a judge in the Eleventh Circuit who probably really has \nnever been West, nor does he understand the West, make a ruling on a \nground-disturbing activity of the Forest Service on its lands and say \nthat you haven't studied thoroughly enough how that activity \ncontributes to the demise of a plant, a fungus, a slug, a snail, or an \nexotic animal. This judge went against decades of science, and even \nnine court decisions that had largely said the Forest Service was doing \nan adequate job in its overview of the endangered species \nresponsibility under the Endangered Species Act through an \nenvironmental impact study.\n  The Senator from Oregon was talking about the judge's decision in the \nEleventh Circuit being picked up by the\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\njudge in the Ninth Circuit, and without any real consideration, just \narbitrarily spreading across the pages of his decision: Well, if it is \ngood enough in the Eleventh Circuit, it is good enough in the Ninth.\n  Ironically, in the Ninth Circuit, what the Senator from Oregon was \ntalking about was the most comprehensive, above the level of science \nthat has been practiced, reviewed, and mandated under the President's \nown forest plan. There was a comprehensive effort between the Forest \nService and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine \nFisheries that all aspects of the disturbance would be studied before \nthese timber sales or other activities would go on.\n  As a result of that, I think it is tremendously important for the \nSenator from Virginia to understand--I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee--we did not attempt to do anything extraordinary. We just \ntried to say in public policy that what the judge in the Eleventh \nCircuit had done, what the judge in the Ninth Circuit was doing, and \nwhat a judge in Texas has already picked up on is really outside \nscience.\n  A committee of scientists empowered by this Secretary of Agriculture, \nDan Glickman, just this last year reported back to the Department of \nAgriculture and to the U.S. Forest Service that the science they were \nusing that the judge in the Eleventh Circuit knocked down was the right \nscience--that you use indicator species, that you didn't need to get \nout on the ground and count every plant, or animal, or microorganism.\n  It was unnecessary to do this to determine the kind of impact that a \n``Ground disturbing activity'' would have on the ground. But it was \nvery important for the state of the science involved to use the \nindicator species concept that had been used and upheld in nine \ndifferent court decisions as the right approach.\n  I guess what I am saying to the Senator from Virginia tonight is how \nlong do we fight? How long do we see this kind of conflict that stops \nall kinds of activity before the Senator from Virginia is willing to \nstand up with the Senator from Idaho and do what is our responsibility, \nand that is crafting sound public policy that disallows the courts and \nthe judges from being the public land managers of our States.\n  Yet the Senator from Virginia tonight says: I want the judge to \ndecide.\n  But he didn't really quite say it that way, and it would be unfair. \nWhat he is saying is, let the process continue to go forward.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the chief of the Forest Service is \nnot in the gallery tonight saying to the Senator from Virginia: You \nshouldn't be doing this.\n  What the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, put in this legislation \nallows the Forest Service to continue to do what the courts and a team \nof scientists said is the right thing to do: That is, when you are \ndoing these surveys use the appropriate science, the indicator species, \nin making the determination as to how to mitigate for a surface-\ndisturbing activity. However, the chief of the Forest Service isn't \nhere tonight nor was he willing to stand up and speak out loudly.\n  What this administration I think is saying, and I trust that it has \nto be as reasonably disturbing to the Senator from Virginia as it is to \nthis Senator from Idaho, is continue to work through the court process. \nWe think we can work this out.\n  Ironically enough, their working it out means they have already lost \n3 lawsuits, they have already lost 3 times. They are still saying: \nTrust us, we know how to work it out.\n  Even the forest plan that the President himself staked his public \nland reputation on is in the tank out in Oregon, Washington and \nnorthern California. Thousands of people will be out of work this \nwinter because this President wouldn't stand up and ask his chief of \nthe Forest Service to fight for what he originally said he thought was \nright.\n  He says: Let us work through the court process.\n  How long will it take? We don't know. A year, until after the next \nelection? Possibly.\n  What is most important for the Senator from Virginia to understand is \nthat what is in 329 is not outside the law. Let me read the language:\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service shall \n     use the best available science and commercial data in \n     amending and revising resource management plans for and \n     offering sales, issue leases or otherwise authorizing or \n     undertaking management activities on, land under their \n     respective jurisdiction.\n\n  Where does the language come from? Not out of the mind of the Senator \nfrom Washington who is the chairman of the Interior appropriations \nsubcommittee. It comes out of endangered species law. It comes out of \nthe act itself. It is the operative language that drives the Endangered \nSpecies Act. It is not new language. It is not new law.\n  Then we go on to say,\n\n       Provided that the Secretaries may at their discretion \n     determine whether any additional information concerning \n     wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving any \n     such plan, sales, lease or activities.\n\n  Full discretion to the secretary, to the managing agency. Not new \nlaw. Empowering them to do the right thing with their scientists and \ntheir expertise. That is what we are doing. We are empowering Bill \nClinton. We are empowering Mike Dombeck, the chief of the Forest \nService. Yet they are saying, just work this out through the courts. \nWhat if they lose the fourth time and it is a year from now and nobody \nis in the mills and nobody is working and thousands of people are out \nof work in Oregon, Washington and northern California?\n  Or should we talk for just a few moments about the activities on the \nGeorge Washington and the Jefferson National Forests in the home State \nof the Senator from Virginia? Not much timbering in his home State, but \nthere is a lot of ``people'' activity, a lot of trails, a lot of \nmanagement and road building. Flood control in the Cascade National \nRecreation Area, a contract involved with repair and construction of \nfour bridges and relocation of portions of the trail and stone \nstructures and retaining walls. All of it is surface-disturbing \nactivity; all of it because someone didn't like it, a lawsuit is filed, \nand a judge stops it because the Forest Service doesn't know how to do \nthese kind of things.\n\n  No, not at all. Because the Forest Service didn't examine whether \nrepairing an old trail wall disturbs a lichen or a moss on the wall of \nstone that was originally put there by man himself. That doesn't make \nmuch sense, does it? But that is exactly what striking section 329 will \ndo.\n  I wish the Senator could stand up and say let's abide by science, \nlet's not play this out in the courts anymore. Let's empower the chief \nof the Forest Service and the assistant secretary of agriculture and \nthe President himself. I don't find myself on the floor of the United \nStates very often defending this President. I don't think he has had \ngood public land policy. But in one area where he really tried, now he \nhimself will not even defend his effort. His chief of the Forest \nService is trying to avoid the pressure by environmental groups who see \nthis exactly the way the Senator from Oregon spoke to it this evening: \nA way to turn the forest off.\n  They will not only stop logging, they will turn your forests off. \nThey will attack any surface-disturbing activity, even if it is a \ntrail, a trail head, or a campground that may facilitate the very \ncitizens of the State of Virginia who enjoy their public lands and \ntheir two national forests.\n  As the Senator from Virginia knows, in the mid-1970s we passed the \nNational Forest Management Act. That was to direct the most \ncomprehensive review of every forest in the United States. From that \nwas to come a management plan and a way to execute that plan. The \nSenator from Virginia knows as do I that he and I and the taxpayers \nspent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars developing those plans. It \nwas the most comprehensive land-planning exercise in the history of the \nworld. We developed computer models. We looked at every aspect, every \nwatershed, all of the character and the nature of this public land. It \nwas right that we did so. Our forests now operate under those plans. \nEvery activity was viewed through a grid that determines whether they \nare endangering a species of any kind. That is what I spoke to a few \nmoments ago. However, that whole effort cost a quarter of a billion \ndollars, or near that.\n  What the amendment of the Senator would do, and if the courts were to \nwin--not the policy makers that we\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nwere elected to be, but a judge, an appointed judge who does not know \none thing about the forests in Oregon or Idaho because he is reviewing \nan activity in a forest in the State of Georgia, he is saying get out \nthere on your hands and knees with as many scientists as you can muster \nand count and look at every little tidbit.\n  The Senator from Oregon went through that litany of mosses, snails \nand critters tonight. It is estimated, just estimated, that to do that \nkind of an evaluation on an acre-by-acre basis across the landscape of \nthe public forests of our country would cost 5, 8, or $9 billion \ndollars. The Senator from Virginia knows, as do I, we will not \nappropriate that money. That kind of money doesn't exist and that kind \nof money should never be spent on this kind of activity. The scientists \nwho are good scientists--not judges, and not environmentalists who want \nto see the world shut down--are saying that the standards and the tests \nand the indicator species and the work that is being done today is \nthorough, adequate and responsible. Yet the amendment of the Senator \ndenies that because that is the exact language that was put in this \nsection of the appropriations bill.\n  Why is it important we do it now? We heard from the Senator from \nOregon. I have been to John Day and I have been to Roseburg. Those are \nmill towns. Those are little communities with millions of acres of \npublic timber land around them. The people who live there make their \nlivelihood from logging. It has changed some because logging has \ndiminished dramatically in those areas.\n  But what the action of the Senator from Virginia is doing, if he is \nsuccessful, is it turns off those timber sales, nearly 500 million \nboard feet of timber that would keep those mills operating through the \nwinter and into the spring. Because no longer do we operate on a 3-year \npipeline, they call it, where you have timber adequate in the pipeline \nfor a 3-year period. That ended with the Clinton administration. Now we \nare on nearly a timber sale by timber sale basis.\n  Yet, remember the reduction in timber sales that the Senator from \nOregon talked about? We are not talking about cutting anywhere near \nprevious levels. We have an 80 percent lower cut in 8 years. And even \nthat which this President said was adequate, right, responsible and \nenvironmentally sound, a judge now arbitrarily has taken away. So that \nis why we are on the floor this evening. This is one of the most time \nsensitive amendments, directly relating to jobs and people's well-\nbeing, that is in this legislation.\n  Let me close by one other analysis. I was in one of my communities, \nGrangeville, Idaho County, Idaho, a big county right in the heart of my \nState, with 70-plus percent, 80 percent public lands. In one of those \ncommunities they started their school year with no hot lunch program. \nWhy? Because a huge portion of their budget came from timber sales, the \nTwenty-Five Percent Fund. The Senator may be familiar with it. For \nevery tree that is cut, the counties and the schools got 25 percent of \nthe stumpage fee. We are not cutting trees in that area anymore, even \nthough there are millions of acres of trees there. As a result, the \nschool had to decide whether to have an athletic program or hot lunch \nprogram for the kids. They are struggling, taking donations from the \ncommunity to have hot lunches. I don't know whether that's happening \nanywhere in Virginia, taking donations to have a hot lunch program to \nfeed kids. But the Senator's amendment has an impact on that kind of \ncaring event.\n  I wanted to personalize this because I don't think, when the \namendment to strike came to the floor, there was an understanding of \nthe immediacy of the impact of this kind of decision. It was just some \nneat environmental vote that we would have because that is what a lot \nof the environmental community wants. This is a test vote of some kind.\n  It is not a test vote on anything other than a political idea. It \ndoes not bear out consistently good policy because we have good policy \nin this area. We have scientists from around the world saying we do it \nbetter than anyplace else. Yet a judge simply said no, you don't. You \ndon't do it the way I think it should be done, and therefore I want you \nto do it differently.\n  That is the crux of the debate. There are all kinds of opinions \naround it. But I must say, to an administration that has three times \nlost this battle in court, for them to step up now and say, trust us, \nlet's work it out, without an alternative plan, with the idea we will \nwork it out and get to the point and they lose another lawsuit and we \nare 12 months down the road and the people in Roseburg or John Day are \nnot back to work?\n  It is not impacting my State at this moment. But here is what happens \nin my State. It is like a West Virginia-Virginia relationship. If they \nare not cutting trees in Oregon, even under the President's plan, and \nthese mills are deprived of trees and people are out of work, that mill \noperator comes into Idaho looking for timber sales. He bids up the \nprice well beyond where it ought to be, takes a timber sale out of \nIdaho, puts those logs on a truck and heads them west over the Cascades \ninto Oregon just to keep his people working.\n  So my mill in Orofino, or a place like that, is with less timber at a \ntime when we are hardly cutting any timber. And we have simply pitted \none against another. That is not good policy either. But ultimately \nthat is what can happen and that is what will happen in my State, even \nthough this judge's decision at this moment does not impact us.\n  But failing Congress' ability to establish and clarify this policy \nissue, some group will file a lawsuit and argue on the premise of the \njudge from the eleventh and the judge from the ninth circuit, that \nthose kinds of effective studies were not done on a given disturbing \nactivity in my State. Then it will apply further into my State.\n  Those are the issues. I hope our colleagues are listening tonight. I \nunderstand we will debate this tomorrow some, but we will vote on it.\n  To reiterate, I oppose the amendment by Senator Robb that would \nremove Section 329 of the Interior Appropriations bill. This effort is \nmisguided and I strongly urge my colleagues to understand the need for \nthis Section if our national forests are going to continue to function. \nThe Section simply clarifies that despite recent circuit and district \ncourt decisions, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior maintain \nthe discretion to implement current regulations as they have been doing \nfor nearly 2 decades.\n  During the past two decades, nine separate court decisions have \nbacked the way the Forest Service has been conducting their surveying \npopulations by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population \ndata.\n  On February 18, 1999, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \ndetermined that the Forest Service must conduct forest-wide wildlife \npopulation surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, \nand management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national \nforest plans and on all ``ground disturbing activity''--not just timber \nsales. Never before has such an extensive, and frankly impossible, \nstandard been set by the courts.\n  Another ruling on August 2, 1999, in Federal District Court in \nSeattle, on a similar case, jeopardizes the President's Northwest \nForest Plan, and has already begun to stop most if not all ground \ndisturbing activity in the Northwest.\n  These rulings result in paralysis by analysis. It would require the \nForest Service to examine every square inch of the project area and \ncount every animal and plant--even every insect--before it approved any \nactivity.\n  The cost to carry out such extensive studies--studies which have \nnever been required before--could be approximately 9 billion dollars. \nHow do we do this? Because the Forest Service does contract for \npopulation inventorying on occasion. A population trend survey requires \ntwo studies. If we extrapolate from the $8,000 cost of one plant \ninventory, we reach $38.1 million for the 864,000 acres within the \nChattahoochee National Forest where this decision originated. If \napplied to the 188-million acre national forest system, the cost \nreaches $8.3 billion.\n  We appropriate roughly $70 million for forest inventory and \nmonitoring. Are we prepared to shift the $9 billion necessary for this \nnew standard? If not, this recent interpretation forces the Forest \nService to shut down until the Agency can apply the new standard.\n  The purpose of Section 329 is not to change the court decisions or \nset a\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nnew, lower standard. It is simply to clarify that the existing \nregulation gives the discretion to the Forest Service and the BLM when \ndetermining what kind of surveys are needed when management activities \nare being considered.\n  Some of my colleagues would argue that this is an issue for the \nauthorizing committees to deal with. I agree. This is an issue that \nabsolutely should be dealt with by those committees. They need to \ndetermine whether the agencies have been correctly interpreting their \nregulation for the past 17 years. They need to determine whether it is \nsufficient to inventory habitat, rely on existing population, consult \nwith state and federal agencies and conduct population inventories only \nfor specific reasons.\n  But I argue that the appropriations process should not be made to \nbear the burden while the authorizing committees study the question. \nAll section 329 does is to preserve, for the next year, the status quo \nas it existed on April 8, 1999. Otherwise, our already limited \nresources will be further overwhelmed if we are required to fund this \nnew standard.\n  I urge you to oppose this amendment and support sensible management.\n  We are appropriating roughly $70 million for forest inventory \nmonitoring this year. There is only $70 million in the Federal budget. \nYet it is now estimated that this will literally cost us billions of \ndollars if the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Idaho cannot \nstand up and look some of our radical friends in the eye and say: That \nis not good policy. You are not the policymaker and your lawsuits and \nyour judges are not either. We are. We were elected to craft policy. \nThe Senator from Virginia and I are responsible only if we take that \nkind of leadership position.\n  That is the kind of leadership position that Senator Gorton took in \nthe appropriations bill. He did not go outside the law and he did not \ngo outside practice. He mandated and requested the Forest Service of \nthe United States act responsibly, under the Endangered Species Act, \nand gave them the guidelines to do so. That is what section 329 does.\n  That is leadership. Falling back into the arms of the judge and \nsimply seeking the will of the courts is not. I hope my colleagues \nwould join with me tomorrow and oppose a motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first let me address my colleague and friend \nfrom Idaho, who is one of the four Senators who have spoken against \nthis amendment on the floor and tell him first of all I appreciate the \nsincerity of his remarks and the concern he shows, and his colleagues \nhave shown, for those who face economic hardship because of any \ndecision that might be impacted by the Federal Government. I would have \nto say in particular, with respect to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon talking about some of the people in communities which he has \nvisited, the same phenomena has occurred to all of us at one time or \nanother. All of us truly feel the intense pain that those families \nsuffer. In many cases that suffering comes to them because of \nactivities that have been taken in terms of Federal trade policy, \nsometimes because of innovation in various manufacturing techniques, \nmodernization of equipment--lots of reasons that long and established \ncommunities are adversely affected. Any of us who do not relate to that \nand have a sense of compassion--we may disagree on a particular item at \na particular time, about what is the best way to approach a particular \nchallenge that we face, but I don't think any of us lack compassion for \nthose families or want to be in a position where we are doing anything \nthat hurts more than helps. In this particular instance, I would have \nto say one of the comments made by my friend from Oregon was ``let \nscience decide.'' That is really what is at issue here.\n  We see the issue differently. But in this particular case, science \nhas determined at this point, and the board of scientists the \ndistinguished Senator referred to has suggested, that there are means \nof establishing the health of the forest that will require indicator \nspecies measurement. None of the decisions require counting all \nspecies, every single species. In fact, the only species I am aware of \nthat is measured in terms of every single member of the species is the \nCondor count. That is a truly endangered species. I know of no other. \nThere may be.\n  In any event, we are talking about doing something. The reason these \ncases were decided the way they were and other cases were decided \ndifferently is because the rules that had been established, the plan \nthat had been established by the Forest Service, and that they had \nagreed to follow, wasn't followed.\n  The Northwest forest plan came about in very large part because of \nthe timber wars, the very difficult situation that every Member of the \nNorthwest delegation of this body remembers.\n  As a result of the compromise that was entered into, opened up some \nlogging--I recognize the 80-percent factor the Senator from Idaho and \nothers have used--at least some logging was conducted and the gridlock \nthat had existed prior to that time did not continue. They have been \noperating under this provision, the Northwest Forest Plan since that \ntime.\n  I have heard repeated references to costs that are clearly beyond \nanything anyone associated with the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, or the Agriculture Department would consider possible, or \ncan even understand frankly, because we have claims of $5 billion to $9 \nbillion, and no one in the administration is talking about anything \nthat would cost anything in that range.\n  The essence of the court decisions were on a very limited scope. The \ncourt said, if you tell us that this is the plan you want to put into \neffect, that you agree to put into effect, then the least you ought to \ndo is try to follow that plan.\n  The problem in the Eleventh Circuit, if my memory serves me \ncorrectly, was with 32 of the 37 species, absolutely nothing was done. \nThe court is in the position of saying, we will give great deference to \nthe Forest Service, to other administrative agencies, to regulators, to \nanyone else who is involved, but you cannot simply do nothing and \nexpect us to simply say it is OK not to pay attention to your own rules \nand regulations.\n  That is what both of the cases are about, and that is what \ndistinguishes the cases which trouble the Senators from the Northwest \nfrom the other cases.\n  In the other cases, the judge was able to rule in such a way that the \nlogging could continue, whatever land disturbing operations could \ncontinue. We are not talking about a situation where every single \nspecies, some of which none of us could identify if we were given a \nchart of all the species involved because they are so rare, had to be \ncounted. That is what indicator species are for, to simply be able to \ntrack in some limited way some species as an indication of how all the \nspecies are faring under various changes that might affect those \nparticular forests or those particular areas. That is really all we are \nsaying.\n  In this particular case, the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, the Department of Agriculture, and the heads of those \nagencies have said that section 329 is likely to cost a great deal more \nmoney, is not likely to do exactly what they purport to address but \nhave exactly the opposite effect.\n  In this particular case, the Agriculture Department, the Interior \nDepartment, the BLM, and the Forest Service make it very clear that \nwhat is proposed is more likely to be counterproductive, but that is \nbeside the point. They are acknowledging that a standard has been \nrecognized by the Eleventh Circuit case and that they did not meet that \nstandard. They believe they should be held to the standard, and that is \nwhat they are prepared to do. That is what adaptive management practice \nis all about. This is not the kind of absolute foreclosure that my \nfriends on the other side have represented it as.\n  Plans are underway right now to address the challenges that were put \nto the management agencies by both decisions. I submit the concern for \nthe Ninth Circuit case is considerably greater on the part of my \nfriends from the northwestern part of the United States than the \nEleventh Circuit.\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n  Nonetheless, the decisions simply said to the Federal agency \ninvolved: If you say these are the rules that you are going to follow \nand you agree these are the rules that should be followed, and the \nscientific community has said this is the way we can make the rational \nassessments and achieve the kind of balance that we are looking for, \nthen you ought to do that.\n  I share the frustration. There is always an enormous frustration \nfactor when you are dealing with a situation that seems to be beyond \nthe control of those who are most affected by it. I am particularly \nsensitive to the State of Idaho where so much of the land is owned by \nthe Federal Government, owned by the people of the United States, and \nthat makes this forum for decisionmaking so much more important, in \nmany cases, than it is for other States where the percentage of our \ntotal land, the percentage of our total economic activity is less \naffected by decisions that are made right in this particular Chamber.\n\n  The bottom line again is simply if the agency agrees to a particular \ncourse of action, if the action is rational, and reflects the fact we \nare not using the forest just as a place where logging can be carried \nout, but where recreational and other environmental elements are \nvalued, then that one activity must be balanced against the others.\n  In this particular case, a rational approach has been devised. It is \nflexible. It is being addressed at this particular moment. An \nadditional environmental impact statement is in the process of \npreparation.\n  The only real change that will come about from where the law is now, \nthe only real change is whether or not the public ought to have an \nopportunity to participate and comment on the process. That is the only \nreal change that would be brought about by this particular rider, other \nthan attempting to legislate on an appropriations bill, thus bypassing \nthe administration, regardless of what party is in power, and bypassing \nthe legislative process, bypassing the authorizing committee to which \nthese arguments could be addressed.\n  I am not at all insensitive to the concerns that have been raised by \nmy colleagues who represent this particular area. Indeed, I want to \nwork with them and the Forest Service, the BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, and the Agriculture Department to see if we cannot find \nways to address the specific problems that those communities, \nparticularly those that have no other opportunity for economic \nactivity, are faced with at this particular time.\n  The way to do it is not to put an environmental rider on an Interior \nappropriations bill which bypasses the Federal administrative process, \nbypasses the legislative process, and simply attempts to write into law \nsomething that has not been approved by either section and which is, \nindeed, actively opposed by representatives for both.\n  Mr. President, I see no one else who I believe wishes to address this \nparticular matter. We will have an opportunity to provide closing \narguments tomorrow before this is taken up.\n  I do not believe we have asked for the yeas and nays. I request the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment and \nto express my concerns regarding the increased bureaucratic burden it \nwould place on the backs of America's rural communities. This amendment \nwould require the Forest Service to conduct forest-wide wildlife \npopulation surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, \nand management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national \nforest plans, and in every area of each national forest that would be \ndisturbed by a timber sale or any other management activity. Such a \nrequirement would put a virtual freeze on all Forest Service activities \nand would serve as a death knell for rural economies.\n  For more than fifteen years, the Federal Government has been at war \nover how to manage our Western lands. The result has been 15 years of \ngridlock that not only locks up public lands and threatens the health \nof our national forests, but it also locks up rural economies which \nhave suffered from dramatic economic disruption.\n  Economies in rural communities are not like economies in more urban \nsettings. Rural economies cannot make the kind of rapid adjustments \nthat are available to more populated areas. When a timber company of \nabout 50 people goes out of business in rural America, even though its \nnumber of employees may seem small under urban standards, those fifty \nemployees can make up 20 to 30 percent or more of the local work force.\n  Just as important, however, is the impact that this kind of amendment \nwill have on the future of forest health. The biggest threat facing \nAmerica's forests today is the overriding threat of destruction by \ncatastrophic wildfire. This threat is particularly strong in the West \nwhere our nation receives very little annual rainfall.\n  Without a proactive forest health program that thins out the ever \nincreasing vegetation from our forest floors, we are only setting \nourselves up for disaster.\n  Haven't we learned anything from the debate over the Wilson Bridge? \nWhen local communities decided to improve the Wilson Bridge along the \ninfamous Washington Beltway they learned near the end of their process \nthat they had to go back and complete a full blown EIS. Because of this \nregulatory requirement, the Wilson Bridge now will not be built for \nanother two or three years. In the meantime, traffic will continue to \nback up and it will take longer and longer to navigate around our \nnation's capitol. This kind of regulatory gridlock never used to happen \non the East Coast, but it has been a common occurrence in the West. I \ncan guarantee you, however, that these kinds of regulatory activities \nwill continue until we receive regulatory relief and learn that \nincreased regulation does not necessarily mean we are protecting the \nenvironment.\n  If we are seriously going to protect our environment, we need less \nregulation and more proactive programs particularly on our national \nforests. The worst thing we could do, then, is add to the gridlock and \nadopt this kind of amendment.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for and \ncosponsorship of Senator Robb's amendment to remove the Section 329 \nrider from the Interior Appropriations bill. This rider would undermine \nsound science in wildlife management in my state and across the nation. \nIt would suspend U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management \nrequirements to research and monitor certain wildlife populations, \nintegral requirements that the agencies themselves adopted as early as \n1982. I strongly support this amendment and believe that we should \nremove this rider.\n  Section 329 attempts to overturn a recent court case, Sierra Club \nversus Martin, issued by the 11th Circuit, which confirmed the \nagencies' duties to monitor certain wildlife species in order to make \ncredible and well-informed management decisions. The 11th District \nCourt unanimously ruled that the Forest Service was not properly \nperforming its responsibilities to inventory ``rare'' species in the \nChattahoochee and Oconee National Forests as mandated by its own Forest \nManagement Plan. The court's decision does not expand monitoring \nrequirements, but merely ruled that the absolute failure to collect any \ndata or implement any monitoring of indicator and sensitive species was \nnot legal.\n  Monitoring the health of ``indicator'' and ``sensitive'' species is \nboth sound science and good wildlife management. Indicator species act \nas proxies for other wildlife in the forest. That is why monitoring of \nindicator species was included in the 1982 implementing regulations of \nthe National Forest Management Act and is included as an integral part \nof forest management plans adopted by the agencies. If we ignore what \nis happening to these ``indicators,'' we are ignoring the impacts on \nthe whole forest. Collecting new and important data is the only way to \nensure that our land mangers are using the most up-to-date and accurate \nscientific information. By limiting decisions to ``available'' science \nas this rider would dictate, Section 329 turns a blind eye to the \ninformation we need to make the best possible management decisions.\n  I understand that some argue the best ``available'' definition is the \nsame\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nrigid standard set forth by the Endangered Species Act. While true, \nthis is a complete misrepresentation of the law's intent. The intent of \nbest ``available'' information for Endangered Species is to encourage \nswift listings of animals so that we avoid risking the extinction of \nsuch animals. Associating this definition with determining the status \nof animals in a National Forest section scheduled for timber harvesting \nruns completely contrary to the intent of the Endangered Species Act \nversion which is to protect species. Applying this definition when \nmaking forest management decisions risks the habitat and future of both \n``sensitive'' and ``endangered'' species by not having accurate and \ncurrent data upon which to make these decisions. Each forest manager \nwill be without guidance and our national lands will be managed \naccording to the whims of individuals rather than the interests of the \npublic.\n  In my own state of Georgia, National Forests provide a refuge for \nblack bear, migratory songbirds, native brook trout, and an incredible \ndiversity of aquatic species. Some of these species are already listed \nunder the federal Endangered Species Act. Many more may be listed in \nthe future if we ignore the warning signs. The smart, economical \napproach is to monitor and conserve ``sensitive'' species before they \nreach a crisis state and are listed on the endangered species list. By \navoiding such listings, we have the maximum amount of flexibility and \nthe costs of conservation are low. Unfortunately, Section 329 \ndiscourages land managers from doing just that.\n\n  I understand that, in reaction to the court decision, the regional \nforester for the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests is amending \nits forest management plan and this rider completely short circuits \nthat process. Amending the Forest Management Plan is the proper method \nfor handling these kinds of issues. It allows for Public Comment and \nParticipation and also allows for Sound Science to be utilized and \nreviewed. The Forest Service has stated that this rider, ``Overrides a \nFederal Court Ruling, agency regulations, and resource management plans \nthat require the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain \nand use current and appropriate information for wildlife and other \nresources before conducting planning and management activities.'' Note \nthe language that resource management plans require the agencies to \nobtain and use current and appropriate information. It does not say, \nsee what data you can scrounge up and use that.\n  Considering the Senate's recent debate on Rule 16, it is clear that \nthis rider is attempting to legislate on an Appropriations bill. I \nbelieve that contentious authorizing language such as this should have \nthe benefit of a full review by the authorizing Committee which has \njurisdiction over these matters. These important decisions should not \nbe done through an environmental rider on an appropriations bill.\n  In closing, it is clear that the Forest Service's own National Forest \nManagement Act regulations require monitoring of certain, but not all, \nresident wildlife to ensure that land managers are using the most up-\nto-date and accurate scientific information in their decisions. Now, I \nunderstand that every single species of plant and animal cannot and \nshould not be documented in these inventories. However, I believe that \nin order to protect species from becoming threatened and endangered, \nthe Forest Service must employ effective measuring techniques which \nwill provide accurate estimates. These estimates are critical to making \nsound management decision. I believe that this rider short circuits \nboth the Senate's ability to provide proper oversight and the Forest \nService's process for amending forest management plans.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove this rider and vote in favor of this \namendment. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, seeing my friend from Texas on the floor, \nknowing that she has plans to address another of the pending \namendments, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I do intend to address the issue of my amendment, but \nfirst I ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor be granted \nto William Eby during the pendency of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as was unanimously consented to \nearlier in the evening, Senator Gorton requested that all of the \narguments on the Hutchison amendment be put together. So I ask \nunanimous consent that my remarks be put following the Boxer remarks on \nthe Hutchison amendment, which I think is the next in line, in order to \nkeep them in the same area so that they will follow along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to address some of the \nissues and some of the facts that were misstated by the Senator from \nCalifornia because I think it is very important that the Record be set \nstraight. I attempted to correct the Senator from California while she \nwas speaking, but she preferred to continue to speak, so I want the \nRecord to be very clear on some of these important facts.\n  First, the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois made \nmuch of the testimony of a former executive from Arco who had \ntestified, they said, under oath that oil companies had in fact \nmisstated and actually tried to hide the value of the oil and not pay \ntheir fair share in oil royalties to the State of California and the \nCity of Long Beach.\n  In fact, I am very pleased that they brought that up because the case \nhas actually been settled just in the last couple weeks. In fact, the \nSenators from California and Illinois mentioned that several oil \ncompanies had settled because they, for whatever reason, did not want \nto go forward with the costly litigation. But Exxon decided not to \nsettle, and the Arco employee did testify in the Exxon case, under \noath, that the oil companies were misstating the value of the royalties \nthey owed to the State and to the City of Long Beach.\n  This case went to a jury, a jury in California of 12 citizens. The \njury found that the Arco employee was not credible. The jury of his \npeers determined that the Exxon Corporation had not cheated the \ntaxpayers of California or the City of Long Beach, and they threw out \nthat suit from Long Beach and the State of California. Exxon showed \nthat it had not undervalued its oil. This was a suit for $750 million.\n  So the Arco executive who testified under oath was in fact \ndiscredited in the court, and the jury found that the Arco executive \nwas not persuasive. I say that because so much was made of it, as if \nthe case had gone the other way. But 12 citizens in California got \ntogether and the jury verdict was in favor of Exxon.\n  But having said that, I have said from the very beginning that the \nlawsuits are not an issue. If any oil company did not value correctly \nunder the present law or regulations, they ought to pay. So it has \nnever been an issue. You would think, from the rhetoric of the Senator \nfrom the State of California, that this amendment had something to do \nwith companies not paying their fair share under the present law. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, what we are talking about is changing the valuation of oil \nroyalties. We are talking about unelected Department of Interior \nemployees, who have no accountability, usurping the rights of Congress \nto set tax policy in this country and affect oil jobs to a huge extent.\n  The fact of the matter is, what we are trying to do with the \namendment, with the Hutchison-Domenici amendment, is we are saying we \nwant it to be fair, we want to continue the moratorium until the \nDepartment of the Interior has a fair valuation that accedes to the \nwishes of Congress, because Congress makes the laws. That is the \nprerogative of Congress. That is the responsibility of Congress. And it \nis further the responsibility of Congress to stand up when they \ndelegate authority to a Federal agency to make a rule and that Federal \nagency does not do what Congress intended for it to do.\n  Only Congress can step forward and say: No, we did not intend to \nraise oil royalty rates the way you intend to do it, so we are going to \nput a moratorium on your rule until you do an oil royalty\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nrate that is simpler, fairer, will be right for the citizens of our \ncountry and right for the oil industry that is very important to this \ncountry. So that is what we are talking about today.\n  I did not like the tone of the rhetoric that ``oil is bad,'' that \n``big oil is worse,'' that ``everything about oil companies is bad.'' I \nthought I was back in the 1960s when it seemed that ``business was \nbad.'' Well, business is people. Business is jobs. Business is people.\n  My heavens, why wouldn't we want business to be successful in America \nso that we have jobs in America? Sometimes when I hear people talking \nabout the ``big bad oil companies,'' I think: Do you want more foreign \noil, more foreign jobs, rather than American jobs and American revenue?\n  I think we have a choice here. Those ``big bad oil companies'' are \nthe basis of the California teacher retirement system pension plan. \nThey are a very important part of the stability of retirement for \nCalifornia teachers, and Texas teachers, for that matter, and probably \nIllinois teachers as well, because the big oil companies have been a \nstable source of dividends for maybe 100 years.\n  I don't know when the big oil companies first started, but they have \nbeen good citizens for our country. They are the basis of pension plans \nand retired people's security all over our country, and they do create \nthousands of good jobs.\n  So I do not think we have to beat up on oil companies. They are part \nof our economy and they are part of the security of our country. And, \noh, by the way, since 1953 they have paid more than $58 billion for the \nright to drill on the people's land--$58 billion in oil royalty \npayments.\n  If they did not pay their fair share, I want them to pay their fair \nshare. So talking about settlements and lawsuits is not really an \nissue, even though a jury of their peers in California did find that \nExxon had not cheated in any way.\n  That isn't the issue. The issue is, we want them to pay. In order for \nthem to pay a fair share, they need to be able to know exactly what \nthey owe, and that is why we hope the MMS will simplify the regulation. \nIn fact, the MMS refuses to even abide by its own previous rulings. So \nan oil company that is trying to do the right thing goes to a previous \nruling on how oil is valued in a particular place, in a particular way, \nand the MMS says: No, we are not going to be bound by what we did in \nanother case.\n  That walks away from the value of precedent that is the hallmark of \nour judicial system and the regulatory system in our country. In most \ninstances, the IRS most certainly abides by its previous rulings. They \ngive opinion letters that people can rely on so they can pay their fair \nshare of taxes. Courts set precedents with rulings every day so people \nwill know what the law is and what they must do to comply. Not the MMS. \nThey have one opinion here and one opinion there. Congress asked them \nto make it simpler, and they have gone far beyond what Congress \nintended. It is our responsibility to make sure they do what is right \nfor the taxpayers of America. That is what the Hutchison-Domenici \namendment will assure they do.\n  This is not an industry that has had an easy time in the last year \nand a half. In fact, oil prices have been lower than ever in the \nhistory of our country, adjusted for inflation, $7, $8 a barrel, a lot \nof that because of the glut of imported oil on the market. We have lost \nhalf a million jobs in the oil industry in the last 10 years. We are \nimporting 57 percent of the oil in our country. If we have bad oil \nroyalty principles, it also affects natural gas, which is the most \nimportant substitute fuel in many of our coal burning areas. Natural \ngas is much cleaner, better for the environment than coal. So when you \nstart tampering in a negative way with the oil royalty rates, you also \nare going to affect the price and availability of natural gas, because \nnatural gas, of course, is a byproduct of drilling for oil. If you \ndiscourage our American companies and our American people from being \nable to get our own oil resources, you are also cutting back on our \nsupply of natural gas. That could be dangerous to our economy and \ndangerous to the people who live in our country who depend on natural \ngas to heat their homes.\n  I think it is important we put this in perspective. It is important \nwe look at what we are talking about. Senator Boxer said the new rule \nwould only affect 5 percent of the oil companies, and it would be just \nthe big oil companies. She said she supports small oil companies. Well, \nI hope she will, because if she will, she will support the Hutchison-\nDomenici amendment because it is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that \nwill keep our small producers in business after the devastating effects \nof low oil prices from the last year.\n  In fact, every single oil company is affected. There are 2,400 \nproducers with Federal leases. Only 70 of them are not classified by \nthe SBA as small businesses. All 2,400 are opposed to this new rule \nthat will require them basically to pay taxes on their costs. The small \noil companies that the Senator said she would support are very opposed \nto her position. They are for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment because \nthey don't want a new rule that would second-guess sales of oil at the \nwellhead and make fuzzy exactly when the oil should be valued. They \ndon't want a new duty to market and incur the costs of marketing and \nselling the product and bear the cost without any allowance. They are \nvery concerned about this.\n\n  If Senator Boxer believes that the small oil companies are against \nthe Hutchison amendment, I hope she will talk to them. They will assure \nher that this is going to put one more chink in their ability to create \njobs and continue to drill oil and natural gas in our country, rather \nthan choosing to go overseas where it is much cheaper to do it and \nwhere you don't have to pay as much as we pay in America.\n  I hope very much that she will reconsider, knowing that all of the \nsmall companies are affected by this new ruling.\n  I will read from some of the letters of people and groups that are \nsupporting the Hutchison-Domenici amendment.\n  People for the USA writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: We support your fight to simplify \n     the current royalty calculation system. On behalf of 30,000 \n     grassroots members of People for the USA, I want to thank you \n     for your diligent efforts to bring common sense to royalty \n     calculations on Federal oil and gas leases. Energy Secretary \n     Bill Richardson has suggested that domestic oil field workers \n     look to opportunities overseas. Senator, an administration \n     that talks about kicking American resource producers out of \n     the country has a badly skewed set of priorities.\n\n  That is signed by Jeffrey Harris, Executive Director.\n  The National Black Chamber of Commerce writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The efforts of MMS are, indeed, \n     ludicrous. Collectively the national economy is booming and \n     the chief subject matter is ``tax reduction,'' not ``royalty \n     increase,'' which is a cute term for tax increase. What adds \n     salt to the wound is the fact that despite a booming economy \n     from a national perspective, the oil industry has not been so \n     fortunate and is on hard times. We need to come up with \n     vehicles that will stimulate this vital part of our economic \n     bloodstream, not further the damage.\n\n  That is signed by Harry Alford, President and CEO, National Black \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Citizens for a Sound Economy:\n\n       The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium \n     language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule, with \n     the expectation that the Department of Interior and industry \n     would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to resolve \n     their differences. Unfortunately, more time is still needed \n     for government and industry to reach a mutually beneficial \n     compromise.\n\n  It is signed by Paul Beckner, President.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste:\n\n       Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations \n     bill will provide the time necessary for the MMS and the \n     industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule \n     benefiting both sides.\n\n  It is signed by Council Nedd II, Director, Government Affairs, \nCitizens Against Government Waste.\n  Frontiers of Freedom:\n\n       In a misleading letter dated July 21, 1999, detractors of \n     the Hutchison-Domenici amendment allege it will cost \n     taxpayers, school children, Native Americans and the \n     environment. That is not so. It is time to set the record \n     straight. This amendment does not alter the status quo at \n     all. This amendment says to Secretary Babbitt, spend no money \n     to finalize a crude oil valuation rule\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\n     until the Congress agrees with your proposed methodology \n     for defining value for royalty purposes.\n\n  That is signed by Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax \nReform; George Landrith, Executive Director for Frontiers of Freedom; \nPatrick Burns, Director of Environmental Policy, Citizens for a Sound \nEconomy; Fred Smith, President Competitive Enterprise Institute; Al \nCors, Jr., Vice President for Government Affairs, National Taxpayers \nUnion; Jim Martin, President, 60 Plus; David Ridenour, National Center \nfor Public Policy Research; Adena Cook, Blue Ribbon Coalition; Bruce \nVincent, Alliance for America; Chuck Cushman, American Land Rights \nAssociation; and Malcolm Wallop, Chairman of Frontiers of Freedom.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                          Frontiers of Freedom\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 30, 1999.\n     Re Supporting the Hutchison-Domenici Amendment (a Moratorium \n         on the Proposed Oil Valuation Rule which Prevents \n         Unauthorized Taxation and Lawmaking by the Department of \n         Interior).\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: We are writing to express our \n     support for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment to the FY 2000 \n     Appropriations bill. The Hutchison-Domenici amendment \n     prevents the Department of the Interior from rewriting laws \n     and assessing additional taxes without the consent of the \n     Congress. This role properly rests with the legislative \n     branch, not with unelected bureaucrats.\n       In a misleading letter dated July 21, 1999, detractors of \n     the Hutchison-Domenici amendment allege it will cost \n     taxpayers, schoolchildren, native Americans, and the \n     environment.'' That is not so! It's time to set the record \n     straight--this amendment does not alter the status quo at \n     all. This amendment says to Secretary Babbitt: Spend no money \n     to finalize a crude oil valuation rule until the Congress \n     agrees with your proposed methodology for defining value for \n     royalty purposes.\n       We contend that a mineral lease is a contract, whether \n     issued by the United States or any other lessor, as such, its \n     terms may not be unilaterally changed just because a \n     government bureaucrat thinks more money can be squeezed from \n     the lesser by redefining the manner in which the value of \n     production is established. What royalty amount is due is \n     determined by the contracts and statues, and nothing else. \n     For seventy-nine years the federal government has lived \n     according to a law that established that the government \n     receives value at the well--not downstream after incremental \n     value is added. The bureaucrats at the Interior Department \n     are in effect imposing a value added tax through the \n     backdoor.\n       Bureaucrats are saying that value should be measured in \n     downstream markets hundreds of miles from one's lease, or \n     based upon prices set in futures trading on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange, both of which routinely attribute higher \n     value than exists at the ``wellhead.'' If bureaucrats had it \n     their way, they would assess a tax all the way to the \n     gasoline, ignoring the costs associated with bringing oil to \n     that pump. If Congress intended this, they would have said so \n     in the law.\n       This is nothing short of a backdoor tax via an unlawful, \n     inequitable rulemaking which Secretary Babbitt says is \n     necessary because of ``changing oil markets.'' But, we think \n     his real result and that of his supporters such as Senator \n     Boxer, is to cripple the domestic petroleum industry, and \n     drive them to foreign shores and advance their goal of \n     reducing fossil fuel consumption. This is why they falsely \n     claim that green eyeshade accounts somehow are impacting the \n     environment.\n       The outcry on behalf of schoolchildren is particularly \n     hypocritical. Senator Boxer and Rep. George Miller are \n     responsible for a mineral leasing law amendment in the 1993 \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act which reduces education \n     revenues to the State of California by over $1 million per \n     year--far more than the Department's oil valuation rule would \n     add to California's treasury (approximately $150,000 per year \n     as scored by the Congressional Budget Office). So really, who \n     is harming schoolchildren's education budgets? The oil \n     industry provides millions and millions of royalty dollars \n     each year for the U.S. Treasury and for State's coffers.\n       The ``cheating'' which Sen. Boxer and others allege is \n     unproven. Reference to settlements by oil companies as proof \n     of fraud is improper. When President Clinton settled the \n     Paula Jones lawsuit his attorney admonished Senator Boxer and \n     her fellow jurors to take no legal inference from that \n     payment. We agree. As such, oil company settlements cannot be \n     given precedential value. Who can fight the government \n     forever when the royalty dollars they have paid in are used \n     to fund enormous litigation budgets?\n       Lastly, two employees of the federal government who were \n     integral to the ``futures market pricing'' philosophy \n     espoused in the Department's rulemaking have been caught \n     accepting $350,000 checks from a private group with a stake \n     in the outcome of False Claims Act litigation against oil \n     companies. Ironically, the money to pay-off these two \n     individuals for their ``heroic'' actions while working as \n     federal employees came from a settlement by one oil company. \n     The Project on Governments Oversight (POGO) last fall \n     received well over one million dollars as a plaintiff in the \n     suit. Shortly thereafter POGO quietly ``thanked'' these \n     public servants for making this bounty possible. The Public \n     Integrity Section of the Department of Justice has an ongoing \n     investigation. We find it unconscionable the Administration \n     seeks to put the valuation rule into place without getting to \n     the bottom of this bribe first. The L.A. Times recently drew \n     a parallel with the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920's, but \n     who is Albert Fall in this modern day scandal?\n       The Department's rule amounts to unfair taxation without \n     the representation which Members of Congress bring by passing \n     laws. If Congress chooses to change the mineral leasing laws \n     to prospectively modify the terms of a lease, so be it. It \n     should do so in the proper authorizing process with \n     opportunity for the public to be heard. A federal judge has \n     recently ruled the EPA has unconstitutionally encroached upon \n     the legislature's lawmaking authority when promulgating air \n     quality rules. We are convinced the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in a similar manner, is far exceeding his authority \n     unilaterally by assessing a value added tax.\n       Let Congress define the law on mineral royalties. We \n     elected Members to do this job, we didn't elect Bruce Babbitt \n     and a band of self-serving bureaucrats.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     of the Rio Grande Valley Partnership, I want to thank you \n     once again for your leadership to prevent the Minerals \n     Management Service on the U.S. Department of Interior from \n     finalizing its new oil royalty regulations.\n       Until Congress is assured that they will be fair, the new \n     regulations must work for government and for producers, and \n     not result in litigation, as the proposed regulations would. \n     Uncertainty and litigation just add delays and costs to \n     producers large and small, and to the federal government, and \n     that can make domestic oil and gas production from federal \n     lands less competitive, adversely affective jobs in Texas and \n     other producing areas and reducing royalty revenues to the \n     federal government.\n       Please continue your lead in the fight to stop the Minerals \n     Management Service from making new rules final until they \n     solve the host of problems pointed out by oil producers, \n     large and small.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Summers,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           People for the USA,\n\n                                        Pueblo, CO, July 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the 30,000 grassroots \n     members of People for the USA, I would once again like to \n     thank you for your diligent efforts to bring common sense to \n     royalty calculations and payments on federal oil and gas \n     leases.\n       In their efforts to balance environmental protection with \n     economic growth through grassroots actions, our members (not \n     just those in Texas) always notice and appreciate strong, \n     common sense leadership such as you have shown.\n       We support your fight to simplify the current royalty \n     calculation system. It is already a burden on a struggling \n     domestic oil and gas industry, and the Minerals Management \n     Service proposal simply adds insult to injury. Royalty \n     calculation is not, as Interior Communications Director \n     Michael Gauldin remarked, ``an issue to demagogue for another \n     year.'' With 52,000 jobs lost in just the last year?\n       Worse, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has suggested that \n     domestic oilfield workers look to opportunity overseas. \n     Senator, an Administration that talks about kicking American \n     resource producers out of the country has a badly skewed set \n     of priorities.\n       We appreciate what you are doing to straighten them out, \n     and will back you up at the grass roots any way we can.\n       Again, on behalf of thousands of hard-working American \n     resource producers, thank\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\n     you. If you have any specific suggestions as to how we can \n     assist you, feel free to contact me any time.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Jeffrey P.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Senator, State of Texas, Rm. 284, Senate Russell Office \n         Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The National Black Chamber of \n     Commerce has been quite proud of the leadership you have \n     shown on the issue of oil royalties and the attempt of the \n     Minerals Management Service's, Department of Interior, to \n     levy eventual increases on the oil industry.\n       The efforts of MMS are, indeed, ludicrous. Collectively, \n     the national economy is booming and the chief subject matter \n     is ``tax reduction'' not ``royalty increase'', which is a \n     cute term for tax increase. What adds ``salt to the wound'' \n     is the fact that despite a booming economy from a national \n     perspective, the oil industry has not been so fortunate and \n     is on hard times. We need to come up with vehicles that will \n     stimulate this vital part of our economic bloodstream, not \n     further the damage.\n       We support your plan to re-offer a one-year extension of \n     the moratorium on the new rule proposed by MMS. We will also \n     support any efforts you may have to prohibit the new rule. \n     Good luck in giving it ``the good fight''.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C. Alford,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Citizens for a Sound Economy\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1999.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The 250,000 grassroots members of \n     Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) ask you to oppose any \n     attempts in the Senate to strike the provision in the \n     Interior Appropriation bill that delays implementation of a \n     final crude oil valuation rule.\n       The current royalty system is needlessly complex and \n     results in time-consuming disagreements and expensive \n     litigation. The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) new oil \n     valuation proposal is, however, deeply flawed and would have \n     the ultimate effect of raising taxes on consumers.\n       The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium \n     language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule with the \n     expectation that the Department of the Interior (DOI) and \n     industry would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to \n     resolve their differences. Unfortunately, more time is still \n     needed for government and industry is required to reach a \n     mutually beneficial compromise.\n       CSE recognizes this need and opposes any attempt to halt \n     the moratorium, or curtail efforts to bring about a simpler, \n     more workable rule.\n       Thank you for your attention and efforts, and for your \n     continuing leadership in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Council for Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, we \n     respectfully ask you to oppose any efforts in the Senate to \n     strike the provision in the Interior Appropriations Bill that \n     delays the implementation of a final crude oil valuation \n     rule, unless a resolution between MMS and industry can be \n     reached. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) proposed new \n     oil valuation rules that would eventually raise taxes on \n     producers. The rulemaking effort has involved several \n     revisions to the original proposal, but remains ambiguous, \n     unworkable, and would create even greater uncertainty and \n     unnecessary litigation.\n       Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations \n     Bill will provide the time necessary for the MMS and the \n     industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule, \n     benefiting both sides. The taxpayers have a vested interest \n     in this issue, because the rule proposed by the MMS would \n     lead to an unnecessary administrative burden for both the \n     government and the private industry as auditors, accountants, \n     and lawyers attempt to resolve innumerable disputes over the \n     correct amounts due.\n       Please take this opportunity to prevent the current \n     proposed rule, which benefits no one, from being implemented. \n     We urge you to oppose any amendment to strike the provision \n     for delay of final valuation rule in the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill as it reaches the floor for debate in the \n     full Senate this week.\n       We wish to thank you for your efforts in this matter. Your \n     continued commitment and integrity in the promotion of \n     efficiency and accountability in the federal government is \n     sincerely appreciated. If I can be of further assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Regards,\n                                                  Council Nedd II,\n                        Director, Government Affairs & Grassroots.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from \nCalifornia throwing around numbers such as this has cost the taxpayers \nof America $88 million already, or $60 million already. And I pointed \nthis out to her. I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  FY 2000 INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES--S. 1292, AS REPORTED, PROPOSED\n                            FLOOR AMENDMENTS\n                      [Budget account--in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Pending      Proposed     Difference\n              No.              -----------------------------------------\n                                  BA     O      BA     O      BA     O\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1603--Hutchinson Oil valuation  .....  .....     11     11     11     11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this shows there would be a proposed \ndifference in income of $11 million. In addition to putting that in the \nRecord, I want to say that we have offset that $11 million. I have to \nsay I think it is ludicrous that you would say we think that in the \nfuture you won't get $11 million and, therefore, we need to make up \nthat proposed lost revenue for a tax that has not even been put in \nplace. Nevertheless, that was the ruling we were given, so we did \noffset with $11 million. But it is ridiculous to say that you have to \noffset the tax that hasn't been put in place because you don't know \nwhat businesses are going to pull up stakes and say: It is too \nexpensive to drill with this kind of royalty rate. We are going to go \noverseas and we are going to take our jobs with us.\n  So I am not sure that it would be $11 million, or anything at all. My \nhunch is that we are going to lose jobs and we are going to lose \nincome, and the schoolchildren of this country are going to suffer \nbecause the oil business has not yet recovered from the crisis.\n  Mr. President, on that note, I have to also say that I think it is \nvery important that when we are talking about a proposed rule that \nhasn't been put in place and we are already saying how much will be \nmissed, clearly, there is no concept of how business can work and make \na profit and continue to create jobs. So I am concerned that if we \nraise this royalty valuation, which is a tax on the oil industry, at a \ntime when many of them are on their knees anyway, we are not going to \nhave income of $11 million, or $60 million, or anything else. In fact, \nI think we are going to go into negative income, which is exactly what \nhas happened in Texas in the last year and a half, where schools have \nhad to shut their doors and close down and consolidate classrooms \nbecause they could not make their budget because of the oil income not \ncoming in. We lost $150 million just in the last year in oil royalty \nrevenue in Texas alone. So this is not the time to raise rates.\n  Let's talk about the kind of taxes. We are talking about fairness. In \nfact, we are talking about what we tax. Today, the oil is valued as it \ncomes out of the ground, after it has been cleaned up and is ready to \nbe sold. You take out the contaminants and it is clean and that is \nwhere it is valued. But what the Government and MMS are proposing to do \nis say, no, we want you to go out and get a buyer for the oil and incur \nthe cost of buying; and then we want you to put it in a pipeline and \ntake it to where it is going to be picked up by the buyer, and we are \ngoing to value it there. That is taxing the cost. That just doesn't \nmake sense. That is like saying to McDonald's, whatever you spend in \nadvertising, we are going to tax you that amount. We are going to tax \nyou on your advertising for McDonald's hamburgers.\n  Mr. President, that concept will not fly. It doesn't happen in any \nother industry. Whenever would the Government expect taxes on expenses? \nIt just doesn't make sense. But sometimes I think people I hear arguing \non the Senate floor have never been in business. If you have never been \nin business and have never met a payroll, then you don't really \nunderstand how hard it is to make a profit and create new jobs and do \nright by your employees. I have been in business. I have met a payroll. \nI know how hard it is, especially in a small business. And when the \nprices are $7 or $8 a barrel and the costs are $14 a barrel, you can't \nstay in business very long. And if you can't stay in business very \nlong, there are a lot of people and families who don't have jobs; and \nif you have to lay off people\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\nwho are working at the well, then you also have to lay off people in \nthe oil fields service industry and the oil supply industry because you \naren't going to need the supplies if you are not drilling. And if it is \ntoo expensive to drill in America, you are going to go somewhere else, \nand you are going to create jobs in a foreign country.\n\n  Mr. President, I guess the last thing I will say in refuting the \narguments I heard from the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nCalifornia is that it always seems the tack is to say, well, they don't \nreally care about this issue; they are supporting big oil because big \noil has contributed to their campaigns. I don't go around looking at \nwhether trial lawyers give to other Senators and, therefore, they don't \nvote for tort reform. I don't accuse people of not representing the \ninterests of their States. Of course, I have oil workers in my State. I \nhope I am supported by people who work in my State and live in my \nState. But I would not do anything that would hurt the people of my \nState. The idea that that is connected to campaign contributions I just \nthink is cynical, and I don't think it adds integrity to the debate.\n  You gauge that against a most incredible statement when you accuse \npeople who want to keep jobs in America, who want fair pricing, fair \ntaxing, and fair payment of taxes--you accuse people of having some \nkind of other motive, and then you pick up a magazine called Inside \nEnergy and the Department of Interior communications director says on \nNovember 2 of 1998, regarding the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that \nwould require them to have a fair valuation:\n\n       We are sticking to the position we have taken. It gives us \n     an issue to demagog for another year.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we have heard a lot of demagoguery on this \nissue. I have heard the most outrageous debate and arguments that I \nhave heard on just about any subject on this issue, trying to make it \nseem as if oil companies that are being sued are somehow connected to \nwhether or not we have a fair royalty valuation, trying to mesh those \nissues. That just does not make sense. It does not add to the debate. \nBut to have the kind of demagoguery that we have heard on the floor and \nthen to have the Department of the Interior admit that what they want \nis an issue to demagog, I have to say I think the Los Angeles Times \neditorial proves they did get a demagoguery editorial. I think some of \nthe network television bought into it. I think there has been some very \nunfair coverage because we are talking about Congress standing up for \nits right to tax. If Congress doesn't stand up, who will? Who is \naccountable at the Department of the Interior? It is a matter of \nfairness.\n\n  I am not going to walk away from that responsibility. I know what I \nam doing is right because I know we can have fair taxes of royalty. We \nare talking about an industry that paid $58 billion in the last 40 \nyears in royalty rates. They have given a lot back to this country. \nThey have given jobs. They have paid royalty rates. I want them to pay \nfair royalty rates. I would never stand up and say they shouldn't, or \nif they haven't that they shouldn't be fined. I think they should. But \nwe are talking about people. We are talking about jobs. We are talking \nabout the American economy. We are talking about retirement plans that \ndepend on stable oil companies and the oil industry.\n  I think fair taxation is the responsibility of Congress. That is what \nthe Hutchison-Domenici amendment will assure--fair taxation intended by \nCongress.\n  We will have some more debate on this. I certainly hope in the end my \ncolleagues will not be susceptible to rank demagoguery--to rhetoric \nthat is harsh and not in any way fair. It may be fun to ask questions \nback and forth on the Senate floor indicating that people's motives are \nnot the right motives or are not pure, but that doesn't add to the \ndebate. It is our responsibility to make policy. We are going to do it.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Interior Appropriations bill \nfunds critical programs that are vital to the protection of our \nnation's land and natural resources and supports federal programs for \nNative Americans, as well as several energy and agriculture programs.\n  I commend the managers of this bill for their efforts to keep \nspending in this bill within budget limitations as required by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. Unfortunately, I can still find in this \nbill and the committee report approximately $216 million in low-\npriority, unauthorized or unrequested spending that has not been \nconsidered in the normal merit-based review process.\n  In the usual fashion of appropriations bills and reports, little \nexplanation is provided as to the merit or national priority of various \nprojects receiving earmarks. We are left to imagine the reasons that \ncertain projects, such the Bruneau Hot Springs Snail Conservation \nCommittee or goose-related crop depredation projects in Washington and \nOregon, are deserving of a $500,000 earmark each.\n  I am sure these projects are significant to the communities that \nwould benefit from these directed funds. But we are unfairly singling \nout projects of parochial interest, rather than evaluating other more \nequally deserving projects that could be more significant to the \nprotection of our land, forest or energy resources nationwide.\n  Not only do we undermine the value of our legislative process by this \ntype of arbitrary spending, we betray the confidence of the American \npeople who rely on our fair and equitable judgement to fund those \nprojects of greatest need and priority. Instead, we reward their faith \nby choosing to provide $1 million of taxpayer funds to rehabilitate a \nbathhouse at Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas. I question the \nnecessity of fixing up a public bathhouse when federal school \nfacilities for Indian children are in a deplorable state of disrepair \nand ill maintenance.\n  In a similar fashion, $1 million is earmarked to support the Olympic \nTree Program being developed by the Salt Lake Olympic committee. While \nour country takes great pride in hosting the international Olympics \nevents, I find it difficult to fathom why we would expect the American \npeople to accept the expenditure of a million dollars for this purely \naesthetic purpose.\n  This bill also continues a disturbing trend of including legislative \nriders that, if enacted, will make substantive changes to current law \nand regulations. By using the appropriations process as a policy \nhammer, we are circumventing a fair and deliberative legislative review \nof the need for such changes. We also shortchange the interested public \nby eliminating their opportunity for input and participation.\n  I have heard from many interested parties who decry the inclusion of \nriders that will extend grazing permits without completion of due \nenvironmental analyses and a provision that overturns an administrative \nlegal opinion regarding the amount of land that can be used for mining \nclaims. I know that these are important issues in my state of Arizona, \nyet I am precluded from fully representing the interests of my \nconstituents when legislative riders such as these are attached to an \nappropriations measure that must be passed within a very short \ntimeframe with little to no opportunity to make changes.\n  Just yesterday, the Senate voted to restore Rule XVI which makes \nfloor amendments of a policy nature out of order on an appropriations \nbill. I supported restoration of this Rule. Ironically, this Rule only \napplies to floor amendments. I believe very strongly that it should be \napplied to committee actions where a small minority of the Senate can \nact to include legislative riders on an appropriations bill without \neven consulting the relevant authorizing committees. I believe the Rule \nshould be expanded to cover committee actions.\n  Mr. President, ensuring the protection of our nation's resources and \nmeeting federal trust obligations to Native Americans are among our \nmost important duties. With this type of shameful waste of taxpayer \ndollars and inappropriate legislative mandates on an appropriations \nmeasure, we are betraying our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' \ndollars responsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best \ninterests of all Americans, rather than the special interests of a few.\n  Unfortunately, due to its length, this list of $216 million of \nearmarks and objectionable provisions in S. 1292, and its accompanying \nSenate report, cannot be printed in the Record. However, the list will \nbe available on my Senate webpage.\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10551-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10551-S10584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                             2000--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, debate on the Interior appropriations bill \ntook place on two separate occasions before the August recess. Two \nsignificant amendments have already been voted upon. We now have a \nunanimous consent agreement for listing all of the amendments that are \nin order, and they are 66 in number.\n  A substantial share, perhaps 20 or more of those amendments, will \neither be accepted or will be a part of one omnibus managers' amendment \nat the end of this debate. I suspect several others will not actually \nbe brought up for discussion in the Senate, but it seems apparent to \nthis Senator, as manager of the bill, that as many as a dozen may \nrequire some amount of debate and very likely a vote.\n  Up to four of those amendments are amendments that were included as a \npart of the bill as it was reported by the Subcommittee on Interior \nappropriations and by the full Appropriations Committee, which fell \nunder the revised rule XVI. One of those is an amendment originally \ndrafted by the Senator from Missouri. He will bring it up at this \npoint.\n  I have asked the Democratic manager, Senator Byrd, to get me a list \nof amendments that Members of his party wish to bring up. He is in the \nprocess of doing that at the moment. But this is an announcement that \nwe are now open and ready for business. It may be that we will, from \ntime to time, set amendments aside so we can hear debate on others. The \nmajority leader may decide to stack votes on some of these amendments. \nBut this is a very short week. We are starting this at 4 o'clock on \nWednesday afternoon. We have all day and into the evening tomorrow for \nthese debates. The majority leader has announced, due to the Jewish \nholiday, that there will be no votes on Friday. I hope we will have \nmade substantial progress on the bill by the end of tomorrow's session \nof the Senate. That is possible, of course, only if Members on both \nsides--both Republicans and Democrats--are willing to bring their \namendments to the floor.\n  The one other amendment I have discussed seriously at this point is \none by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, on gambling. That amendment is ready to be \naccepted. Now I see two Members on the floor. If the Senator from \nFlorida--who was told he could go first--would like to bring his \namendment up now and submit the rest of the various statements on it, I \nunderstand the amendment will be accepted in relatively short order. Is \nmy understanding correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is my understanding, and we are prepared to proceed \nwith our amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I yield the floor and suggest the Senator from \nFlorida seek to be recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kasey \nGillette of our staff have floor privileges for the duration of the \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1577\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from implementing \n          class III gaming procedures without State approval)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Enzi, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1577.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON CLASS III GAMING PROCEDURES.\n\n       No funds made available under this Act may be expended to \n     implement the final rule published on April 12, 1999, at 64 \n     Fed. Reg. 17535.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, which has been cosponsored \nby Senators Enzi, Bryan, Reid, Voinovich, Grams of Minnesota, Lugar, \nSessions, and Bayh, has been before the Senate on several previous \noccasions. It essentially goes to the issue of what will be the process \nto determine whether on Indian properties there shall be allowed class \nIII gambling. Class III gambling is the type of gambling that occurs in \nLas Vegas and Atlantic City. It is what we would characterize as casino \ngambling. Currently, for that gambling to occur, there has to be a \ncompact entered into between the representatives of the Indian tribe \nand the Governor of the State in which the proposed casino would be \nlocated. This is all part of the Indian Gaming Act passed by the \nCongress in the past.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, earlier this year, on April 12, issued \na regulation that essentially said if he determined the States were not \nnegotiating\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\non these compacts in good faith, then he could remove that power from \nthe States, and the Secretary of the Interior would decide whether \nthere should be class III gambling under the aegis of Indian tribes.\n  I personally think that is a very bad idea. It disrupts the basic \nprinciple of federalism, the responsibility which this Congress has \nplaced with the States and the tribes to reach an agreement.\n  In my own State of Florida, we have a prohibition in our constitution \nagainst casino gambling. Three times since 1978 there have been \nattempts to amend the constitution and change that provision, and each \ntime they have been overwhelmingly defeated. This would have the effect \nof overturning three constitutional expressions of opinion by the \npeople of Florida, and similar expressions of opinion by citizens of \nother States, to have the Secretary of the Department of the Interior \ninsert his or her will as to casino gambling within that State.\n  At this time, unless there is further debate, I will yield my time. \nWe will not necessarily ask for a rollcall vote on this matter if it \ncan, as in the past, be resolved by a voice vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. This amendment has \none very simple purpose: To ensure that the rights of Congress and all \nfifty states are not trampled on by an unelected cabinet official.\n  This amendment is very straightforward: it prohibits Secretary \nBabbitt from expending any funds from this act to implement the final \nregulations he published on April 12 of this year. The regulations at \nissue would allow Secretary Babbitt to circumvent the rights of \nindividual states by approving casino-style gambling on Indian Tribal \nlands. This amendment would prohibit this power grab.\n  Mr. President, this is the fifth time in two years that I have been \ninvolved in amendments of this nature. I myself have offered four \nprevious amendments to stop this power grab by the Secretary of the \nInterior, and four times this Senate has approved these amendments by \nvoice votes. I think this body has spoken with a clear voice that it \ndoes not believe an unelected cabinet official should bypass Congress \nand all fifty states in a decision as great as whether or not casino \ngambling should allowed within the state borders.\n  Mr. President, recently I was invited to testify before the Indian \nAffairs committee on a bill Senator Campbell has introduced to amend \nthe statute that governs gambling on Indian Tribal lands, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act. While I do not agree with all the changes \nSenator Campbell has proposed to IGRA, I applaud the Chairman for \ntaking the initiative to attempt to make changes the proper way--by \nproposing a bill, holding hearings, receiving public input from all the \nstakeholders, and moving the legislation through both houses of \nCongress. I have a few ideas on how I believe the bill could be \nimproved, and I welcome the invitation of Senator Campbell to offer \nsome suggestions to his bill.\n  In contrast to this legislative process--the proper way to make \nchanges to substantive law--Secretary Babbitt wants to make changes by \nadministrative fiat. His regulations are a slap in the face to the \ngovernments of all fifty states, to Congress, and to all the Indian \nTribes that have negotiated Tribal-State compacts with the States in \nwhich they are located. The Secretary's rules effectively punish those \ntribes which have played by the rules. The Secretary's action will open \nthe floodgates to an approval process based more on political influence \nthan on proper negotiations between the states and the tribes. Who will \nbe the winners under Secretary Babbitt's new regime? Will it be the \nTribes that donate enough money to the right political party? In \ncontrast to the Secretary's rules, the Graham-Enzi amendment would \nensure that an unelected Secretary of the Interior won't single-\nhandedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change \nto IGRA is done the right way--legislatively.\n  I have already had occasion on this floor to remark on the painful \nirony of the timing of Secretary Babbitt's power grab. In March of last \nyear, Attorney General Janet Reno requested an independent counsel to \ninvestigate Secretary Babbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-state \ngambling license to an Indian Tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have \nto wait for Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her \ninvestigation before any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident \nthat serious questions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's \njudgment and objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. We \nshould not turn over sole discretion of casino gambling on Indian \nTribal lands to an individual who has shown such carelessness in \nadministering his trust responsibilities to all the Indian Tribes \nwithin his jurisdiction.\n  The very fact that Attorney General Reno believed there was specific \nand credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient \nto make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant \nhimself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the states in the \narea of Tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this investigation \nshould have taught us an important lesson: we in Congress should not \nallow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to \nusurp the rightful role of Congress and the states in addressing the \ndifficult question of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary has not given any indication in the 16 \nmonths since the independent counsel was appointed that he should be \ntrusted with new, self-appointed trust responsibilities over Indian \nTribes. On February 22nd of this year, United States District Judge \nRoyce Lamberth issued a contempt citation against Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt and Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, \nKevin Gover, for disobeying the Court's orders in a trial in which the \nInterior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were sued for \nmismanagement of American Indian trust funds.\n  In his contempt citation, Judge Lamberth stated, and I quote,\n\n       The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would \n     fail to obey orders for production of documents, and then \n     conceal and cover up that disobedience with outright false \n     statements that the court then relied upon. But when that \n     litigant is the federal government, the misconduct is even \n     more troubling. I have never seen more egregious misconduct \n     by the federal government.\n\n  This conduct has raised such concern that both the Chairman of the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee and the Chairman of Senate the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee have held hearings and proposed \nlegislation to call Secretary Babbitt to task for his mismanagement of \nthese funds and his disregard for the rulings of a federal court. The \nSecretary's continued violation of his trust obligations to Indian \nTribes should serve as a wake-up call to all of us in the Senate. This \nis not the time to allow the Secretary to delegate to himself new, \nunauthorized, powers.\n  I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing \nTribal-State compacts. The amendment does not, in any way, prevent \nstates and Tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are \nwilling to agree on class III gambling on Tribal lands within a State's \nborders. This amendment does ensure that all stakeholders must be \ninvolved in the process--Congress, the Tribes, the States, and the \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming \nwould be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent \na lot of money. The even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a \nlot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the \nspokesman for the opposition. When we first got our meager organization \ntogether, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor \nof gambling. When the election was held casino gambling lost by over 62 \npercent--and it lost in every single county of our state. The 40 point \nswing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue \nand implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. That's a pretty solid \nmessage. We don't want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote \nin my state have debated it and made their choice. Any federal \nbureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will only inject \nanimosity.\n  Why did we have that decisive of a vote? We used a couple of our \nneighboring states to review the effects of\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\ntheir limited casino gambling. We found that a few people make an awful \nlot of money at the expense of everyone else. When casino gambling \ncomes into a state, communities are changed forever. And everyone \nagrees there are costs to the state. There are material costs, with a \nneed for new law enforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are \nsocial costs. And, not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but \nonce it is instituted, the revenues can be addictive too. But I'm not \nhere to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to \nmaintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative solution, \nrather than have a bureaucratic mandate.\n  Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society \nas a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A state's law \nenforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously \nimpacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. \nTherefore, a state's popularly elected representatives should have a \nsay in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on \nIndian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an \nunelected cabinet official. Passing the Graham-Enzi amendment will keep \nall the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all the \nparties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the time \nit needs to hear all the sides and work on legislation to fix any \nproblems that exist in the current system. I urge my colleagues to \nstand up for the constitutional role of Congress--and for the rights of \nall fifty states--by supporting this amendment.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye, may wish the opportunity to speak, and perhaps more likely \nwill wish the opportunity to put a statement in the Record. I don't \nbelieve that affects the proposition that the amendment will be \naccepted by voice vote. But I ask that we not take that voice vote at \nthis time, until we are apprised of the desires of the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  Under the circumstances, the Senator from Missouri being here, I ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized and that we set this amendment \naside to deal with another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1621\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1621.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, line 10, add the following before the period \n     ``:Provided, That within the funds available, $250,000 shall \n     be used to assess the potential hydrologic and biological \n     impact of lead and zinc mining in the Mark Twain National \n     Forest of Southern Missouri: Provided further, That none of \n     the funds in this Act may be used by the Secretary of the \n     Interior to issue a prospecting permit for hardrock mineral \n     exploration on Mark Twain National land in the Current River/\n     Jack's Fork River--Eleven Point Watershed (not including Mark \n     Twain National Forest land in Townships 31N and 32N, Range 2 \n     and Range 3 West, on which mining activities are taking place \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act): Provided further, \n     That none of the funds in this Act may be used by the \n     Secretary of the Interior to segregate or withdraw land in \n     the Mark Twain National Forest Missouri under section 204 of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1714)''\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment, as the manager has already \nstated, deals with a matter that was approved in the committee and was \ntaken out by a procedural move. The amendment requires a study of \nmining in the Mark Twain National Forest in south-central and southeast \nMissouri. It requires that it be conducted to address the scientific \ngaps identified by scientists in the Departments of the Interior, \nAgriculture, and others.\n  While the relevant information is collected, the amendment delays any \nprospecting or withdrawal decisions for the fiscal year.\n  This amendment is a commonsense amendment. It is a modern amendment. \nIt enables the full-blown process to go forward before any decisions \nare made.\n  This amendment does not permit mining. It does not permit \nexploration. It does not amend, weaken, or touch environmental \nstandards.\n  It prohibits exploration and withdrawal. It requires a scientific \nstudy of the scientific gaps identified by the agencies. It maintains \nthe NEPA requirement for full-blown environmental impact statements \nwhich any withdrawal by the Secretary would preclude.\n  This amendment preserves, as I said, the requirement of the full-\nblown NEPA process. And a full-blown impact statement will ultimately \ndictate whether any mining should or should not take place if an \napplication is made, if there are deposits of lead discovered.\n  By the time any mining could take place, Senator Thurmond might be \nthe only Senator remaining in this Chamber.\n  The amendment does not give miners their way who want clearance for \nprospecting now.\n  It does not give the zero-growth opponents their way. Contrary to \nprecedent and current law, they want no economic activity on these \npublic lands which are multiple-use lands in the State of Missouri.\n  Anyone who understands this issue understands that bulldozers are not \nready to roll, nor should they be. They don't even know yet what lead \nmight be available. There are too many unanswered questions to make a \nfinal decision. Regrettably, some on the extreme want to preclude an \nopportunity to answer those questions.\n  The fundamental question that this amendment addresses is whether \nsomeday, if we were to find lead in those areas, additional lead could \nbe mined safely in the State of Missouri. That is a critical question \nand that is one that should be answered by the scientists.\n  We are not here to legislate a decision and it should not be hijacked \nby administrative decree.\n  Some suggest that we know enough already to make what would be a \npermanent decision for the 1,800 miners who are under the gun for the \n10 counties in south Missouri that depend upon this mining. They say we \nknow enough already to prevent any further mining in an area which has \n90 percent of the domestic lead deposits. So we would export lead \nproduction overseas.\n  This past month I met with the bipartisan county commissioners, \nDemocrats and Republicans, who are elected by and responsible to the \npeople in the counties they serve. They make up the Scenic Rivers \nWatershed Partnership. They are closest to the issue. They have the \nmost at stake. They are the ones who represent the recreational \ninterests. They are the ones who represent the timber interests. They \nrepresent the forest interests. They represent the interests of schools \nand roads which depend upon the royalties that come from mining. And \nthey support this amendment. They said we must have a full-blown study.\n  There is a technical team that has been set up.\n  A multiagency technical team was established in 1988. It has the USDA \nForest Service, the National Park Service, EPA, U.S. Geological Survey \nWater Resources Division and the Geologic Division, the Mineral \nResources Division, the Mapping Division, the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources, and the Department of Conservation. It has the \nprivate companies involved; it has the University of Missouri, Rolla; \nand it has the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  What do these scientists and engineers who have begun the study say?\n  First, they say:\n\n       The technical team believes that there is insufficient \n     scientific information available to determine the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the Mark Twain \n     National Forest area. This is a consensus opinion that the \n     technical team has held from the beginning through the \n     present. Due to the lack of scientific information available \n     to assess the potential impacts of lead mining, the technical \n     team proposed that a comprehensive study be conducted.\n\n  That is contained in a letter to me dated July 30, 1999, from Charles \nG. Groat, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, the Office of the \nDirector, the\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior in Reston, VA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Geological Survey,\n\n                                  Reston, Virginia, July 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond:  This is in response to your letter of \n     July 20, 1999, to Mr. Jim Barks, related to mining in the \n     Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) area. In your letter, you \n     ask that we provide a brief and clear assessment as to the \n     quality of information that was compiled by the interagency \n     technical team charged with building a ``relevant database to \n     assess mining impacts and base future decisions.'' You ask \n     that we, ``specifically address the question as to the \n     adequacy and relevance of information currently available to \n     provide a solid scientific foundation for any decision to \n     justify either withdrawal or mining in the region.''\n       In 1988, an interagency technical team was assembled to \n     guide the identification, collection, and dissemination of \n     scientific information needed to assess the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. Since \n     1989, the team has been chaired by Bob Willis of the Forest \n     Service. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has actively \n     participated on the team from the beginning, with Mr. James \n     H. Barks, USGS Missouri State Representative, serving as our \n     representative.\n       The technical team believes that there is insufficient \n     scientific information available to determine the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. This is \n     a consensus opinion that the technical team has held from the \n     beginning through the present. Due to the lack of scientific \n     information available to assess the potential impacts of lead \n     mining, the technical team proposed that a comprehensive \n     study be conducted.\n       In January 1998 at the request of the technical team, the \n     USGS prepared a proposal for a multi-component scientific \n     study to address the primary questions about the potential \n     environmental impacts of lead mining in the MTNF area. Mr. \n     Barks provided a copy of the proposed study to Brian \n     Klippenstein of your staff at his request on July 9, 1999. \n     Neither a requirement for full environmental review to \n     support a Secretarial decision nor a source of funding has \n     been established. For these reasons the proposed study has \n     not been initiated.\n       Please let us know if we can provide additional information \n     or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles G. Groat,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is further backup and supportive \ninformation that I can provide. But, in summary, my amendment provides \nthe money for the research that the technical team says it needs, and \nit preserves the current rigorous environmental process which will take \nyears to complete. If lead is discovered, if it is economically viable, \nand if the company decides to develop a mining plan and apply for \nmineral production, then the whole process will have to start.\n  To vote for this amendment is to vote to let the scientists get what \nthey say is necessary to make an informed decision, and it is a \nconsensus of all of those agencies I outlined that they don't have the \ninformation. I think it is also a strong consensus of all the agencies \nthat we must protect the environmental resources of the region.\n  As one who has floated and fished on the streams in the Mark Twain \nNational Forest, I can tell you that it is a real gem. I flew over much \nof the area and I visited on foot much of the area in the last month. I \ncan tell you that it is a beautiful wilderness. But it is a multiple-\nuse area. It is used for recreation; it is used for timber; it is used \nfor mining. We flew over some 160 exploratory drilling sites. But you \ndon't see them because they grow back. As a matter of fact, I had my \npicture taken in one of the exploratory sites.\n  There is an exploratory site 2 years after the exploration stopped. \nIt is growing back. In another few years you won't even be able to tell \nit is there.\n  That is why the scientists said that exploratory drilling has no \nimpact. So it is not even an issue. It has no environmental impact. \nThat is not a problem.\n  There are those who do not live in the area who say that no economic \nuse can be made. But I believe that for the good of the country, for \nthe good of the area, to satisfy our needs, to provide the work for \n1,800 miners in the area, to provide the support for the schools, for \nthe communities, for the roads and infrastructure in the area, we must \nfollow the long established, rigorous evaluation process designed to \nallow environmentally acceptable activities and prohibit those that \nwould be adverse to the environment.\n  If you listen to the scientists, as we have, you know that it takes \nmore information than is currently available to make that \ndetermination. These questions deserve to be answered before we mine, \nor before we slam the door in the face of the regions' residents and \nforce our country to become exclusively reliant on foreign sources of \nthis vital mineral.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is a commonsense \namendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1577\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I was off the floor. What is the pending \nbusiness? Are we going back to the Graham amendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now on Senator Bond's amendment. We \nleft the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent to return to the Graham \namendment so that I may speak in opposition to it for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I don't think anyone has more disagreement with Secretary Babbitt \nthan I do as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. Certainly Indian \ntrust funds have been an issue on which we have been at odds for \nliterally months with the Secretary. In addition to that, as a member \nof the Energy Committee, I have had my disagreements with him on \ngrazing, water, and many other things, too. But there are at least four \nreasons to oppose this amendment.\n  I hope my friend, the Senator from Florida, will consider withdrawing \nit.\n  First, after the Supreme Court decided in Seminole v. Florida that \nIndian tribes cannot sue States for unwillingness to negotiate Indian \ngaming agreements, it created a terrific problem, as many Members know. \nWe have spent a considerable amount of time in our committee, with me \nas the chairman of that Committee on Indian Affairs, looking for ways \nthat States and tribes can come to some consensus.\n  We have a pending bill, S. 985. We have worked on it very hard. We \nwant the legislative process to proceed. The Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct requires tribes to have compacts before they can operate class III \ngaming. Right now, unfortunately, the States hold all the cards since \nthe court decided the States do not have to negotiate in good faith.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is now in Federal court over his \nability to issue the kind of procedures that this amendment seeks to \nstop. As the Senator from Florida probably knows, these procedures can \nonly be put into effect if they are published in the Federal Register. \nThe States of Alabama and Florida have sued the Secretary of the \nInterior if this case moves ahead in the courts. It is in the interest \nof all parties, States and tribes, for the United States to allow the \ncourts to decide once and for all if the Secretary has this authority.\n  I point out, the House has already rejected a similar amendment. I \nhave a letter dated August 2 from the Secretary of the Interior. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As you know, a floor amendment has \n     been submitted for intended action on the FY 2000 Interior \n     appropriations bill which would preclude the Department from \n     expending any funds to implement the Indian gaming regulation \n     published in the Federal Register on April 12, 1999. The \n     question of our authority to promulgate that regulation is in \n     litigation in the Northern District of Florida in a case \n     brought by the States of Florida and Alabama. I urge you to \n     oppose the amendments in recognition of the fact that the \n     matter is now in the courts, and we have agreed to refrain \n     from implementing the regulation in any specific case until \n     the federal district court has an opportunity to rule on the \n     merits of the legal issues. We believe that this matter is \n     best dealt with by the courts and we are eager for a judicial \n     resolution.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n       The regulation will have narrow application. It applies, by \n     its terms, only (1) when an Indian Tribe and a State have \n     failed to reach voluntary agreement on a tribal-state gaming \n     compact; and (2) when a State successfully asserts its \n     Eleventh Amendment immunity from a tribal lawsuit and thus \n     avoids the mediation process expressly provided in the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act. The regulation will be implemented on \n     a case-by-case basis, controlled by the facts and law \n     applicable to each situation. As noted above, we are already \n     in litigation in federal court in Florida over the lawfulness \n     of the regulation.\n       In a letter dated May 11, 1999, I explained our concern \n     that we do not think a legal challenge to the regulation is \n     ``ripe'' for adjudication until the Department had actually \n     issued ``procedures'' under it. Since that time, we have \n     sought to dismiss a legal challenge on ripeness grounds. We \n     intend to go forward with processing tribal applications \n     under our regulation and to issue ``procedures'' if they are \n     warranted. It is important to note that any such \n     ``procedures'' become affective only when published in the \n     Federal Register. As noted above, we have agreed to refrain \n     from publishing any procedures until the federal district \n     court has an opportunity to rule on the merits of the legal \n     issues.\n       The House of Representatives rejected an amendment that \n     would have precluded implementation of the rule and I hope \n     that the full Senate will do the same. As you know, in the \n     past, I have recommended that the President veto legislation \n     containing similar provisions.\n       Thank you for your assistance on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In that letter, the Secretary indicates the final rule \nwill not be implemented and no tribal agreements will be authorized \nuntil the courts decide the real issue of whether he has authority to \nissue these procedures. That may take several years.\n  I ask the legislative process proceed and we not short circuit it \nwith this amendment. I ask the Senator from Florida to withdraw that \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senators from Florida and Wyoming, Mr. \nGraham and Mr. Enzi. This is an amendment that prevents the Interior \nDepartment from implementing new regulations that seriously threaten \nthe rights of States to regulate gaming activities within their \nborders.\n  This amendment reinstates the prohibition on the Secretary of the \nInterior, which expired on March 31, from approving casino gaming on \nIndian land in the absence of a tribal-State compact. A similar \nprovision was adopted unanimously by the Senate as part of the fiscal \nyear 1998 Interior appropriations bill as well as the fiscal year 1999 \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nenacted in 1988 divides Indian gaming into three categories. The \namendment offered for consideration on the Senate floor today addresses \nthe conduct of class III gaming; that is, casino gaming, slot machines, \nvideo poker, and other casino-type games.\n  Under IGRA, the Congress very clearly intended to authorize Indian \ntribes to enjoy and to participate in gaming activities within their \nrespective States to the same extent as a matter of public policy that \nthe State confers gaming opportunities generally to the State.\n  There are two clear extremes. In one case, we have the States of Utah \nand Hawaii. Those are the only two of the 50 States that I am aware of \nthat permit no form of Indian gaming. It is very clear that because \nthose two States as a matter of public policy confer no gaming \nopportunities upon its citizenry, Indian tribes in Utah and Hawaii have \nno ability to conduct gaming activities within the class III \ndescription, the so-called casino-type games.\n  Equally clear at the other end of the spectrum is my home State of \nNevada. Nevada has embraced casino gaming since 1931. It is equally \nclear in Nevada law that the Indian tribes in my own State are entitled \nto a full range of casino gaming. Indeed, compacts have been introduced \nto accomplish that purpose.\n  Under IGRA, the class III gaming activity is lawful on Indian lands \nonly if three conditions are made:\n  No. 1, there is an authorized ordinance adopted by the governing body \nof a tribe and approved by the Chairman of the National Gaming Indian \nCommission;\n  No. 2, located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by \nany person, organization, or entity--I want to return to that because \nthat is the key here--located in a State that permits such gaming for \nany purpose by any person, organization, or entity.\n  No. 3, are conducted in conformance with a tribal-State compact.\n  As I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair fully understands, \nthe implementation of IGRA requires that compact be negotiated and \nentered into between the Governor of the State and the tribe within \nthat State that is seeking to conduct class III activity. When IGRA was \nenacted in 1988, Congress was careful to create a balance between State \nand tribal interests. One of the fundamental precepts of IGRA is that \nStates and tribes must negotiate agreements or compacts that delineate \nthe scope of permissible gaming activities available to the \ntribes. Again, the intent of IGRA is clear and I support its concept. \nVery simply stated: To the extent that a State authorizes certain \ngaming activity as a matter of public policy within the boundaries of \nthat State, Indian tribes located within that State should have the \nsame opportunity. There is no fundamental disagreement about that.\n\n  However, a situation has arisen in a number of States in which Indian \ntribes have tried to force Governors to negotiate extended gaming \nactivities that are not authorized or permitted by law within that \nState; for example, a State that may authorize only a lottery might be \npressed by a tribe to permit slot machines--clearly something that IGRA \ndid not contemplate. It is in that area that we have had some very \nserious disagreements.\n  The new Interior Department regulations destroy the compromise that \nis reflected in IGRA. It is in my view a blatant attempt by the \nSecretary to rewrite the law without congressional approval. The rule \nthat has been promulgated allows the Secretary to prescribe \n``procedures'' which the Interior Department characterizes as a legal \nsubstitute for a tribal-State compact, in the event a State asserts an \n11th amendment sovereign immunity defense to a suit brought by a tribe \nclaiming a State has not negotiated in good faith.\n  The effect of this rule for all intents and purposes nullifies the \nState's constitutionally guaranteed sovereign immunity by allowing the \nSecretary of the Interior to become a substitute Federal court that can \nhear the dispute brought by the tribe against the State. Ironically, \nthe new rule permits a tribe to sue based on any stalemate brought \nabout by its own unreasonable demands on the State, such as insisting \non gaming activities that violate that State's law.\n  I support this amendment because I believe, as do the Governors and \nthe States Attorney General, that the Secretary does not possess the \nlegal authority he has sought to grant to himself under this rule, and \nthat statutory modifications to IGRA are necessary in order to resolve \na State's sovereign immunity claim.\n  In a letter to the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the \nNation's Governors stated they strongly believe that no statute or \ncourt decision provides the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nInterior with the authority to intervene in disputes over compacts \nbetween Indian tribes and States about casino gambling on Indian lands. \nIn light of this strongly held view, the States of Florida and Alabama \nhave already filed suit against the Secretary to declare the new rule \nultra vires.\n  The most troubling aspect of the new rule is that the Secretary of \nthe Interior grants himself the sole authority to provide for casino \ngaming on Indian lands in the absence of the tribal-State compact.\n  As a former Governor, I appreciate the States' concern with the \ninherent conflict of interest of the Secretary in resolving a major \npublic policy issue between a State and Indian tribe while also \nmaintaining his overall trust responsibility to the tribe.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the Secretary of the Interior would \nin effect be the arbiter where a dispute arose between the tribe and \nthe Governor in which the tribe was asserting a claim to have more \ngaming activity than is lawfully permitted in the State. The Secretary \nof the Interior, who\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nholds a trust responsibility to the tribe, would in effect be making \nthe determination in that State as to what kind of gaming activity \nwould be permitted. I cannot imagine something that is a more flagrant \nviolation of a State's sovereignty and its ability, as a matter of \npublic policy, to circumscribe the type of gaming activity permitted. \nThe States have asserted a wide variety of these. Some States, as I \nindicated earlier, provide for no gaming activity at all. Others \nprovide for a full range of casino gaming, as does my own State. Other \nStates permit lotteries. Still others authorize certain types of card \ngames. Others permit a variation of horse or dogtrack racing, both on- \nand off-track.\n\n  So a State faces the real possibility, under this rule, if it is not \ninvalidated--and I believe legally it has no force and effect, but we \nwant to make sure this amendment prohibits the attempt of the Secretary \nto implement it--in effect, the Secretary of the Interior would have \nthe ability to set public policy among the respective States as to what \ntype of gaming activities could occur on Indian reservations within \nthose States. We are talking now about class III casino gaming. Even \nthough a State Governor and the legislature and the people of that \nState may have determined, as a matter of public policy, that they want \na very limited form of gaming--a lottery or racetrack betting at the \ntrack as opposed to off-track--the Secretary would have the ability, \nwhen a tribe asserted more than the State's law permitted, to, in \neffect, resolve that. I cannot think of anything that is more violative \nof a fundamental States rights issue in terms of its sovereignty and \nits ability as a matter of public policy to make that determination.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that statutory changes to IGRA are \nin order, in light of recent court decisions. I am hopeful that \nCongress will see fit to reassert its lawmaking authority in this area \nby reexamining IGRA, rather than sitting on the sidelines while the \nSecretary of the Interior performs that task.\n  But, in the meantime, it is imperative that the Congress prohibit the \nSecretary from approving class III gaming procedures without State \napproval. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the \ncarefully crafted amendment by my colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, and Senator Enzi from Wyoming--an amendment to preserve the \nrole for States in the conduct of gaming on Indian lands.\n  It is fair, it is balanced, and it is reasonable. It is consistent \nwith the overall intent of IGRA, which was adopted in 1988 by the \nCongress, to permit class III gaming activities when the three \nconditions which I have enumerated are met, ultimately with a compact \nnegotiated by the Governor and the tribe within that State. In the \nabsence of such an agreement, the Secretary of the Interior must not be \nallowed to determine that State's public policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is still the opinion of the managers \nthat this amendment is likely to be accepted by voice vote. We still \nhaven't directly heard from the Senator from Hawaii, however, who may \nbe nearby. I hope when he finishes we can cast such a vote.\n  We have heard, on the other hand, the senior Senator from Illinois \nwishes to speak against the Lott amendment proposed for him by Senator \nBond and will ask for a vote on that. So we will await his presence and \nhis speech on that subject before there is any attempt to bring that \namendment to a vote. But for all other Members with the other 64 \namendments, now that we have started to deal with two of them, we would \ncertainly appreciate their coming to the floor and showing a \nwillingness to debate. The Democratic manager, Senator Byrd, and I are \ncertainly going to be happy to grant unanimous consent to move off of \none amendment and onto another, I am sure, to keep the debate going \nwith the hope of making progress on the bill.\n  With that, however, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, the \nmanager of the bill, in urging Senators to come to the floor and debate \nthese amendments. It is my understanding, as it is his, that the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, wishes to speak \nagainst the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBond, and he will certainly have that opportunity.\n  I trust the offices of Senators--I am sure they are watching and \nlistening--will pass on to the respective Senators this urgent message \nthat we are trying to state here, that we are here, we are here to \ndiscuss amendments, debate them, agree to them, vote them down, vote \nthem up, amend them further, or whatever. But Senators need to come to \nthe floor and make their wishes known so that this valuable time will \nnot be lost. So I urge our Senators to act accordingly.\n  Now I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, with the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom Florida, I rise in opposition to the amendments he proposes to the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  As similar amendments have done in prior years, this amendment seeks \nto prevent Indian tribal governments from engaging in activities that \nhave been authorized by the U.S. Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  My colleagues know well that there has been a serious impasse in the \noperation of federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act--IGRA--since \n1996.\n  In that year, the Supreme Court concluded that the means by which \ntribal governments could have recourse to the Federal courts if a State \nrefused to negotiate for a tribal-State compact violated the states' \neleventh amendment immunity to suit.\n  Thus, while there are presently over 128 tribal-State compacts as \nmany as 24 States, in those States where tribal-State compact \nnegotiations had not been brought to fruition by 1996, the Court's \nruling gave those States a trump card in the negotiations.\n  Those States--and there are only a few--now had a means of avoiding \ncompliance with the Federal law altogether. They could refuse to \nnegotiate any further, or refuse to negotiate at all, with the \nknowledge that tribal governments had no remedy at law and no recourse \nto the Federal courts.\n  We have tried to address this matter through legislation, and indeed, \nthe chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, currently has a bill pending in the Senate which specifically \naddresses this matter and establishes a process for resolving this \nimpasse.\n  In the interim, the Secretary of the Interior has stepped into the \nbreach--first by soliciting public comment on his authority to \npromulgate regulations for an alternative process if tribal-State \ncompact negotiations should fail, and then by following the \nadministrative procedures to assure that everyone with an interest had \nan opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.\n  That was the open and public and well above-board process that was \nfollowed, and it seems to me only fair that if a State refuses to \nnegotiate with a tribal government,--that there be some other means by \nwhich an indian government can secure its right under Federal law to \nconduct gaming activities.\n  Mr. President, if there were a proponent of this amendment that could \ntell us what equitable alternative they would propose for those tribal \ngovernments that will be directly affected by this amendment, I would \ngive that alternative my earnest consideration.\n  But all that I see going on here is an effort to assure that the \nwindfall enjoyed by those States that had not entered into compacts by \n1996, never have to do so.\n  I suggest that if what we are about here is to render the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act a nullity, then let's be direct and forthright \nabout it.\n  Let's repeal the Federal law.\n  Let's have the Supreme Court's ruling in Cabazon be the order of the \nday and of every day to come.\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n  I, for one, will not be party to this obvious effort on the part of \nsome States to evade the mandates of the Federal law.\n  There is nothing constructive being advanced today. There is no \neffort to assure some balance in the positions of the respective \nsovereigns, tribal and State governments, and as such, I must strongly \nand respectfully oppose the adoption of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the following statement was ordered \nprinted in the Record:\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator Graham, in offering \nthis important amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Interior \nappropriations legislation. This is an amendment that should be \nsupported by anyone who is concerned about the issue of gambling, and \nwho also believes that the Federal Government often goes too far in \nexerting its will on the individual States. I think that the amendment \nwe offer today, which will prohibit taxpayers money from being expended \nto implement the final rule published on April 12, 1999 at 64 Federal \nRegister 17535, is an important amendment because if it passes it will \nprohibit the Secretary of the Interior from unilaterally approving the \nexpansion of casino gambling on Tribal land throughout this country, \nincluding States, like Alabama, in which a Class III gambling compact \nhas not previously been negotiated.\n  Allow me to briefly share some of my thoughts on the importance of \nthis amendment. As Attorney General of Alabama, I cosigned a letter \nwith 25 other Attorneys General that was sent to the Secretary of the \nInterior in regards to his promulgation of the rule we seek to block \ntoday. Every Attorney General who signed that letter shared the opinion \nthat the Secretary of the Interior did not have the legal authority to \ntake action to promulgate regulations which gave him the authority to \nallow casino gambling in this manner. In fact, I previously warned the \nSecretary that if he attempted to implement this rule, he would \nimmediately be sued by States throughout this country in direct \nchallenge to these regulations, resulting in a terrible waste of \nresources on both the State and Federal level. Unfortunately, my \nprediction has come true, as the States of Florida and Alabama have \nfiled suit to block the implementation of this rule.\n  This is an important issue for my State, which has a federally \nrecognized tribe and which has not entered into a tribal-State gambling \ncompact. Alabama's citizens have repeatedly rejected attempts to allow \ncasino gambling to occur within our State. However, under the rules \nthat the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated, he has given \nhimself the authority to unilaterally decide whether tribes within the \nState will be allowed to open casinos, regardless of the opinion of the \nState itself, despite his obvious conflict of interest, and even in the \nabsence of any bad faith on the part of the States. I fail to see how \nthe Secretary of the Interior can cede himself the authority to make \nthis determination for the people of Alabama. Allow me to quote two \npoints from the legal analysis prepared by the States of Florida and \nAlabama which highlight these issues:\n  The States of Florida and Alabama point out in their lawsuit that \n``under IGRA, an Indian tribe is entitled to nothing other than the \nexpectation that a State will negotiate in good faith. If an impasse is \nreached in good faith under the statute, the Tribe has no alternative \nbut to go back to the negotiating table and work out a deal. The rules \nsignificantly change this by removing any necessity for a finding that \na State has failed to negotiate in good faith. The trigger in the rule \nwould allow secretarial procedures in the case where no compact is \nreached within 180 days and the State imposes its Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.''\n  Additionally the States' challenge points out the problems associated \nwith the Secretary of Interior's conflict of interest. In their \nargument the States point out that ``the rules at issue here arrogate \nto the Secretary the power to decide factual and legal disputes between \nStates and Indian Tribes related to those rights. Pursuant to 25 USC \nSection 2 and Section 9, the Secretary of the Interior stands in a \ntrust relationship to the Indian tribes of this nation. The rules set \nup the Secretary, who is the Tribes' trustee and therefore has an \nirreconcilable conflict of interest as the judge of these disputes. \nTherefore, the rules, on their face, deny the States due process and \nare invalid.''\n  Both of these points help to illustrate just how badly flawed the \nregulation proposed by the Secretary of the Interior is, and help \nunderscore why Congress should be vigilant in ensuring it cannot be \nutilized.\n  Why is this issue so important to my State? Because in giving himself \nthe ability to decide whether to allow tribal Class III gambling in a \nState, the Secretary of Interior has given himself the ability to \nimpose great social and economic burdens on local communities \nthroughout Alabama. Let me share with you a letter that the mayor of \nWetumpka, Jo Glenn, whose community is home to property owned by a \ntribe, wrote me in reference to the undue burdens her town would face \nif the Secretary were to step in and authorize casino gambling. Mayor \nGlenn writes:\n\n       Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could \n     not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. \n     The demand for greater social services that comes to areas \n     around gambling facilities could not be adequately funded. \n     Please once again convey to Secretary Babbitt our city's \n     strong and adamant opposition to the establishment of an \n     Indian Gambling facility here.\n\n  Mayor Glenn's concerns have been seconded by other communities. Let \nme share with you an editorial that appeared in the Montgomery \nAdvertiser in regards to regulations being discussed today. The \nAdvertiser wrote:\n\n       Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State \n     involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy handed imposition \n     of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow \n     gambling here is too significant a decision economically, \n     politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive \n     State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the \n     others that would undoubtedly follow in other parts of the \n     State--has implications far too great to allow the critical \n     decisions to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a \n     hand in this high stakes game.\n\n  Mr. President, the States of Alabama and Florida were correct to \nchallenge this regulatory proposal, and the writers of the above quoted \nletter and editorial were correct when they voiced their objections to \nit. We should not allow the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate \nrules giving himself the authority to impose drastic economic, \npolitical and social costs on our local communities, and we should take \nsteps now to ensure that he is unable to do so. I urge my colleagues' \nsupport for the Graham-Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 12, 1999, Thomas Jefferson must \nhave turned over in his grave. That Monday, the Secretary of the \nInterior promulgated a regulation which had the potential to \nunilaterally strip the duly elected Governors of America of their \ndecision-making authority on the issue of casino gambling.\n  That day, the Secretary published regulations that would circumvent \nthe State-tribal compact negotiation process by allowing tribes to \napply directly to the Department of Interior for the approval of Class \nIII gaming. If the Secretary determines that the State and tribe have \nnot been able to reach an agreement, he, alone, can grant the tribes \nthe authority to engage in Class III gaming.\n  Class III gaming is the sort of gambling you might find in Atlantic \nCity or Las Vegas--blackjack, slot machines, craps, roulette.\n  It's an old story, Mr. President: Washington knows best. But in an \nera when we have correctly determined that political decisions are best \nmade at the State and local level, this complete abrogation of States' \nrights is particularly outrageous. Today, Senator Enzi and I are taking \nsteps to reverse the Interior Department's power grab. Our amendment to \nthe Interior Appropriations bill would preserve the fundamental right \nof every State to decide whether or not it wants Class III Indian \ngaming within its borders. It would block these efforts to unilaterally \napprove tribal casino-style gambling applications by prohibiting the \nuse of Department of Interior funds for the implementation of the \nSecretary's final rule.\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\n  The final rule publication on April 12 is fraught with long-term \nconsequences. If we allow the long-standing tribal-State negotiation \nprocess to be bypassed, we will undermine a dialogue which has promoted \ngreater understanding between both parties in the negotiation of gaming \ncompacts.\n  This amendment does not limit the ability of tribes to obtain Class \nIII casino-style gambling provided that tribes and States enter into \nvalid compacts pursuant to existing law.\n  But even more importantly, Department of Interior's action calls into \nquestion the basic right of States to make decisions that are in the \nbest interest of their residents. In the State of Florida, our \nConstitution prohibits this sort of gambling, and in 1978, 1986, and \n1994, Floridians overwhelmingly rejected casino gambling in three \nseparate statewide referendums. State and local law enforcement \nofficials are equally vehement in their opposition.\n  Mr. President, our amendment has the support of the National \nGovernors Association, National Association of Attorneys General, \nNational League of Cities, and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures.\n  Four times in the past three years, an amendment similar to this one \nhas been offered in the Senate, and all four times it has been \naccepted. Should it fail this time, the Interior Department will have \nunfettered power to grant Class III gaming compacts over State \nobjections, even in State where casino gambling is against State law, \nincluding in States like Florida, where casino gambling is prohibited \nby the State constitution.\n  This amendment neither affects existing tribal-State compacts nor \namends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It does protect States' rights \nand ensures that elected State leaders--not unelected Federal \nofficials--have the right to negotiate gaming compacts based on public \nsentiment.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Enzi, our cosponsors, and \nmyself in supporting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as far as I know, that concludes debate on \nthe Graham-Enzi amendment. As far as I know, Members are willing to \naccept a voice vote on the amendment. So unless someone else rises, I \nsuggest the President put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1577.\n  The amendment (No. 1577) was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the purpose of issuing a \n  notice of rulemaking with respect to the valuation of crude oil for \n               royalty purposes until September 30, 2000)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), for herself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, \n     Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1603.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL FOR ROYALTY PURPOSES.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to issue a notice of final rulemaking with respect to the \n     valuation of crude oil for royalty purposes (including a \n     rulemaking derived from proposed rules published at 62 Fed. \n     Reg. 3742 (January 24, 1997), 62 Fed. Reg. 36030 (July 3, \n     1997), and 63 Fed. Reg. 6113 (1998)) until September 30, \n     2000.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nShelby be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on my behalf, \nand in addition to Senator Shelby, Senators Domenici, Lott, Nickles, \nBreaux, Murkowski, and Landrieu.\n  This amendment will continue an existing provision that will prevent \nthe Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, MMS, from \nimplementing an overreaching and unwise new oil royalty valuation \nsystem. This moratorium was adopted by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee and continues the same restrictions that have been passed by \nthe Senate and the House and signed by the President three times \npreviously.\n  I add that it has been bipartisan, and the initial moratorium and its \nsubsequent extensions have been supported by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, and the same is true on the House side. This will be the \nfourth time that Congress will have to act to stop this action by the \nMinerals Management Service. I regret that, and I wish there did not \nhave to be a first time. But this moratorium is absolutely necessary in \norder to stop the MMS from overriding its regulatory authority by \nimposing a backdoor tax on the production of oil from Federal leases.\n  We have heard about judges legislating from the bench. This is, I \nthink, legislating from the cubicle. This new rule violates both the \nlanguage and the intent of Federal law governing the assessment and \ncollection of Federal royalties from oil and gas drawn from Federal \nlands in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Everyone agrees the existing rules are too complex and burdensome, \nand Congress and the industry groups had welcomed a revision of the \nrules. But the proposed rule 3 years ago which MMS announced without \nprior notice to Congress could impose even more costly regulations on \noil producers and effectively enact a royalty rate hike or tax increase \nwhich the agency simply does not have the authority to do. While the \nlarger oil companies might be able to absorb these costs, hundreds of \nsmall independent producers probably will not. This new rule hits them \nat a time when they are still reeling from the historically low oil \nprices we have seen lately.\n  Anyone who has any kind of oil production in their States knows that \nhundreds of thousands of oil-related jobs in our country have gone out \nof existence in the last 6 months. We all know that oil prices went \ndown to $10 a barrel. We have not seen that in this country for 40 \nyears. We know that small independent producers had to go out of \nbusiness, thus throwing hundreds of thousands of people off the \npayroll.\n  In addition, there are two recent developments that justify more than \never before the extension of the moratorium. First, the MMS itself says \nit needs more time to review its rule; second, a serious ethical and \nlegal question has recently been raised about the rulemaking process.\n  Earlier this year, the Minerals Management Service did reopen the \ncomment period for their rule for 30 days. During that period of time, \nthey received extensive comments dealing with the many facets of this \nissue, and they have not yet finished reviewing and considering those \ncomments.\n  Because they have held workshops and various oil industry \nrepresentatives and others interested in this issue have been able to \nmeet together, it is going to take time for the agency to digest the \ninput they have. I hope there is a window in which the Minerals \nManagement Service will be able to sit down and come up with something \nthat is fair and will not put more of our oil industry jobs off the \nbooks and into foreign countries.\n  Remember, today we import more than 50 percent of the oil needs of \nour country. We are certainly not doing anything to help our own oil \nindustry keep oil jobs in America, and it is a security risk to any \ncountry that cannot produce 50 percent of its energy needs.\n  I think everything we can do to keep this industry strong is a \nsecurity issue for our country, and it is certainly a jobs issue.\n  Unfortunately, extending the moratorium through the next fiscal year \nis the only way we are going to be able to get this agency to produce a \nworkable\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\nrule that stays within the bounds of the law. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  In fact, I want our oil industry to pay its fair share of royalties \nto the people of our country. Our taxpayers deserve that. That is \nexactly what we are trying to do with the MMS. But the MMS has been \nvery heavy handed, and they act as if businesses going out of existence \nis preferable to having a fair royalty rate in which the industry would \npay its fair share and we would keep jobs in America.\n  Several of my colleagues and I strongly urged MMS to sit down with \nMembers of Congress and industry representatives to discuss these \nissues. It did so last year. Some progress was made, and I thought we \nwere coming toward a compromise. Unfortunately, the Department of the \nInterior brought the progress to an abrupt halt. The only way we will \nbe able to sit down with the agency is if there is a moratorium until \nthere is a satisfactory resolution of this issue by the MMS and the \nMembers of Congress who are interested in keeping oil jobs in America.\n  In addition, I and other Members of Congress only recently became \naware of a situation that, frankly, calls the entire rulemaking process \ninto serious question. This spring it was revealed that a self-\nproclaimed government watchdog group called Project on Government \nOversight, or POGO, gave $350,000 each to two Federal officials: One at \nthe Department of the Interior and the other at the Department of \nEnergy, apparently in connection with their work on the royalty \nvaluation issue.\n  This matter is presently under criminal investigation at the \nDepartment of Justice, and it is the subject of an investigation by the \nDepartment of the Interior's inspector general. Until these \ninvestigations are complete, the prudent course would be for the \nInterior Department to take a voluntary action to suspend its plan to \nfinalize the new royalty valuation rule. Unfortunately, the Department \nhas indicated it is not willing to do this. I can't imagine an agency \nthat has admitted or at least acknowledged that one of its employees in \nthis rulemaking process took $350,000 as part of a payment in a lawsuit \nfrom this government watchdog organization, and the agency is not even \nwilling to say we should call a moratorium on this whole process until \nwe get to the bottom of this. That is why, when things such as this \nhappen, people don't trust their Government.\n  I can't imagine the Interior Department not volunteering to take this \naction and sit down with us and make sure that this rulemaking process \nhas integrity.\n  The Interior Department's proposed rule defies the law and the intent \nof Congress. This disregard for the law is what is at the heart of our \nobjection to the proposed new rule, not the $11 million the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the proposed rule will generate \nin new income for the agency.\n  Federal law requires for purposes of royalty payments the value of \noil drawn from Federal land is to be assessed at the wellhead; that is, \nwhen the oil is drawn from the ground. The MMS, however, continues to \ntry to assess the value of the oil away from the wellhead, after the \noil has been transported, processed, and marketed, each of which must \noccur before the oil can be sold. In effect, the MMS is trying to get a \nfree ride on these costs rather than allowing companies to deduct them \nfrom the price they ultimately receive for the oil. So you are asking \npeople to pay a tax on their cost of doing business. That does not make \neconomic sense. It certainly doesn't pass the fairness question.\n  There isn't any question that the existing system of computing \nFederal oil royalties is overly complex. No one disputes that. Under \nthe current system, oil producers are often unclear as to what their \nroyalty payments are supposed to be, and even the MMS is often at a \nloss as to what they are owed. But rather than propose a simpler method \nof ascertaining royalty payments, the MMS has proposed an even more \ncomplex and protracted litigation over just what the new rule requires.\n  While the proposed rule could bring in increased Federal revenues, \nthe increased payments could also be eaten up by the need to hire an \narmy of new Federal auditors to ensure compliance with the complex new \nsystem. Furthermore, if companies decide not to go forward with their \ndrilling because they can't make any kind of profit, there will be no \nrevenue to the schoolchildren in our country because there will be no \noil royalty extracted from those companies. So the new rule is going to \nbe a regulatory thicket that really is not going to help the situation, \nwhich is the problem of a too complex regulation today.\n  Let me also emphasize this amendment has nothing to do with the \nentirely separate issue of whether or not any particular oil company \nhas paid the royalties it owes under the existing system.\n  I have heard a lot of rhetoric on this issue. I have heard my \ncolleagues talk about the lawsuits and the settlements and companies \nthat haven't paid their fair share. If any oil company has not paid its \nfair share under the existing regulation, I want it to be prosecuted. I \nwant it to have to pay. That is not an issue in this regulation. The \nonly issue before us today is what is going to be the oil royalty \nvaluation process and is Congress going to have the right to raise \ntaxes or is an unelected bureaucrat who is not accountable going to \nhave that right.\n  Federal land and the mineral resources within that land belong to us \nall. Proper royalties must be paid for the right to extract those \nresources. Since 1953, those payments have totaled over $58 billion. \nThat is what we have collected in oil royalties. But enforcement of the \nlaw and writing the law are two separate things. The MMS seems to have \nforgotten that it is the responsibility of Congress, not the government \nbureaucrats, to determine what the royalty is. That is why we must \ncontinue this moratorium until Congress says this is the right \napproach.\n  The new rule imposes upon Federal lease producers a duty to market \ntheir oil without allowing the cost to be deducted. Oil does not sell \nitself. There are overhead costs associated with listing the oil for \nsale, locating buyers, facilitating the sale, and then ensuring that \nthe oil is delivered to that buyer. Federal law and existing \nregulations only require that the lessee place the oil in marketable \ncondition; that is, that the oil is ready to be sold by removing water \nand other impurities from it. But lessees are allowed, under current \nlaw, to deduct the costs associated with transporting and marketing the \noil.\n  The new rule, as contained in the MMS' own explanation, states that \nthe producers must market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee \nand the lessor. This, then, would mean producers would no longer be \nallowed to deduct these costs in order to arrive at true wellhead \nvalue, as called for by Federal law. There is no other way to slice it. \nThis constitutes a backdoor royalty rate hike; in effect, a tax \nincrease on Federal lands producers.\n  Secondly, the MMS rule would not allow for the proper deduction of \ntransportation costs. Oil producers typically have to bear the cost of \ntransporting the oil to the buyer, either by pipeline or truck. \nPresently, those costs are determined by using a methodology recognized \nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has regulatory \nauthority over interstate oil pipelines. So the new MMS rule would \nactually reject the Federal Government's own cost guidelines and impose \na new, untested system for determining transportation costs.\n  So it comes down to a simple decision: Do we want unelected \nbureaucrats enacting policy with regard to our Federal lands, or do we \nwant Congress to establish these policies? There have been other bills \nintroduced that would deal with this issue. I hope we can come to an \nagreement. But I don't think we can forget what has happened to the oil \nindustry over the last 2 years. In fact, this is coming at a time when \noil and gas production in our country is at an all-time low. In March \nof this year, we saw oil prices in parts of our country going down to \neven $7 or $8 a barrel.\n  While the price of oil has since begun to come back up--and today \nstands at about $20 a barrel--the impacts of a year and a half price \ncrash are reverberating throughout the United States. Since the price \nof oil first fell in late 1997, over 200,000 oil and gas wells have \nbeen shut down. Most of these, of\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\ncourse, were the low-yield marginal or ``stripper'' wells that will \nnever again be opened because it is not economically feasible to do it.\n  In March of this year, crude oil production in the lower 48 States \nfell to 4.8 million barrels per day, the lowest level in 50 years. The \nnumber of oil rigs in service in the United States fell to just over \n100 for the last week in July, the lowest number in service since \nrecords have ever been kept.\n  During this time, foreign oil imports rose steadily and now account \nfor 57 percent of consumption, well above the 36 percent import level \nwe saw during the 1974 oil embargo that nearly shut down the American \neconomy.\n  The oil crisis has also had a devastating impact on American jobs. \nSince November 1997, we have lost over 67,000 jobs just in the \nexploration and production sectors of this industry, which represents \n20 percent of the total number of jobs in this field. In January 1999 \nalone, 11,500 oil and gas jobs were lost. If one looks back to 1981, \nthe numbers are even more alarming: Over half a million good-paying \nAmerican jobs have been lost in the oil and gas industry.\n  There are those who would say this is going to hurt our \nschoolchildren, that they are not going to get the revenues from our \npublic lands. This is very important in my home State. There are dozens \nof school districts that rely heavily on oil production; property taxes \nfall with the price of oil. Statewide school districts will collect an \nestimated $154 million less in revenues this year than last. That is \n$154 million worth of teachers' salaries, books, computers, you name \nit. That is what we are talking about in Texas when we talk about the \nimpact of oil on education.\n  So if we are going to hit the oil business again, what is it going to \ndo to the schoolchildren of our country? Is it going to take another \n$154 million hit in my State? Do you know that they had to let teachers \noff in midyear in many counties in Texas because they didn't have the \nmoney because of oil companies going out of business and having no \nincome whatsoever? So when my colleagues say the schoolchildren are \ngoing to lose $60 million, perhaps, in California alone, I point my \ncolleagues' attention to the fact that we have lost $154 million this \nyear in Texas, and we are cutting teachers off in midyear and shutting \ndown schools because our oil industry is on its knees.\n\n  During 1998, while the average yield for stocks in the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average was a positive 18 percent, the yield for oil and gas \nstocks was a negative 36 percent. So what does that do to the elderly \ninvestor, or the person who is investing in mutual funds? What does \nthat do to an industry that is very important for the retirement \nsecurity of millions of our citizens?\n  For companies inclined toward exploration and production, earnings \nand stock values have fared even worse. The yield on independent \nrefiner stocks, down 40 percent. The yield on exploration and \nproduction stocks, down 63 percent. The yield on drilling stock, down \n64 percent. These stock values reflect huge losses by oil companies \nover the past year and a half. Corporate earnings of the 17 major U.S. \npetroleum companies fell 41 percent between the first quarter of 1998 \nand the first quarter of 1999. Fourth quarter losses for 1998 and the \nfirst quarter of 1999 were some of the largest witnessed in industry \nhistory. Some companies have lost over $1 billion during each of these \nquarters.\n  So we are not just talking about the loss of revenue to our \nschoolchildren. We are not just talking about the stability of the \nretirement pension plans of millions of Americans. We are talking about \nflat bad policy. We are talking about cutting off an industry that is \nessential to our security, essential to the retirement security of \nindividuals in this country, essential to job security for thousands of \nworkers; and we are talking about blithely saying let the bureaucrats \nwho aren't accountable increase the taxes without congressional \nresponsibility.\n  Congress didn't say that last year, they didn't say it the year \nbefore, and they didn't say it the year before that. They said: No, you \nwill be accountable because we do care about the schoolchildren of this \ncountry, we do care about the people living on retirement incomes in \nthis country, and we do care about those who have mutual funds that \ninclude oil industry stocks; we want them to be stable, we want them to \npay their fair share, and we believe their fair share includes not \npaying taxes on their expenses. It is economics 101.\n  So I am asking my colleagues, for the fourth straight time, to come \nforward and vote to keep this moratorium so Congress can exercise its \nfull responsibility, so that we will not put people out of business \nbecause the margins are so low and because they have been hit so hard \nover the last year and a half.\n  We are joined by many groups who care about the economic viability of \nour country: Frontiers of Freedom, the National Taxpayers Union, \nAmericans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy, the Alliance for America, People for the USA, \nSixty-Plus, the Blue Ribbon Coalition, the American Land Rights \nAssociation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Center \nfor Public Policy Research, Rio Grande Valley Partnership.\n  The moratorium that I am proposing to extend will force the \nDepartment to take the time to craft a rule that works and accurately \nreflects the will of Congress--a rule that will be fair to the \nschoolchildren of our country, a rule that will be fair to the \ntaxpayers of our country, a rule that will make the oil industry pay \nits fair share, but a rule that will not make the oil industry pay an \nincreased tax on their expenses. That is unheard of in economics in our \ncountry, nor good business sense. It is confiscatory taxation, and we \nwill not stand for our retirees having their investments obliterated by \ntaxes that are unfair. The buck stops here. It does not stop on the \nbureaucrat's desk; it stops here, because we are responsible for \nkeeping the jobs in this country. We are responsible for fair taxation \npolicy. We are responsible for the schoolchildren of our country. And \nthe way to keep these companies paying their fair share, creating the \njobs, and creating safe retirement systems for the people of our \ncountry is to keep the moratorium on and force the Department of the \nInterior to do the will of Congress, which is what it is supposed to \ndo. If we don't stand up for our responsibility, who will? Who will \nstand up for Congress' responsibility if the Senate doesn't?\n\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment which has been adopted three \ntimes before, and which I hope will be adopted again, so that we will \nkeep the oil jobs in our country, so that we will keep the retirement \nsecurity of the mutual funds that depend on oil companies being stable, \nso that we will keep the schoolchildren of our country having the \nability to get revenue that is fair, and to make the oil industry pay \nits fair share. That is what this amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know there are Senators who are \nwaiting to speak on other measures. I am only going to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  I congratulate Senator Hutchison on the argument she offered today. \nShe indicated that the last three times we have done this, I have \neither been the sponsor and she the cosponsor, or vice versa.\n  I am here today to again indicate that whoever follows us and talks \nabout the fact that we ought to stick big oil, or we ought to make sure \nthere are no longer any slick deals, as I see some of these comments \nthat are going to be made here on the floor, let me suggest that if you \nare taxing anything in the United States and you are doing it wrongly \nor unfairly or without justification under the law, then it doesn't \nmatter whether somebody is going to lose money if in fact Congress says \nyou have to stop doing that.\n  That is what we have here. We are going to have Senators argue that \nthere are certain oil companies that are not going to have to pay. \nThere have been settlements where they have paid. But the truth of the \nmatter is, the intention of this law is, if you are going to change it \nmaterially, Congress is supposed to be involved.\n  We have tried to get involved. In fact, for 6 months we have mutually \nattended hearings with the MMS and the oil producers and talked about \nwhat was wrong with these regulations and\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nrules. Everybody on both sides was saying, let's fix them; let's modify \nthem; let's change them. Frankly, I think the oil people who were at \nthose meetings who have talked with us and have gone to hearings in the \nEnergy Committee are more than willing to listen to realistic, \nreasonable changes.\n  But essentially what has happened is, the MMS decided to change the \nrule which historically based royalties on prices at the wellhead. They \ndecided they would go downstream from that wellhead, and they invented \na new concept called ``duty to market.'' They decided that they are \ngoing to decide what expenses are allowed in moving that gas downstream \nto where the marketing occurs. They are deciding what the values are at \nthat point. And we could go through a litany of situations where the \noil industry believes the decisions are not fair, not market oriented, \nor not consistent with business practices. Frankly, I think some--\nbecause it is oil, or big oil--think it just doesn't matter, stick \nthem.\n  Frankly, as I indicated before, we want to stand here and say: Why \ndon't you get serious about fixing those regulations? And we will get \noff your back.\n  That is what is going to happen. Until they do it realistically and \nwe get some word that they have been fair and reasonable in the way \nthey are setting these royalty costs and prices that yield dollars in \ntaxes to the oil industry, until we find out there are some changes \nmade, we are going to be here on the floor saying this is a new add-on \ntax to an industry that maybe 15 years ago we could talk about as if \nwhat you taxed them didn't matter. But we know that we have a falling \nproduction market in the United States. It is more and more difficult \nto produce these products. It is more and more expensive and cheaper \noverseas. Some of us don't want to see the American industry taxed any \nmore than is absolutely reasonable and fair.\n  These regulations are not right. They are not fair; they are not \nbased on marketplace concepts, or we wouldn't be here.\n  I know some are going to want to debate this for a very long time. \nMaybe we will even have to ask for the debate to be closed. But we are \nnot going to give up very easily.\n  We ask Senators who pay close attention. It is not a matter of what \nwe could get out of this industry or what somebody alleges they would \nhave paid in the settlement. It is a question of whether the new rules \nand regulations are right and consistent with fair market concepts or \nnot. As you figure the royalty, are you inventing costs and prices and \ndisallowing deductions and the like that have no relationship to \nreality? We think that is what these are.\n  We would be happy to come back again and debate. I will be glad to be \nhere. But for now I yield the floor. I thank Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may say so, I appreciate that \nthis is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment. Sometimes it is Domenici-\nHutchison because we both have worked so hard on this issue over the \nlast 3 years. I appreciate the leadership of my colleague from New \nMexico who feels the loss of oil jobs just as my State of Texas does. \nIt is a team effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1583\n\n (Purpose: To strike Section 329 from a bill making appropriations for \n  the Department of Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n                       ending September 30, 2000)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I call up an amendment that has been filed \nat the desk on behalf of myself and Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Cleland, \nChafee, and Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb), for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \n     Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 1583.\n       Beginning on page 116, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through line 21.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I did not ask that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with because it was so short and to the point.\n  The amendment simply strikes section 329 from the Interior \nappropriations bill we are now considering. Section 329 is a rider that \nis intended to overturn recent decisions handed down by the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court in Washington \nState dealing with national forests.\n  These courts were asked to examine the activities of the Forest \nService and BLM to determine whether, in allowing certain timber sales \nfrom public lands, they complied with their own regulations and \nresource management plans that were developed under the National Forest \nManagement Act. The courts found that they did not comply and \ndisallowed the sales until they did.\n  The forest plans guide the Federal decision-making, so that one \nactivity in the national forests such as logging does not occur in \ndetriment to other uses. These plans apply only to national forest \nland--Federal land--not private land. This is land held in trust for \nall people and all uses, and the Forest Service and BLM are charged \nwith ensuring that decisions involving these public treasures are made \nwisely.\n  We in Congress continually insist that Federal regulators operate \nusing good science. But there is no good science without good data.\n  Section 329, which my amendment would strike, would relieve the \nForest Service from the obligation to develop any new data. And we \ncannot have good decisions without good science and good data.\n  After decades of managing our forests primarily for the production of \nlogs, we are now managing forests for a variety of uses. But we cannot \ndo that without baseline data on threatened and endangered species.\n  We are changing the way we manage forests and the way we look at \nforest uses. Preserving habitat and providing recreation also have \nbecome increasingly important.\n\n  These changes are not easy. Proponents of this section, that my \namendment would strike, fear that the requirements that we make sound \ndecisions based on sound science and good data will lead to less \nlogging. This is simply not true. Managing forests for their various \nuses, which include harvesting timber, requires an understanding of the \nentire system, including the plants, animals, even the pests that \nsometimes inhibit or damage growth.\n  To improve forest management, in December of 1997 the Chief of the \nForest Service appointed an independent committee of scientists to \nadvise him on ways to bring better science into forest planning. The \npanel's findings strongly recommended the use of scientific evidence in \nmanaging forests. The panel repeatedly advised that monitoring is \ncritical to sustaining forest health.\n  In the cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the courts simply \nrequire the Federal Government to undertake the monitoring that their \nown forest plans and rules require. Supporters of section 329 argue \nthat the courts in these two cases have deviated from rulings by other \ncourts where challenged timber sales were allowed to proceed. In other \ncases--and here is the important difference--the courts had enough data \nto rule in favor of the Forest Service. There was evidence to show that \nwhile the data gathered may not have been exhaustive, at least it was \nadequate.\n  In the most recent cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the \ncourts, after noting deference to the Forest Service, recognized the \njob simply had not been done adequately or at all. The courts didn't \nrule that each and every species had to be monitored. They simply said \nto the Federal Government: You have to follow your own rules. You have \nto gather the data in which a sound decision can be based.\n  For example, the Eleventh Circuit decision delayed seven timber sales \nin the southern Appalachian forest in Georgia until the Forest Service \ncompleted an evaluation of the impact the sales would have on the \nforest environment.\n  The purpose of the information gathering is to ensure that the Forest \nService makes an informed decision before it allows the removal of \nexpanses of\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\ntimber that could be crucial to survival of endangered or threatened \nspecies or that could affect overall forest health.\n  In a similar action, a Federal judge in Washington State has delayed \nover 25 timber sales until the Forest Service completes the survey work \nrequired by the Northwest Forest Plan.\n  In the case involving the southern Appalachian forest, the Forest \nService failed to develop the required baseline data on a number of \nspecies in both the endangered and the threatened category and in a \ncategory known as ``indicator'' species. For example, the Forest \nService had no population inventory information at all for 32 of 37 \nspecies in one category. The court of appeals ruled that in proffering \nthe tracts of timber for sale, the Forest Service failed to comply with \nits own regulations. The court didn't just determine that the data was \ninadequate; the court determined that the data was nonexistent.\n  Under most forest plans, the Forest Service develops lists of \nindicator species to provide a basis for monitoring. These lists have \nspecies such as deer, bear, bass, and trout. These species are \nrepresentative of all the other species in the forest. The list is \nshort and it is designed to be easy to monitor.\n  In the Eleventh Circuit case, the Forest Service developed such a \nlist but then failed to gather any information on most of the species \non the list. In the Northwest, the court found that the Forest Service \nsidestepped similar requirements of the forest plan.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan is the legal and scientific framework that \nallows timber sales to go forward in the old growth forests of the \nNorthwest. As our colleagues will recall, lawsuits in the early 1990s \nbrought logging in that region to a complete halt. The Northwest Forest \nPlan, which was the result of lengthy and often painful negotiations, \nallowed timber sales to go forward, provided that there was an adequate \nbasis to make an informed decision. The agreement provides the best \nhope of sustained yield and multiple use. This latest ruling by the \nWestern District Court of Washington is a reminder that the agreement \nis the operating plan for the forests, and that guidance memorandum \ncannot exempt the Forest Service from its duty. This ruling will delay \ntimber sales but only until the Forest Service completes the work laid \nout in the plan.\n\n  Of the 80 surveys in question, all but 13 have protocols developed \nthat will allow survey work to move forward. These decisions are not a \nresult of overstepping by the courts. They are a result of the courts \nexamining the rules the Forest Service laid out for itself and merely \nrequiring the Forest Service to operate by the rules it adopted.\n  Let me quote from the Eleventh Circuit decision:\n\n       While the Forest Service's interpretation of its Forest \n     Plan should receive great deference from reviewing courts, \n     courts must overturn agency actions which do not scrupulously \n     follow the regulations and procedures promulgated by the \n     agency itself.\n\n  I suggest to our colleagues who support section 329 that we should \nnot as a result of one court decision turn our backs on the necessity \nof developing good information on plant and animal populations in our \nnational forests. This data is the basis of the good science we keep \ntalking about. It will add to our knowledge. In fact, most forest \ndistricts already have a substantial amount of data and continue to \ndevelop more. The majority of sales are moving forward under the \nexisting rules and plans. It would be a mistake to let delays in a few \ntimber sales negate all of the important work that is now being done. \nSection 329 effectively stops data gathering for the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  In addition, section 329 establishes a new standard to be applied by \nthe Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for determining \nwhen to approve timber sales. However, according to the agencies that \nare required to implement the change, rather than speed timber sales \nup, it would slow them down. To understand the effect of this change, \nwe ought to hear from those who will be responsible for implementing \nthe change.\n  In a statement issued jointly by the Secretaries of Agriculture and \nInterior they say:\n\n       [I]f this rider were adopted, tens of thousands of \n     individual management activities and planning efforts would \n     be subject to a new legal standard.\n       This would have the unintended effect of increasing project \n     costs and increasing delays in order to conduct time-\n     consuming reviews of administrative records to document \n     compliance with the new standard.\n       Increased litigation and delay could also be expected as \n     plaintiffs seek to define the new standard in court.\n       In an effort to free up a limited number of timber sales in \n     Georgia and the Pacific Northwest, the Senate would \n     unnecessarily override the Federal Court ruling, agency \n     regulations, and resource management plans requiring the \n     Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain and \n     use current and appropriate information for wildlife and \n     other resources before conducting planning and management \n     activities.\n       Moreover, the bill language applies not just to timber \n     sales decisions and required surveys in the forests of the \n     Southeast and Pacific Northwest, but to all activities for \n     which authorization is required on all lands managed by the \n     Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service.\n       As such, it could result in far-reaching, unintended \n     negative consequences.\n\n  In short, the Secretaries who would be required to implement the new \nstandard write that:\n\n       Section 329 is unnecessary, confusing, difficult to \n     interpret, and wasteful.\n       If enacted, it will likely result in costly delays, \n     conflicts, and lawsuits with no clear benefit to the public \n     or the health of public lands.\n\n  The Forest Service, which is charged with implementing the court's \nruling, is acting. In the southern Appalachian forests, they are \nmodifying the forest plan and have developed guidance to help meet the \ncourt's directives. In the Northwest, they are completing a \nsupplemental environmental impact statement that will respond to the \ncourt's concerns.\n  Incidentally, the SEIS was in process before the court ruled because \nthe Forest Service had already recognized that the plan needed \nadjusting, and the plan has mechanisms in it to accommodate change.\n  The Forest Service does not believe this rider is necessary in order \nto approve timber sales. In fact, they believe it will interfere with \ntimber sales.\n  I want to emphasize an additional problem with section 329. It does \nnot just apply to timber sales. Again, according to the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and the Interior:\n\n       The provision which applies for one year would apply to all \n     of the nearly 450 million acres of land managed by the two \n     agencies and would apply to all management activities \n     undertaken by the bureaus, not just timber sales.\n\n  We should not be putting a rider on an appropriations bill to lower \nthe standard for government agencies in the hope that it might pass \nunnoticed. One of the reasons people get cynical about their government \nis that it does not always do what it says it will do. In this case, we \nwould lower the bar for agencies that do not want the bar lowered. The \nForest Service believes that it can do the job right. We would do a \ndisservice to this body and to the people who expect us to protect our \nnational treasure by not demanding that Federal agencies make informed \ndecisions with adequate data.\n  What section 329 proposes to do is lower the standard the first time \nthat agency fails to meet it. I believe this is the wrong approach. I \nbelieve we should strike section 329 from this appropriations bill and \nthat the Federal Government should comply with the laws we have passed \nand the rules it has established and the plans it has adopted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nvery important comments. I rise in very strong opposition to the \nHutchison amendment that was laid aside and about which, as I \nunderstand it, probably we will have to vote on a cloture motion. I \nawait the word of the chairman on that.\n  I want to tell my colleagues that this is a very serious matter. I \nhope they will listen very carefully as to why the arguments against \nthe Hutchison amendment are so important. I am going to say some very \nstrong things on the floor. But everything I say will be backed up by \nfact, backed up by quotes, backed up by court cases, backed up by \nrecent history on oil royalty payments.\n  What the Hutchison amendment will do for the fourth time is to stop \nAmerican taxpayers from receiving the\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\namount of oil royalties they are owed by the oil companies. Let me \nrepeat that. The Hutchison amendment will stop the American taxpayers \nfrom receiving the fair share of oil royalties that they deserve. If it \ndoes pass, and I hope it does not, it will sanction that. It will say \nto the oil companies: It's OK, you continue, big oil companies, \nunderpaying your oil royalties. We know they have a plan to underpay. \nWe know that. We have heard it from people who have blown the whistle \non the oil companies.\n  If we go with the Hutchison amendment, our fingerprints are on this \ndefrauding of the taxpayers. This is very serious business. I ask my \ncolleagues to pay attention, because when this issue was last before \nus, we did not have a whistleblower who worked for the oil companies in \ncourt, saying that the oil companies, in essence, defrauded the \ntaxpayers and they planned to do so. We have that information. I will \nlay it before the Senate.\n\n  What is an oil royalty payment? Right here you see what a royalty \npayment is. The oil companies sign an agreement with the Federal \nGovernment that when they drill on Federal lands in any State of the \nUnion, be it onshore or offshore, they must pay a fair percentage, 12.5 \npercent, of the value of that oil over to the Federal Government. It is \nlike paying rent. It is not a tax; it is a royalty payment.\n  If you do not own the place in which you live, you pay rent. Imagine \nif you decided on a daily basis what that rent ought to be. No, no, \nno--you would go to jail or you would be evicted because you have \nsigned a contract to pay a certain amount of rent. The oil companies \nhave signed a contract to pay a certain amount of rent based on the oil \nthey extract from Federal lands. Here it is. It ``shall never be less \nthan the fair market value of the production.'' Keep that in mind, \n``fair market value of the production.'' They have to base their \nroyalty payment on the fair market value of the oil.\n  Senator Domenici was on the floor and he said beware of colleagues \nwho start talking about Congress' slick deal with the oil companies. He \nsaid beware.\n  I am not saying it; USA Today said it. USA Today said it is ``time to \nclean up Big Oil's slick deal with Congress.'' They say, in their view, \n``industry's effort to avoid paying full fees hurts taxpayers [and] \nothers.''\n  Here is what USA Today says on the subject in this article. They knew \nthe Hutchison amendment was coming and this is what they said.\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent \n     discount off the marketplace. Over time, that would add up to \n     really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to \n     make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.\n\n  They go on to say the fact that ``big oil has contributed more than \n$35 million to national political committees and congressional \ncandidates.'' They say that is ``a modest investment in protecting the \nroyalty-pricing arrangement which has enabled the industry to pocket an \nextra $2 billion.''\n  This is a very bad situation. If you vote for the Hutchison \namendment, you are aligning yourselves with a planned effort to defraud \ntaxpayers. I do not know how many of my friends want to go home and \nface their constituents and make that argument. This is what USA Today \ncontinues saying:\n\n       That's millions of dollars missing in action from the \n     battle to reduce the Federal deficit and from accounts for \n     land and water conservation, historic preservation, and \n     several Native American tribes. In addition, public schools \n     in 24 States have been shortchanged: States use their share \n     of Federal royalties for education funding.\n\n  They conclude by saying:\n\n       . . . the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of \n     this deal for far too long.\n\n  We have a chance to stand up for the consumer, for the taxpayers, \nagainst cheaters, against people who would knowingly defraud taxpayers, \nif we do not support the Hutchison amendment, if we oppose it.\n\n  We heard the Senator from Texas say: Oh, my God, things are terrible \nfor oil. We are suffering in the oil industry.\n  What she does not tell you is something very important: 95 percent of \nthe oil companies are not affected by the rule the Interior Department \nwants to put into place which will fix this problem. The Hutchison \namendment stops them in their tracks and prohibits them from fixing \nthis perpetual underpayment of royalties. That is what the Hutchison \namendment does.\n\n  She says big oil and oil across the board is hurting. Ninety-five \npercent of the oil companies are not affected. They are decent. They \nare paying their fair share of royalties. It is the 5 percent that are \ndoing this slick thing that are, instead of paying their royalty based \non a market price, they are paying it based on a posted price which \nthey post. They decide what the price is, and we know they are cheating \nus. How do we know that? That is a tough thing for a Senator to say, \nbut I want to prove it to you.\n  First of all, we know this for sure: Seven States have already won \nbattles in court against oil companies. The seven States have said that \nthe oil companies are underpaying their royalty payments to the Federal \nGovernment and the States' share of those royalty payments, therefore, \nare lower. The oil companies have settled with these States.\n  If they were doing the right thing, do you think they would be \nsettling for $5 billion so far? I doubt it. If they were so innocent, \ndo you think they would be shelling out--``shelling'' is a good word--\n$5 billion to seven States? By the way, the Federal Government is suing \nas well. We do not want to have to keep these battles in court. The \nInterior Department wants to fix these problems so nobody will have to \nsue anymore. There will be a fair payment. So one reason we know they \nare cheating us is they are settling these cases all over the country.\n  There is another reason we know. This one is very direct and this one \nis new. I urge my colleagues at their peril to pay attention to this \nmatter, please:\n\n       A retired Atlantic Richfield employee has admitted in court \n     that while he was Secretary of ARCO's crude pricing \n     committee, the major's posted prices were far below fair \n     market value.\n\n  He goes on to say--Anderson is his name:\n\n       He admitted he was not being fully truthful 5 years ago \n     when he testified in a deposition that ARCO's posted prices \n     represented fair market value. He said: ``I was an ARCO \n     employee. Some of the issues being discussed were still being \n     litigated. My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen \n     numerous occasions, the nail that stood up getting beat \n     down.'' Said Anderson, ``The senior executives of ARCO had \n     the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the \n     day of judgment, and that's what we did.''\n\n  Here is a retired former employee of one of the oil companies that \nhas been ripping off the taxpayers admitting it in a court of law--he \ncould go to jail if he lies--swearing on a Bible, an oil company man, \nthat they sat around and agreed to understate the value so they could \nget away with it and wait for the day of judgment. Talk about a smoking \ngun, here it is. This is new information, and yet Senator Hutchison is \nasking you to stand with those people, one of whom admitted they \nactually had a plan to defraud the taxpayers.\n  This is a very serious issue. It is not politics. It involves a plan \nto understate the market price. It is wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask my colleague, the Senator from California, \nif she will clarify several things so those following the debate \nunderstand the parameters of this issue. In every instance here are we \ntalking about private oil companies drilling for oil on public lands?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, I say to my friend. These are private \noil companies that have signed an agreement with the Federal Government \nto pay the royalty payment based on the fair market value when they \ndrill on land that is owned by the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask the Senator from California, it has been my \nexperience in Illinois that coal mining companies and oil exploration \ncompanies will go out and buy private land, at least an easement or \nright to drill on private land, and pay compensation to the landowner \nfor that purpose. But in this situation, we are dealing with land owned \nby the people of America----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That these companies are using to make a profit; is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And their payment to the taxpayers for the use of our \nland, the land owned by the taxpayers across America, is this royalty; \nis it not?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator from California explain the impact, then, \nof the Hutchison amendment, how this will affect the royalty that is \npaid by the oil companies that want to drill for oil and make a profit \nfrom that oil off land owned by taxpayers?\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the Hutchison amendment does is it puts off for the \nfourth time any move by the Interior Department to fix the problem we \nare facing with this underpayment of the royalties that are due the \ntaxpayers.\n  The Interior Department has held a series of 17 meetings across the \ncountry. They have met with the oil companies, they have met with \nMembers of Congress, they have done everything, and they are ready to \nfinalize a rule. Every time they are ready to promulgate a rule to fix \nthis problem, up comes one of the Senators from the oil States who \nsays: Oh, wait, wait, wait, it is too complicated; it isn't a good \nidea.\n  It isn't a good idea from the oil companies' perspective because as \nwe just heard this one whistleblower say, they want to put off the day \nof judgment and use this float to make more and more money. But my \nfriend is right in his questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, let's consider two \npossibilities. If the royalty is based on the price of oil, there is a \npossibility that the royalty payments might go down if it is \nrecalculated; there is a possibility that it might stay the same, or it \nmight go up.\n  But I take it from this amendment that the oil companies that are \npushing this amendment are so certain that their payments to the \nFederal Government are going to go up that they want to stop the \nFederal Government from recalculating the royalties.\n  The net impact of this, and the Senator from California can correct \nme, is that the oil companies are being protected from paying their \nfair share of rent or royalties for using public lands, and the \ntaxpayers, because of this amendment, are the losers. We are the ones \nwho do not get the royalties back from those who want to drill all the \noil out of land that we own and not pay the taxpayers of this country \nfor the right to do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I can put it in specific dollars. \nAlready the Hutchison amendment, since she first offered it and our \ncolleagues backed her on it, has lost taxpayers $88 million, and if she \nsucceeds in this, although Senator Hutchison has pared it back to a \nyear, another delay of a year, it is another $66 million. That is a lot \nof millions of dollars. Taxpayers already have lost $88 million, and \nthey are about to lose another $66 million unless we can stop this. The \nInterior Department is with us 100 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Hutchison amendment prevails and is not defeated--\n--\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield on \nthat point because I think there has been an error in the amount that \nwe are talking about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can say to my colleague, the Senator from Texas, I \nwas only asking a question of the Senator from California who I believe \nhas the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I will address this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a letter that backs up those numbers which I will \nput in the Record. I will continue to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I am getting to is, if the Hutchison amendment \nis adopted, then basically we are giving a discount to these oil \ncompanies from the amount they owe taxpayers for drilling oil out of \npublic lands and selling it at a profit; is that the net impact of this \namendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know we are in an era of surpluses where we are trying \nto figure out ways to give away money, but I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia why would we decide to give money to oil companies at this \npoint? Why adopt an amendment that would give them additional profits \nfor drilling oil on lands owned by the taxpayers, the people of \nAmerica?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is a special interest rider. \nI have to say that, with all due respect. By the way, it doesn't give \nmoney to all the oil companies. It only gives it to the top 5 percent, \nthe ones that are vertically integrated. Ninety-five percent of the oil \ncompanies are not affected, and they are paying the fair market value. \nThey are paying the royalty based on the fair market value.\n  I ask unanimous consent, before yielding to the Senator for more \nquestions, to have printed in the Record a letter from the Secretary of \nthe Interior, which was based on the original Hutchison amendment, \nwhich addresses the question of the dollars lost. It is very clear what \nwill be lost. In her additional amendment of 21 months, they calculate \nit at $120 million, and we are just paring it back to the 1-year \nnumber. We also have a letter from the Office of Management and Budget \nwhich clearly states that the rider, as it is before us now, will cost \ntaxpayers about $60 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those two documents printed in the \nRecord when I complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object. I do want the Senator to be \nable to enter her documents in the Record, but I want to also have \nentered in the Record that the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated it would be $11 million. That would be the cost to the \ntaxpayers; that is, if the oil companies continue to drill. So she \nmay----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may we have regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't ever remember having one Senator object to \nanother Senator putting a document in the Record. I am kind of shocked \nat that.\n  I ask, again, unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the two \nFederal agencies versus the one that back us up on our documentation. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to have those printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will not object, as long as the Record also shows \nthe CBO has said $11 million and that assumes people are not going to \ngo out of business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator \nentering into the Record anything she wants, but I can say very clearly \nthat we know what this is costing.\n  The Senator herself admits it is $11 million taken out of taxpayer \npockets. We believe it is $66 million.\n  I continue to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that these \npayments, these royalties come through the Federal Government and back \nto many of the States. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. In other words, if there is oil being drilled \nin Texas, it is on Federal lands, but the Federal lands are within \nTexas. Texas gets 50 percent of the royalty payment. I know in \nCalifornia, it is 50 percent if it is onshore and about 25 percent if \nit is offshore. In many of the States, including California, these \nfunds go directly into the classroom and to the schools.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So in some of the States, for example, Texas and \nCalifornia, if the Hutchison amendment passes, there will be fewer \ndollars from these royalty payments coming back to the States of the \ntwo Senators engaged in this debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, and into the classrooms.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, it is my understanding from her \nprevious statement that many of the States have sued the oil companies \nsaying: You didn't pay enough. You owed us more in royalties. You \nunderpaid the amount you were required to pay for drilling for oil on \nfederally owned public lands for profit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is correct. To be very specific, I will tell \nthe Senator, the oil companies that are being so defended here have \nagreed in court to pay up not $1 billion, not $2 billion, but $5 \nbillion to these States; in essence,\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nagreeing that they undervalued. Alaska got $3.7 billion, for example; \nCalifornia, $345 million. By the way, private owners are also \ncomplaining, and they have resolved some of the disputes for $194 \nmillion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, as a followup \nquestion, so I understand it completely, these private oil companies go \non to public lands, drill for oil which they sell for a profit. They \nare charged a royalty based on the price of the oil. The impact of this \namendment by the Senator from Texas would be to say to the Department \nof the Interior: You cannot recalculate the royalty to raise it. So we \nare protecting these oil companies from an increase in what they are \ngoing to pay taxpayers for drilling on public land, which means more \nmoney in their pocket. The losers are not only Federal taxpayers but \nStates such as Texas and California and their taxpayers who lose the \nbenefits of the money that might come back to them from these \nroyalties?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is right. But it is even worse than that \nbecause a royalty payment is a contract. The oil companies have signed \na contract. It says very clearly ``fair market value.'' It is not that \nthe Interior Department wants to increase the percent, for example, \nthat is paid; they just want to make sure the contract is carried out.\n  It says: The value of production for purposes of computing royalty on \nproduction from this lease ``shall never be less than the fair market \nvalue of the production.'' So all they are trying to do is correct a \nserious problem. And we know, because I can show my colleague another \nchart on posted prices versus the market prices of ARCO, I will show \nhim what has happened. Right now the oil companies, these 5 percent of \nthem that are cheating us, they base their royalty payment on what they \ncall posted prices. They create the price. If we could show this to the \nSenator, look at the difference between the market price and the posted \nprice. This is one oil company, but I could show my friend, every \nsingle one of these oil companies, by some kind of magic action, they \nhave the same spread. And if you heard what the ARCO executive said, \nthe former executive, they did this on purpose. They made the posted \nprices below the market price.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I only have three questions, and I will stop.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate my colleague asking as many questions as he \nwants.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator made reference to a Wall Street Journal \narticle where a former official from ARCO said--was this under oath or \nwas it just a public statement in terms of their efforts to try to \nreduce the royalty payments to the Federal Government for this private \ncompany to drill oil on public land and make a profit?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The article that I quoted is Platt's Oilgram News--an oil \nindustry newsletter. In fact, my colleague is right, they talk about a \ncourt case in which a retired Atlantic Richfield employee admitted in \ncourt----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under oath.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Under oath, penalty of perjury, that while he was \nsecretary of ARCO's crude pricing committee, the major's posted prices \nwere far below the market value.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this gentleman, no longer employed, conceded the point \nwhich you have been making during the course of this debate, that these \noil companies are really cheating the Federal Government, the taxpayers \nof this country, because they are using our public lands and not paying \na fair royalty payment for the oil they are extracting and selling at a \nprofit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely right. They are basing their royalty \npayment on a price that is not reflective of the fair market value. It \nis a price they made up. It is as if one day you woke up and let's say \nyou paid rent, which my friend probably does here in Washington, DC, \nand you just decided one day that the fair market value of the rent was \nlower than your lease.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. My landlord wouldn't allow that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He would not allow that. He would probably evict you. Yet \nwhat do we have here in this Senate. We have Senators standing up \ncondoning this kind of behavior.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, in my home State of \nIllinois, there are many small oil producers that are going through \nvery difficult times. Some of them may not survive. There has been an \nargument made that we have to give this break, in the Hutchison \namendment, to these oil companies to help these small producers and \nhelp the oil industry.\n  If I vote against the Hutchison amendment and go home to Illinois and \nface these small oil companies that are trying to survive in difficult \ntimes, will they be saying to me: You have just cut off the flow of \nmoney to us? What companies are affected by this Hutchison amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, let me say there are 777 companies that are not \nimpacted at all by this Interior rule, but there are 44 companies that \nare impacted. Let me say to my colleague, I voted to help the small oil \ncompanies. I was proud to support the Domenici amendment. We took it up \nrecently when we helped the steel companies. If we want to help the oil \ncompanies because they are having tough times, I will be right there. \nIf there are reasons to help smaller companies, I am right there. And I \nhave always been right there.\n  But it seems to me we can't stand on the floor of the Senate and help \nthe largest oil companies--most of these are the largest; not all, but \nmost--5 percent of the oil companies that are out-and-out cheating the \ntaxpayers. We know it because it has been testified to in a court of \nlaw, and we know it because they have been settling these cases all \nover the country. My friend should feel very comfortable when he \nopposes the Hutchison amendment case that he is impacting only 5 \npercent.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware of the fact that the Los Angeles \nTimes, on July 20 of this year, in analyzing this debate, concluded by \nsaying, ``not since the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s has the stench \nof oil money reeked as strongly in Washington as it is in this case''?\n  I ask the Senator from California, isn't it odd that on an \nappropriations bill we are considering a string of riders that are of \nsuch import and controversy, putting them on a spending bill instead of \nhaving a hearing so the oil companies could come in and try to defend, \nif they would like to, so the Department of the Interior can come in \nand basically explain why they think taxpayers across America are \nripped off by this amendment? It seems to me to be an odd state of \naffairs that we have seven, eight, or nine different riders on this \nbill which really go to important, substantive issues that have not \nbeen addressed by this Congress during the course of this year. Does \nthe Senator agree with me that this is an exceptional procedural issue \nto be taking up on a spending bill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I think it is not appropriate. I hope the Senator \nfrom Texas will not proceed with this. She knows if she does--and we \nare very open about this--we are going to be on our feet a long time. \nSo we are going to have a cloture vote to see where this all comes out. \nI want to say this to my friend and then I will yield to my friend from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I just have a question on procedure, not on the substance, \nif the Senator would not mind yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do mind yielding at this point. I don't want to lose my \ntrain of thought.\n  My friend is so right in his understanding of what this means. This \nis an example of legislating on an appropriations bill. This Hutchison \namendment was put into the committee and stripped out because of the \nway it was put into the committee. It was stripped out. It has been \ndefined and technically changed, and now it is being offered. But it is \nstill the same thing. You know, you can put a dress on a hippopotamus \nand it still looks like a hippopotamus. That is what this is. This is a \nvery ugly amendment.\n  I want to mention one thing in answering the question. I was very \npleased that my friend read the Los Angeles Times editorial. It is a \nnewspaper that now has Republican ownership. I think that is very \nimportant. I want to read a couple of other statements from it. I see \nmy friend from\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nWisconsin is here. Is he going to ask me a question as well?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This Los Angeles Times article says, ``The Great American \nOil Ripoff.''\n  It says:\n\n       America's big oil companies have been ripping off Federal \n     and State governments for decades by underpaying royalties \n     for oil drilled on public lands. The Interior Department \n     tried to stop the practice with new rules, but Congress has \n     succeeded in blocking their implementation, and will again if \n     the Senate bill calling for a moratorium on the new rules \n     proposed by Senators Hutchison and Domenici comes up before \n     the Senate.\n\n  It has and here we are.\n\n       The large integrated oil companies, not the small \n     independent producers, have been cheating the State and \n     Federal Treasuries by computing their royalties on the so-\n     called ``posted rights'' rather than the fair market price.\n\n  That is what we are talking about, computing royalties on posted \nrights, rather than fair market price.\n\n       It could be as much as $4 or $5 a barrel lower. \n     The Interior Department estimates this practice costs the \n     taxpayers up to $66 million a year.\n\n  Senator Hutchison says it is $11 million, and that is a lot; but we \nthink it is $66 million, and so does the OMB.\n\n       Two years ago, Interior drew up rules that would stop the \n     underpayment but Congress has blocked implementation.\n\n  They go on to explain:\n\n       The bottom line is, Congress should not buckle to the \n     pressure of the oil companies, and the Hutchison amendment \n     should be defeated.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield briefly, I will leave the \nSenators to debate this. We have the Robb amendment on the floor. \nSeveral of us came to debate that, expecting it would be stacked for a \nvote in the morning. Obviously, you are going to continue this debate \ninto tomorrow. I wonder what your plan is for the evening because it is \npredicated upon a unanimous consent agreement that we want to craft. If \nyou plan to debate late into the evening, we will not stay.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, we don't.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There are four Senators, including the Presiding Officer, \nwho came to the floor because the Senator from Virginia was on the \nfloor with his amendment. We hoped to debate that within the next 35 to \n40 minutes if the Senator will consider yielding the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't have any intention of talking more than 40 \nminutes. I will be yielding for a question. I thought the Senator came \nbecause he was drawn into this debate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No. I just say I think it is a rather baseless debate, \nwith a lot of politics.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will stay out of the substance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to use a little bit of humor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am more interested in the timing for this evening, on \nbehalf of five Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I told my friend the time. I don't intend to go over 40 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not only do I not think this is baseless, I want to touch \nall the bases so the Senator from Idaho can understand why we think \nthis is worthy of debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask the Senator from California this: We had a big debate about \nwelfare reform and welfare ``Cadillacs.'' We are talking about welfare \n``tankers'' here--$11 million--or $66 million going to these major oil \ncompanies. I say to the Senator from California, how many times have we \ndone this? How many times have we postponed this decision by the \nDepartment of the Interior to give to the taxpayers of this country the \nfair share they are entitled to for these oil companies to use our \nlands--the lands of people who live in Illinois, California, Idaho, and \nTexas--to drill oil. How many times has the industry come in and, with \nan amendment similar to the one before us, tried to stop this \nrecalculation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is the fourth time this amendment has come before \nthe body. I have to say to my friend, I don't think it has ever gotten \nthe attention it needs. To come in and say it is a baseless debate, \nwhen we are talking about as much as $66 million on top of the $88 \nmillion we have already lost from the three other times this amendment \ncame before us, is unbelievable to me. It is unbelievable that we close \nour eyes to this kind of purposeful rip off, and to call it a baseless \ndebate, I find that amazing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from California will further yield, is not \nthe fact that these States have come forward in court and sued the oil \ncompanies successfully evidence of the fact that the oil companies have \nbeen underpaying the Federal taxpayers, as well as the State taxpayers, \nand this amendment will continue that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct. Let me reiterate what I said. \nIn cases all across this country, there have been settlements in seven \ndifferent States, and $5 billion has been collected from the oil \ncompanies in these settlements. Now, if the oil companies had such \nclean hands and they were paying their fair amount of royalties, I \nassure my friend they would not part with $5 billion--I didn't say \nmillion, I said $5 billion. I don't even know what $5 billion looks \nlike in a room. All I can say to my friend is, it is more than we spend \non Head Start in a year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from California this because I share \nher strong opposition to this amendment, which would allow oil \ncompanies to continue to underpay the U.S. Government in royalties for \ndrilling on public lands. It is my understanding this rider was \nmodified by the managers' amendment. But, as originally drafted, the \nrider blocks the implementation of new Interior rules to stop these \nunderpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last \nCongress; is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. This is the fourth time that this Interior \nDepartment ``fix'' to ensure fair royalty payments has been stopped in \nits tracks, unless we defeat the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I know the Senator from California is obviously \nconcerned about big windfalls for the oil companies. The Interior \nDepartment estimates that underpayments by the oil companies cost the \ntaxpayers up to $66 million a year. I am wondering if she is aware of \nsome of the largest oil companies that benefit from it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be very pleased if the Senator could put that \ninto the Record because I haven't done that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. They are not small mom-and-pop, independent producers. \nThey are companies like Exxon, Chevron, BP Oil, Atlantic Richfield, and \nAmoco. I ask the Senator if she is aware of some of the campaign \ncontributions that entities such as this put forward in order to \nachieve this end.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad the Senator put out some of the names of \nthe big oil companies that would be impacted by this Interior rule that \nSenator Hutchison is trying to get. Fully 95 percent of the oil \ncompanies are not impacted. Only 5 percent are impacted. The 95 percent \nof the others are paying their fair share of royalty payments. That is \nsomething to be happy about. They are good corporate citizens paying \ntheir fair share of royalty payments based on fair market value just as \nthey signed in their lease agreements with the United States of \nAmerica. But it is the 5 percent of most of the large ones that are \ngetting away with it.\n  I say to my friend that he is a champion of campaign finance reform. \nI am so proud to be associated with him on that issue.\n  I can only say to my friend that this issue was mentioned in the USA \nToday editorial, dated Wednesday, August 26, 1998, that big oil has \ncontributed more than $35 million to national political committees and \ncongressional candidates. They make the point. These are their words, \nnot my words. They say that is a modest investment for protecting \nroyalty pricing arrangements which enables the industry to pocket an \nextra $2 billion.\n  My friend is on a certain track. I think it is important.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am grateful for the Senator's tremendous leadership \non this.\n  She may be aware that from time to time I do something that I call \n``calling of the bankroll''--interest in companies that contribute \nlarge sums of\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nmoney in terms of campaign contributions.\n  I am wondering if the Senator is aware that during the 1997-1998 \nelection cycle oil companies gave the following in political donations \nto the parties and to Federal candidates:\n  Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in \nPAC money.\n  Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 \nin PAC money.\n  I wonder if the Senator is aware that Atlantic-Richfield gave more \nthan $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 in PAC money.\n  BP Oil and Amoco, two oil companies which merged into the newly \nformed petroleum giant, BP Amoco, gave a combined total of $480,000 in \nsoft money, and nearly $295,000 in PAC money.\n  This is just some of the information we have. I don't know if the \nSenator was aware of these figures.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that I was not aware of those specific \nfigures. It is very rare that I feel that if Congress goes along with \nsomething it is really part of an ugly situation. I feel that way here. \nI feel that we have enough information now to take a stand with the \nInterior Department, with the consumers, and with over 70 groups that \nstand with us against the Hutchison amendment.\n  I hope my friend will listen to some of these groups because my \ncolleague, my friend from Texas, listed groups that were with her. I \nthink it is important that we compare these groups, who they stand for, \nand who they speak for. They are with us on our side trying to stop \nthis oil company rip off, stop the Hutchison amendment: American \nAssociation of Educational Services Agencies, American Association of \nSchool Administrators, the American Lands Alliance, the Americans Ocean \nCampaign, the Better Government Association, Common Cause, Consumer \nProject on Technology, Council of State School Officers, Friends of \nEarth, Funds for Constitutional Government, Government Accountability \nProject, Green Peace, the Mineral Policy Standard, National \nEnvironmental Trust, National Parks and Conservation Association, the \nNational Rural Education Association, the National Resources Defense \nFund, the Navajo Nation, Ozone Action, Public Citizens, Congress Watch, \nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Safe Energy \nCommunication Council, the Surface Employees International Union, and \nthe Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\n  They are with us on this.\n  The United Electrical-Radio Machine Workers of America.\n  These are just some of the groups that are opposed to the Hutchison \namendment, for one basic reason: They believe the big oil companies, \nthe 5 percent of them, are cheating the taxpayers.\n  These are all public interest groups.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I finally ask the Senator to make the comparison \nbetween the list that she just read. By and large these are very \nimportant groups that represent the average people of this country. \nThere is no way four of them could get together and give $2.9 million \nas these four corporations I just described did. Obviously these four \ncorporations want this rider to be a part of the Interior \nappropriations bill. It is the powerful political donors. They may well \nget their way despite the credibility of groups and interests that the \nSenator just indicated.\n  I, again, very much thank the Senator from California for her \nleadership on this.\n  I rise today to share my concern about the number and content of \nlegislative riders to address environmental matters contained in the FY \n2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. I hope that all provisions which \nadversely effect the implementation of environmental law, or change \nfederal environmental policy, will be removed from this legislation \nwhen it returns to the floor.\n  I believe that the Senate should not include provisions in spending \nbills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nenvironmentally beneficial regulations from being promulgated by the \nfederal agencies that enforce federal environmental law.\n  I want to note, before I describe my concerns in detail, that this is \nnot the first time that I have expressed concerns regarding legislative \nriders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact \non our nation's environment.\n  For more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable bipartisan \nconsensus to protect the environment through effective environmental \nlegislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the \nAmerican people to protect the quality of our public lands and \nresources. That responsibility requires the Senate to express its \nstrong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in \nspending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nbeneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated or enforced \nby the federal agencies that carry out federal law.\n  The people of Wisconsin have caught on to what's happening here. They \ncontinue to express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in \nspending bills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are \nbeing made without the benefit of an up or down vote.\n  Wisconsinites have a very strong belief that Congress has a \nresponsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters effecting the \nenvironment. We should be on record with regard to our position on this \nmatter of open government and environmental stewardship.\n  I have particular concerns regarding several riders contained in this \nbill. I will site three examples of provisions of concern to me. I am \nconcerned that we failed to strip the rider on the mining millsite \nissue. This is the second rider of this type we have considered. In \nSection 3006 of Public Law 106-31, the 1999 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, Congress exempted the Crown Jewel project in \nWashington State from the Solicitor's Opinion. This rider, in contrast \nto the previous rider, applies to all mines on public lands.\n  I am also concerned that we have chosen to again include a grazing \npolicy rider as well. It requires the Bureau of Land Management to \nrenew expiring grazing permits under the same terms and conditions \ncontained in the old permit. This automatic renewal will remain in \neffect until such time as the Bureau complies with ``all applicable \nlaws.'' There is no schedule imposed on the Agency, therefore necessary \nenvironmental improvements to the grazing program could be postponed \nindefinitely. This rider affects millions of acres of public rangelands \nthat support endangered species, wildlife, recreation, and cultural \nresources. The rider's impact goes far beyond the language contained in \nthe FY 1999 appropriations bill, in which Congress allowed a short-term \nextension of grazing permits which expired during the current fiscal \nyear. As written, this section undercuts the application of \nenvironmental law, derails administrative appeals, and hampers \napplication of the conservation-oriented grazing Guidelines.\n\n  I also want to voice my opposition to the amendment that would allow \noil companies to continue to underpay the U.S. government in royalties \nfor drilling on public lands. I understand that this rider was modified \nby the manager's amendment, but as originally drafted the rider blocks \nthe implementation of new Interior Department rules to stop these \nunderpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last \nCongress.\n  This is a huge windfall for the oil companies--and as it is with so \nmany special interest provisions that find their way into our \nlegislation, to the wealthy donors go the spoils, while the taxpayers \nget the shaft. The Interior Department estimates that these \nunderpayments by the oil companies cost the taxpayers up to $66 million \na year. And the oil companies that enjoy this cut-rate drilling are not \nsmall independent producers. On the contrary, the oil companies that \nbenefit are among the largest in the world. Names like Exxon, Chevron, \nBP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield.\n  I'd like to take a moment to Call the Bankroll on these companies, \nsomething I do from time to time in this chamber to remind my \ncolleagues and the public about the role money plays in our legislative \ndebates and decisions here in this chamber.\n  During the 1997-1998 election cycle, oil companies gave the following \nin political donations to the parties and to federal candidates:\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\n  Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in \nPAC money;\n  Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 \nin PAC money;\n  Atlantic Richfield gave more than $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 \nin PAC money;\n  BP Oil and Amoco, two oil companies which have merged into the newly \nformed petroleum giant BP Amoco, gave a combined total of more than \n$480,000 in soft money and nearly 295,000 in PAC money.\n  That's more than $2.9 million just from those four corporations in \nthe span of only two years, Mr. President. They want this rider to be \npart of the Interior Appropriations bill, and as powerful political \ndonors they are likely to get their way.\n  I'd like to discuss one final rider, which undoubtedly deserves its \nown Calling of the Bankroll. Though I understand that this rider has \nnow been modified by the substitute amendment, the underlying bill \ninitially prohibited the use of funds to study, develop, or implement \nprocedures or policies to establish energy efficiency, energy use, or \nenergy acquisition rules. Unchanged, this language would have blocked \nfederal programs which cut federal agencies' energy expenditures, save \ntaxpayer funds, and contribute to reductions in pollution.\n  In conclusion, I think that delay of mining law enforcement is \nindefensible, as are the other changes we are making in environmental \npolicy without full and fair debate. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin demanding that this bill be cleaned up in Conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and commend my friend from Illinois. I \nthink their questions and their caring are very important to this \ndebate. We have to take a stand on the floor of the Senate once in a \nwhile for average people--people who are faceless in this institution. \nThey think it is dominated by the special interests. My friend from \nWisconsin who works so hard every day to get the special interest money \nout of this Senate has made a very important point--that the very \ncompanies that are going to benefit from the Hutchison amendment have \ngiven huge contributions to Federal candidates and to Federal \ncommittees.\n  If you put that together, as my friend points out, with the retired \nARCO employee testimony under oath that he lied 5 years ago--he \nadmitted he was not truthful when he testified in the deposition that \nARCO-posted prices represented fair market value. He goes on to \nhonestly say he was afraid he would lose his retirement. He was afraid \nhe would be fired. You put together the contributions from big oil with \nthe testimony of this former ARCO employee, who sat in the room when \nthe decision was made to stop taxpayers from getting their fair share--\nwhen you put that together with the recent settlements by many States \nwith the oil companies, the oil companies saying to the States: Take \nyour lawsuit out of here. We will pay you billions of dollars to go \naway. We will not go to court to try to make the case that oil royalty \npayments are fair. You put all of that together, and it adds up to a \nbad situation.\n  I would be so proud of this Senate if we stood together on behalf of \nthe people and on behalf of the consumers against the bad actors in the \noil industry, who according to this employee, said we will put off \njudgment day. We will go take our chances.\n\n       The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they \n     would take the money, accrue for the day judgment, and that's \n     what we did.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  He said this:\n\n       I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued \n     to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the \n     process during the suggestions stage.\n\n  I know colleagues are here on other matters. I just felt it was very \nimportant to lay out the case against the Hutchison amendment. I will \nlay it out again and again and again if I have to. I hope I don't have \nto. I really could. I hope we can vote against cloture and hopefully \nrid this bill of this special interest rider that helps the 5 percent \nof the oil companies that are bad actors.\n  The 95 percent who are paying their fair share are doing fine; they \nwill not be impacted by the Interior Department. It is just that 5 \npercent.\n  This is an important debate. It is not a baseless debate. It is \ndebate on behalf of the hard-working taxpayers. It is a debate on \nbehalf of everyone who pays rent or a mortgage payment every month. \nImagine one day waking up and saying to the bank: Guess what. I don't \nlike my mortgage payment. I'm paying less because it is no longer the \nfair market value as the day I signed up.\n  I think the bank would say: Renegotiating the interest rate is fine; \nbut if you don't pay your fair share, we are taking you to court and we \nwill repossess your house.\n  We cannot allow the top 5 percent of oil companies to act in an \nirresponsible fashion. I hope my colleagues will join with me, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Wellstone, Senator Murray, and many \nother Senators who feel very strongly about this and vote down the \nHutchison amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pertinent letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriation Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the \n     Senate Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of \n     the bill, your consideration of the Administration's views \n     would be appreciated. These views are necessarily preliminary \n     because they are based on incomplete information, since the \n     Administration has not had the opportunity to review the \n     draft bill and report language.\n       The allocation of discretionary resources available to the \n     Senate under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply \n     inadequate to make the necessary investments that our \n     citizens need and expect. The President's FY 2000 Budget \n     proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet such \n     needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by \n     making savings proposals in mandatory and other programs \n     available to help finance this spending. Congress has \n     approved, and the President has signed into law, nearly $29 \n     billion of such offsets in appropriations legislation since \n     1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such \n     proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves \n     forward. In addition, we urge the Committee to reduce \n     unrequested funding for programs and projects in this bill.\n       The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to \n     accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the \n     302(b) allocations. However, it is our understanding that the \n     Committee bill makes major reductions to critical requests \n     for the President's Lands Legacy Initiative and for key \n     tribal programs. We also understand that the bill may include \n     a number of environmental provisions that would be \n     objectionable to the Administration--and would likely not be \n     approved by Congress, if considered on their own. We strongly \n     urge the Committee to keep the bill free of extraneous \n     provisions and to address the following issues:\n       Lands Legacy Initiative/Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     (LWCF). The Administration strongly opposes the \n     Subcommittee's decision not to fund major portions of the \n     President's Lands Legacy Initiative. Overall, only $265 \n     million (33 percent) of the $797 million requested in this \n     bill for the Initiative would be funded. The bill would \n     provide no funding for State conservation grants and planning \n     assistance, and only a portion (11 percent) of the requested \n     increase for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation \n     Fund. It would also make significant cuts in State and \n     Private Forestry grants. Federal land acquisition funding \n     would be cut by more than half from the Lands Legacy request, \n     from $413 million to $198 million. It would be short-sighted \n     to gut this important environmental initiative, given the \n     growing bipartisan recognition of the need for the federal \n     government, the states and the private sector to protect open \n     spaces and preserve America's great places.\n       Land Management Operations. The Administration commends the \n     action of the Subcommittee to address the operational and \n     maintenance needs of land management agencies in Interior and \n     USDA. The Administration is concerned, however, with cuts in \n     key conservation programs. For example, the bill would reduce \n     requests for the Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered \n     species program by $13 million (12 percent) and the Forest \n     Service forest research program by $48 million (25 percent). \n     Increased funding for key programs within the Forest Service \n     operating program, such as wildlife and fisheries habitat and \n     rangeland management, could be offset with reductions in \n     unrequested and excessive funding for timber sale preparation \n     and management.\n       Environmental and Other Objectionable Riders. The \n     Administration strongly objects to objectionable \n     environmental and other riders. Such riders rarely receive \n     the level of congressional and public review required of\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\n     authorization language, and they often override existing \n     environmental and natural resource protections, tribal \n     sovereignty, or impose unjustified micro-management \n     restrictions on agency activities. We urge the Committee to \n     oppose such provisions. For example, the Administration would \n     strongly oppose an amendment that may be offered that would \n     prohibit implementation of the oil valuation rule. Such a \n     prohibition would cost the American taxpayer about $60 \n     million in FY2000.\n       Millennium Initiative to Save America's Treasures. The \n     Administration strongly objects to the lack of funding for \n     this $30 million Presidential initiative to commemorate the \n     Millennium by preserving the Nation's historic sites and \n     cultural artifacts that are America's treasures.\n       National Endowment for the Arts/National Endowment for the \n     Humanities. The Administration strongly objects to the \n     proposed funding levels for the National Endowment for the \n     Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. The \n     Subcommittee's proposed $51 million (34 percent) reduction \n     from the request would preclude NEA from moving forward with \n     its Challenge America initiative which emphasizes arts \n     education and access to under-served communities across \n     America. The $38 million (25 percent) reduction from the \n     request would preclude NEH from expanding its summer seminar \n     series to provide professional development opportunities to \n     our nation's teachers as well as broadening the outreach of \n     its humanities programs. The Administration urges the \n     Committee to approve funding for the Endowments at the \n     requested levels.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express my grave concern over \n     the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY \n     2000 reported by the Committee on Appropriations Bill for FY \n     2000 reported by the Committee on Appropriations. If the bill \n     were presented to the President as it was reported from the \n     Committee, I would recommend that the President veto the \n     bill.\n       The bill contains a number of objectionable legislative \n     provisions, three of which I'd like to highlight. The \n     amendment on mill sites adopted by the Committee permanently \n     extends the Mining Law's existing near-giveaway of Federal \n     lands to include as much acreage as a mining company thinks \n     it can use for mountains of mine waste and spoil. The \n     amendment further tilts the Mining Law against the interests \n     of the taxpayer and the environment, ignoring the need for \n     comprehensive reform.\n       The extension of the moratorium on issuance of new rules on \n     oil valuation will delay these rules for an additional 21 \n     months. Revision of the way royalties are collected is \n     urgently needed to assure the taxpayer a fair return. \n     Extension of the moratorium cuts off the dialogue on how best \n     to do this and will needlessly cost the taxpayers about $120 \n     million in lost royalty payments.\n       It is also my understanding that the Committee adopted an \n     amendment that could limit the implementation of the \n     President's June 3 Energy Efficiency Executive Order to \n     reduce Federal energy costs. Restricting the agencies' \n     ability to improve energy efficiency in our buildings will \n     prevent the Federal Government from saving taxpayer dollars, \n     cutting dependence on foreign oil, protecting the environment \n     through improved air quality and lower greenhouse gas \n     emissions, and expanding markets for renewable energy \n     technologies.\n       Although I appreciate your efforts in re-working the \n     discretionary spending allocations in order to increase the \n     spending limits for the Interior bill in the face of the \n     limitations placed on you under the Budget Resolution, the \n     funding amount proposed by the Senate denies funding to \n     protect America's open spaces and great places for the future \n     through the President's Lands Legacy initiative, as well as \n     critical requests for land management, trust reform, other \n     Indian programs, and science.\n       Overall, the reductions to the budget request seriously \n     impair the Department's ability to be a responsible steward \n     of the Nation's natural and cultural resources and to uphold \n     our trust responsibilities to Indians. The 2000 budget sets a \n     course for the new millennium providing resources that are \n     needed to accommodate increasing demand and use of our public \n     lands and resources. In this decade, visits to parks, refuges \n     and public lands have increased up to 31 percent; the number \n     of students in BIA schools has increased 33 percent; and the \n     BIA service population is up by 26 percent.\n       In this regard, the Committee proposal does not provide \n     sufficient increases to fully operate our National Parks, \n     restore healthy public lands, rebuild wildlife and fisheries \n     resources, clean up streams in support of the Clean Water \n     Action Plan through Abandoned Mine Land grants, or improve \n     the safety of schools and communities for Indians. At the \n     funding level provided, we will be unable to meet the needs \n     expressed by Congress for better stewardship of public lands \n     and facilities, resolution of the Indian trust issue, and \n     improved schools and quality of life in Indian Country. \n     Further, the Committee eliminated funding for the Save \n     America's Treasures program that preserves priority historic \n     preservation projects of national scope and significance.\n       I urge you to reconsider the contents of the Interior bill \n     and work with the Administration and me towards a more \n     balanced approach. I look forward to working with you to \n     address these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Babbit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe the matter before the Senate now \nis the amendment of Senator Robb, and I ask consent of the Senator from \nCalifornia that her presentation, including all of her questions and \nanswers, be included in the Congressional Record immediately after the \nspeeches of Senators Hutchison and Domenici so that the debate on that \nsubject be continuous, and that other speeches during the course of the \nevening be consolidated in the Record on the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his excellent idea. We should keep \nthis debate seamless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Second, I have a unanimous consent agreement under which \nthere will be two votes on the Bond amendment and a vote on the Robb \namendment tomorrow morning that apparently have been cleared.\n  Before I present that, I say we will be in session long enough this \nevening for anyone who wishes to do so to speak on the Bond amendment. \nI believe the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak. The Senator from \nMissouri (Mr. Bond) may return for that subject. Senator Hutchison \nwishes to speak again on her amendment. There may be other speeches on \nthat. There are three or four people here to speak on the Robb \namendment. I want all of the speeches on each of these subjects to be \nconsolidated into one point in the Record.\n  This unanimous consent agreement is not going to limit anyone's right \nto talk on any of these subjects this evening as long as they wish.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield for a question, what is my \nfriend's plan of action on the Hutchison amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe a cloture motion on the Hutchison amendment \nwill be filed tomorrow to ripen sometime early next week. There will be \nlots of time for a discussion of that amendment before any vote on \ncloture takes place.\n  I hope during most of tomorrow, however, we will deal with other \namendments that can be completed and dispensed with. By the time we get \nto a vote on the cloture, we are pretty close to the end of debate on \nthis bill. I don't know if that is true or not. We will have dealt \ntoday in whole or in part with 4 of the 66 amendments that are reserved \nfor the Interior appropriations bill. I trust some will go faster than \nmany of those today.\n  I will state the unanimous consent agreement. Then I intend to speak \nbriefly on the Robb amendment. I believe the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Craig will also speak on that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nvote scheduled at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, notwithstanding rule XXII, the \nSenate resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill and \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nBond amendment No. 1621; following that vote, there will be 2 minutes \nequally divided on the pending Robb amendment No. 1583. I ask unanimous \nconsent no amendments be in order prior to these votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. In light of this agreement, I am able to announce for the \nmajority leader that there will be no further votes today but that \nthere will be three votes at 9:30 tomorrow morning and immediately \nthereafter.\n  I will speak to the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Washington be kind enough to yield \nfor a unanimous consent request so we can make a record of the sequence \nof speakers?\n  I have been here for a while but other Senators have, too. I want to \nspeak to the Bond amendment and I certainly yield to the chair of the \nsubcommittee for his comments on the Robb amendment.\n  Is it appropriate to ask unanimous consent that after the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nWashington completes his remarks, I be given no more than 10 minutes to \nrespond to the Robb amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1583\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with respect to the Robb amendment which \nwould strike section 329 of the bill before the Senate, perhaps the \nbest way to begin my remarks on it is to read that relatively short \nsection.\n  It reads as follows:\n\n       For fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture with \n     respect to lands within the National Forest Service and the \n     Secretary of the Interior with respect to lands under the \n     jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, shall use the \n     best available scientific and commercial data in amending or \n     revising resource management plans for offering sales, \n     issuing leases, or otherwise authorizing or undertaking \n     management activities on lands under their respective \n     jurisdictions provided that the Secretaries may at their \n     discretion determine whether any information concerning \n     wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving any \n     such plan, sale, lease, or other activity and, if so, the \n     type of collection procedures for such information.\n\n  It seems to me there are fundamentally three subjects involved in \nsection 329. The first is, of course, that it applies only to fiscal \nyear 2000, the year covered by this appropriations bill. The second \nsubject is that the two Secretaries managing these national lands shall \nuse the best available scientific and commercial data in dealing with \nthe plans they have for those lands. I can't imagine that there is any \nobjection on the part of the proponents of this current amendment to \nthat language. The third subject says that the Secretaries may, at \ntheir discretion, determine whether any additional information \nconcerning wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving \nthese plans.\n  In other words, section 329 doesn't require these Secretaries to do \nanything. It simply grants them the discretion to act in a reasonable \nfashion.\n  A number of court decisions, pursuant both to the National Forest \nManagement Act and perhaps even more significantly to forest plans \nalready prepared by this Clinton administration and under the \nsupervision of these Secretaries, have stated essentially that before \nany contract is entered with a private organization for the harvest of \ntimber in national forests or on Bureau of Land Management lands, an \nextraordinarily expensive wildlife census must be taken, a census at \nleast as detailed as the census of the people of the United States to \nbe taken next year--on reflection, a census much more elaborate than \nthe census of the people of the United States next year, as we are \ngoing to be asked to spend about $4 billion to count every person in \nthe United States.\n  The cost of carrying out the activities required by our courts on our \nnational forests, if we go forward, would be somewhere between $5 \nbillion and perhaps $9 billion. These are matters that deal simply with \nendangered species. We already have injunctions and orders for the \nFederal Government with respect to protecting endangered species and \nnot allowing them to be harmed by any of these commercial \nactivities. These are, in effect, censuses of everything that exists in \nthe forest, vertebrate and invertebrate, plant and animal species -- \nthe entire works. There are, of course, other decisions on the other \nside of this issue. Section 329 attempts to deal reasonably with these \nrequirements.\n\n  The very groups that brought these actions, various environmental \ngroups, have made two arguments over the course of the last 10 or 12 \nyears that perhaps predominate over the balance of their arguments. The \nfirst is that we should stop engaging in timber sales in which the \nFederal Government--either the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land \nManagement--lose money; that below-cost timber sales are not a wise \ninvestment of the resources of the United States of America. At the \nsame time, of course, they advocate positions, and have succeeded in \nfront of some courts with those positions, the net result of which will \nbe that there can never be a timber sale that is not below cost. The \ncost of any one of these surveys on any public lands will exceed the \nvalue of the timber located on the land. That, of course, in turn, is \nin pursuit of the second goal of many of these environmental \norganizations, specifically including the Sierra Club, and that goal is \nthat there should be no harvest, no harvest under any circumstances, on \nany of our public lands of any of our timber resources. That is a \nformal position of many of the environmental organizations including \nthose that have been plaintiffs in this litigation.\n  The net result of these decisions is the success of that latter \npolicy. The United States of America is not going to spend $9 billion, \nor $5 billion, engaging in these particular surveys. It is not a \nprovident expenditure of our money. There is no money in this \nappropriations bill for such elaborate courses of action under any set \nof circumstances.\n  As a former head of the Forest Service under President Clinton, Jack \nWard Thomas said: This whole idea is designed to make this survey and \nmanagement system unworkable. Scientists are not looking for these \ncreatures in the first place. The Clinton forest plan, which has \nreduced by about 80 percent harvests on the public lands--in the \nPacific Northwest, in any event, it already set aside 84 percent of our \nnational forests essentially as wildlife refuges. The other 16 percent \nhas been considered by this administration for a harvest in the Pacific \nNorthwest of about 1 billion board feet a year. This was the \nPresident's forest plan, his promise in his campaign in 1992 to the \npeople of the Northwest, somewhere between one-fifth and one-sixth of \nwhat was the historic harvest.\n  The President has not been able to keep that promise, even using his \nadministration's present forest policies. He has not reached that \nparticular goal. The harvest under these decisions will be zero because \nthe cost of preparing the sales will simply be too great.\n  This is not a policy--the policy of the present enjoined forms of \nwildlife surveys--that comes from an administration that has been hell-\nbent for leather to harvest trees in the forests either in the Pacific \nNorthwest or in the Southeast, the location of the 11th Circuit, by any \nstretch of the imagination. Nor is this discretion being given to \nofficials in the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the \nInterior who are bound and determined to cut the last tree. This, I \nwant to repeat, is a 1-year provision--that is to say it will apply \nonly through most of the rest of the Clinton administration--granting \ndiscretion to the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, to use their present relatively reasonable \nsystems of determining whether or not some small portions of the 16 \npercent of the national forests not set aside for wildlife purposes can \nbe the subject of timber harvesting contracts. It does not require the \nadministration to follow exactly the procedures it has been following \nwith the Northwest forest plan and its plans for other forests at all. \nIt simply says if in their discretion they think they have done enough, \nthey can go ahead and meet their own very modest goals of at least \nproviding a modest harvest of our timber in our national forests. That \nis all. It is neither more nor less than that. It is not a mandate. It \nis authority to very green, very pro-environmentalist Departments of \nAgriculture and Interior to engage in activities of this nature.\n\n  It is very clear the goal of these lawsuits and the goal of the \norganizations that have brought these lawsuits is not to get these \nsurveys done. The goal is to see to it that the cost of entering into \npreparing for any contract for the harvest of timber is so high that \nnone of them will be worth doing. But the effects of those lawsuits, \nand therefore the effects of this amendment, do not apply only to \ntimber harvesting contracts by any stretch of the imagination. They \nwill apply to any new or different use of any portion of our national \nforests and of our BLM lands. They will apply equally to the building \nof campsites or the improvement of campsites or other recreational uses \nof the forest system itself. As a consequence, the effect of these \npresent lawsuits is to make de facto wilderness areas out of all of our \nnational forest areas and to prohibit any improvement for human \nrecreation, other than that allowed of wilderness areas itself, as well \nas of any timber harvest. It is an extraordinary set of policies that \nare essentially advocated by the Robb\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\namendment, a set of policies based on the proposition from some \nnational environmental organizations that there should be no productive \nuse, no economically productive use, of our national forest system \nwhatsoever.\n  The section 329, which really should not have been contested at all, \nis simply to grant this Clinton administration, for 1 year, the right \nto go ahead with the extremely environmentally sensitive forest plans \nthat it has structured during the course of the last 6 years, not only \nin the Northwest part of the United States but in the Southeast part of \nthe United States and Texas and in every other place, either BLM lands \nor Forest Service lands, and allows them to go ahead. If the President \ndoes not want them to go ahead, if the policies are those advocated by \nthese organizations in these lawsuits, nothing in this section 329 \nprohibits them from adopting those policies. But what it does require \nis that it will require the President to say: Whatever I told the \npeople of the Northwest, whatever I told the people of other parts of \nthe country about a balance, about the proposition that there were \ncertainly some of our national forests that were appropriate for \nproductive use, for the provision of jobs and for the provision of \ntimber resources of the United States, I now have changed my mind. We \nare not going to do it at all.\n  If he wants that as a policy, it is not barred by section 329. But he \nwill not be able to hide behind a court decision and say he is trying \nto do something and trying to abide by a court decision that is \nimpossible, that sets conditions that are impossible economically to \nmeet. We are not going to spend the amount of money necessary to \nconduct these surveys. The surveys are not needed. They are not worth \nit. We either choose to deal reasonably with these issues and allow \nthis President and this administration to conduct the modest harvests \nthat they have thought were appropriate, or we are saying we are not \ngoing to have any harvest at all, and in all probability we aren't \ngoing to have any new recreational activities on our national forests \nas well.\n  Simply stated, that is the issue: Do we trust this administration not \nto go overboard in the nature of harvesting, do we believe this \nadministration to be environmentally oriented or not?\n  Most of us, and I think I speak for the Presiding Officer as well as \nmyself, do not think these forest plans are appropriately balanced as \nthey are, but they do provide for some economically productive use of \nour forests, a productive use that is totally barred under these \ncertain court decisions, whether they are correct or not correct, and \nwhich we allow the administration to politely and courteously either \nabide by or say no, we have a better and more balanced way of doing it.\n  I think it is overwhelmingly appropriate to reject this amendment, to \ntrust this administration not to go overboard in timber harvests by any \nstretch of the imagination, and to allow it to keep the promises it has \nmade for a period of more than 6 years to the people of timber-\ndependent communities all over the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1621\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for recognition. I misspoke earlier. I \nwish to speak to the Bond amendment, not the Robb amendment.\n  The Bond amendment is another one of these legislative riders on \nspending bills. It is an attempt to change environmental policy with an \namendment to the appropriations bill for the Department of the \nInterior. The reason it is being done this way, of course, is it avoids \nany committee hearing, any opportunity for any witnesses or public \ninput.\n  There are seven, eight, or nine different environmental riders that \nhave been attached to this spending bill. The administration has \nindicated that unless they are removed, there is a strong likelihood \nthat an otherwise good bill will be vetoed by the President because \nriders, such as the one I am about to address, go way too far.\n  One might wonder why I am addressing the issue of a national forest \nin Missouri since I represent the State of Illinois. I am from \ndownstate Illinois. I was born in East St. Louis, and the Ozarks are an \nimportant recreational area for everyone who lives in the region. It is \nnot only a regional treasure but a national treasure which has been \nrecognized by a designation as a national forest.\n  Last year, the attorney general of Missouri, Jay Nixon, joined \nenvironmental groups in petitioning the Secretary of the Interior \nasking him under his authority, under the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act, to remove from access to mining 400,000 acres in the \nMark Twain National Forest.\n  Those of us who live in that region know this is an especially \npopular area of the Ozarks. The watersheds of the Current, Jacks Fork, \nand Eleven Point Rivers are in this region. Many of my friends and \nfamily go to the Ozarks for canoeing. They love it because of its \npristine beauty, and they believe the attorney general, Jay Nixon, was \ncorrect when he petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to preserve \nthis area and to stop it from being used for lead mining.\n  This is Federal public land that a private company, a lead mining \ncompany, wants to come in and mine for profit. The Interior Department \nhas the authority to say no, it is important environmentally and we \nshould not allow this kind of commercial use. That is what they would \ndo were it not for the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, wants to remove the authority of \nthe Department of the Interior to protect the Mark Twain National \nForest from lead mining. Is this a popular concept? It probably is with \nsome companies. Not only the attorney general of Missouri but the \nGovernor of Missouri has written protesting this action being taken by \nthis Bond amendment.\n  Governor Mel Carnahan from Jefferson City, MO, has written and said:\n\n       I believe you will agree the watersheds of the Current, \n     Jacks Fork and Eleven Point rivers are among the most \n     beautiful and pristine areas of Missouri. These crystal clear \n     streams are great recreational assets which should be \n     protected for future generations to enjoy.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The environmental risk of lead mining and potential for \n     toxic contamination of these pristine waterways are well \n     understood. The Interior Secretary's authority to \n     protect sensitive public lands should be preserved.\n\n  He says to my colleague from Missouri:\n\n       I respectfully request you withdraw your amendment.\n\n  But that amendment has not been withdrawn. It will be voted on \ntomorrow.\n  I can say further there are groups across Missouri that oppose this \ninvasion of a pristine area, a watershed of the Mark Twain National \nForest, for the purpose of lead mining. The St. Louis Post Dispatch, \nthe largest newspaper in the State, has editorialized against this and \nhas said, frankly, that this is an effort to allow this company to come \nin and mine an area which is of critical importance to the people of \nMissouri.\n  The Kansas City Star, an equally influential paper, has come to the \nsame conclusion that the Bond amendment is a mistake, a mistake which \nthreatens the watersheds of the crystal clear streams of the Current, \nJacks Fork, and Eleven Point Rivers.\n  For those who believe this lead mining operation is somehow \nantiseptic and will not leave a legacy, I say they are wrong, and the \nscientific studies have proven that. We know what is going to happen if \nwe allow these companies to come in and mine lead in this beautiful \narea. We know the potential for contaminating the streams. We know the \npotential for leaving behind the waste from their mining operations.\n  Some might argue that it is worth it because it creates jobs, and yet \nstudy after study reaches the opposite conclusion.\n  This is primarily a tourist area, a recreational area recognized all \naround the Midwest. To defile it with lead mining to create a handful \nof jobs for mining purposes is to jeopardize the attraction of this \narea for literally thousands of people in the Midwest and across the \nNation. That is why it is such a serious mistake. I daresay if this \namendment had been offered on an ordinary bill, there would have been a \nlong line of people to come in and testify, not only environmentalists \nwho\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\noppose the Bond amendment, but certainly those who are in authority in \nthe State of Missouri, Governor Mel Carnahan, Attorney General Jay \nNixon, as well as many other groups of ordinary citizens who believe \nthis is a national treasure that should not be defiled so one company \ncan make a profit.\n  On the spending bill for the Department of the Interior, this is \nanother one of the environmental riders designed to benefit a private \ninterest at the expense of American taxpayers who own this public land, \nat the expense of families who enjoy this recreational area, at the \nexpense of people who look forward to a weekend on the Current River \nbecause of its beauty.\n  Frankly, this is a big mistake, and I hope the Senator from Missouri \nwill have second thoughts before he calls it up for a vote tomorrow \nmorning. I hope he will listen carefully to the leaders in the State, \nas well as the environmental groups, who are standing up for one of the \nmost precious resources in Missouri.\n  I hope he will join them in saying the Mark Twain National Forest and \nthe watershed of these great rivers are worth protecting, worth \npreserving, and should not be allowed to be invaded by a lead mining \ncompany that wants to come in and mine on Federal public lands at the \nexpense of this great national resource.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nmotion to strike Section 329 of the Interior appropriations bill. This \nsection is necessary to counter an extremely adverse ruling by the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has just been described by my \ncolleagues, as well as a preliminary injunction recently handed down by \nJudge Dwyer in the U.S. District Court.\n  The case before Judge Dwyer involves the implementation of the \nClinton-Gore Northwest Forest Plan, which was unveiled in 1993. At the \ntime, President Clinton said that it ``provides an innovative approach \nfor forest management to protect the environment and to produce a \npredictable and sustainable level of timber sales.''\n  The real travesty here is that the supporters of Section 329 are \ntrying to fulfill the commitments made by this Administration in 1993, \nand we are now doing so over the objection of the Administration.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan was supposed to be the Clinton \nAdministration's historic compromise between timber harvesting and the \nenvironment. For National Forests covered by the Plan, timber harvests \nwere reduced by 80 percent. Apparently, that wasn't enough for those \nwho want no timber harvests, because they are again challenging \nimplementation of the Plan in Court.\n  While Judge Dwyer issued a preliminary injunction against the sales \ndirectly challenged in the case, the effect of his August 2, 1999, \nruling is much broader.\n  The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have made a \ndecision not to award any previously-auctioned sales until the lawsuit \nis resolved. Further, the agencies do not plan to offer any additional \nsales until their supplemental EIS on survey and manage is completed \nand approved.\n  While the Forest Service claims this will be completed by February of \n2000, history tells us that this EIS will be appealed and litigated. In \nfact, the Forest Service hasn't produced a region-wide EIS for the \nNorthwest for 10 years that hasn't been litigated.\n  The current or planned sales affected by Judge Dwyer's ruling contain \nabout 500 million board feet of timber. Since there will be no future \nsales until the EIS is completed, the total volume affected could be 3 \ntimes that high.\n  Further, because many of these sales have already been awarded, if \nthey are enjoined and operations are delayed, or if the government is \nforced to cancel these sales, the government will be potentially liable \nfor hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\n  Because so little volume has been sold to date, and is therefore \navailable to purchasers, the injunction of this volume will lead to \nimmediate mill closures, increasing the government's liability for \ndamages.\n  The issue in this case involves the Administration's implementation \nof one part of the Clinton-Gore Forest Plan, concerning surveys for 77 \nrare species of fungi, lichens, mosses, snails, and slugs, and for a \nsmall mammal called the red-tree vole. Six years into the 10-year plan, \nthe agencies still do not know how to conduct surveys for 32 of the \nrare species.\n  None of these species is threatened or endangered. Although these \nsurveys are only one piece of the Plan, the consequences of the case \nare potentially enormous.\n  The real fallacy of the survey and manage requirement is that we are \nonly going to survey on those lands where ground-disturbing \nactivities--such as recreational improvements and timber sales--are \nplanned. In the National Forests covered by the President's Plan, this \namounts to about 12 percent of the total forest base that is still \navailable for multiple use.\n  This is not going to tell us about the overall health of these \nspecies, since we aren't going to be looking for these species in the \nremaining 88 percent of the land base.\n  Unfortunately, it could also apply to needed forest restoration \nactivities such as prescribed burns and reforestation on other selected \nparts of the forests, thereby delaying these activities and increasing \ntheir costs.\n  It is unfortunate that the Clinton-Gore Administration ever included \nthis provision in the Northwest Forest Plan.\n  But having done so, it is a travesty that the Administration's \nfailure to effectively implement the plan has resulted in another \ninjunction that will further erode our timber communities.\n  With respect to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, it \nrequires surveys for all ground-disturbing activities.\n  This means not only timber sales, but recreation improvements and \nforest management activities. Some preliminary cost estimates put the \nnationwide implementation of the Eleventh Circuit court ruling at $9 \nbillion. It is a Trojan horse rolled in by candidate Clinton to destroy \nan industry.\n  Therefore, we should make the public policy decision that we will \nallow forest managers to use the best available commercial data in \namending or revising resource management plans, as Section 329 \nstipulates.\n  This is the standard for data under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The language in Section 329 does not preclude the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture from gathering additional data.\n  It simply gives the Secretaries more discretion to meet land \nmanagement objectives in a timely manner.\n  Section 329 is designed to give the Clinton administration officials \nexactly the flexibility in land management that they argued for in \ncourt.\n  I am deeply saddened that in the face of the economic crisis about to \nbe visited on my constituents, the President isn't 100 percent behind \nretaining this language.\n  This isn't an agonizing choice for me at all. If I have to choose \nhere between surveying for red tree voles or keeping hundreds of \nOregonians employed in family-wage jobs, I will vote for families.\n  I know that there are those who don't think the language in Section \n329 is the best language possible.\n  I will commit to work with my colleagues and the Administration to \nsee if we can improve this language. But I will strongly oppose efforts \nto strike it.\n  I urge anyone who has a National Forest in their State to support \nretention of Section 329.\n  If the Eleventh Circuit Court ruling is ever applied nationwide, we \nwill have tied the hands of professional land managers with an \nexpensive, time-consuming and ineffective requirement.\n  I believe my colleague from Virginia has the best of motives, but I \nonly wish he could go with me to rural Oregon and see the human \nconsequences of what he proposes.\n  I began my political career in 1992 running for a rural seat in the \nOregon State Senate. It was the same election year that now-President \nBill Clinton sought the Presidency. I watched as an opponent of his \ncampaign with admiration for the skill with which he came to my State \nand reached out to those in the rural communities and made some very \ndramatic promises, some promises which he said would protect\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\nthe environment and ensure a sustainable harvest of timber.\n  He carried my State. He carried your State, Mr. President, with these \nsame promises because a lot of people wanted to believe in him.\n  I have noted with great interest that recently the President --and I \napplaud him for this--has gone to rural Appalachia. I don't know \nwhether he went to parts of the State of the Senator from Virginia. I \nknow he went to West Virginia, and he decried poverty levels that are \nlamentable and awful. But there are parts of my State as a result of \nhis forest policies which are in worse shape than those he visited in \nAppalachia.\n  I rise today with a lot of emotion in my heart because I think the \ntruth has not been told and promises have not been carried out.\n  I have recently come from a town hall meeting in Roseburg, OR, where \npeople are finally looking at oblivion because their jobs are directly \ndependent upon the sales that have now been enjoined by Judge Dwyer in \nthe district court of the Ninth Circuit.\n  I hope I can reach the heart of every one of my colleagues because \nthis stuff matters in human terms. I wish they would have a more honest \napproach and say: We don't want any more harvest of timber; let's shut \nit all down. At least that would be honest. This isn't.\n  I wish they could see the kids in John Day, OR, who go to school 4 \ndays a week because they can't afford to open the school for 5. I want \nmy colleagues to understand what they are voting for. If you distill \nthis down, this is about pitting a survey of fungus, snails, and slugs \nagainst children and families who need streets and schools.\n  Now, lest you think the last pine tree in Oregon is about to go down, \nI am sorry to disabuse you. You can't stop timber from growing in my \nState. We went to the CRP area not far from where I live. There are \nwheat fields that formerly were in wheat that were left to go to \nnature, and there are Ponderosa trees going up everywhere. They are 12 \nfeet high now.\n  I know what the New York Times says. I know what the Washington Post \nsays. But like some of my colleagues, they have never been to my State. \nThey have never looked into the eyes of the schoolchildren who, \nfrankly, don't have an adequate education because the Federal \nGovernment made promises to them and their county officials and their \nschool officials that are being denied to them in a very dishonest and \ndisingenuous way.\n\n  I am angry. It is not right. It is not right to go win an election \nand then supposedly put up a program that is to provide for the \nenvironment, to provide a sustainable yield, and then through \nsubterfuge make sure it doesn't happen, when you have a year to go in \nyour term, when you are decrying poverty elsewhere in this country, but \nyou are creating it in my backyard.\n  I don't think the Senator from Virginia would offer this motion to \nstrike if he could go with me to Roseburg, OR. It has been a long time, \nhas been a lot of heartache, a lot of pain, but it is getting old. It \nis almost over. Here you and I are defending the President's plan, \ntrying to help him live up to his promises. I want the American people \nto know that the Clinton-Gore forest plan, at the beginning at least, \nwas honest enough to say: The traditional harvest you have had, we are \ngoing to cut it by 80 percent, by 80 percent. The reality is, it is not \neven 10 percent of what is delivered, and now what we are seeing is \nthere is going to be nothing delivered.\n  That isn't right. A sustainable yield of 20 percent is all that was \npromised, and yet even that apparently is another mirage.\n  Well, I know the President wishes we didn't have to do a rider, but \nit is the only tool left because we are running out of time. Your \nproposal is for a year to allow the Federal courts to allow these sales \nto go forward. Without the Clinton-Gore forest plan, these sales would \nbe fine; these meet the Endangered Species Act, but somehow in the \ncreation of this plan, they have put in a survey system that isn't \neconomical. It isn't going to happen. It isn't even necessary. It is a \nfraud. It is a way to undermine their own promises.\n  Well, history tells us this is not going to happen now. I regret to \ntell the people of rural Oregon that the Clinton forest plan is a \nfailure to them.\n  Another irony. I heard my colleague from Virginia say he read a \nletter from the Forest Service about their new-found position on this \nissue. Why didn't they argue that in court? If it was an argument to be \nmade a month ago, why isn't it still a good argument. They have \nreversed course. Why? Is it only about politics? I think people are \nsick of that. I think people are ready to be told the truth, and they \nthought they had been told the truth by the President, at least when it \ncame to his forest plan. I regret to tell them that apparently they \nhave not been.\n  What is at stake? In Judge Dwyer's ruling, about 500 million board \nfeet of timber. By the way, to my colleagues on the other side, if you \nthink by killing the forest industry in this country you are somehow \nsaving the environment, you are the best friend the Canadians and the \nNew Zealanders have ever had because the U.S. demand and use of timber \nis not going down. It is going up. We have just exported those jobs. So \nwe pat ourselves on the back that we somehow have taken care of our \nforests, even though it is growing at record rates and subject to \ncatastrophic fire. Even though we pat ourselves on the back, we are \npillaging our neighbors' land.\n  I am simply saying, the promise of the President to have a \nsustainable harvest and a good environment are possible, but it isn't \npossible with this. We are trying to help the President make it \npossible.\n  I am saying what is being asked for by the courts now, as required by \nthe Clinton-Gore forest plan, is a survey for 77 rare species of fungi, \nlichens, mosses, snails, slugs, and for a small mammal called the red \ntree vole. Well, the agencies don't know how to conduct these things. \nThey don't even know some of these species. The amount of land that is \nat issue is 12 percent of 100 percent of the land, so 88 percent of the \nland is not going to be surveyed, only the area where they are digging \naround. No one contends that any of these things are endangered at all. \nWhat is endangered is rural people, creating a new Appalachia with \nchronic poverty. We are doing it in my State while he decries it in his \nState. That isn't right, not when they have been promised something \nbetter.\n  I conclude my remarks by pleading with my colleagues not to put in an \nartificial requirement that we will not fund, which is not necessary \nand which can be adequately provided for, by the way you described it, \nby giving to the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture the power \nto do what they already do under the Endangered Species Act, by giving \nthem that power and allowing these things to go forward and keeping \nsome promises. Why don't we keep some promises around here?\n  I want my colleagues to know this is about a survey versus families. \nIt is about snails and slugs versus streets and schools. I ask you to \noppose the motion to strike this amendment. What is being done here is \nwrong. It has human consequences, and we in this Senate ought to be \nbigger than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the impassioned \nplea of my friend from Oregon. Last week, we sold a lumber mill in \nMontana. Darby Lumber went down because they could not get logs. Mills \nare hauling logs in from Canada, 500 miles, and it is like my friend \nfrom Oregon said--we are decimating our neighbors' lands because we \nhave not had the nerve to be honest with the American people.\n  To give you an idea, up in the northwestern part of Montana, we are \ngrowing about 120 million board feet of lumber a year. The Forest \nService makes plans to harvest about 19 million board feet. The truth \nis, America, we will be lucky if we harvest 6 million board feet.\n  Opposition to section 329 flatly contradicts previous positions taken \nby the environmental community and this administration on the best \nmethods for protecting wildlife. Section 329 would restore to the \nadministration the authority to plan and account for wildlife \nprotection by surveying habitat--a method employed for over two decades \nand that has been approved by seven Federal courts, including three \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\ncourts of appeal. The recent Eleventh Circuit decision contradicted \nthis consensus judicial opinion and would require the agency to provide \nprotection to wildlife by counting--not once but twice--the number of \nmembers of each of 20 to 40 management indicator and sensitive species \nbefore undertaking any ground-disturbing activities in our national \nforests--be it timber harvesting, be it watershed restoration, be it \ntrail building, be it maintenance, or be it for the prevention of fire. \nI guess this is one reason you can't run a pretty good ranch or a \npretty good farm that depends on renewable resources by a committee, \nfor the difference of opinion on how we should do things. If left to \nthat, we would never get in a crop. America would never have a \nsubstantial, sustaining supply of food.\n\n  The emphasis the Forest Service has placed on habitat availability \ninstead of counting the members of individual species is exactly the \npolicy advocated by the environmental community. I wonder, at this time \nwhen they change the policy, what is the motive here? What is the \nmotive? Is it us against them? I don't think so. I don't know of \nanybody who stands in this body to decimate the environment. But I \nwonder, of all the fires that are burning in the West today, if a \nlittle management on fuel buildup could not have prevented some of \nthose. But somebody thought a mouse was too important that we can't \ndisturb the land, and it burns.\n  Virtually every environmental organization has insisted the law be \nreformed to address habitat protection and away from narrow species-by-\nspecies focus. Indeed, the provision in the Endangered Species Act that \nthe environmentalists most frequently quote in both the Senate and the \nHouse, and in Federal courtrooms across the country, is the first \nphrase in the statement of purpose in section 2(b):\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby \n     ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened \n     species depend may be preserved.\n\n  Now, we can argue on philosophy, but I think we are arguing on \npolitics, and what is at stake is families. Also, what is at stake is \nthe forest itself. I invite the Senator from Virginia to go with me \nthis weekend. I will take him up in the Yak, where we have infestation \nof the pine beetle, dying trees, and a forest that would just shock \nhim. It would absolutely shock him to his shoes. He would be \ndevastated, looking at that forest. Yet the environmental community has \nmade up its mind that we are not going to harvest; we are going to let \nit burn. I don't think that is why the Senator from Virginia wore the \nuniform as long as he did, to protect that kind of mismanagement of the \ncountry he so loves, or even the people he so loves.\n  The administration has been even more adamant in insisting on a \nhabitat approach to wildlife protection. That is what they told us when \nthey first came to office. It has championed two land management \nconcepts--ecosystem management and biological diversity protection--\nthat rely entirely on methodologies which concentrate on habitat rather \nthan individual species. Certainly, ecosystem management is a fancy way \nof saying habitat management. I don't have very many of those fancy \nwords; I have to write them down.\n  But it is funny what you can see from horseback. Sometimes you can \nsee over tall mountains and tall buildings and over very high-minded \nideas that don't work. They have never worked; they never will work. \nSo, too, when biological diversity is considered, conservation \nbiologists insist on treating habitat as the source of wildlife and \nplant diversity and resist focusing on individual species. They have \nalways done that.\n  We have embraced that philosophy and that approach. That means we can \ndo something about managing our land in the highest standard of \nenvironmental protection and still harvest the crop with which the God \nabove has so blessed this country.\n  Finally, the capstone of this administration's wildlife policy is the \nhabitat conservation planning and incidental take, permitting it is \nconducting with private landowners helping them provide habitat for \nendangered species.\n  How can a man stand here and even talk about endangered species when \nyou have only one crop that you get paid once a year for and you see \nwolves killing right out of your own pasture not 300 feet away from \nwhere you live? And there is not a thing you can do about it.\n  Does anyone want to go out and face that man and tell him and his \nfamily, well, we have some folks that like to hear that yipping and \nhowling? After they get done with their kill, they will go across the \ncreek, which is only about 400 yards, and they will lay there and they \nwill rest until they get hungry again. That is almost unbelievable to \nme.\n  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about \nsomething that doesn't work. We are talking about people who are very \nsmart and very intelligent but have little or no wisdom--higher than \nthee, elitist--who prevent men and women who were born of the soil, \nborn of the land, worked the land, and will die and go back to the \nland. I guess one could say we are all just circling the brink because \nthat is where we are going to go. Maybe you never know how that is \ngoing to turn out.\n  Despite the solid momentum away from attention to single species and \ntoward consideration of habitats, we now see the very advocates of this \napproach criticizing it in their attacks on section 329. I wonder how \nthey will feel when they are successful in stripping 329 from the bill \nonly to discover that the U.S. Forest Service--one of the first \nagencies to adopt a habitat approach to wildlife protection--must now \nabandon it to follow the expensive--in fact, it is too expensive. We \nknow that the money will never be appropriated. So it will not be done. \nIt is an outdated process of counting individual members of one species \nafter another, like I said, not once but twice. I am just asking that \nwe have an attack of common sense--just common sense, everyday common \nsense that the rest of America uses every day just to subsist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to visit with my \ncolleague from Virginia who has offered an amendment to strike section \n329 of the Interior appropriations bill. I am pleased that he is on the \nfloor. I am extremely pleased that he listened with great attention to \nthe Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Montana, and that he will \nlisten to this Senator from Idaho whose State is 63 percent owned by \nthe Federal Government and whose policy as to how those lands are \nmanaged is determined on the floor of the Senate by this Senator, the \nSenator from Virginia, and others.\n  I listened to the Senator this afternoon as he offered his amendment \nto strike section 329. I must tell you that I listened with a degree of \nfrustration, certainly in no disrespect to the Senator, but to what I \nsensed was a lack of understanding of what has brought us to this issue \nand why the Appropriations Committee found it necessary at this moment \nin time to speak out and to clarify public policy that the Senator from \nVirginia is trying to undo.\n  The Senator from Montana, the Senator from Oregon, myself, and others \nfrom large public land and forest States have grown tremendously \nfrustrated not by just this administration but by public policy that \nputs all of us at odds. That arguably does not provide the kind of \nenvironmental protection many of us would like and that would allow the \nbalance between environmental protection and under that important \numbrella the effective use or utilization of our resources like timber.\n  So we had a judge in the Eleventh Circuit who probably really has \nnever been West, nor does he understand the West, make a ruling on a \nground-disturbing activity of the Forest Service on its lands and say \nthat you haven't studied thoroughly enough how that activity \ncontributes to the demise of a plant, a fungus, a slug, a snail, or an \nexotic animal. This judge went against decades of science, and even \nnine court decisions that had largely said the Forest Service was doing \nan adequate job in its overview of the endangered species \nresponsibility under the Endangered Species Act through an \nenvironmental impact study.\n  The Senator from Oregon was talking about the judge's decision in the \nEleventh Circuit being picked up by the\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\njudge in the Ninth Circuit, and without any real consideration, just \narbitrarily spreading across the pages of his decision: Well, if it is \ngood enough in the Eleventh Circuit, it is good enough in the Ninth.\n  Ironically, in the Ninth Circuit, what the Senator from Oregon was \ntalking about was the most comprehensive, above the level of science \nthat has been practiced, reviewed, and mandated under the President's \nown forest plan. There was a comprehensive effort between the Forest \nService and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine \nFisheries that all aspects of the disturbance would be studied before \nthese timber sales or other activities would go on.\n  As a result of that, I think it is tremendously important for the \nSenator from Virginia to understand--I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee--we did not attempt to do anything extraordinary. We just \ntried to say in public policy that what the judge in the Eleventh \nCircuit had done, what the judge in the Ninth Circuit was doing, and \nwhat a judge in Texas has already picked up on is really outside \nscience.\n  A committee of scientists empowered by this Secretary of Agriculture, \nDan Glickman, just this last year reported back to the Department of \nAgriculture and to the U.S. Forest Service that the science they were \nusing that the judge in the Eleventh Circuit knocked down was the right \nscience--that you use indicator species, that you didn't need to get \nout on the ground and count every plant, or animal, or microorganism.\n  It was unnecessary to do this to determine the kind of impact that a \n``Ground disturbing activity'' would have on the ground. But it was \nvery important for the state of the science involved to use the \nindicator species concept that had been used and upheld in nine \ndifferent court decisions as the right approach.\n  I guess what I am saying to the Senator from Virginia tonight is how \nlong do we fight? How long do we see this kind of conflict that stops \nall kinds of activity before the Senator from Virginia is willing to \nstand up with the Senator from Idaho and do what is our responsibility, \nand that is crafting sound public policy that disallows the courts and \nthe judges from being the public land managers of our States.\n  Yet the Senator from Virginia tonight says: I want the judge to \ndecide.\n  But he didn't really quite say it that way, and it would be unfair. \nWhat he is saying is, let the process continue to go forward.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the chief of the Forest Service is \nnot in the gallery tonight saying to the Senator from Virginia: You \nshouldn't be doing this.\n  What the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, put in this legislation \nallows the Forest Service to continue to do what the courts and a team \nof scientists said is the right thing to do: That is, when you are \ndoing these surveys use the appropriate science, the indicator species, \nin making the determination as to how to mitigate for a surface-\ndisturbing activity. However, the chief of the Forest Service isn't \nhere tonight nor was he willing to stand up and speak out loudly.\n  What this administration I think is saying, and I trust that it has \nto be as reasonably disturbing to the Senator from Virginia as it is to \nthis Senator from Idaho, is continue to work through the court process. \nWe think we can work this out.\n  Ironically enough, their working it out means they have already lost \n3 lawsuits, they have already lost 3 times. They are still saying: \nTrust us, we know how to work it out.\n  Even the forest plan that the President himself staked his public \nland reputation on is in the tank out in Oregon, Washington and \nnorthern California. Thousands of people will be out of work this \nwinter because this President wouldn't stand up and ask his chief of \nthe Forest Service to fight for what he originally said he thought was \nright.\n  He says: Let us work through the court process.\n  How long will it take? We don't know. A year, until after the next \nelection? Possibly.\n  What is most important for the Senator from Virginia to understand is \nthat what is in 329 is not outside the law. Let me read the language:\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service shall \n     use the best available science and commercial data in \n     amending and revising resource management plans for and \n     offering sales, issue leases or otherwise authorizing or \n     undertaking management activities on, land under their \n     respective jurisdiction.\n\n  Where does the language come from? Not out of the mind of the Senator \nfrom Washington who is the chairman of the Interior appropriations \nsubcommittee. It comes out of endangered species law. It comes out of \nthe act itself. It is the operative language that drives the Endangered \nSpecies Act. It is not new language. It is not new law.\n  Then we go on to say,\n\n       Provided that the Secretaries may at their discretion \n     determine whether any additional information concerning \n     wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving any \n     such plan, sales, lease or activities.\n\n  Full discretion to the secretary, to the managing agency. Not new \nlaw. Empowering them to do the right thing with their scientists and \ntheir expertise. That is what we are doing. We are empowering Bill \nClinton. We are empowering Mike Dombeck, the chief of the Forest \nService. Yet they are saying, just work this out through the courts. \nWhat if they lose the fourth time and it is a year from now and nobody \nis in the mills and nobody is working and thousands of people are out \nof work in Oregon, Washington and northern California?\n  Or should we talk for just a few moments about the activities on the \nGeorge Washington and the Jefferson National Forests in the home State \nof the Senator from Virginia? Not much timbering in his home State, but \nthere is a lot of ``people'' activity, a lot of trails, a lot of \nmanagement and road building. Flood control in the Cascade National \nRecreation Area, a contract involved with repair and construction of \nfour bridges and relocation of portions of the trail and stone \nstructures and retaining walls. All of it is surface-disturbing \nactivity; all of it because someone didn't like it, a lawsuit is filed, \nand a judge stops it because the Forest Service doesn't know how to do \nthese kind of things.\n\n  No, not at all. Because the Forest Service didn't examine whether \nrepairing an old trail wall disturbs a lichen or a moss on the wall of \nstone that was originally put there by man himself. That doesn't make \nmuch sense, does it? But that is exactly what striking section 329 will \ndo.\n  I wish the Senator could stand up and say let's abide by science, \nlet's not play this out in the courts anymore. Let's empower the chief \nof the Forest Service and the assistant secretary of agriculture and \nthe President himself. I don't find myself on the floor of the United \nStates very often defending this President. I don't think he has had \ngood public land policy. But in one area where he really tried, now he \nhimself will not even defend his effort. His chief of the Forest \nService is trying to avoid the pressure by environmental groups who see \nthis exactly the way the Senator from Oregon spoke to it this evening: \nA way to turn the forest off.\n  They will not only stop logging, they will turn your forests off. \nThey will attack any surface-disturbing activity, even if it is a \ntrail, a trail head, or a campground that may facilitate the very \ncitizens of the State of Virginia who enjoy their public lands and \ntheir two national forests.\n  As the Senator from Virginia knows, in the mid-1970s we passed the \nNational Forest Management Act. That was to direct the most \ncomprehensive review of every forest in the United States. From that \nwas to come a management plan and a way to execute that plan. The \nSenator from Virginia knows as do I that he and I and the taxpayers \nspent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars developing those plans. It \nwas the most comprehensive land-planning exercise in the history of the \nworld. We developed computer models. We looked at every aspect, every \nwatershed, all of the character and the nature of this public land. It \nwas right that we did so. Our forests now operate under those plans. \nEvery activity was viewed through a grid that determines whether they \nare endangering a species of any kind. That is what I spoke to a few \nmoments ago. However, that whole effort cost a quarter of a billion \ndollars, or near that.\n  What the amendment of the Senator would do, and if the courts were to \nwin--not the policy makers that we\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nwere elected to be, but a judge, an appointed judge who does not know \none thing about the forests in Oregon or Idaho because he is reviewing \nan activity in a forest in the State of Georgia, he is saying get out \nthere on your hands and knees with as many scientists as you can muster \nand count and look at every little tidbit.\n  The Senator from Oregon went through that litany of mosses, snails \nand critters tonight. It is estimated, just estimated, that to do that \nkind of an evaluation on an acre-by-acre basis across the landscape of \nthe public forests of our country would cost 5, 8, or $9 billion \ndollars. The Senator from Virginia knows, as do I, we will not \nappropriate that money. That kind of money doesn't exist and that kind \nof money should never be spent on this kind of activity. The scientists \nwho are good scientists--not judges, and not environmentalists who want \nto see the world shut down--are saying that the standards and the tests \nand the indicator species and the work that is being done today is \nthorough, adequate and responsible. Yet the amendment of the Senator \ndenies that because that is the exact language that was put in this \nsection of the appropriations bill.\n  Why is it important we do it now? We heard from the Senator from \nOregon. I have been to John Day and I have been to Roseburg. Those are \nmill towns. Those are little communities with millions of acres of \npublic timber land around them. The people who live there make their \nlivelihood from logging. It has changed some because logging has \ndiminished dramatically in those areas.\n  But what the action of the Senator from Virginia is doing, if he is \nsuccessful, is it turns off those timber sales, nearly 500 million \nboard feet of timber that would keep those mills operating through the \nwinter and into the spring. Because no longer do we operate on a 3-year \npipeline, they call it, where you have timber adequate in the pipeline \nfor a 3-year period. That ended with the Clinton administration. Now we \nare on nearly a timber sale by timber sale basis.\n  Yet, remember the reduction in timber sales that the Senator from \nOregon talked about? We are not talking about cutting anywhere near \nprevious levels. We have an 80 percent lower cut in 8 years. And even \nthat which this President said was adequate, right, responsible and \nenvironmentally sound, a judge now arbitrarily has taken away. So that \nis why we are on the floor this evening. This is one of the most time \nsensitive amendments, directly relating to jobs and people's well-\nbeing, that is in this legislation.\n  Let me close by one other analysis. I was in one of my communities, \nGrangeville, Idaho County, Idaho, a big county right in the heart of my \nState, with 70-plus percent, 80 percent public lands. In one of those \ncommunities they started their school year with no hot lunch program. \nWhy? Because a huge portion of their budget came from timber sales, the \nTwenty-Five Percent Fund. The Senator may be familiar with it. For \nevery tree that is cut, the counties and the schools got 25 percent of \nthe stumpage fee. We are not cutting trees in that area anymore, even \nthough there are millions of acres of trees there. As a result, the \nschool had to decide whether to have an athletic program or hot lunch \nprogram for the kids. They are struggling, taking donations from the \ncommunity to have hot lunches. I don't know whether that's happening \nanywhere in Virginia, taking donations to have a hot lunch program to \nfeed kids. But the Senator's amendment has an impact on that kind of \ncaring event.\n  I wanted to personalize this because I don't think, when the \namendment to strike came to the floor, there was an understanding of \nthe immediacy of the impact of this kind of decision. It was just some \nneat environmental vote that we would have because that is what a lot \nof the environmental community wants. This is a test vote of some kind.\n  It is not a test vote on anything other than a political idea. It \ndoes not bear out consistently good policy because we have good policy \nin this area. We have scientists from around the world saying we do it \nbetter than anyplace else. Yet a judge simply said no, you don't. You \ndon't do it the way I think it should be done, and therefore I want you \nto do it differently.\n  That is the crux of the debate. There are all kinds of opinions \naround it. But I must say, to an administration that has three times \nlost this battle in court, for them to step up now and say, trust us, \nlet's work it out, without an alternative plan, with the idea we will \nwork it out and get to the point and they lose another lawsuit and we \nare 12 months down the road and the people in Roseburg or John Day are \nnot back to work?\n  It is not impacting my State at this moment. But here is what happens \nin my State. It is like a West Virginia-Virginia relationship. If they \nare not cutting trees in Oregon, even under the President's plan, and \nthese mills are deprived of trees and people are out of work, that mill \noperator comes into Idaho looking for timber sales. He bids up the \nprice well beyond where it ought to be, takes a timber sale out of \nIdaho, puts those logs on a truck and heads them west over the Cascades \ninto Oregon just to keep his people working.\n  So my mill in Orofino, or a place like that, is with less timber at a \ntime when we are hardly cutting any timber. And we have simply pitted \none against another. That is not good policy either. But ultimately \nthat is what can happen and that is what will happen in my State, even \nthough this judge's decision at this moment does not impact us.\n  But failing Congress' ability to establish and clarify this policy \nissue, some group will file a lawsuit and argue on the premise of the \njudge from the eleventh and the judge from the ninth circuit, that \nthose kinds of effective studies were not done on a given disturbing \nactivity in my State. Then it will apply further into my State.\n  Those are the issues. I hope our colleagues are listening tonight. I \nunderstand we will debate this tomorrow some, but we will vote on it.\n  To reiterate, I oppose the amendment by Senator Robb that would \nremove Section 329 of the Interior Appropriations bill. This effort is \nmisguided and I strongly urge my colleagues to understand the need for \nthis Section if our national forests are going to continue to function. \nThe Section simply clarifies that despite recent circuit and district \ncourt decisions, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior maintain \nthe discretion to implement current regulations as they have been doing \nfor nearly 2 decades.\n  During the past two decades, nine separate court decisions have \nbacked the way the Forest Service has been conducting their surveying \npopulations by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population \ndata.\n  On February 18, 1999, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \ndetermined that the Forest Service must conduct forest-wide wildlife \npopulation surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, \nand management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national \nforest plans and on all ``ground disturbing activity''--not just timber \nsales. Never before has such an extensive, and frankly impossible, \nstandard been set by the courts.\n  Another ruling on August 2, 1999, in Federal District Court in \nSeattle, on a similar case, jeopardizes the President's Northwest \nForest Plan, and has already begun to stop most if not all ground \ndisturbing activity in the Northwest.\n  These rulings result in paralysis by analysis. It would require the \nForest Service to examine every square inch of the project area and \ncount every animal and plant--even every insect--before it approved any \nactivity.\n  The cost to carry out such extensive studies--studies which have \nnever been required before--could be approximately 9 billion dollars. \nHow do we do this? Because the Forest Service does contract for \npopulation inventorying on occasion. A population trend survey requires \ntwo studies. If we extrapolate from the $8,000 cost of one plant \ninventory, we reach $38.1 million for the 864,000 acres within the \nChattahoochee National Forest where this decision originated. If \napplied to the 188-million acre national forest system, the cost \nreaches $8.3 billion.\n  We appropriate roughly $70 million for forest inventory and \nmonitoring. Are we prepared to shift the $9 billion necessary for this \nnew standard? If not, this recent interpretation forces the Forest \nService to shut down until the Agency can apply the new standard.\n  The purpose of Section 329 is not to change the court decisions or \nset a\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nnew, lower standard. It is simply to clarify that the existing \nregulation gives the discretion to the Forest Service and the BLM when \ndetermining what kind of surveys are needed when management activities \nare being considered.\n  Some of my colleagues would argue that this is an issue for the \nauthorizing committees to deal with. I agree. This is an issue that \nabsolutely should be dealt with by those committees. They need to \ndetermine whether the agencies have been correctly interpreting their \nregulation for the past 17 years. They need to determine whether it is \nsufficient to inventory habitat, rely on existing population, consult \nwith state and federal agencies and conduct population inventories only \nfor specific reasons.\n  But I argue that the appropriations process should not be made to \nbear the burden while the authorizing committees study the question. \nAll section 329 does is to preserve, for the next year, the status quo \nas it existed on April 8, 1999. Otherwise, our already limited \nresources will be further overwhelmed if we are required to fund this \nnew standard.\n  I urge you to oppose this amendment and support sensible management.\n  We are appropriating roughly $70 million for forest inventory \nmonitoring this year. There is only $70 million in the Federal budget. \nYet it is now estimated that this will literally cost us billions of \ndollars if the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Idaho cannot \nstand up and look some of our radical friends in the eye and say: That \nis not good policy. You are not the policymaker and your lawsuits and \nyour judges are not either. We are. We were elected to craft policy. \nThe Senator from Virginia and I are responsible only if we take that \nkind of leadership position.\n  That is the kind of leadership position that Senator Gorton took in \nthe appropriations bill. He did not go outside the law and he did not \ngo outside practice. He mandated and requested the Forest Service of \nthe United States act responsibly, under the Endangered Species Act, \nand gave them the guidelines to do so. That is what section 329 does.\n  That is leadership. Falling back into the arms of the judge and \nsimply seeking the will of the courts is not. I hope my colleagues \nwould join with me tomorrow and oppose a motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first let me address my colleague and friend \nfrom Idaho, who is one of the four Senators who have spoken against \nthis amendment on the floor and tell him first of all I appreciate the \nsincerity of his remarks and the concern he shows, and his colleagues \nhave shown, for those who face economic hardship because of any \ndecision that might be impacted by the Federal Government. I would have \nto say in particular, with respect to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon talking about some of the people in communities which he has \nvisited, the same phenomena has occurred to all of us at one time or \nanother. All of us truly feel the intense pain that those families \nsuffer. In many cases that suffering comes to them because of \nactivities that have been taken in terms of Federal trade policy, \nsometimes because of innovation in various manufacturing techniques, \nmodernization of equipment--lots of reasons that long and established \ncommunities are adversely affected. Any of us who do not relate to that \nand have a sense of compassion--we may disagree on a particular item at \na particular time, about what is the best way to approach a particular \nchallenge that we face, but I don't think any of us lack compassion for \nthose families or want to be in a position where we are doing anything \nthat hurts more than helps. In this particular instance, I would have \nto say one of the comments made by my friend from Oregon was ``let \nscience decide.'' That is really what is at issue here.\n  We see the issue differently. But in this particular case, science \nhas determined at this point, and the board of scientists the \ndistinguished Senator referred to has suggested, that there are means \nof establishing the health of the forest that will require indicator \nspecies measurement. None of the decisions require counting all \nspecies, every single species. In fact, the only species I am aware of \nthat is measured in terms of every single member of the species is the \nCondor count. That is a truly endangered species. I know of no other. \nThere may be.\n  In any event, we are talking about doing something. The reason these \ncases were decided the way they were and other cases were decided \ndifferently is because the rules that had been established, the plan \nthat had been established by the Forest Service, and that they had \nagreed to follow, wasn't followed.\n  The Northwest forest plan came about in very large part because of \nthe timber wars, the very difficult situation that every Member of the \nNorthwest delegation of this body remembers.\n  As a result of the compromise that was entered into, opened up some \nlogging--I recognize the 80-percent factor the Senator from Idaho and \nothers have used--at least some logging was conducted and the gridlock \nthat had existed prior to that time did not continue. They have been \noperating under this provision, the Northwest Forest Plan since that \ntime.\n  I have heard repeated references to costs that are clearly beyond \nanything anyone associated with the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, or the Agriculture Department would consider possible, or \ncan even understand frankly, because we have claims of $5 billion to $9 \nbillion, and no one in the administration is talking about anything \nthat would cost anything in that range.\n  The essence of the court decisions were on a very limited scope. The \ncourt said, if you tell us that this is the plan you want to put into \neffect, that you agree to put into effect, then the least you ought to \ndo is try to follow that plan.\n  The problem in the Eleventh Circuit, if my memory serves me \ncorrectly, was with 32 of the 37 species, absolutely nothing was done. \nThe court is in the position of saying, we will give great deference to \nthe Forest Service, to other administrative agencies, to regulators, to \nanyone else who is involved, but you cannot simply do nothing and \nexpect us to simply say it is OK not to pay attention to your own rules \nand regulations.\n  That is what both of the cases are about, and that is what \ndistinguishes the cases which trouble the Senators from the Northwest \nfrom the other cases.\n  In the other cases, the judge was able to rule in such a way that the \nlogging could continue, whatever land disturbing operations could \ncontinue. We are not talking about a situation where every single \nspecies, some of which none of us could identify if we were given a \nchart of all the species involved because they are so rare, had to be \ncounted. That is what indicator species are for, to simply be able to \ntrack in some limited way some species as an indication of how all the \nspecies are faring under various changes that might affect those \nparticular forests or those particular areas. That is really all we are \nsaying.\n  In this particular case, the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, the Department of Agriculture, and the heads of those \nagencies have said that section 329 is likely to cost a great deal more \nmoney, is not likely to do exactly what they purport to address but \nhave exactly the opposite effect.\n  In this particular case, the Agriculture Department, the Interior \nDepartment, the BLM, and the Forest Service make it very clear that \nwhat is proposed is more likely to be counterproductive, but that is \nbeside the point. They are acknowledging that a standard has been \nrecognized by the Eleventh Circuit case and that they did not meet that \nstandard. They believe they should be held to the standard, and that is \nwhat they are prepared to do. That is what adaptive management practice \nis all about. This is not the kind of absolute foreclosure that my \nfriends on the other side have represented it as.\n  Plans are underway right now to address the challenges that were put \nto the management agencies by both decisions. I submit the concern for \nthe Ninth Circuit case is considerably greater on the part of my \nfriends from the northwestern part of the United States than the \nEleventh Circuit.\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n  Nonetheless, the decisions simply said to the Federal agency \ninvolved: If you say these are the rules that you are going to follow \nand you agree these are the rules that should be followed, and the \nscientific community has said this is the way we can make the rational \nassessments and achieve the kind of balance that we are looking for, \nthen you ought to do that.\n  I share the frustration. There is always an enormous frustration \nfactor when you are dealing with a situation that seems to be beyond \nthe control of those who are most affected by it. I am particularly \nsensitive to the State of Idaho where so much of the land is owned by \nthe Federal Government, owned by the people of the United States, and \nthat makes this forum for decisionmaking so much more important, in \nmany cases, than it is for other States where the percentage of our \ntotal land, the percentage of our total economic activity is less \naffected by decisions that are made right in this particular Chamber.\n\n  The bottom line again is simply if the agency agrees to a particular \ncourse of action, if the action is rational, and reflects the fact we \nare not using the forest just as a place where logging can be carried \nout, but where recreational and other environmental elements are \nvalued, then that one activity must be balanced against the others.\n  In this particular case, a rational approach has been devised. It is \nflexible. It is being addressed at this particular moment. An \nadditional environmental impact statement is in the process of \npreparation.\n  The only real change that will come about from where the law is now, \nthe only real change is whether or not the public ought to have an \nopportunity to participate and comment on the process. That is the only \nreal change that would be brought about by this particular rider, other \nthan attempting to legislate on an appropriations bill, thus bypassing \nthe administration, regardless of what party is in power, and bypassing \nthe legislative process, bypassing the authorizing committee to which \nthese arguments could be addressed.\n  I am not at all insensitive to the concerns that have been raised by \nmy colleagues who represent this particular area. Indeed, I want to \nwork with them and the Forest Service, the BLM, the Interior \nDepartment, and the Agriculture Department to see if we cannot find \nways to address the specific problems that those communities, \nparticularly those that have no other opportunity for economic \nactivity, are faced with at this particular time.\n  The way to do it is not to put an environmental rider on an Interior \nappropriations bill which bypasses the Federal administrative process, \nbypasses the legislative process, and simply attempts to write into law \nsomething that has not been approved by either section and which is, \nindeed, actively opposed by representatives for both.\n  Mr. President, I see no one else who I believe wishes to address this \nparticular matter. We will have an opportunity to provide closing \narguments tomorrow before this is taken up.\n  I do not believe we have asked for the yeas and nays. I request the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment and \nto express my concerns regarding the increased bureaucratic burden it \nwould place on the backs of America's rural communities. This amendment \nwould require the Forest Service to conduct forest-wide wildlife \npopulation surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, \nand management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national \nforest plans, and in every area of each national forest that would be \ndisturbed by a timber sale or any other management activity. Such a \nrequirement would put a virtual freeze on all Forest Service activities \nand would serve as a death knell for rural economies.\n  For more than fifteen years, the Federal Government has been at war \nover how to manage our Western lands. The result has been 15 years of \ngridlock that not only locks up public lands and threatens the health \nof our national forests, but it also locks up rural economies which \nhave suffered from dramatic economic disruption.\n  Economies in rural communities are not like economies in more urban \nsettings. Rural economies cannot make the kind of rapid adjustments \nthat are available to more populated areas. When a timber company of \nabout 50 people goes out of business in rural America, even though its \nnumber of employees may seem small under urban standards, those fifty \nemployees can make up 20 to 30 percent or more of the local work force.\n  Just as important, however, is the impact that this kind of amendment \nwill have on the future of forest health. The biggest threat facing \nAmerica's forests today is the overriding threat of destruction by \ncatastrophic wildfire. This threat is particularly strong in the West \nwhere our nation receives very little annual rainfall.\n  Without a proactive forest health program that thins out the ever \nincreasing vegetation from our forest floors, we are only setting \nourselves up for disaster.\n  Haven't we learned anything from the debate over the Wilson Bridge? \nWhen local communities decided to improve the Wilson Bridge along the \ninfamous Washington Beltway they learned near the end of their process \nthat they had to go back and complete a full blown EIS. Because of this \nregulatory requirement, the Wilson Bridge now will not be built for \nanother two or three years. In the meantime, traffic will continue to \nback up and it will take longer and longer to navigate around our \nnation's capitol. This kind of regulatory gridlock never used to happen \non the East Coast, but it has been a common occurrence in the West. I \ncan guarantee you, however, that these kinds of regulatory activities \nwill continue until we receive regulatory relief and learn that \nincreased regulation does not necessarily mean we are protecting the \nenvironment.\n  If we are seriously going to protect our environment, we need less \nregulation and more proactive programs particularly on our national \nforests. The worst thing we could do, then, is add to the gridlock and \nadopt this kind of amendment.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for and \ncosponsorship of Senator Robb's amendment to remove the Section 329 \nrider from the Interior Appropriations bill. This rider would undermine \nsound science in wildlife management in my state and across the nation. \nIt would suspend U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management \nrequirements to research and monitor certain wildlife populations, \nintegral requirements that the agencies themselves adopted as early as \n1982. I strongly support this amendment and believe that we should \nremove this rider.\n  Section 329 attempts to overturn a recent court case, Sierra Club \nversus Martin, issued by the 11th Circuit, which confirmed the \nagencies' duties to monitor certain wildlife species in order to make \ncredible and well-informed management decisions. The 11th District \nCourt unanimously ruled that the Forest Service was not properly \nperforming its responsibilities to inventory ``rare'' species in the \nChattahoochee and Oconee National Forests as mandated by its own Forest \nManagement Plan. The court's decision does not expand monitoring \nrequirements, but merely ruled that the absolute failure to collect any \ndata or implement any monitoring of indicator and sensitive species was \nnot legal.\n  Monitoring the health of ``indicator'' and ``sensitive'' species is \nboth sound science and good wildlife management. Indicator species act \nas proxies for other wildlife in the forest. That is why monitoring of \nindicator species was included in the 1982 implementing regulations of \nthe National Forest Management Act and is included as an integral part \nof forest management plans adopted by the agencies. If we ignore what \nis happening to these ``indicators,'' we are ignoring the impacts on \nthe whole forest. Collecting new and important data is the only way to \nensure that our land mangers are using the most up-to-date and accurate \nscientific information. By limiting decisions to ``available'' science \nas this rider would dictate, Section 329 turns a blind eye to the \ninformation we need to make the best possible management decisions.\n  I understand that some argue the best ``available'' definition is the \nsame\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nrigid standard set forth by the Endangered Species Act. While true, \nthis is a complete misrepresentation of the law's intent. The intent of \nbest ``available'' information for Endangered Species is to encourage \nswift listings of animals so that we avoid risking the extinction of \nsuch animals. Associating this definition with determining the status \nof animals in a National Forest section scheduled for timber harvesting \nruns completely contrary to the intent of the Endangered Species Act \nversion which is to protect species. Applying this definition when \nmaking forest management decisions risks the habitat and future of both \n``sensitive'' and ``endangered'' species by not having accurate and \ncurrent data upon which to make these decisions. Each forest manager \nwill be without guidance and our national lands will be managed \naccording to the whims of individuals rather than the interests of the \npublic.\n  In my own state of Georgia, National Forests provide a refuge for \nblack bear, migratory songbirds, native brook trout, and an incredible \ndiversity of aquatic species. Some of these species are already listed \nunder the federal Endangered Species Act. Many more may be listed in \nthe future if we ignore the warning signs. The smart, economical \napproach is to monitor and conserve ``sensitive'' species before they \nreach a crisis state and are listed on the endangered species list. By \navoiding such listings, we have the maximum amount of flexibility and \nthe costs of conservation are low. Unfortunately, Section 329 \ndiscourages land managers from doing just that.\n\n  I understand that, in reaction to the court decision, the regional \nforester for the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests is amending \nits forest management plan and this rider completely short circuits \nthat process. Amending the Forest Management Plan is the proper method \nfor handling these kinds of issues. It allows for Public Comment and \nParticipation and also allows for Sound Science to be utilized and \nreviewed. The Forest Service has stated that this rider, ``Overrides a \nFederal Court Ruling, agency regulations, and resource management plans \nthat require the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain \nand use current and appropriate information for wildlife and other \nresources before conducting planning and management activities.'' Note \nthe language that resource management plans require the agencies to \nobtain and use current and appropriate information. It does not say, \nsee what data you can scrounge up and use that.\n  Considering the Senate's recent debate on Rule 16, it is clear that \nthis rider is attempting to legislate on an Appropriations bill. I \nbelieve that contentious authorizing language such as this should have \nthe benefit of a full review by the authorizing Committee which has \njurisdiction over these matters. These important decisions should not \nbe done through an environmental rider on an appropriations bill.\n  In closing, it is clear that the Forest Service's own National Forest \nManagement Act regulations require monitoring of certain, but not all, \nresident wildlife to ensure that land managers are using the most up-\nto-date and accurate scientific information in their decisions. Now, I \nunderstand that every single species of plant and animal cannot and \nshould not be documented in these inventories. However, I believe that \nin order to protect species from becoming threatened and endangered, \nthe Forest Service must employ effective measuring techniques which \nwill provide accurate estimates. These estimates are critical to making \nsound management decision. I believe that this rider short circuits \nboth the Senate's ability to provide proper oversight and the Forest \nService's process for amending forest management plans.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove this rider and vote in favor of this \namendment. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, seeing my friend from Texas on the floor, \nknowing that she has plans to address another of the pending \namendments, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I do intend to address the issue of my amendment, but \nfirst I ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor be granted \nto William Eby during the pendency of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1603\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as was unanimously consented to \nearlier in the evening, Senator Gorton requested that all of the \narguments on the Hutchison amendment be put together. So I ask \nunanimous consent that my remarks be put following the Boxer remarks on \nthe Hutchison amendment, which I think is the next in line, in order to \nkeep them in the same area so that they will follow along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to address some of the \nissues and some of the facts that were misstated by the Senator from \nCalifornia because I think it is very important that the Record be set \nstraight. I attempted to correct the Senator from California while she \nwas speaking, but she preferred to continue to speak, so I want the \nRecord to be very clear on some of these important facts.\n  First, the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois made \nmuch of the testimony of a former executive from Arco who had \ntestified, they said, under oath that oil companies had in fact \nmisstated and actually tried to hide the value of the oil and not pay \ntheir fair share in oil royalties to the State of California and the \nCity of Long Beach.\n  In fact, I am very pleased that they brought that up because the case \nhas actually been settled just in the last couple weeks. In fact, the \nSenators from California and Illinois mentioned that several oil \ncompanies had settled because they, for whatever reason, did not want \nto go forward with the costly litigation. But Exxon decided not to \nsettle, and the Arco employee did testify in the Exxon case, under \noath, that the oil companies were misstating the value of the royalties \nthey owed to the State and to the City of Long Beach.\n  This case went to a jury, a jury in California of 12 citizens. The \njury found that the Arco employee was not credible. The jury of his \npeers determined that the Exxon Corporation had not cheated the \ntaxpayers of California or the City of Long Beach, and they threw out \nthat suit from Long Beach and the State of California. Exxon showed \nthat it had not undervalued its oil. This was a suit for $750 million.\n  So the Arco executive who testified under oath was in fact \ndiscredited in the court, and the jury found that the Arco executive \nwas not persuasive. I say that because so much was made of it, as if \nthe case had gone the other way. But 12 citizens in California got \ntogether and the jury verdict was in favor of Exxon.\n  But having said that, I have said from the very beginning that the \nlawsuits are not an issue. If any oil company did not value correctly \nunder the present law or regulations, they ought to pay. So it has \nnever been an issue. You would think, from the rhetoric of the Senator \nfrom the State of California, that this amendment had something to do \nwith companies not paying their fair share under the present law. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, what we are talking about is changing the valuation of oil \nroyalties. We are talking about unelected Department of Interior \nemployees, who have no accountability, usurping the rights of Congress \nto set tax policy in this country and affect oil jobs to a huge extent.\n  The fact of the matter is, what we are trying to do with the \namendment, with the Hutchison-Domenici amendment, is we are saying we \nwant it to be fair, we want to continue the moratorium until the \nDepartment of the Interior has a fair valuation that accedes to the \nwishes of Congress, because Congress makes the laws. That is the \nprerogative of Congress. That is the responsibility of Congress. And it \nis further the responsibility of Congress to stand up when they \ndelegate authority to a Federal agency to make a rule and that Federal \nagency does not do what Congress intended for it to do.\n  Only Congress can step forward and say: No, we did not intend to \nraise oil royalty rates the way you intend to do it, so we are going to \nput a moratorium on your rule until you do an oil royalty\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nrate that is simpler, fairer, will be right for the citizens of our \ncountry and right for the oil industry that is very important to this \ncountry. So that is what we are talking about today.\n  I did not like the tone of the rhetoric that ``oil is bad,'' that \n``big oil is worse,'' that ``everything about oil companies is bad.'' I \nthought I was back in the 1960s when it seemed that ``business was \nbad.'' Well, business is people. Business is jobs. Business is people.\n  My heavens, why wouldn't we want business to be successful in America \nso that we have jobs in America? Sometimes when I hear people talking \nabout the ``big bad oil companies,'' I think: Do you want more foreign \noil, more foreign jobs, rather than American jobs and American revenue?\n  I think we have a choice here. Those ``big bad oil companies'' are \nthe basis of the California teacher retirement system pension plan. \nThey are a very important part of the stability of retirement for \nCalifornia teachers, and Texas teachers, for that matter, and probably \nIllinois teachers as well, because the big oil companies have been a \nstable source of dividends for maybe 100 years.\n  I don't know when the big oil companies first started, but they have \nbeen good citizens for our country. They are the basis of pension plans \nand retired people's security all over our country, and they do create \nthousands of good jobs.\n  So I do not think we have to beat up on oil companies. They are part \nof our economy and they are part of the security of our country. And, \noh, by the way, since 1953 they have paid more than $58 billion for the \nright to drill on the people's land--$58 billion in oil royalty \npayments.\n  If they did not pay their fair share, I want them to pay their fair \nshare. So talking about settlements and lawsuits is not really an \nissue, even though a jury of their peers in California did find that \nExxon had not cheated in any way.\n  That isn't the issue. The issue is, we want them to pay. In order for \nthem to pay a fair share, they need to be able to know exactly what \nthey owe, and that is why we hope the MMS will simplify the regulation. \nIn fact, the MMS refuses to even abide by its own previous rulings. So \nan oil company that is trying to do the right thing goes to a previous \nruling on how oil is valued in a particular place, in a particular way, \nand the MMS says: No, we are not going to be bound by what we did in \nanother case.\n  That walks away from the value of precedent that is the hallmark of \nour judicial system and the regulatory system in our country. In most \ninstances, the IRS most certainly abides by its previous rulings. They \ngive opinion letters that people can rely on so they can pay their fair \nshare of taxes. Courts set precedents with rulings every day so people \nwill know what the law is and what they must do to comply. Not the MMS. \nThey have one opinion here and one opinion there. Congress asked them \nto make it simpler, and they have gone far beyond what Congress \nintended. It is our responsibility to make sure they do what is right \nfor the taxpayers of America. That is what the Hutchison-Domenici \namendment will assure they do.\n  This is not an industry that has had an easy time in the last year \nand a half. In fact, oil prices have been lower than ever in the \nhistory of our country, adjusted for inflation, $7, $8 a barrel, a lot \nof that because of the glut of imported oil on the market. We have lost \nhalf a million jobs in the oil industry in the last 10 years. We are \nimporting 57 percent of the oil in our country. If we have bad oil \nroyalty principles, it also affects natural gas, which is the most \nimportant substitute fuel in many of our coal burning areas. Natural \ngas is much cleaner, better for the environment than coal. So when you \nstart tampering in a negative way with the oil royalty rates, you also \nare going to affect the price and availability of natural gas, because \nnatural gas, of course, is a byproduct of drilling for oil. If you \ndiscourage our American companies and our American people from being \nable to get our own oil resources, you are also cutting back on our \nsupply of natural gas. That could be dangerous to our economy and \ndangerous to the people who live in our country who depend on natural \ngas to heat their homes.\n  I think it is important we put this in perspective. It is important \nwe look at what we are talking about. Senator Boxer said the new rule \nwould only affect 5 percent of the oil companies, and it would be just \nthe big oil companies. She said she supports small oil companies. Well, \nI hope she will, because if she will, she will support the Hutchison-\nDomenici amendment because it is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that \nwill keep our small producers in business after the devastating effects \nof low oil prices from the last year.\n  In fact, every single oil company is affected. There are 2,400 \nproducers with Federal leases. Only 70 of them are not classified by \nthe SBA as small businesses. All 2,400 are opposed to this new rule \nthat will require them basically to pay taxes on their costs. The small \noil companies that the Senator said she would support are very opposed \nto her position. They are for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment because \nthey don't want a new rule that would second-guess sales of oil at the \nwellhead and make fuzzy exactly when the oil should be valued. They \ndon't want a new duty to market and incur the costs of marketing and \nselling the product and bear the cost without any allowance. They are \nvery concerned about this.\n\n  If Senator Boxer believes that the small oil companies are against \nthe Hutchison amendment, I hope she will talk to them. They will assure \nher that this is going to put one more chink in their ability to create \njobs and continue to drill oil and natural gas in our country, rather \nthan choosing to go overseas where it is much cheaper to do it and \nwhere you don't have to pay as much as we pay in America.\n  I hope very much that she will reconsider, knowing that all of the \nsmall companies are affected by this new ruling.\n  I will read from some of the letters of people and groups that are \nsupporting the Hutchison-Domenici amendment.\n  People for the USA writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: We support your fight to simplify \n     the current royalty calculation system. On behalf of 30,000 \n     grassroots members of People for the USA, I want to thank you \n     for your diligent efforts to bring common sense to royalty \n     calculations on Federal oil and gas leases. Energy Secretary \n     Bill Richardson has suggested that domestic oil field workers \n     look to opportunities overseas. Senator, an administration \n     that talks about kicking American resource producers out of \n     the country has a badly skewed set of priorities.\n\n  That is signed by Jeffrey Harris, Executive Director.\n  The National Black Chamber of Commerce writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The efforts of MMS are, indeed, \n     ludicrous. Collectively the national economy is booming and \n     the chief subject matter is ``tax reduction,'' not ``royalty \n     increase,'' which is a cute term for tax increase. What adds \n     salt to the wound is the fact that despite a booming economy \n     from a national perspective, the oil industry has not been so \n     fortunate and is on hard times. We need to come up with \n     vehicles that will stimulate this vital part of our economic \n     bloodstream, not further the damage.\n\n  That is signed by Harry Alford, President and CEO, National Black \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Citizens for a Sound Economy:\n\n       The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium \n     language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule, with \n     the expectation that the Department of Interior and industry \n     would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to resolve \n     their differences.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: We are writing to express our \n     support for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment to the FY 2000 \n     Appropriations bill. The Hutchison-Domenici amendment \n     prevents the Department of the Interior from rewriting laws \n     and assessing additional taxes without the consent of the \n     Congress. This role properly rests with the legislative \n     branch, not with unelected bureaucrats.\n       In a misleading letter dated July 21, 1999, detractors of \n     the Hutchison-Domenici amendment allege it will cost \n     taxpayers, schoolchildren, native Americans, and the \n     environment.'' That is not so! It's time to set the record \n     straight--this amendment does not alter the status quo at \n     all. This amendment says to Secretary Babbitt: Spend no money \n     to finalize a crude oil valuation rule until the Congress \n     agrees with your proposed methodology for defining value for \n     royalty purposes.\n       We contend that a mineral lease is a contract, whether \n     issued by the United States or any other lessor, as such, its \n     terms may not be unilaterally changed just because a \n     government bureaucrat thinks more money can be squeezed from \n     the lesser by redefining the manner in which the value of \n     production is established. What royalty amount is due is \n     determined by the contracts and statues, and nothing else. \n     For seventy-nine years the federal government has lived \n     according to a law that established that the government \n     receives value at the well--not downstream after incremental \n     value is added. The bureaucrats at the Interior Department \n     are in effect imposing a value added tax through the \n     backdoor.\n       Bureaucrats are saying that value should be measured in \n     downstream markets hundreds of miles from one's lease, or \n     based upon prices set in futures trading on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange, both of which routinely attribute higher \n     value than exists at the ``wellhead.'' If bureaucrats had it \n     their way, they would assess a tax all the way to the \n     gasoline, ignoring the costs associated with bringing oil to \n     that pump. If Congress intended this, they would have said so \n     in the law.\n       This is nothing short of a backdoor tax via an unlawful, \n     inequitable rulemaking which Secretary Babbitt says is \n     necessary because of ``changing oil markets.'' But, we think \n     his real result and that of his supporters such as Senator \n     Boxer, is to cripple the domestic petroleum industry, and \n     drive them to foreign shores and advance their goal of \n     reducing fossil fuel consumption. This is why they falsely \n     claim that green eyeshade accounts somehow are impacting the \n     environment.\n       The outcry on behalf of schoolchildren is particularly \n     hypocritical. Senator Boxer and Rep. George Miller are \n     responsible for a mineral leasing law amendment in the 1993 \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act which reduces education \n     revenues to the State of California by over $1 million per \n     year--far more than the Department's oil valuation rule would \n     add to California's treasury (approximately $150,000 per year \n     as scored by the Congressional Budget Office). So really, who \n     is harming schoolchildren's education budgets? The oil \n     industry provides millions and millions of royalty dollars \n     each year for the U.S. Treasury and for State's coffers.\n       The ``cheating'' which Sen. Boxer and others allege is \n     unproven. Reference to settlements by oil companies as proof \n     of fraud is improper. When President Clinton settled the \n     Paula Jones lawsuit his attorney admonished Senator Boxer and \n     her fellow jurors to take no legal inference from that \n     payment. We agree. As such, oil company settlements cannot be \n     given precedential value. Who can fight the government \n     forever when the royalty dollars they have paid in are used \n     to fund enormous litigation budgets?\n       Lastly, two employees of the federal government who were \n     integral to the ``futures market pricing'' philosophy \n     espoused in the Department's rulemaking have been caught \n     accepting $350,000 checks from a private group with a stake \n     in the outcome of False Claims Act litigation against oil \n     companies. Ironically, the money to pay-off these two \n     individuals for their ``heroic'' actions while working as \n     federal employees came from a settlement by one oil company. \n     The Project on Governments Oversight (POGO) last fall \n     received well over one million dollars as a plaintiff in the \n     suit. Shortly thereafter POGO quietly ``thanked'' these \n     public servants for making this bounty possible. The Public \n     Integrity Section of the Department of Justice has an ongoing \n     investigation. We find it unconscionable the Administration \n     seeks to put the valuation rule into place without getting to \n     the bottom of this bribe first. The L.A. Times recently drew \n     a parallel with the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920's, but \n     who is Albert Fall in this modern day scandal?\n       The Department's rule amounts to unfair taxation without \n     the representation which Members of Congress bring by passing \n     laws. If Congress chooses to change the mineral leasing laws \n     to prospectively modify the terms of a lease, so be it. It \n     should do so in the proper authorizing process with \n     opportunity for the public to be heard. A federal judge has \n     recently ruled the EPA has unconstitutionally encroached upon \n     the legislature's lawmaking authority when promulgating air \n     quality rules. We are convinced the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in a similar manner, is far exceeding his authority \n     unilaterally by assessing a value added tax.\n       Let Congress define the law on mineral royalties. We \n     elected Members to do this job, we didn't elect Bruce Babbitt \n     and a band of self-serving bureaucrats.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the 30,000 grassroots \n     members of People for the USA, I would once again like to \n     thank you for your diligent efforts to bring common sense to \n     royalty calculations and payments on federal oil and gas \n     leases.\n       In their efforts to balance environmental protection with \n     economic growth through grassroots actions, our members (not \n     just those in Texas) always notice and appreciate strong, \n     common sense leadership such as you have shown.\n       We support your fight to simplify the current royalty \n     calculation system. It is already a burden on a struggling \n     domestic oil and gas industry, and the Minerals Management \n     Service proposal simply adds insult to injury. Royalty \n     calculation is not, as Interior Communications Director \n     Michael Gauldin remarked, ``an issue to demagogue for another \n     year.'' With 52,000 jobs lost in just the last year?\n       Worse, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has suggested that \n     domestic oilfield workers look to opportunity overseas. \n     Senator, an Administration that talks about kicking American \n     resource producers out of the country has a badly skewed set \n     of priorities.\n       We appreciate what you are doing to straighten them out, \n     and will back you up at the grass roots any way we can.\n       Again, on behalf of thousands of hard-working American \n     resource producers, thank\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\n     you.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Senator, State of Texas, Rm. 284, Senate Russell Office \n         Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The National Black Chamber of \n     Commerce has been quite proud of the leadership you have \n     shown on the issue of oil royalties and the attempt of the \n     Minerals Management Service's, Department of Interior, to \n     levy eventual increases on the oil industry.\n       The efforts of MMS are, indeed, ludicrous. Collectively, \n     the national economy is booming and the chief subject matter \n     is ``tax reduction'' not ``royalty increase'', which is a \n     cute term for tax increase. What adds ``salt to the wound'' \n     is the fact that despite a booming economy from a national \n     perspective, the oil industry has not been so fortunate and \n     is on hard times. We need to come up with vehicles that will \n     stimulate this vital part of our economic bloodstream, not \n     further the damage.\n       We support your plan to re-offer a one-year extension of \n     the moratorium on the new rule proposed by MMS. We will also \n     support any efforts you may have to prohibit the new rule. \n     Good luck in giving it ``the good fight''.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C.

The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) new oil \n     valuation proposal is, however, deeply flawed and would have \n     the ultimate effect of raising taxes on consumers.\n       The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium \n     language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule with the \n     expectation that the Department of the Interior (DOI) and \n     industry would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to \n     resolve their differences. Unfortunately, more time is still \n     needed for government and industry is required to reach a \n     mutually beneficial compromise.\n       CSE recognizes this need and opposes any attempt to halt \n     the moratorium, or curtail efforts to bring about a simpler, \n     more workable rule.\n       Thank you for your attention and efforts, and for your \n     continuing leadership in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Council for Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, we \n     respectfully ask you to oppose any efforts in the Senate to \n     strike the provision in the Interior Appropriations Bill that \n     delays the implementation of a final crude oil valuation \n     rule, unless a resolution between MMS and industry can be \n     reached. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) proposed new \n     oil valuation rules that would eventually raise taxes on \n     producers. The rulemaking effort has involved several \n     revisions to the original proposal, but remains ambiguous, \n     unworkable, and would create even greater uncertainty and \n     unnecessary litigation.\n       Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations \n     Bill will provide the time necessary for the MMS and the \n     industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule, \n     benefiting both sides. The taxpayers have a vested interest \n     in this issue, because the rule proposed by the MMS would \n     lead to an unnecessary administrative burden for both the \n     government and the private industry as auditors, accountants, \n     and lawyers attempt to resolve innumerable disputes over the \n     correct amounts due.\n       Please take this opportunity to prevent the current \n     proposed rule, which benefits no one, from being implemented. \n     We urge you to oppose any amendment to strike the provision \n     for delay of final valuation rule in the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill as it reaches the floor for debate in the \n     full Senate this week.\n       We wish to thank you for your efforts in this matter. Your \n     continued commitment and integrity in the promotion of \n     efficiency and accountability in the federal government is \n     sincerely appreciated. If I can be of further assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Regards,\n                                                  Council Nedd II,\n                        Director, Government Affairs & Grassroots.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from \nCalifornia throwing around numbers such as this has cost the taxpayers \nof America $88 million already, or $60 million already. And I pointed \nthis out to her. I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  FY 2000 INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES--S. 1292, AS REPORTED, PROPOSED\n                            FLOOR AMENDMENTS\n                      [Budget account--in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Pending      Proposed     Difference\n              No.              -----------------------------------------\n                                  BA     O      BA     O      BA     O\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1603--Hutchinson Oil valuation  .....  .....     11     11     11     11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this shows there would be a proposed \ndifference in income of $11 million. In addition to putting that in the \nRecord, I want to say that we have offset that $11 million. I have to \nsay I think it is ludicrous that you would say we think that in the \nfuture you won't get $11 million and, therefore, we need to make up \nthat proposed lost revenue for a tax that has not even been put in \nplace. Nevertheless, that was the ruling we were given, so we did \noffset with $11 million. But it is ridiculous to say that you have to \noffset the tax that hasn't been put in place because you don't know \nwhat businesses are going to pull up stakes and say: It is too \nexpensive to drill with this kind of royalty rate. We are going to go \noverseas and we are going to take our jobs with us.\n  So I am not sure that it would be $11 million, or anything at all. My \nhunch is that we are going to lose jobs and we are going to lose \nincome, and the schoolchildren of this country are going to suffer \nbecause the oil business has not yet recovered from the crisis.\n  Mr. President, on that note, I have to also say that I think it is \nvery important that when we are talking about a proposed rule that \nhasn't been put in place and we are already saying how much will be \nmissed, clearly, there is no concept of how business can work and make \na profit and continue to create jobs. So I am concerned that if we \nraise this royalty valuation, which is a tax on the oil industry, at a \ntime when many of them are on their knees anyway, we are not going to \nhave income of $11 million, or $60 million, or anything else. In fact, \nI think we are going to go into negative income, which is exactly what \nhas happened in Texas in the last year and a half, where schools have \nhad to shut their doors and close down and consolidate classrooms \nbecause they could not make their budget because of the oil income not \ncoming in. We lost $150 million just in the last year in oil royalty \nrevenue in Texas alone. So this is not the time to raise rates.\n  Let's talk about the kind of taxes. We are talking about fairness. In \nfact, we are talking about what we tax. Today, the oil is valued as it \ncomes out of the ground, after it has been cleaned up and is ready to \nbe sold. You take out the contaminants and it is clean and that is \nwhere it is valued. But what the Government and MMS are proposing to do \nis say, no, we want you to go out and get a buyer for the oil and incur \nthe cost of buying; and then we want you to put it in a pipeline and \ntake it to where it is going to be picked up by the buyer, and we are \ngoing to value it there. That is taxing the cost. That just doesn't \nmake sense. That is like saying to McDonald's, whatever you spend in \nadvertising, we are going to tax you that amount. We are going to tax \nyou on your advertising for McDonald's hamburgers.\n  Mr. President, that concept will not fly. It doesn't happen in any \nother industry. Whenever would the Government expect taxes on expenses? \nIt just doesn't make sense. But sometimes I think people I hear arguing \non the Senate floor have never been in business. If you have never been \nin business and have never met a payroll, then you don't really \nunderstand how hard it is to make a profit and create new jobs and do \nright by your employees. I have been in business. I have met a payroll. \nI know how hard it is, especially in a small business. And when the \nprices are $7 or $8 a barrel and the costs are $14 a barrel, you can't \nstay in business very long. And if you can't stay in business very \nlong, there are a lot of people and families who don't have jobs; and \nif you have to lay off people\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\nwho are working at the well, then you also have to lay off people in \nthe oil fields service industry and the oil supply industry because you \naren't going to need the supplies if you are not drilling. And if it is \ntoo expensive to drill in America, you are going to go somewhere else, \nand you are going to create jobs in a foreign country.\n\n  Mr. President, I guess the last thing I will say in refuting the \narguments I heard from the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nCalifornia is that it always seems the tack is to say, well, they don't \nreally care about this issue; they are supporting big oil because big \noil has contributed to their campaigns. I don't go around looking at \nwhether trial lawyers give to other Senators and, therefore, they don't \nvote for tort reform. I don't accuse people of not representing the \ninterests of their States. Of course, I have oil workers in my State. I \nhope I am supported by people who work in my State and live in my \nState. But I would not do anything that would hurt the people of my \nState. The idea that that is connected to campaign contributions I just \nthink is cynical, and I don't think it adds integrity to the debate.\n  You gauge that against a most incredible statement when you accuse \npeople who want to keep jobs in America, who want fair pricing, fair \ntaxing, and fair payment of taxes--you accuse people of having some \nkind of other motive, and then you pick up a magazine called Inside \nEnergy and the Department of Interior communications director says on \nNovember 2 of 1998, regarding the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that \nwould require them to have a fair valuation:\n\n       We are sticking to the position we have taken. It gives us \n     an issue to demagog for another year.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we have heard a lot of demagoguery on this \nissue. I have heard the most outrageous debate and arguments that I \nhave heard on just about any subject on this issue, trying to make it \nseem as if oil companies that are being sued are somehow connected to \nwhether or not we have a fair royalty valuation, trying to mesh those \nissues. That just does not make sense. It does not add to the debate. \nBut to have the kind of demagoguery that we have heard on the floor and \nthen to have the Department of the Interior admit that what they want \nis an issue to demagog, I have to say I think the Los Angeles Times \neditorial proves they did get a demagoguery editorial. I think some of \nthe network television bought into it. I think there has been some very \nunfair coverage because we are talking about Congress standing up for \nits right to tax. If Congress doesn't stand up, who will? Who is \naccountable at the Department of the Interior? It is a matter of \nfairness.\n\n  I am not going to walk away from that responsibility. I know what I \nam doing is right because I know we can have fair taxes of royalty. We \nare talking about an industry that paid $58 billion in the last 40 \nyears in royalty rates. They have given a lot back to this country. \nThey have given jobs. They have paid royalty rates. I want them to pay \nfair royalty rates. I would never stand up and say they shouldn't, or \nif they haven't that they shouldn't be fined. I think they should. But \nwe are talking about people. We are talking about jobs. We are talking \nabout the American economy. We are talking about retirement plans that \ndepend on stable oil companies and the oil industry.\n  I think fair taxation is the responsibility of Congress. That is what \nthe Hutchison-Domenici amendment will assure--fair taxation intended by \nCongress.\n  We will have some more debate on this. I certainly hope in the end my \ncolleagues will not be susceptible to rank demagoguery--to rhetoric \nthat is harsh and not in any way fair. It may be fun to ask questions \nback and forth on the Senate floor indicating that people's motives are \nnot the right motives or are not pure, but that doesn't add to the \ndebate. It is our responsibility to make policy. We are going to do it.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Interior Appropriations bill \nfunds critical programs that are vital to the protection of our \nnation's land and natural resources and supports federal programs for \nNative Americans, as well as several energy and agriculture programs.\n  I commend the managers of this bill for their efforts to keep \nspending in this bill within budget limitations as required by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. Unfortunately, I can still find in this \nbill and the committee report approximately $216 million in low-\npriority, unauthorized or unrequested spending that has not been \nconsidered in the normal merit-based review process.\n  In the usual fashion of appropriations bills and reports, little \nexplanation is provided as to the merit or national priority of various \nprojects receiving earmarks. We are left to imagine the reasons that \ncertain projects, such the Bruneau Hot Springs Snail Conservation \nCommittee or goose-related crop depredation projects in Washington and \nOregon, are deserving of a $500,000 earmark each.\n  I am sure these projects are significant to the communities that \nwould benefit from these directed funds. But we are unfairly singling \nout projects of parochial interest, rather than evaluating other more \nequally deserving projects that could be more significant to the \nprotection of our land, forest or energy resources nationwide.\n  Not only do we undermine the value of our legislative process by this \ntype of arbitrary spending, we betray the confidence of the American \npeople who rely on our fair and equitable judgement to fund those \nprojects of greatest need and priority. Instead, we reward their faith \nby choosing to provide $1 million of taxpayer funds to rehabilitate a \nbathhouse at Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas. I question the \nnecessity of fixing up a public bathhouse when federal school \nfacilities for Indian children are in a deplorable state of disrepair \nand ill maintenance.\n  In a similar fashion, $1 million is earmarked to support the Olympic \nTree Program being developed by the Salt Lake Olympic committee. While \nour country takes great pride in hosting the international Olympics \nevents, I find it difficult to fathom why we would expect the American \npeople to accept the expenditure of a million dollars for this purely \naesthetic purpose.\n  This bill also continues a disturbing trend of including legislative \nriders that, if enacted, will make substantive changes to current law \nand regulations. By using the appropriations process as a policy \nhammer, we are circumventing a fair and deliberative legislative review \nof the need for such changes. We also shortchange the interested public \nby eliminating their opportunity for input and participation.\n  I have heard from many interested parties who decry the inclusion of \nriders that will extend grazing permits without completion of due \nenvironmental analyses and a provision that overturns an administrative \nlegal opinion regarding the amount of land that can be used for mining \nclaims. I know that these are important issues in my state of Arizona, \nyet I am precluded from fully representing the interests of my \nconstituents when legislative riders such as these are attached to an \nappropriations measure that must be passed within a very short \ntimeframe with little to no opportunity to make changes.\n  Just yesterday, the Senate voted to restore Rule XVI which makes \nfloor amendments of a policy nature out of order on an appropriations \nbill. I supported restoration of this Rule. Ironically, this Rule only \napplies to floor amendments. I believe very strongly that it should be \napplied to committee actions where a small minority of the Senate can \nact to include legislative riders on an appropriations bill without \neven consulting the relevant authorizing committees. I believe the Rule \nshould be expanded to cover committee actions.\n  Mr. President, ensuring the protection of our nation's resources and \nmeeting federal trust obligations to Native Americans are among our \nmost important duties. With this type of shameful waste of taxpayer \ndollars and inappropriate legislative mandates on an appropriations \nmeasure, we are betraying our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' \ndollars responsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best \ninterests of all Americans, rather than the special interests of a few.\n  Unfortunately, due to its length, this list of $216 million of \nearmarks and objectionable provisions in S. 1292, and its accompanying \nSenate report, cannot be printed in the Record. However, the list will \nbe available on my Senate webpage.\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10584-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before I leave, I want to take a \nmoment to also talk about one other issue. That is the issue of what is \nhappening in Indonesia.\n  All of us have seen atrocities and read of atrocities in many parts \nof the world--most recently in Indonesia where we have seen the people \nof East Timor vote for independence, and they were told by the \nGovernment of Indonesia that vote would be respected. Now we see bands \nof militia-type people that, it is said, could be connected with the \nIndonesian Government going in and committing terrible acts. This is a \nterrible thing. It is horrible. We hate to see it.\n  I think there are many things that can be done.\n  First and foremost, we must call on Indonesia to do what they said \nthey would do and respect the right of the people of East Timor in \ntheir independence.\n  I also think we should be supportive of those who are volunteering to \ngo over there if necessary. This is where I think we can show some \nleadership from the United States. I would call on the President to do \nthat. That is not to all of a sudden start talking about sending \nAmerican troops into East Timor.\n  I think by beginning to start bandying that around, all of a sudden \nyou are going to start seeing people depend on American troops. I don't \nthink we have to start talking about American troops in East Timor. I \nthink it would be harmful if we did that because of the vast commitment \nwe have in the Balkans right now as well as the DMZ in Korea, as well \nas in Japan, as well as in Europe, and other places in the world.\n  No one would ever walk away from the responsibility that America must \nshoulder as a superpower. But Australia has stepped up to the line to \ntry to help bring an end to the chaos that I hope is temporarily \nerupting in East Timor. I think we should help them do that by offering \nlogistical support but letting people volunteer.\n  This is a time when we can look at the areas of the world that have \nregional conflicts, and we can let the sophisticated countries that \nhave quality military operations be the main part of a force in those \nareas.\n  In fact, it appears that Australia, New Zealand, and many others are \nvolunteering to take this policekeeping mission. I think it would be \nwise for us to let them do that. Let them take that responsibility and \noffer our logistical help if they need it. But don't start bandying \nabout the possibility of U.S. troops going in on the ground when our \ntroops are stretched so thin--when we have had the worst recruiting \nyear and the worst retention year since the early 1970s because our \ntroops are in mission fatigue. They are not able to stay in top \ntraining because they are stretched so thin.\n  I hope the President will take this opportunity to set a U.S. policy \nand to work with our allies to have a division of responsibility that \nis fair.\n  If we do that, then America will be able to do what only it can \nuniquely do, and that is the air power that we have shown that we have \nin the last 6 months. Let us keep our role to responding where only we \nare able to keep the peace--in the Middle East, in Korea, in Japan, and \nin parts of Europe. Let's work with our allies for a fair \nresponsibility sharing that will set a precedent so that we will all \nhave the staying power to provide the critical needs in regions as they \noccur.\n  I hope President Clinton will take this opportunity to be a leader \nand to represent the United States and our national security issues and \nour national security stability. If he will do that, I think you will \nbegin to see a foreign policy that will evolve with all of our allies \nsharing and keeping all of us strong by not overburdening any one of us \nto the detriment of all.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Mr. President, so far, we have had one meeting of a \nconference to resolve differences in the Senate and House passed \njuvenile justice bills. I commented at that conference meeting, on \nAugust 5, 1999, about how unfortunate it was that the leadership in the \nCongress delayed action on the conference all summer. In fact, the \nconference met less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its \nlong August recess.\n  Unfortunately, we did not conclude our work but left this conference \nand important work on the juvenile justice legislation to languish for \nthe last five weeks of the summer.\n  Due to the delays in convening this conference and then its abrupt \nadjournment before completing its work, we knew before our August \nrecess that the programs to enhance school safety and protect our \nchildren and families called for in this legislation would not be in \nplace before school began.\n  The fact that American children are starting school without Congress \nfinishing its work on this legislation is wrong.\n  We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters to \nbegin the juvenile justice conference. It is no secret that there are \nthose in both bodies who would prefer no action and no conference to \nmoving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. Now that \nwe have convened this conference, we should waste no more time to get \ndown to business and finish our work promptly.\n  We have seen the kind of swift conference action the Congress is \ncapable of doing with the Y2K law that provides special legal \nprotections to businesses. That Y2K bill was passed by the Senate \nalmost a month after the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, on June \n16th, but was sent to conference, worked out, and sent to the \nPresident's desk within two short weeks. That bill is already law. The \nexample set by the Y2K legislation shows that if we have the will, \nthere is a way to get legislation done and done quickly.\n  Those of us serving on the conference and many who are not on the \nconference have worked on versions of this legislation for several \nyears now. We spent two weeks on the Senate floor in May considering \nalmost 50 amendments to S. 254, the Senate juvenile justice bill, and \nmaking many improvements to the underlying bill. We worked hard in the \nSenate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill, and we should \ntake this opportunity to cut through our remaining partisan differences \nto make a difference in the lives of our children and families.\n  I appreciate that one of the most contentious issues in this \nconference is guns, even though sensible gun control proposals are just \na small part of the comprehensive legislation we are considering. The \nquestion that the majority in Congress must answer is what are they \nwilling to do to protect children from gun violence?\n  A report released two months ago on juvenile violence by the Justice \nDepartment concludes that, ``data . . . indicate that guns play a major \nrole in juvenile violence.'' We need to do more to keep guns out of the \nhands of children who do not know how to use them or plan to use them \nto hurt others.\n  Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns \nout of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking \nabout people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals \nand unsupervised children. An editorial that appeared today in the \nRutland Daily Herald summed up the dilemma in this juvenile justice \nconference for the majority:\n\n       Republicans in Congress have tried to follow the line of \n     the National Rifle Association. It will be interesting to see \n     if they can hold that line when the Nation's crime fighters \n     let them know that fighting crime also means fighting guns.\n\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country was concerned this \nsummer about school violence over the last\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\ntwo years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only \nhope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. This \nan unacceptable and intolerable situation.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out \nof the hands of children and away from criminals. I hope we get to work \nsoon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. We \nare already tardy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10585-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DR.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout someone who has provided invaluable assistance to me and the \nBudget Committees over the years--Dr. Paul Van de Water, the Assistant \nDirector for Budget Analysis of the Congressional Budget Office. Dr. \nVan de Water is leaving the Congressional Budget Office this week, \nafter 18 years of distinguished service to the Congress, the budget \nprocess, and the American public. He will become the Senior Advisor to \nthe Deputy Commissioner for Policy at the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Paul Van de Water came to CBO in 1981, the same year I assumed \nChairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee. For years he headed the \nProjections Unit--doing the bread and butter work involved with \nproducing Congressional budgets. Without CBO, I could not have done my \njob, and Paul contributed mightily to almost every CBO analysis we \nneeded. He has served over and above the call of duty, spending nights \nand weekends working on our two Budget Committees' requests. I am sure \nhe will never forget the two weeks spent at Andrews Air Force Base \nduring the 1990 Budget Summit. We will not soon forget his sharp \nanalytical skills, his appreciation of Congressional demands, and the \ninstitutional consistency he has provided CBO over the last 18 years. \nDr. Van de Water has truly been an exceptional public servant.\n  I know I am speaking for all Members who have ever served on the \nBudget Committees of the House and Senate, and all our staff, when I \nexpress our gratitude to Paul for his contributions to this \nCongressional budget process. I join everyone in congratulating him on \nhis service to the country and wishing him luck in his future work at \nthe Social Security Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10585-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Secretary of \nthe Treasury Robert Rubin. Sworn in on January 10, 1995, as the 70th \nSecretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin resigned earlier this month.\n  Prior to serving in the administration, Secretary Rubin spent 26 \nyears at Goldman, Sachs, & Co., starting as an associate and leaving as \nco-chairman and co-senior partner. We have had few Secretaries of the \nTreasury who have brought such knowledge and expertise to the job.\n  His tenure as Secretary was marked by a steady, even-handed approach \nto economic policy in this country. He served in a critical time in our \nNation's history. On his watch, the United States has dramatically \nincreased its role as a leader in the global marketplace. The past 4 \nyears have been marked by turbulent economic times, and with his \nleadership we have weathered numerous international financial storms, \nincluding the Asian financial crisis, the Mexico peso devaluation, and \nthe ongoing economic turmoil of the former Soviet Union.\n  Under Secretary Rubin's leadership, we have maintained fiscal \ndiscipline. In 1992, the budget deficit was $290 billion, the largest \ndollar deficit on record. Last year, the budget surplus was nearly $70 \nbillion, the largest dollar surplus on record.\n  Under Secretary Rubin, we have had a robust economy with strong job \ncreation, inflation virtually nonexistent, and unemployment at its \nlowest rate in 29 years. His economic accomplishments are staggering.\n  Over the past 4 years, 18.4 million new jobs have been created. Also, \nthe unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in April 1999, which is the \nlowest in 29 years. At the time of Secretary Rubin's start in 1992, \nunemployment was at 7.5 percent. In fact, the unemployment rate has \nbeen below 5 percent for 22 months in a row--the lowest sustained \nunemployment rate in 29 years.\n  After adjusting for inflation, wages have increased almost 2.7 \npercent in 1998--that is the fastest real wage growth in more than \ntwo decades and the third year in a row--the longest sustained growth \nsince the early 1970s.\n\n  Inflation is the lowest since the 1950s. In fact, inflation was at \n1.4 percent for the beginning of 1999.\n  I think the greatest tribute to Secretary Rubin has been the reaction \nof the financial markets to his departure. Our financial markets have \nresponded with continued stable growth. Investors, both domestic and \nabroad, understand that the only way that Bob Rubin would consent to \nleave his post is if he felt that the U.S. economy was healthy and \nheading in the right direction.\n  While I am saddened with Secretary Rubin's departure, I can think of \nno better replacement to fill the top post at Treasury than Larry \nSummers. I believe that it is critical that there be a smooth \ntransition from one Treasury Secretary to another. Secretary Summers' \nleadership will provide a seamless transition and continuity to ensure \nstability in our financial markets.\n  Secretary Summers' extensive academic expertise and tenure as Deputy \nTreasury Secretary make him an invaluable addition to the Cabinet. I am \nconfident of his leadership ability and a strong believer that he will \nmake an excellent Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Bob Rubin has represented the best in public service, and our nation \ntruly owes him a debt of gratitude. His tireless leadership helped put \nour fiscal house in order, but--just as important--helped forge a \nstrong and vibrant economy that has created jobs and economic \nopportunity for millions of Americans. With his impressive financial \nexpertise and background, he uniquely understood that government and \nbusiness could work together so that everyone could benefit from \neconomic expansion. And though he fought to make our nation a leader in \nthe global marketplace--Bob Rubin ultimately understood the most \nimportant street in our nation was not just Wall Street, but Main \nStreet.\n  America is better off today because of Bob Rubin.\n  I would like to thank him for his service to our nation and wish him \nall the best in his next endeavor. I would also like to congratulate \nSecretary Summers on his new position. I am confident of his success \nand I look forward to continuing to work with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10585-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10585-S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAWAII'S STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on August 21, 1999, the State of Hawaii \ncelebrated its 40th anniversary as the 50th State of this great Nation.\n  Statehood for Hawaii was not a sudden or impulsive idea. During the \ndebate on statehood for Hawaii in the\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\nHouse of Representatives in March 1959, there were no fewer than 88 \nbills pending that would have, if enacted, admitted Hawaii as a State. \nThe people of Hawaii, through our territorial legislature, had \npetitioned the Congress for statehood on 17 different occasions.\n  Back in the fifties, times were very different. In those days, the \nconcept of statehood for a group of tiny islands in the middle of the \nPacific Ocean seemed far-fetched to many. However, the admission of \nAlaska removed the doubts of those who felt the United States should be \none contiguous land mass.\n  After nearly 40 years of Congressional debates, investigations, \nhearings, and visitations, we achieved what so many of us in the \nTerritory of Hawaii deeply desired. The State of Hawaii has come a long \nway since 1959 and I am very proud of the achievements of the people of \nHawaii. I believe Hawaii has proven to be a credit to our Nation. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to give my colleagues some insight \ninto the tremendous changes that have taken place in the 50th State \nover the past 40 years.\n  Hawaii has the reputation of being the ``Health State,'' and that \nreputation is well deserved. We lead the Nation in providing access to \nhealth care with more than 96 percent of the Hawaii population having \nhealth insurance. Hawaii leads the Nation with the lowest number of \ndeaths from breast cancer, and ranks second in the Nation for the \nlowest number of deaths due to all cancers, heart disease, and \ndiabetes.\n  Our territory of 600,000 American citizens in 1959 has more than \ndoubled in 40 years. No territory, with the exception of Oklahoma, ever \npossessed a population as large as Hawaii's at the time it sought \nstatehood in the Union. Consider these facts. In 1959, Hawaii \ncontributed into the U.S. Treasury $166 million in taxes, putting \nHawaii ahead of 10 States in taxpayer contributions. The per capita \nincome of Hawaii was $1,821, ranking it 25th amongst the States, and \nthe total income was more than in eight States. Current per capita \nincome is more than 14 times that original amount, ranking Hawaii 15th \namongst the States. Further, last year the people of Hawaii contributed \n$2.7 billion to Federal coffers in the form of taxes.\n  In 1959, sugar was king; 974,000 tons of sugar were produced in \nHawaii. Though sugar is no longer king in Hawaii, agricultural has and \ncontinues to be a significant contributor to the state's economy \nproviding nearly $3 billion in sales and more than 40,000 jobs. Sugar \nremains an important crop and pineapple production has been stable for \nmany years. Additionally, diversified agriculture, including flowers, \nfruits, vegetables, macadamia nuts, coffee, and livestock, is a very \nbright spot in our State's economy. It is one of the few economic \nsectors experiencing growth. In 1987, diversified crops surpassed sugar \nin farm fate value in Hawaii and never looked back. After its pristine \nbeaches and warm tropical waters, Hawaii's attraction lies in its green \nspace. Without agricultural production, much of this lush green \nenvironment, many come to expect of Hawaii, would be lost.\n  With sugar's downsizing, Hawaii is taking advantage of an opportunity \nthat has been available in the islands in 150 years, that is, \nagricultural land is available in large quantities. The State is now \ntaking an unobstructed look at agriculture in its broadest sense. \nBeyond traditional products, Hawaii and its year-round growing \ncapability is ripe for development of high value products like herbal \ndietary supplements, cosmetics, ethical drugs, specialized fruits and \nvegetables, and natural industrial products. There is also potential \nfor agriculture as a service industry in the areas of bioremediation of \ncontaminants, carbon sequestering forest production, seed testing and \npropagation for use worldwide, and development of innovative pest \nmanagement strategies.\n  The State of Hawaii has become a world class player in the science \nand technology arena. Manua Kea, on the Island of Hawaii, is known \ninternationally as the best site for optical, infrared, and millimeter/\nsubmillimeter astronomy. It is the chosen site for all four of the new \ngeneration of 8- or 10-meter class telescopes now under construction in \nthe Northern Hemisphere. The observatories include: the Gemini project, \nthe Keck Observatory, Canada-France-Hawaii, the Joint Astronomy Center, \nSubaru, Smithsonian, and the California Institute of Technology. Eight \nnations are represented atop Manua Kea with the United States' presence \nmost prominent.\n  The Maui Research and Technology Park is fast earning a reputation as \none of the world's most sophisticated high technology centers. MRTP is \nhome to the Maui High Performance Computing Center, the newest of 12 \nnational supercomputing resource centers.\n  The University of Hawaii's successful cloning of three generations of \nmice from adult cells stunned the international scientific community \nand has brought significant prestige and attention to the University \nand the State.\n  Forty years ago, when the Members of Congress debated the suitability \nof Hawaii as a state, questions were raised about our Americanism. \nDuring World War II, the loyalty and patriotism of Americans of \nJapanese ancestry living in Hawaii were called into question. When we \nfinally received the call to duty in early 1943, 1,500 Hawaii \nvolunteers were sought by the U.S. Army. In less than a week, 15,000 \nhad volunteered, and Hawaii was not yet a State.\n  We continue our strong commitment to military service. Hawaii is home \nto all the services, and we continue to demonstrate our support for our \nnation's military as a member of our Hawaii community. We are home to \nthe USS Missouri and the USS Arizona memorials which symbolize the \nbeginning and end of World War II, and pay tribute to the many brave \nmen and women who have their lives for our nation. Hawaii has been \nbestowed with this high honor of stewardship that we will proudly \nuphold.\n  Tripler Army Medical Center is a leader in medical care, medical \neducation, and research. It has also earned national recognition for \nits work in telehealth technology applications, most appropriately \ncalled AKAMAI which in Hawaiian means ``brilliant or smart.'' The \nstate-of-the-art Spark M. Matsunaga Veterans Medical Center will open \nin early 2000 at Tripler, and the two agencies have worked \ncollaboratively to integrate services and information systems, \nproviding both active duty personnel and veterans with the best medical \ncare available anywhere. We are also very proud of the Center of \nExcellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance, a \nmilitary-civilian partnership that facilitates joint disaster response \noperations through research, education, and information management.\n  It is clear that none of the concerns expressed in those years \npreceding statehood have become reality. Hawaii did not fall to \ncommunism. Hawaii's distance has not diminished the strength of the \nUnited States, but in fact has enhanced its military and economic power \ninto the Asia-Pacific region. Further, Hawaii remains one of the \ngreatest examples of a multiethnic society living in relative peace.\n  I have had the privilege of serving the people of Hawaii in the U.S. \nCongress since statehood. Over these years, the people of Hawaii have \nproven their unfailing loyalty and devotion to America's ideals. \nHawaii's achievements are a testament to our desire to continually \nshare the best of who we are and what we have to offer our fellow \nAmericans.\n  So, as we celebrate 40 years of statehood, Hawaii looks toward the \nnew millennium with pride, dignity and the hope for an even brighter \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10586-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Her \nintellect, knowledge, competence and experience continue to be \nindispensable to the resolution of the many issues that confront this \nkey segment of the economy.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of California relative to Social \n     Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S10605]]\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, For 60 years social security has provided a stable \n     platform of retirement, disability, and survivor annuity \n     benefits to protect working Americans and their dependents; \n     and\n       Whereas, The American and world economies continue to \n     encounter periods of high uncertainty and volatility that \n     make it as important as ever to preserve a basic and \n     continuous safety net of protections guaranteed by our \n     society's largest repository of risk, the federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas, Social security affords protections to rich and \n     poor alike. No citizen, no matter how well off today, can say \n     that tomorrow's adversities will not create future \n     dependency; and\n       Whereas, Average life expectancies are increasing greatly \n     and people are commonly living into their 80's and 90's, \n     making it more important than ever that each of us be fully \n     protected by defined retirement benefits; and\n       Whereas, Medical scientists are daily discovering more \n     creative ways to preserve the lives of the profoundly \n     disabled, thus making it more important than ever that each \n     of us be protected against the risks of our own dependency, \n     against the risk of becoming a burden to relatives, and \n     against the risk of succumbing to a disability unrelated to \n     the duration of life; and\n       Whereas, The lives of wage earners and their spouses are \n     seldom coterminous. One spouse often outlives the other by \n     decades, making it crucial to preserve a secure base of \n     protection for family members dependent on a wage earner who \n     may die or become disabled; and\n       Whereas, The children of working Americans require \n     protection against the untimely death or disability of their \n     wage-earning parents, contingencies that are too often \n     uncovered by working Americans and their employers; and\n       Whereas, The costs of administering social security are \n     less than 1 percent of the benefits delivered; and\n       Whereas, The single purpose of social security is to \n     provide a strong, simple, and efficient form of basic \n     insurance against the adversities of old age, disability, and \n     dependency; and\n       Whereas, Social security was founded on the sanctity of \n     work and the preservation of family integrity in the face of \n     death or disability; and\n       Whereas, Social security, in current form, reinforces \n     family cohesiveness and enhances the value of work in our \n     society; and\n       Whereas, Congress currently has proposals to shift a \n     portion of social security contributions from insurance to \n     personal investment accounts for each wage earner; and\n       Whereas, Social security, our largest and most fundamental \n     insurance system, should not be splintered into \n     individualized stock accounts. Social security cannot fulfill \n     its protective function if it must also create and manage \n     millions of small risk-bearing investments out of a stream of \n     contributions intended as insurance. Private accounts cannot \n     be substituted for social security without eroding basic \n     protections for working families. For these protections to be \n     strong, they must be insulated from economic uncertainty and \n     be backed by the entity best capable of spreading risk, the \n     American government; and\n       Whereas, The diversion of contributions to private \n     investment accounts would dramatically increase financial \n     shortfalls to the social security trust fund and require \n     major reductions in the defined benefits upon which millions \n     of Americans depend. To administer 150,000,000 separate \n     investment accounts would create an ever proliferating \n     bureaucracy. The resulting expense and the cost of converting \n     each account to an annuity upon retirement would consume much \n     of the profit, or exacerbate the loss, realized by each \n     participant; and\n       Whereas, It is an entirely different question whether part \n     of the social security trust fund should be diversified into \n     investments other than government bonds. For the fund to \n     invest collectively in a broad selection of equities and \n     private bonds may well increase returns over time and thus \n     enhance the capacity of the fund to meet its obligations to \n     pay benefits as presently defined. The central management for \n     those investments would be a minor expense compared to the \n     staggering cost of overseeing millions of splintered \n     accounts. Central investment also preserves the spreading of \n     risk across the entire spectrum of social security \n     participants. Individualized accounts, by contrast, would \n     create an array of winners and losers, thus converting part \n     of our retirement system into a national lottery. Those who \n     become disabled, those who must retire early, and dependents \n     with the earliest and greatest need would receive the least \n     in return. The system would be perversely contrary to basic \n     principles of insurance and risk distribution; and\n       Whereas, Diverting social security contributions to private \n     accounts is redundant to existing programs. Through \n     amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Congress has \n     created a full menu of provisions by which working Americans \n     and their employers may contribute by choice to tax-sheltered \n     accounts that are open to the opportunities and exposed fully \n     to the risks of our speculative and vigorous investment \n     markets. One-half of American families are already covered by \n     these recently created systems; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the \n     federal government is respectfully requested to take \n     appropriate steps to encourage workers and their employers to \n     save or invest for retirement to supplement the basic \n     benefits of the Social Security Program, but not as a \n     substitute for the core protections that are vital to \n     American working families; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, and each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-310. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of California relative to Domestic Violence \n     Awareness Month; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, Home should be a place of warmth, unconditional \n     love, tranquility, and security; however, for many Americans, \n     home is tainted with violence and fear; and\n       Whereas, Domestic violence is much more than the occasional \n     family dispute; and\n       Whereas, According to the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services, domestic violence is the single \n     largest cause of injury to American women, affecting \n     6,000,000 women of all racial, cultural, and economic \n     backgrounds; and\n       Whereas, According to data published by the California \n     Department of Justice in 1996, 624 incidents of domestic \n     violence were reported, on average, every day in California. \n     According to the American Psychological Association, nearly \n     one in three adult women are physicially assaulted by a \n     partner during adulthood; and\n       Whereas, According to the United States Department of \n     Labor, 1,000,000 people are assaulted and injured every year \n     as a result of workplace violence, 1,000 people are killed \n     every year due to workplace violence, and 30 percent of \n     battered women lose their jobs due to harassment at work by \n     abusive husbands or boyfriends; and\n       Whereas, More than one-half of the number of women in need \n     of shelter from an abusive environment may be turned away \n     from a shelter due to lack of space; and\n       Whereas, Women are not the only targets of domestic \n     violence; young children, elderly persons, and men are also \n     victims in their own homes; and\n       Whereas, Emotional scars are often permanent; and\n       Whereas, A coalition of organizations has emerged to \n     confront this crisis directly. Law enforcement agencies, \n     domestic violence hotlines, battered women and children's \n     shelters, health care providers, churches, and the volunteers \n     that serve those entities are helping the effort to end \n     domestic violence; and\n       Whereas, It is important to recognize the compassion and \n     dedication of the individuals involved in that effort, \n     applaud their commitment, and increase public understanding \n     of this significant problem; and\n       Whereas, The first Day of Unity was celebrated in October \n     1981 and was sponsored by the National Coalition Against \n     Domestic Violence for the purpose of uniting battered women's \n     advocates across the nation in an effort to end domestic \n     violence; and\n       Whereas, That one day has grown into a month of activities \n     at all levels of government, aimed at creating awareness \n     about the problem and presenting solutions; and\n       Whereas, The first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was \n     proclaimed in October 1987; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, the \n     Assembly thereof concurring, That the Legislature hereby \n     proclaims the month of October 1999, as Domestic Violence \n     Awareness Month; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Governor of the State of California, the Director of the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-311. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to Medicare; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, Many health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have \n     thrown the Medicare system into a state of turmoil by \n     withdrawing coverage of Medicare enrollees at the end of \n     1998; and\n       Whereas, Thousands of HMO patients in California are now in \n     a state of panic and confusion regarding their future ability \n     to access health care services, including pharmacy benefits, \n     at a reasonable cost; and\n       Whereas, In California, 39 percent of Medicare enrollees, \n     or approximately 1.5 million patients, are served by HMOs, \n     more than double the national average; and\n       Whereas, In recent years, HMOs have aggressively and \n     successfully recruited the elderly into their Medicare health \n     plans with promises to provide more benefits than standard \n     fee-for-service Medicare coverage, including allowances for \n     prescription drugs, hearing aids, and eyeglasses; and\n       Whereas, Each year HMOs participating in the Medicare \n     managed care program are required to notify  the federal \n     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) whether\n\n[[Page S10606]]\n\n     they will renew their contracts for the following year; \n     and\n       Whereas, This year, numerous HMOs have notified HCFA that \n     they will not renew their contracts for next year, or will \n     reduce the areas that they currently serve, with these \n     withdrawals and service area reductions adversely affecting \n     more than 400,000 beneficiaries across the nation, and over \n     40,000 Medicare patients in California; and\n       Whereas, The Inspector General of the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services has discovered that \n     HMOs have been receiving more than $1 billion annually in \n     overpayments from the Medicare Trust Fund, because HMOs are \n     inflating administration costs dedicated to marketing, \n     executive salaries and fringe benefits, legal fees, and other \n     overhead costs; and\n       Whereas, The inspector general has recommended that these \n     funds be recovered from HMOs and dedicated to providing \n     Medicare beneficiaries with added health benefits, including \n     prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, Many Medicare patients not served by HMOs purchase \n     Medicare supplement insurance, also known as Medigap \n     coverage, which fills in the gaps in Medicare coverage and \n     offers patients the most flexibility in choosing doctors and \n     hospitals, and premiums for Medigap insurance have increased, \n     on average, 35 percent since 1994; and\n       Whereas, Under the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     seniors enrolled in a Medicare HMO that terminates its \n     services are eligible to purchase specified Medigap insurance \n     coverage, regardless of their health status, but the last day \n     to take advantage of this guaranteed access is March 4, 1999; \n     and\n       Whereas, Disabled individuals who qualify for Medicare, but \n     are younger than 65 years of age, are not guaranteed access \n     to Medigap coverage under a federal interpretation of federal \n     law, and will need special assistance to secure health care \n     services after they are abandoned by their HMOs; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully \n     memorializes the Federal Government to take immediate and \n     appropriate steps to ensure that persons abandoned by \n     Medicare HMOs have access to other HMO or Medigap policies \n     that cover prescription drugs and to establish stopgap \n     measures to ensure that HMOs do not further restrict coverage \n     areas or benefits until the larger issue of the Medicare HMO \n     payment mechanism is further examined or refined; and be in \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully memorializes \n     the Federal Government to rescind its determination that \n     disabled persons under 65 years of age enrolled in HMOs do \n     not have the same guaranteed rights to Medigap policies as \n     all other Medicare enrollees; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully memorializes \n     the President of the United States to issue an Executive \n     order directing his administration to work closely and \n     coordinate with California and other states to guide and \n     assist Medicare enrollees who are abandoned by their HMOs to \n     find new Medicare coverage, either in the form of another HMO \n     that serves the abandoned region, or through Medigap \n     coverage, until appropriate federal legislation is enacted to \n     address permanently these types of dislocations that \n     adversely affect Medicare patients; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the majority leader of the Senate, each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, and Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the \n     Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-312. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State or California relative to the U.S. Coast Guard \n     Training Facility (TRACEN) Petaluma; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                      Sente Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, The United States Coast Guard is presently \n     assessing its training structure for cost-effectiveness and \n     is considering consolidating or closing one or two of its \n     five training centers including the United States Coast Guard \n     Training Center (TRACEN) Petaluma in the rural community of \n     Two Rock, California; and\n       Whereas, TRACEN Petaluma is the only Coast Guard training \n     facility on the west coast, while the Coast Guard maintains \n     four other training centers on the eastern seaboard; and\n       Whereas, In the case of a prolonged national emergency, a \n     Coast Guard training facility on the west coast has both \n     logistic and strategic value to the service's two-ocean \n     mission and to national security; and\n       Whereas, The mild California coastal climate makes it \n     possible for TRACEN Petaluma to conduct outdoor exercises \n     year round; and\n       Whereas, The Coast Guard has invested more than $50 million \n     in TRACEN Petaluma since its inception, including $29 million \n     to construct a state-of-the-art electronics and \n     telecommunications training facility; and\n       Whereas, The rural community of Two Rock is dependent on \n     TRACEN Petaluma for the continued existence of its \n     neighborhood school and for fire and emergency services; and\n       Whereas, TRACEN Petaluma contributes $24.9 million annually \n     to the North Bay economy in an areas that has been severely \n     impacted by military base closures; and\n       Whereas, The closings of veterans hospitals in California \n     have increased the dependence of retired military on the \n     health services available at the TRACEN Petaluma medical \n     facility; and\n       Whereas, TRACEN Petaluma also houses essential non-Coast \n     Guard training activities for police, fire, and emergency \n     personnel and rangers employed by local, state, and federal \n     agencies operating throughout the region; and\n       Whereas, These entities have no other place to continue \n     their training activities in the near future; and\n       Whereas, TRACEN Petaluma has a tradition of excellence \n     recognized by the Coast Guard, a well-earned reputation for \n     community involvement, and a legacy of environmental \n     stewardship;\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature believes the \n     continued operation of the United States Coast Guard Training \n     Center (TRACEN) Petaluma is beneficial to the critical public \n     safety and national security mission of the United States \n     Coast Guard, and to the people and economy of California; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully memorializes \n     the President and the Congress of the United States, and the \n     United States Coast Guard to continue the operation of the \n     United States Coast Guard Training Facility (TRACEN) Petaluma \n     through increased utilization of its facilities and more \n     efficient use of the Coast Guard's east coast facilities; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the United States Coast \n     Guard.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-313. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to human rights; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, The legacy of war in Afghanistan has had a \n     devastating impact on the civilian population; and\n       Whereas, The warring factions in Afghanistan have routinely \n     violated the rights of women and girls; and\n       Whereas, There has been a marked increase in human rights \n     violations against women and girls since the Taliban militia \n     seized the City of Kabul in September 1996; and\n       Whereas, Afghan women are now forbidden to work outside of \n     the home. Prior to the Taliban takeover, women worked outside \n     of the home in various professions; and\n       Whereas, Seventy percent of school teachers, 50 percent of \n     civilian government workers, and 40 percent of doctors in \n     Kabul were women; and\n       Whereas, Afghan girls and women are prohibited from \n     attending schools and universities. Before the takeover, 50 \n     percent of the students in Afghanistan were women; and\n       Whereas, Afghan women are forbidden from appearing outside \n     the home unless accompanied by a close male relative; and\n       Whereas, Access to health care has been denied to the \n     majority of Afghan women and girls. This is a result of \n     prohibiting male doctors from examining women, prohibiting \n     women doctors from practicing, and limiting the health \n     facilities available to women; and\n       Whereas, Afghan women are required to be covered from head \n     to toe in a shroud, with only a narrow mesh opening through \n     which to see, when they leave their homes. Likewise, they are \n     not allowed to wear shoes that make any noise when they walk; \n     and\n       Whereas, Homes and other buildings in which Afghan women or \n     girls might be present must have their windows painted so no \n     female can be seen from outside; and\n       Whereas, Afghan women have been whipped, beaten, shot at, \n     and, a times, killed for not adhering to these restrictions; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Secretary of State of the United States, the \n     United Nations, and the Physicians for Human Rights have \n     reported that the Taliban's targeting of women and girls for \n     discrimination and abuse has created a health and \n     humanitarian disaster; and\n       Whereas, The International Red Cross and the United Nations \n     estimate that more than 500,000 people in the City of Kabul, \n     approximately two-thirds of the residents of that city, \n     depend on international aid to survive; and\n       Whereas, Afghanistan recognizes international human rights \n     conventions such as the Covenant on the Rights of the Child, \n     the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, and the International Covenant \n     on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, all of which \n     espouse respect for basic human rights of all individuals \n     without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, or gender; and\n       Whereas, Denying women and girls the right to education, \n     employment, access to adequate health care, and direct access \n     to humanitarian aid runs counter to international human \n     rights conventions; and\n       Whereas, Peace and security in Afghanistan can only be \n     realized with the full restoration for all human rights and \n     fundamental freedom, the voluntary repatriation\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\n     of refugees to their homeland in safety and dignity, and the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President of the United States and \n     Congress to take the necessary action to ensure the rights of \n     women and girls in Afghanistan are not systematically \n     violated, and urges a peaceful resolution to the situation in \n     Afghanistan that restores the human rights of Afghan women \n     and girls; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     Secretary of State of the United States, to the President of \n     the United States, and to the Secretary General of the United \n     Nations.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-314.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to housing; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, There are 240,000 people in California residing in \n     federally assisted project-based Section 8 housing units. \n     Forty-four percent of Section 8 residents are elderly, and \n     the median income of Section 8 residents is $9,300. Without \n     Section 8 and comparable assistance, many of these households \n     will become homeless; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     (HUD) has typically provided all capital and operating \n     subsidies for public housing. In 1974 Congress created the \n     new housing production program known as the Section 8 New \n     Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation Program, under \n     which HUD typically provided a 20-year commitment for rental \n     subsidies that assured owners a specified level of rental \n     income; and\n       Whereas, Property owners may convert their properties to \n     market-based housing\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\n     when their Section 8 contracts expire with HUD. Dramatic rent \n     increases occurring in a number of housing markets in this \n     state have already inspired many property owners to opt out \n     of Section 8 subsidies, thus eliminating vast resources for \n     low-income housing and potentially increasing levels of \n     homelessness throughout the state. In California, owners of \n     approximately 10,500 formerly affordable HUD units have \n     converted to market rate use in the past two years; and\n       Whereas, Every county in California has buildings with \n     project-based Section 8 units, and will be severely affected \n     by the loss of affordable units. The largest concentrations \n     are in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay Area, San \n     Diego, and Sacramento; and\n       Whereas, Recent federal housing policy and budget decisions \n     have led to uncertainty over the current federally assisted \n     housing inventory in California. Those decisions will place \n     increasing demands on the financial and administrative \n     resources of the state to maintain that housing inventory; \n     and\n       Whereas, The federal fiscal year 1999 budget provides \n     insufficient funding to preserve most of the below market \n     housing stock; and\n       Whereas, The federal fiscal year 2000 budget will need $1.3 \n     billion in additional budget authority to fund all contract \n     extensions on current Section 8 projects. HUD's initiative to \n     provide $100 million to increase contract rents at below \n     market properties was rejected by the Office of Management \n     and Budget; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and Congress of the \n     United States and the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development to establish policies and funding priorities that \n     will ensure the preservation of the inventory of federally \n     assisted housing in California; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-318.

These are:\n       (1) Filipinos who served in the regular components of the \n     United States Armed Forces.\n       (2) Regular Philippine Scouts, called ``Old Scouts,'' who \n     enlisted in Filipino-manned units of the United States Army \n     prior to October 6, 1945.\n       (3) Special Philippine Scouts, called ``New Scouts,'' who \n     enlisted in the United States Armed Forces between October 6, \n     1945, and June 30, 1947, primarily to perform occupation duty \n     in the Pacific following World War II.\n       (4) Members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army who on July \n     26, 1941, were called into the service of the United States \n     Armed Forces. This group includes organized guerrilla \n     resistance units that were recognized by the United States \n     Army; and\n       Whereas, The first two groups, Filipinos who served in the \n     regular components of the United States Army and Old Scouts, \n     are considered United States veterans and are generally \n     entitled to the full range of United States veterans' \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, The other two groups, New Scouts and members of \n     the Philippine Commonwealth Army, are eligible for certain \n     benefits, and some of these benefits are paid at lower than \n     full rates. United States veterans' medical benefits for \n     the four groups of Filipino veterans vary depending upon \n     whether the person resides in the United States or the \n     Philippines; and\n       Whereas, The Old Scouts were created in 1901 pursuant to \n     the act of February 2, 1901, that authorized the President of \n     the United States ``to enlist natives [of the Philippines] . \n     . . for service in the Army, to be organized as scouts . . . \n     or as troops or companies, as authorized by this Act, for the \n     regular Army''; and\n       Whereas, Prior to World War II, these troops assisted in \n     the maintenance of domestic order in the Philippines and \n     served as a combat-ready force to defend the Philippine \n     Islands against foreign invasion; and\n       Whereas, During the war, they participated in the defense \n     and retaking of the islands from Japanese occupation. The \n     eligibility of Old Scouts for benefits based on military \n     service in the United States Armed Forces, including \n     veterans' benefits, has long been established; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     operates a comprehensive program of veterans' benefits in the \n     Republic of the Philippines, including the operation of a \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs office in \n     Manila; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     does not operate a program of this type in any other country; \n     and\n       Whereas, The program in the Philippines evolved because the \n     Philippines were a United States possession during the period \n     1898-1946, and many Filipinos have served in the United \n     States Armed Forces, and because the preindependence \n     Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was called into the \n     service of the United States Armed Forces during World War II \n     (1941-1945); and\n       Whereas, Our nation, however, has failed to meet the \n     promise made to those Filipino soldiers who fought as \n     American soldiers during World War II; and\n       Whereas, Many Filipino veterans have been discriminated \n     against by the classification of their service as not being \n     service rendered in the United States Armed Forces for \n     purposes of benefits from the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, All other nationals, even foreigners, who served \n     in the United States Armed Forces have been recognized and \n     granted full rights and benefits, but the Filipinos who \n     actually were American nationals at that time were and are \n     still denied recognition and singled out for exclusion, and \n     this treatment is unfair and discriminatory; and\n       Whereas, On October 20, 1996, President Clinton issued a \n     proclamation honoring the\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\n     nearly 100,000 Filipino veterans of World War II, soldiers of \n     the Philippine Commonwealth Army, who fought as a component \n     of the United States Armed Forces alongside Allied Forces for \n     four long years to defend and reclaim the Philippine Islands, \n     and thousands more who joined the United States Armed Forces \n     after the war; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and \n     Congress of the United States to take action necessary to \n     honor our country's moral obligation to provide Filipino \n     veterans with the military benefits that they deserve, \n     including, but not limited to, holding related hearings, and \n     acting favorably on legislation pertaining to granting full \n     veterans' benefits to Filipino veterans of the United States \n     Armed Forces; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n       POM-320.

Ramirez originates from \n     East Los Angeles in the 24th Senate District; and\n       Whereas, Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez joined the United \n     States Army in July 1992 and is a cavalry scout in B Troop of \n     the Fourth Cavalry of the First Infantry Division who was \n     stationed in Schweinfurt, Germany, prior to deployment in \n     Macedonia; and\n       Whereas, Communities in California and especially East Los \n     Angeles anxiously await the safe release of Staff Sergeant \n     Andrew A. Ramirez, Staff Sergeant Christopher Stone, and \n     Specialist Steven Gonzales captured by the Yugoslav Armed \n     Forces; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California commend Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez, Staff \n     Sergeant Christopher Stone, and Specialist Steven Gonzales \n     for courageously executing their duties as members of the \n     United States Armed Forces; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully urges the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     to do all that is within their power to secure and expedite \n     the safe return of Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez, Staff \n     Sergeant Christopher Stone, and Specialist Steven Gonzales \n     captured by the Yugoslav Armed Forces in Macedonia; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n       POM-321. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Colorado relative to the Federal Unified Gift \n     and Estate Tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 99-004\n\n       Whereas, The Federal Unified Gift and Estate Tax, or \n     ``Death Tax'', generates a minimal amount of federal revenue, \n     especially considering the high cost of collection and \n     compliance and in fact has been shown to decrease federal \n     revenues from what they might otherwise have been; and\n       Whereas, This federal Death Tax has been identified as \n     destructive to job opportunity and expansion, especially to \n     minority entrepreneurs and family farmers; and\n       Whereas, This federal Death Tax causes severe hardship to \n     growing family businesses and family farming operations, \n     often to the point of partial or complete forced liquidation; \n     and\n       Whereas, Critical state and local leadership assets are \n     unnecessarily destroyed and forever lost to the future \n     detriment of their communities through relocation or \n     liquidation; and\n       Whereas, Local and state schools, churches, and numerous \n     charitable organizations would greatly benefit from the \n     increased employment and continued family business leadership \n     that would result from the repeal of the federal Death Tax; \n     now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General \n     Assembly of the State of Colorado, the House of \n     Representatives concurring herein:\n       That the Congress of the United States is hereby \n     memorialized to immediately repeal the Federal Unified Gift \n     and Estate Tax.\n       Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial \n     be sent to the President of the United States, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States Senate, and each member of the Colorado \n     congressional delegation.\n       POM-322.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Texas Gulf Coast; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, One of Texas' richest and most diverse areas is \n     that of the Gulf Coast; the Coastal Bend abounds with \n     treasures for all, and every year thousands of visitors flock \n     to its beaches and wetlands to enjoy the sun, fish the \n     waters, appreciate its unique scenery and wildlife, and \n     bolster their spirits simply by being near such awe-inspiring \n     beauty; and\n       Whereas, In addition to $7 billion per year generated by \n     coastal tourism, the area is also home to half of the \n     nation's petrochemical industry and over a quarter of its \n     petroleum refining capacity; and\n       Whereas, Coastal tourism, the petrochemical and petroleum \n     industries, a robust commercial and recreational fishing \n     trade, and significant agricultural production make this \n     region a vital economic and natural resource for both the \n     state and the nation; and\n       Whereas, Like other coastal states located near offshore \n     drilling activities, Texas provides workers, equipment, and \n     ports of entry for oil and natural gas mined offshore; while \n     these states derive numerous benefits from the offshore \n     drilling industry, they also face great risks, such as \n     coastline degradation and spill disasters, as well as the \n     loss of nonrenewable natural resources; and\n       Whereas, Although state and local authorities have worked \n     diligently to conserve and protect coastal resources, \n     securing the funds needed to maintain air and water quality \n     and to ensure the existence of healthy wetlands and beaches \n     and protection of wildlife is a constant challenge; and\n       Whereas, The federal Land and Water Conservation fund was \n     established by Congress in 1964 and has been one of the most \n     successful and far-reaching pieces of conservation and \n     recreation legislation, using as its funding source the \n     revenues from oil and gas activity on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf; and\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\n       Whereas, The game and nongame wildlife resources of this \n     state are a vital natural resource and provide enjoyment and \n     other benefits for current and future generations; and\n       Whereas, The federal government has received more than $120 \n     billion in offshore drilling revenue during the past 43 \n     years, only five percent of which has been allotted to the \n     states; it is fair and just that Texas and other coastal \n     states should receive a dedicated share of the revenue they \n     help generate; and\n       Whereas, Several bills are currently before the United \n     States Congress that would allocate a portion of federal \n     offshore drilling royalties to coastal states and local \n     communities for wildlife protection, conservation, and \n     coastal impact projects; and\n       Whereas, States and local communities know best how to \n     allocate resources to address their needs, and block grants \n     will provide the best means for distributing funds; and\n       Whereas, These funds would help support the recipients' \n     efforts to renew and maintain their beaches, wetlands, urban \n     waterfronts, parks, public harbors and fishing piers, and \n     other elements of coastal infrastructure that are vital to \n     the quality of life and economic and environmental well-being \n     of these states and local communities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     pass legislation embodying these principles; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n       POM-324. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Kerrville Veterans \n     Administration Medical Center; to the Committee on Veteran's \n     Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 112\n\n       Whereas, the Kerrville Veterans Administration Medical \n     Center, which consistently ranks high among Texas-based \n     veterans' hospitals, is a ``veteran-friendly'' facility \n     offering the very best of medical care and an outstanding \n     corps of affiliated physicians, nurses, and support \n     personnel; and\n       Whereas, it is a valuable regional resource and a comfort \n     to the many thousands of military retirees who have settled \n     in the Texas Hill Country both for the allure of those \n     environs and the close proximity in their older age to the \n     expertise of highly qualified health practitioners; and\n       Whereas, the Kerrville institution has a long and \n     successful history; begun in 1919, it opened its doors two \n     years later after fund-raising by the American Legion and \n     appropriations from the 37th Legislature; the federal \n     government bought the facility from the state in 1926, \n     eventually to incorporate it within the Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center System; and\n       Whereas, over the last 10 years, the U.S. Department of \n     Veterans Affairs has spent almost $20 million upgrading the \n     center, installing the most modern equipment and enhancing \n     its ability to treat and attend our veterans in a manner \n     reciprocating their service in behalf of this nation; and\n       Whereas, absent a policy reversal, the center will be \n     phased out for extended hospital care by May 1999, and will \n     keep intensive care patients for only 24 hours before \n     transferring them to another Department of Veterans Affairs \n     medical center in San Antonio or, if that is full, to private \n     hospitals in the Bexar County area; and\n       Whereas, given the investment in and improvements to the \n     center in the past decade, these diminutions of service seem \n     both a waste of money and federal resources and a creation of \n     geographic inconvenience for veterans in Kerr County and \n     surrounding communities;\n       Whereas, the continued vitality of the Kerrville Veterans \n     Administration Medical Center as a first-class hospital is an \n     issue of importance not only to the people of Kerrville and \n     the Hill Country region but also to Texas generally because \n     of its strategic role in meeting the health needs of the \n     citizens of this state; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to ensure the future of the Kerrville Veterans Administration \n     Medical Center by providing that it be fully funded, staffed, \n     and utilized, and by restoring and promoting the health \n     rights and benefits of the Texas veterans who are its \n     prospective patrons; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-325. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Social Security Trust \n     Fund; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 249\n\n       Whereas, by 2032, the federal Social Security Trust Fund \n     will likely be unable to meet its obligations, and \n     comprehensive reform is necessary to ensure its viability \n     both for present and future beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, legislation on the subject is anticipated in the \n     106th Congress, and with the Federal Government searching for \n     avenues to restore solvency to the failing fund, attention \n     has turned to the option of mandated coverage for newly hired \n     employees of previously noncovered state and local \n     governments; and\n       Whereas, such governments were initially excluded from \n     Social Security participation when the system was established \n     in 1935, as it was considered unconstitutional for the \n     Federal Government to tax counterpart governments at the \n     state and local levels; and\n       Whereas, consequently, Texas state and local governments \n     established independent retirement plans to meet the needs of \n     their employees, and local government participation in Social \n     Security remains optional, although state employees are now \n     covered by both Social Security and state retirement plans; \n     and\n       Whereas, mandating coverage on newly hired employees of \n     previously noncovered governments, according to the Social \n     Security Advisory Council, would extend the solvency of the \n     Social Security Trust Fund by a mere two years; and\n       Whereas, such mandated coverage would result in a tax \n     increase of 6.2 percent each for local government employees \n     and local government employers, for a combined tax increase \n     of 12.4 percent; and\n       Whereas, there currently are over 562,000 noncovered public \n     employees in Texas, including public school teachers and \n     administrators, public safety officers, and large numbers of \n     city, county, and special district employees; and\n       Whereas, estimates prepared by the Texas Association of \n     Public Employees Retirement Systems project a cost of at \n     least $6.87 billion to Texas local government employers, \n     particularly school districts, and newly hired workers over \n     the first 10 years of implementation; and\n       Whereas, city and county governments, in order to pay the \n     new federal tax, might have no choice but to reduce services \n     such as law enforcement, fire protection, libraries, public \n     health, programs for senior citizens and the disabled, parks \n     and recreation, and refuse collection and recycling; and\n       Whereas, school districts would experience a new source of \n     pressure toward increasing property taxes, and local \n     government retirement plans generally might need to be \n     reduced due to the cost imposed by mandatory Social Security \n     coverage; and\n       Whereas, the proposed new tax is a shift of a federal \n     burden to local communities to solve a federal problem that \n     our state and local governments had no hand in creating, and \n     under which there would be no benefit paid to Texas workers \n     for more than a generation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States and urge \n     the President of the United States in the strongest possible \n     terms to refrain from the inclusion of mandatory Social \n     Security coverage for presently noncovered state and local \n     government employees in any Social Security reform \n     legislation; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-326.

Only \n     300,000 girls participated in California high school sports \n     prior to Title IX; today the number is in excess of 2.37 \n     million; and\n       Whereas, title IX governs overall equity of opportunity in \n     athletics, including areas such as equipment and supplies, \n     travel, support services, and scholarships; and\n       Whereas, scholarship opportunities are an important way \n     that educational institutions meet the needs and interests of \n     student athletics; and\n       Resolved, That the CIF and California high schools and \n     colleges are to be commended for the progress made already, \n     and to encourage further efforts by all to meet the challenge \n     of equality in sports and the greatest fulfillment of the \n     hopes and dreams of girls and women in our school; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That programs and projects that emphasize girls' \n     and women's confidence building through fitness and physical \n     challenges in sports and outdoor adventure, such as the \n     Women's Sports Foundation, Girl Teams Adventure Training, \n     Okinawan Karate, and the 50's Plus Fitness Association, be \n     commended for their positive impact in carrying forward the \n     fitness message for girls and women; and be it further\n       Resolved, That parents, families, businesses, women \n     athletes who serve as positive role models, and all others \n     who have contributed to girls' and women's leadership and \n     team player skills through sports and fitness activities are \n     to be commended; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California, \n     on June 23, 1999, commemorates the 27th Anniversary of Title \n     IX, commends the movement toward increased equality and fair \n     treatment of female athletes, and praises the goals of \n     greater opportunities in sports for girls and young women in \n     California; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-339.

SIMONS LIGHTHOUSE PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat guarantees the future of a great historic treasure in my state. \nFor nearly 200 years, the lighthouse at St. Simons Island, Georgia, \nstood as a sentinel at the head of St. Simons Sound and guided ships \nsafely through dangerous waters and into the port of nearby Brunswick. \nAlthough it is no longer used for this purpose, the lighthouse remains \nan integral part of the St. Simons Island community and is part of the \nrich heritage of this region. Unfortunately, events could soon take \nplace which could do irrevocable harm to this site.\n  In 1961, the United States Postal Service (USPS) leased part of the \nlighthouse property and built a small post office for the community, \nwhich is no longer used by the USPS. The lease was signed between the \nUSPS and a private citizen, who owned the property at the time. This \nagreement, which expires in 2011, gives the USPS seven options to \npurchase the land outright at a significant discount, with the next \npurchase option being in 2001.\n  Since the lease was signed, many things have changed. In 1984, the \ntitle to the lighthouse property was transferred to the Coastal Georgia \nHistorical Society, an organization dedicated\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nto preserving the lighthouse and Georgia's coastal heritage. While the \nCGHS holds the title, the lease with the USPS remains in effect.\n  It is very easy to see why many in the St. Simons community have \ngrave concerns about the USPS exercising its right-to-buy option. The \nUSPS has expressed its intent to exercise this option and immediately \nsell the land to a commercial developer for a huge profit. Many area \nresidents do not appreciate the idea of placing a highrise hotel or a \nfast food restaurant next to the historic symbol of their community.\n  The bill I am introducing today seeks to rectify this situation by \npreserving the St. Simons Lighthouse without interfering with the \nprofit maximization requirements placed on the USPS. The St. Simons \nLighthouse Preservation Act states that the General Services \nAdministration will locate a sufficient federal property of equal value \nto the leased property at St. Simons and deed it to the USPS. In \nexchange, the USPS will terminate its lease.\n  Passage of the St. Simons Lighthouse Preservation Act will ensure \nthat future generations will be able to enjoy the Lighthouse and its \nenvirons. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to ensure quick \npassage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 1568. A bill imposing an immediate suspension of assistance to the \nGovernment of Indonesia until the results of the August 30, 1999, vote \nin East Timor have implemented, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n        suspension of assistance to the government of indonesia\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, to introduce a bill in response to the ongoing violence in \nEast Timor.\n  I am outraged at what is going on in East Timor today. The Indonesian \ngovernment clearly has not lived up to its commitment to maintain \nsecurity following the recent referendum. In fact it is openly \nsupporting the militia violence against the majority of East Timorese, \nwho have made clear their desire for an independent East Timor. If the \nIndonesian government cannot, or will not, maintain peace, I believe an \ninternational peacekeeping mission is the best option. The United \nStates and the rest of the international community must exercise any \nand all leverage it has with the Indonesians to allow for this \ncontingency. In addition, the United States provides a great deal of \neconomic and military assistance to Indonesia. If the Indonesian \ngovernment does not take steps to stop the violence occurring in East \nTimor, we should suspend these benefits.\n  For that reason, I am today introducing a bill which cuts off all \nmilitary and most economic assistance to the government of Indonesia \nuntil the President determines and certifies to the Congress that a \nsafe and secure environment exists in East Timor which will allow the \nEast Timorese who have fled the militia-led violence to return to their \nhomes, allow the United Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor, \nUNAMET, to resume its mandate, and allow the results of the August 30, \n1999, referendum on East Timor's political status to be fully \nimplemented.\n  At long last, on August 30, the people of East Timor went to the \npolls to express their will about the future of their homeland, \nchoosing between a future as an autonomous part of Indonesia, or as an \nindependent nation. The approximately 99 percent voter turnout in the \nface of intimidation from the pro-Jakarta militias is a credit to the \ndedication and courage of the East Timorese people to determine once \nand for all their own political status.\n  Ironically, the day of the ballot was relatively free of violence. \nBut that was the calm before the storm. After the polls closed, the \nmilitias began a rampage throughout the territory that continues today. \nAt least for UNAMET workers have been killed and at least six other are \nmissing. Thousands of East Timorese have fled their homes, which are \nbeing looted and burned at will by the militias.\n  According to some estimates, in the past week alone, several hundred \npeople have been killed, and more than 30,000 have been forced to flee \ntheir homes. Television news reports have shown desperate East Timorese \ncitizens scaling the razor-sharp barbed wire fence surrounding the \nUNAMET mission in order to escape the automatic weapons of the \nadvancing militias. There have been reports of beheadings. Nobel \nLaureate Bishop Carlos Belo and about six thousand East Timorese who \nsought refuge in his home in Dili were forced to flee when his home was \nburned to the ground. Bishop Belo, who has endured years of \nintimidation and countless threats on his life, has since fled to \nAustralia. The United Nations is evacuating many of its workers and \ninternational observers.\n  The result of the ballot, which was announced on September 4, was \noverwhelming--78.5 percent of East Timorese voted for independence. \nThis crushing defeat for the pro-Jakarta militias and their supporters \nsparked even more violence.\n  Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a wave of violence that has \nplagued East Timor for almost a quarter of a century. At this point, I \nwould like to recount some of East Timor's history--the events that \nhave brought the people of that territory to the horrific violence that \nis being unleashed upon them as I speak these words.\n  The East Timorese people have a long history of foreign domination. \nThe Portuguese ruled there for four centuries. In 1975, less than a \nyear after the Portuguese colonial rulers left East Timor, the \nIndonesian army occupied East Timor, and it remains there today. For 24 \nyears, the people of East Timor have been subjugated by the Indonesian \ngovernment and harassed by the Indonesian military.\n  The November 1991 massacre of non-violent demonstrators in the East \nTimorese capital of Dili is but one example of Indonesia's repressive \noccupation of East Timor. Despite the harsh rule of the Suharto \nregime--or maybe in spite of it--the people of East Timor held on to \ntheir hope for self-determination. This dream is personified by people \nsuch as Nobel Peace Prize winners Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos \nBelo, who have worked tirelessly, and at great personal risk, for the \nliberation of the people of East Timor.\n  Following Suharto's resignation in 1998, it appeared that some \npositive changes were on the horizon for the people of East Timor. This \ncomes after January 27, 1999, President B.J. Habibie announced that the \ngovernment of Indonesia was finally willing to learn--and respect--the \nwishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, 1999, the governments \nof Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement to hold a United Nations-\nsupervised ``consultation'' on the future of East Timor.\n  Before the ink was even dry on this agreement, proJakarta militia \ngroups--better described as lawless thugs--began a campaign of terror \nand intimidation against the East Timorese people aimed at quashing the \nindependence movement. And these thugs operated freely while the \nIndonesian military looked the other way, and in some cases, helped \nthem.\n  In the weeks leading up to the historic referendum, the militias \ntargeted supporters of East Timorese independence, and members of the \nUNAMET who were in the territory preparing for the vote.\n  And now, the implementation of the results of this ballot, an effort \nwhich has already been paid for by the blood of more than 200,000 East \nTimorese who have been killed since 1975, is being delayed by more \nviolence from criminals who cannot accept the defeat they received at \nthe polls.\n  Despite his promise to respect the wishes of the East Timorese \npeople, President Habibie has done little to stop the violence. \nYesterday, he imposed martial law in East Timor, but this announcement \nhas not ended the militia rampage, and the Indonesian military has done \nnothing to halt the violence. I am concerned that martial law will only \nembolden the militias.\n  The bill which I am introducing today calls on the Indonesian \ngovernment to foster an environment in which the result of the August \n30 referendum can be fully implemented. And if the Indonesian \ngovernment does not take steps to that end, all U.S. military and most \neconomic assistance to Indonesia will be cut off. Period.\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\n  For too long, the Congress has allowed military and economic \nassistance to be awarded to the government of Indonesia, with few \nconditions, despite its miserable human rights record and its \ndeplorable treatment of the people of East Timor. It is high time that \nthe Indonesian government learns that the U.S. will not tolerate the \nviolent suppression of the legitimate democratic aspiration of the \npeople of East Timor.\n  Earlier this week, President Habibie asked the Indonesian people to \nremain calm in the face of the referendum results. It is past time for \nhim to direct the Indonesian army to stop the militias and to \ndiscipline those army personnel who are in collusion with the militias \nin their rampage through East Timor.\n  It is imperative that President Habibie and his government understand \nthat the United States Congress will not sit idly by while bands of \nthugs continue to loot and burn East Timor, kill innocent civilians, \nand drive people from their homes.\n  President Habibie said earlier this year that he would respect the \nwishes of the people of East Timor. His government also promised the \nWorld Bank that it would live up to its commitments to the United \nNations. It is time he shows that these statements were more than just \npolitical rhetoric. He must stop the violence, and he must allow \ninternational peacekeepers to enter East Timor without the threat of \nattack from militias or members of the Indonesian army.\n  I hope the Senate will act on this important legislation at the \nearliest possible date. We must not allow the Indonesian government to \ncontinue to receive U.S. military and economic assistance so long as it \nis condoning the terror in East Timor.\n  So, Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. Because of the urgency \nof the situation in East Timor, I ask that it be considered as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that the next speaker will be a person \nwho has devoted an incredible energy to this issue; in fact, who \nrecently had the willingness and courage to go to East Timor, Senator \nReed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin. I do so \nbecause of the gravity of the situation and also because of the fact \nthat just 2 weeks ago I had the opportunity to travel, along with \nSenator Harkin of Iowa and Congressman McGovern of Massachusetts, to \nEast Timor.\n  We visited the town of Dili, the capital. Then we went into the \ncountryside. We saw the bravery and courage of people who are willing, \nquite literally, to risk their lives to vote to determine their own \nfuture. We went to a town called Suai, which was a small village in the \nwestern part of East Timor. There we found 2,000 displaced persons \nhuddled in the shadow of a half built Catholic church being protected \nfrom roving bands of militia, basically armed thugs, supported, \nencouraged, and, at times, directed by the Indonesian military \nauthority. They were there not only for protection but also because \nthey wanted to vote. They knew if they went back into the countryside, \nthey might lose their chance to physically be present to vote.\n  As I stood before those thousands of poor people who have been denied \nwater and food by the authorities, who literally were being starved \naway from their right to vote, I told them that the vote is more \npowerful than the army. They believed that. A few days later, with \ngreat courage, they went to the polls, and, in overwhelming numbers, \nthey voted overwhelmingly for independence.\n  That vote now is being undermined systematically and deliberately by \nthe military authority within Indonesia. Regretfully, we have just \nlearned that the priest, Father Hilario, who was providing sanctuary in \nSwai, has been reported to have been killed by those violent militia \nbands.\n  This is an issue that should trouble every person of conscience \nthroughout the world. It should particularly trouble the United States, \nbecause for many years we have maintained a relationship with the \nGovernment of Indonesia in an attempt to provide the kind of support \nthat would allow them to evolve into a democratic country that would \nfulfill its promises.\n  The Government of Indonesia has pretensions of being a great power, \nbut a great power keeps its word. The Government of Indonesia has not \nkept its word. It promised the United Nations that it would provide \nsecurity and protection for the election. It promised it would respect \nthe results of the election. It promised it would protect the lives and \nthe property of the people of East Timor, and it has failed utterly and \nmiserably in doing that.\n  The military of Indonesia has pretensions of being a professional \nmilitary force, but a professional military force always follows \nlegitimate orders of its civilian and military commanders. This army is \nfailing miserably in doing that.\n  There is only one choice. They must either restore order, stability, \nand safety in East Timor, allow people to live freely and safely, \nrespect the results of the election, or cooperate with the introduction \nof international peacekeepers.\n  At the heart of the bill Senator Feingold, myself, and Senator Leahy \nare introducing is a very clear message to the government and the \nmilitary of Indonesia: Unless you restore order immediately or allow \ninternational peacekeepers to enter East Timor, we will cut off all \nmultilateral assistance. We will cut off all bilateral assistance. We \nwill cut off all military cooperation. Essentially, the future \nrelationship of Indonesia with the world community depends \nfundamentally on whether or not they will respect their own agreement \nto provide safety and security for the people of East Timor and respect \nthe results of this election.\n  I hope they do. If there is cooperation, if a United Nations \npeacekeeping force can enter that country, it is fortunate that our \nallies, the Australians and other countries, are ready, willing, and \nable at this moment to send personnel forward in this peacekeeping \nforce. We should be able to assist this force with some of the unique \ncapacities and capabilities we have: intelligence capabilities, \nsatellite observation, air lifts, sea lift. I don't think it is \nnecessary to commit our forces on the ground, but we should be part of \nthis effort to secure the peace and stability and reaffirm the validity \nof this election.\n\n  While we were in East Timor, we had occasion to visit with Bishop \nBelo, the Nobel prize winner. We had supper with him, very humble fare \nfrom a very humble and saintly person. His house has already been \ndestroyed by roving mobs. East Timorese who took sanctuary there have \nbeen scattered and slaughtered. Mercifully, Bishop Belo has been able \nto escape to Australia.\n  These scenes of carnage and mayhem and madness are convulsing East \nTimor. It is the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia to stop \nthe violence or to allow international forces to enter at the soonest \npossible time to stop this violence. As I indicated initially, this \nreferendum was not foisted upon the Government of Indonesia. It was \nagreed to by the Government of Indonesia. They made solemn pledges to \nthe United Nations to respect the results of the vote, to conduct the \nvote fairly without intimidation. Now they must live up to their word \nor allow the United Nations and the world community to see that this \nvote is respected.\n  A final image I have of our time in East Timor is going to a polling \nplace. This was days before the election. We were talking to these very \nbrave international volunteers from many nations who have risked their \nlives, literally, to be in these small towns to take the registration. \nThere was a young man who had come to make sure his name was on the \nrolls so he could vote. We spoke with him. We asked him if he was \nafraid.\n  He said: Yes, very much so, but I will vote. My friends will vote. We \nwant to determine the future of our country. We want to determine the \nfuture of our families and our communities.\n  They did that. We have to respect that courage and that faith in \ndemocracy and the power of the vote. We have to, internationally and \nindividually as a nation, prove that the vote is more powerful than the \narmy.\n  I am pleased and proud to join my colleagues in this resolution. I \nurge its speedy consideration and passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nFeingold on this legislation to prohibit assistance to the Government \nof Indonesia until that nation permits the peaceful implementation of \nthe results of the August 30 referendum, in which the people of East \nTimor overwhelmingly voted in favor of independence from Indonesia. \nThis bill sends a clear and strong message to the Government of \nIndonesia that the United States will hold it responsible for the fate \nof the East Timorese people.\n  Tragically, we are now faced with a crisis of alarming proportions as \na result of the Indonesian government's failure to disarm the militias \nand to guarantee the security of the East Timorese people. The \nmilitias, together with Indonesian military and security personnel, are \ncommitting gross violations of human rights. Hundreds of East Timorese \nhave been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to flee their \nhomes, seeking refuge in West Timor. Hundreds have sought asylum in the \nUN compound in the East Timorese capital of Dili. Bishop Belo's home \nwas burned and he was forced to seek asylum in Australia. UN personnel \nhave been attacked and two were killed. Journalists have been \nthreatened and forced to leave East Timor. The militias and the \nIndonesian military and security personnel perpetrating this violence \nmust be stopped.\n  All of us are deeply concerned over the violence and the likelihood \nof further bloodshed in the coming days. The Indonesian Government must \ntake responsibility for the actions of its military and security \npersonnel. If the Government of Indonesia cannot or will not stop the \nviolence, it must permit the international community to do so. I \nstrongly support the call for an international peacekeeping force, \nauthorized by the United Nations Security Council, to intervene to \nrestore security in East Timor and to implement the results of the \nreferendum.\n  By stopping all U.S. assistance to Indonesia, this legislation will \nencourage the Indonesian government to meet its international \ncommitments and to ensure that its military and security forces abide \nby international law. The United States and the international community \nmust use their economic leverage to encourage the Indonesian government \nto stop the violence in East Timor and permit a peaceful transition to \nindependence. As long as this crisis continues, international financial \ninstitutions must not permit additional resources to flow to the \nIndonesian government--resources which could be used by military and \nsecurity forces to continue the violence. In particular, the \nInternational Monetary Fund should not approve the disbursement of the \nremaining $2 billion of an already-approved $12 billion loan.\n  The Indonesian government must know that these sanctions will remain \nin effect until it ensures the safety of the East Timorese people, \npermits the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor to \nimplement the transition to independence, and ensures that its armed \nforces abide by the principles of international law.\n  The people of East Timor need our help. Despite grave threats, they \ndemonstrated great courage and great faith in the democratic process by \ngoing to the polls and voting overwhelmingly in favor of independence. \nThe Government of Indonesia has an obligation to respect that verdict \nand see that it is implemented peacefully. The international community \nshould do all it can to stop the violence and facilitate the peaceful \ntransition to independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1569. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \nsegments of the Taunton River in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for \nstudy for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n         TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Taunton \nRiver Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 1999. The bill directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to study the Taunton River in Massachusetts \nfor potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems. \nThe Taunton River is ecologically and historically significant, and \nthis legislation is supported by local officials and residents. Senator \nKennedy is joining this bill as an original cosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1570. A bill to amend the National School Lunch Act and the Child \nNutrition Act of 1966 to promote identification of children eligible \nfor benefits under, and enrollment of children in, the medicaid and \nState Children's Health Insurance programs; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     S-CHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Access to \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Act. Joining me in this effort is \nmy colleague from Indiana in the other body, Representative Julia \nCarson.\n  Congress created the S-CHIP program in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 as a new federal-state partnership to expand health insurance \ncoverage for low-income children not eligible for Medicaid. Under S-\nCHIP states may cover children in families up to 200 percent of the \nfederal poverty level or, in states with Medicaid income levels for \nchildren already at or above 200 percent of poverty, within 50 percent \nover the state's current Medicaid income eligibility limit. Congress \nprovided over $4 billion annually to match state expenditures for this \nprogram.\n  Implementation of the S-CHIP program has been slow. States have faced \nboth normal start-up problems as well as other obstacles to identifying \nand enrolling eligible children. There are an estimated 11 million \nchildren who are uninsured with 7.5 million who could be eligible for \nthe S-CHIP program. Congress envisioned that 5 million children would \nreceive services under S-CHIP. As of July 1999, according to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, only 1.3 million children were enrolled on S-CHIP, \nless than half the projected enrollment in 1999.\n  The federal child nutrition programs of school lunch, child care \nfeeding and WIC are important sources of information on potentially \neligible children as well as a contact point with their parents. \nTypically these programs collect income information that can be used to \nidentify eligible children, and even enroll children into federal \nhealth insurance programs. However there are limits on the disclosure \nof school lunch data. While state and local health programs and other \nmeans-tested nutrition programs may receive this data, Medicaid and S-\nCHIP may not.\n  Our bill will expand disclosure, subject to privacy provisions, to \nthe state health agency running Medicaid and S-CHIP. As an added \nprotection, both the State and local education authority must agree to \nthis new disclosure.\n  The bill will also expand on a demonstration basis the use of WIC \nadministrative funds. With the new authority, WIC clinics will be able \nto take a more active role in the identification and enrollment of \nchildren onto the S-CHIP and Medicaid programs. However, since funding \nfor WIC is discretionary and funds for required program activities are \ntight, the number of sites will be limited. The General Accounting \nOffice will be required to determine the added cost of the program.\n  Finally the bill will fund demonstration grants to states. The \ndemonstration projects will integrate nutrition program grantees \n(schools, child care centers and WIC clinics) and other social service \nprograms with the federal health care programs for low income children. \nStates will form comprehensive informational and enrollment projects to \nbe eligible for the funding.\n  Mr. President, this bill removes bureaucratic barriers so that more \npoor children may receive the health care they need. It does this by \nallowing one government entity to share information it possesses with \nanother government entity responsible for health care. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRANSMITTAL OF RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send a concurrent resolution \nestablishing U.S. goals for the next round of global negotiations in \nthe World Trade Organization to the desk.\n  In 1994, seven hard years of talks culminated the Uruguay Round \nAgreement creating the WTO. The United States can point with pride to \nthe results of American leadership on trade. Among the agreement's \nnotable results were beginning new countries into the rule-based trade \nregime; establishing an institution for ongoing trade talks and dispute \nresolution; and addressing some key issues for the first time.\n  The 1994 WTO agreement left unfinished business in two of these key \nissues: agriculture and services. WTO members committed to return to \nthe table in January 2000 to address barriers in these sectors, the so-\ncalled ``built-in agenda.'' It will be a major challenge. Trade-\ndistorting domestic agricultural programs are politically sensitive, \nespecially in the European Union, the world's biggest offender in this \narea. In services, efforts to open up trade run into difficult \nquestions of domestic regulation and investment.\n  Over the past several months, Mr. President, WTO members have \nsubmitted proposals for dealing with agriculture, services, and many \nother issues in a new global round of negotiations, to be launched in \nSeattle this November when the United States hosts the third WTO \nMinisterial Meeting. I have read some of these proposals, including the \nproposals submitted by the Administration, and I have compared them two \nwhat I hear from various groups around the country.\n  I have concluded that the U.S. proposals are timid and lack \nspecificity. I am very concerned about this. We can't build a strong \nglobal economy without a strong set of trade rules. We can't address \nemerging issues such as biotechnology and electronic commerce, areas \nwhere the United States has a commanding lead, unless we supply a \nconcrete vision of the future. We won't reach our goals unless we can \nstate our goals clearly. We need a clear set of goals for this round of \ntrade talks. The American people expect us to show leadership in this \narea. Our trading partners expect America to show leadership, too.\n  We in the Congress have a constitutional responsibility in this \nregard. The resolution I am submitting today fulfills our obligation by \ngiving the Executive Branch specific goals for the upcoming round of \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. President, I would like to summarize briefly the main points of \nthis resolution. It deals not only with agriculture and services, but \nalso with manufactured products, institutional concerns, and a variety \nof other trade-related issues.\n\n\n                              agriculture\n\n  America's farmers compete very effectively when world markets are not \ndistorted by government intervention. Eliminating these distortions is \nnot only good for the farm community, it will benefit U.S. consumers \nand our trading partners. It will stimulate demand for agricultural \noutput, demand which American farmers are prepared to satisfy. My \nresolution instructs the Administration to seek elimination of export \nsubsidies and trade-distorting domestic subsidies, to seek substantial \ntariff reductions, and for the first time to impose discipline on State \nTrading Enterprises.\n\n\n                                Services\n\n  Services comprise almost three quarters of American output. We are a \nnet exporter of services, so increased trade in services will have a \npositive effect on our current account balance. My resolution instructs \nthe Administration to reach a global agreement that trade in services \nis free and open unless otherwise specified. The current system is that \ntrade in services is closed unless otherwise specified. Starting from \nthis principal of openness, the Administration should seek board \nparticipation in an agreement on services trade.,\n\n\n                            Industrial Goods\n\n  To establish a negotiating dynamic broad enough to allow for trade-\noffs, it is vital that the WTO talks include manufactured products. In \nthis regard, there has been some confusion as to the U.S. strategy. The \nwork begun in APEC to cut tarffs in nine sectors has moved into the \nWTO. The agriculture community feared that an early agreement to cut \ntariffs on manufactured products would rob the overall negotiation of \nthe required breadth of issues. My resolution makes clear that this \nnegotiation should be viewed as a single undertaking to be completed in \nthree years. This does not mean that we can have no results on tariffs \nat the Senate WTO Ministerial. But completing accelerated tariff \nelimination should be contingent on successfully concluding the entire \npackage, including agriculture and services.\n\n\n                          Institutional Issues\n\n  We now have almost five years of experience with the operation of the \nUruguay Round agreement and the WTO. That experience has uncovered some \nareas for improvement. Chief among these is the need for greater \ntransparency in WTO operations. In the state of Montana, we have a \nstrong tradition of open government which serves us well. The WTO is a \ngovernmental body. The citizens of the nations which compose the WTO \nhave a right to know what it is doing. We also need to speed up the WTO \nsystem for resolving trade disputes.\n\n\n                       Issues Not for Negotiating\n\n  There are several issues which the Administration should not include \nin the overall negotiation. In some cases, including them would most \nlikely weaken the results we obtained in the Uruguay Round. In other \ncase, I do not believe that a global negotiation would benefit the \nUnited States. Issues such as textiles and apparel, antidumping rules, \ncompetition policy, and investment should not be part of the next round \nof negotiations.\n\n\n               Other Trade Issues: Environment and Labor\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, my resolution lists a number of specific \ntrade issues which the Administration should address in the next round \nof trade negotiations. These include questions such as government \nprocurement and electronic commerce. Let me mention two particular \nmatters which are especially important: the environment and labor.\n  My resolution instructs the Administration to make specific progress \nin both of these areas. On the environment, it requires an \nenvironmental assessment of any new global trade agreement, and a WTO \nconsensus on determining when multilateral environmental agreements are \nconsistent with international trade rules. It also requires tariff \nreductions on environmental products in order to increase the flow of \nenvironmental technology.\n\n  As to labor, my resolution requires the Administration to correct a \ndeficiency which has existed in trade law since the United States \nsigned the GATT in 1947: it does not allow countries to treat products \nmade with forced labor or child labor differently. We should all have \nthe right to prohibit such goods from entering our countries. It also \ncalls for joint research between the WTO and the International Labor \nOrganization, and for a regular examination of how WTO members are \nliving up to their 1996 commitment on core labor standards. Rhetoric is \nnot a substitute for action.\n\n\n                     Goal: Improve Quality of Life\n\n  Let me close, Mr. President, with a word about why this is important \nto all of us. Since the end of World War Two, we have come a long way \nin shaping the world economy. When the GATT was signed in 1947, the \nworld was engaged in a bitter debate over fundamental values. The \ncentral question was whether national economies should be organized by \nmarket forces and open societies or by central government planners. \nWhich is better: democracy or communism? The world now knows the answer \nto this question with absolutely no ambiguity. Today, anyone who thinks \nthat central planning wins over market forces need only compare Seoul \nto Pyongyang.\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\n  In the past decade, the former Soviet bloc national have struggled to \nturn from central planning to market forces and citizen participation. \nDeveloping countries abandoned bankrupt nations like ``import \nsubstitution'' in favor of market-based solutions. OECD countries \nderegulated and dismantled trade barriers. New technology, especially \ninformation technology, provided the means to take advantage of newly \nopened markets. Goods and capital move with amazing speed.\n  Open markets make the global economy more efficient. But there's a \ndistinction between efficiency and equity. Open markets do not make \nprosperity more fair. Many citizens believe it is not fair enough. They \nsee widening income gaps, job insecurity, environmental damage, a less \ncertain future.\n  The next round of global trade talks can't make opening markets an \nend in itself. We no longer have to convince the world that our \neconomic system is more efficient. The task now is to show that our \nsystem also improves the quality of their lives. We need to show that \nour system delivers benefits to them. It has to make them better off. \nIf we fail to do that, we will face a world polarized by poverty as it \nwas once polarized by cold war ideology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10621-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 179--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 15, 1999, AS ``NATIONAL \n                           MAMMOGRAPHY DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 179\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 1999, \n     175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,300 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about 2,000,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives;\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     up to 2 years or more before a regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination, reducing mortality by \n     more than 30 percent; and\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast \n     cancer is currently 97 percent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 15, 1999, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 15, 1999, as ``National Mammography Day''. I have \nsubmitted a similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each \noccasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight against breast \ncancer by approving it.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I look at the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. This year, the news is depressingly familiar: in 1999, an \nestimated 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an \nestimated 43,300 women will die of this disease.\n  In the midst of these gloomy numbers, however, one statistic stands \nout like a beacon of hope: the 5-year survival rate for women with \nlocalized breast cancer is a whopping 97%. Moreover, we already know \none sure-fire method for detecting breast cancer when it is at this \nearly, highly curable stage: periodic mammograms for all women over age \n40. Periodic mammography can detect a breast cancer almost 2 years \nearlier than it would have been detected by breast self-examination. \nThe importance of periodic mammography for women's health is recognized \nby health plans and health insurers, and virtually all of them cover \nits cost. Low-income women who do not have health insurance can get \nfree mammograms through a breast cancer screening program sponsored by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Given all this, that modern mammography is highly effective in \ndiscovering breast cancer at a very early stage, rarely causes any \ndiscomfort, and generally cost nothing, why aren't all women over 40 \ngetting this valuable test every year? One answer is that we are human, \nand we all forget things, especially as we get older. Even if we \nremember that we need a mammogram, we often have so many things going \non in our lives that we just keep putting the mammogram off for that \n``less busy'' day that never comes. Consequently, we need a ``National \nMammography Day'' to remind us that we need to make sure all the women \nin our lives don't overlook this crucial preventive service.\n  How should we use ``National Mammography Day'' to achieve our goal of \nfighting breast cancer through early diagnosis? This year, National \nMammography Day falls on Friday, October 15, right in the middle of \nNational Breast Cancer Awareness month. On that day, let's make sure \nthat each women we know picks a specific date on which to get a \nmammogram each year. I well understand how easy it is to forget do \nsomething that comes around only once per year, but for each of us \nthere are certainly some dates that we don't forget: a child's \nbirthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day our taxes are due. On \nNational Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these \ndates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, your \nwedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a \nmammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the \nothers that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight \nagainst breast cancer by cosponsoring this resolution to designate \nOctober 15, 1999, as National Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10621-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 1621\n\n  Mr. BOND (for Mr. Lott) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2466) \nmaking appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related \nagencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 62, line 10, add the following before the period \n     ``: Provided, That within the funds available, $250,000 shall \n     be used to assess the potential hydrologic and biological \n     impact of lead and zinc mining in the Mark Twain National \n     Forest of Southern Missouri: Provided further, That none of \n     the funds in this Act may be used by the Secretary of the \n     Interior to issue a prospecting permit for hardrock mineral \n     exploration on Mark Twain National Forest land in the Current \n     River/Jack's Fork River--Eleven Point Watershed (not \n     including Mark Twain National Forest land in Townships 31N \n     and 32N, Range 2 and Range 3 West, on which mining activities \n     are taking place as of the date of enactment of this Act); \n     Provided further, That none of the funds in this Act may be \n     used by the Secretary of the Interior to segregate or \n     withdraw land in the Mark Twain National Forest, Missouri \n     under section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714)''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10621-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10621-S10623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VETERANS COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              ROCKEFELLER (AND SPECTER) AMENDMENT NO. 1622\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for Mr. Rockefeller (for himself and Mr. Specter)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1076) to amend title 38, United \nStates Code, to provide a cost-of-living adjustment in rates of \ncompensation paid to veterans with service-connected disabilities, to \nenhance programs providing health care, education, and other benefits \nfor veterans, to authorize major medical facility projects, to reform \neligibility for burial in Arlington National Cemetery, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 66, strike lines 9 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. Smart served in the United States Army from October 1970 \nto April 1973, in Vietnam, where he was assigned to the 176th Assault \nHelicopter Company (American Division) at Chu Lai. His meritorious \nservice was recognized with the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, a \nVietnam Service Medal with four stars and a Presidential Unit Citation.\n  While serving in Vietnam, he joined VFW Post #2181 in Exeter, New \nHampshire. Following his return from military service in 1973, he moved \nquickly through the VFW Department of New Hampshire chairs and earned \nrecognition as an All-American Department Commander during the 1981-82 \nyear. In 1983 he served as Chairman of the National Youth Activities \nCommittee and from 1991-1993 as Chairman of the National Buddy Poppy \nCommittee. In 1995 he was appointed to the position of National Chief \nof Staff.\n  Mr. Smart served his community of Nashua as a firefighter, retiring \nafter 21 years.

I can think of no New Hampshire citizen more \ndedicated to his country and to the cause of assisting his fellow \nveterans. His wife, Mary, his two children, John R. and Cheryl, and his \nfive grandchildren have reason for great pride in this husband, father \nand grandfather who has so ably contributed his time and efforts toward \nthe service of others. I have been honored to work with John Smart over \nmy years here in the Senate, while serving as Governor in New Hampshire \nand earlier in the House of Representatives.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nMr. Bill Mullen, who has been chosen as the 1999 Grand Marshal of the \nEssex-West Hudson Labor Council AFL-CIO Labor Day March and Observance. \nThe Labor Council is proud to honor Bill for his lifetime dedication to \nworking families in the New Jersey Labor Movement, and especially \nIronworkers Local 11. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his \naccomplishments.\n  Bill Mullen served in the United States Army during 1967 and 1968, \nand was stationed in Korea. He was later discharged with the rank of \nSergeant. Returning to New Jersey, Bill completed his apprenticeship, \nand worked as an Ironworker, Shop Steward, Journeyman, Foreman, and \nSuperintendent for various construction companies throughout the state.\n  For over thirty years Bill has been an active member in the labor \nmovement. In 1981, Bill was elected by his fellow colleagues to be the \nVice President of Ironworkers Local 11, and later became President in \n1989. He has also served as Trustee of the Ironworkers of Northern New \nJersey District Council Pension Fund and an active member of the New \nJersey Alliance for Action.

Mr. President, this year marks the 250th \nanniversary of York County, Pennsylvania. Today, I rise to recognize \nthe establishment and storied history of this county which contributed \ngreatly to the founding of our Nation.\n  Established in 1749, York had formerly been a part of neighboring \nLancaster County. The citizens of York had petitioned for their own \ncounty so that they could establish a courthouse in closer proximity to \ntheir jail. With the granting of the petition, York became the first \ncounty in Pennsylvania west of the Susquehanna River and the fifth \ncounty in Pennsylvania overall. Since that time, the county has \ndeveloped rich and dynamic civic, social, political and economic \ninstitutions, including both durable agricultural and industrial bases, \nand serves as a model for communities across the Commonwealth and the \nNation.\n  Mr. President, from September 1777 through June 1778, York served as \nthe capital of our Nation. As British General Howe's army occupied \nPhiladelphia, our early government, the Continental Congress, was first \nmoved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After one day, the Continental \nCongress sought to place further distance between it and the British, \nso it crossed the Susquehanna river at Wrights' Ferry and resumed \nsession in the Colonial Courthouse in Center Square, York.\n  Mr. President, it was during the time that the York hosted our \nnation's government that the Marquis de Lafayette made the famous \n``toast that saved the nation.'' With this toast, Lafayette proclaimed \nhis continued support for, and espoused the attributes of, General \nWashington at a time when certain factions were calling for the General \nto be replaced. This toast has been credited as saving George \nWashington's position as our first Commander in Chief. It was also \nduring the time that the Continental Congress convened in York that it \nadopted the Articles of Confederation. This important document was the \nprecursor to the Constitution and marked the first use of the term \n``United States of America.''\n  Mr. President, the people of York County are proud of their history \nand their traditions. I am proud to join York in this celebration and \nask my colleagues to join me in congratulating York on its 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10624-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10624-S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL PATRICK M. HUGHES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of Senators the retirement of Lieutenant General Patrick M. \nHughes of the United States Army. A native of Great Falls Montana, I am \nproud that one of our native sons has made such a vital contribution to \nthe defense of this great country, through a military career spanning \nnearly 40 years.\n  The recipient of many military awards and honors, including the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart \nand the Bronze Star, General Hughes has been a valuable friend to me \nand the people he has served in his distinguished career.\n  Although we have come to expect people of high caliber and dedication \nin our armed forces, General Hughes's service has been exceptional. \nMost recently assigned as the Director for Intelligence, J2, the Joint \nStaff, General Hughes began his military career in 1962. Following \ncompletion of his enlistment in 1965, he attended Montana State \nUniversity, where he graduated in 1968. He was then commissioned in the \nU.S. Army infantry, and served two tours in Vietnam. He commanded \nseveral military intelligence (MI) detachments, an MI battalion, an MI \nbrigade and the Army Intelligence Agency. He also served in senior \nstaff positions, including a tour as the J2 of the U.S. Central \nCommand.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, General Hughes's tireless and \nsincere\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\ndedication to the men and women in uniform has vastly improved their \nquality of life and mission readiness. As he retires from the United \nStates Army, he will leave behind a tremendous legacy.\n  Mr. President, General Hughes is a great credit to the Army and the \nNation. I salute him for his many years of selfless service to our \ncountry, and offer my gratitude to him, his wife Karlene and their \nsons, Barry and Chad, on the occasion of his retirement from the United \nStates Army. I know I speak for the people of my state when I say that \nI am proud of General Hughes; I know that I speak for all Americans \nwhen I say that he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10625-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO BOB FERRELL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize a great patriot from my wonderful State of \nWest Virginia, Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Ferrell. Bob retired from the U.S. \nAir Force with more than 21 years of active duty service. He bravely \nserved his country during the Vietnam conflict on the C-130 Spectre \nGunship as a gunner and instructor gunner. Over the course of many \nyears of service, the Air Force honored Bob with numerous prestigious \nawards, including the coveted Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  After completing his tour in Vietnam, Bob returned to his lifelong \nhome of Logan County, and began the hard work of a coal miner to \nsupport his family. Bob was an exemplary citizen and participated in \nmany community activities. He was a lifetime member of the American \nLegion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. After retiring from the mines \nin the mid 1980's, Bob traveled all over our State seeking the \nopportunity to speak to our school children about the importance of \nservice to our country and to our state.\n  A devoted husband and father, Bob raised four wonderful and \nproductive children, two boys and two girls. The example he set for his \nsons resulted in both of them following in his footsteps and enlisting \nin the armed forces. The eldest, Mike, is serving in the 101st Airborne \ndivision of Fort Campbell, KY, and Steve is a full-time member of the \nWest Virginia Army National Guard. His daughters also are respected \nmembers of their communities. The oldest, LaRue, is a chiropractor, and \nher younger sister, Anitra, is a loving mother and housewife.\n  Bob passed away in May of this year, and was buried, so \nappropriately, on the day which commemorates the lives of all those who \nsacrificed so much for our nation, Memorial Day. Mr. President, as you \nknow, I am the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, and I take great pride in recognizing this wonderful and \npatriotic man from my state of West Virginia. Bob was one of more than \n200,000 veterans from my home State, and represents the millions of \nAmericans who served our country with pride and distinction. One of the \nbest ways we can honor Bob's memory is to work diligently to ensure \nthat the promises made by our government to all veterans are kept.\n  I would like to close by saying--thank you, Bob. Your outstanding \nattitude and unselfish lifestyle are an inspiration to the people of \nour State. You attained the goal all men strive for, in that, you left \nthe world a better place for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10625-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLCHESTER LIONS CLUB\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I proudly join my colleagues as a \nfounding member of this newly created Senate Wilderness and Public \nLands Caucus. I congratulate my friend, Senator Feingold, for his bold \nspirit and commitment to the active protection of our public lands. I \naccepted Senator Feingold's invitation to participate in this new \nCaucus because we share a responsibility to protect the natural \nresources that sustain our world and grace the quality of our lives.\n  On this day, we commemorate the success of the 1964 Wilderness Act \nwith a renewed commitment to responsible preservation. More than 35 \nyears since the Act's passage, Americans can more readily cherish and \nenjoy pristine lands in their natural state, unencumbered by growth and \ndevelopment. An important goal of this new Caucus is the desire to \nimprove our process for making important land management decisions \nimpacting our public lands.\n  Developing consensus policy for public lands protection is of \nparticular necessity and importance for western states. In Arizona, \nmore than 80 percent of lands are held in public ownership, with 4.5 \nmillion acres designated as wilderness. Arizonans enjoy wilderness in \nsuch places as the Superstition Mountains, Cabeza Prieta, Baboquivari \nPeak and the Red Rock Secret Mountain.\n  Many more difficult land management decisions will require our \nthoughtful consideration. For example, the state of Arizona has \ngrappled for more than ten years over the question of wilderness \nsuitability for the state's largest national park, the Grand Canyon \nNational Park. Arizonans are still engaged in deliberations of this \nimportant decision, as well as determining appropriate land management \ndecisions for other areas in our state.\n  Each of us is well aware that public land management is divisive and, \nif not\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\ncarefully developed, can usually result in unfair games of give-and-\ntake between land-users and conservationists. A fine balance between \ncompeting users has proved to be possible, and it is this balance \ntoward which we must strive. I am joining with my colleagues in this \nCaucus because I believe that any decisions we make in the Congress for \npublic land policy should heed the spirit of bipartisanship, promote \nthe ethics of stewardship and multiple use, and protect individual \nrights. In general, we must ensure that all viewpoints on land-use \nissues are given fair opportunity to be heard.\n  We should find our inspiration in the example of a hero of mine, and \na statesman of the highest virtue, Mo Udall, whose grace and wisdom \nshould inspire every American. Mo once taught a freshman Congressman \nfrom the other side of the aisle a valuable lesson. He reached across \nparty lines to enlist me in the effort to tackle environmental problems \nin our home state.\n  Mo's faith in the pursuit of cooperation and consensus enabled us to \nenact landmark legislation placing 3.5 million acres of pristine \nArizona lands into the Wilderness Preservation System. Contrary to the \npredictions of naysayers and competing political interests, Mo Udall \nbrought the Arizona congressional delegation together with broad \nsupport from the public. This was no simple task, but it worked, and Mo \nUdall demonstrated to his colleagues and constituents a successful \nformula for bringing together people of good faith and different \nperspectives to achieve a common purpose.\n  This new Caucus gives us an opportunity to uphold our commitment to \nresponsible preservation while protecting the rights of all Americans \nfor public use of lands. I encourage our colleagues, of all minds on \nthis issue, to join in the Caucus so that our recommendations and \ndiscussions can be fully representative of all interested \nparties.\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great \npride in becoming a founding member of the newly-formed Senate \nWilderness and Public Lands Caucus. The protection of public lands is \ncritical to the preservation of our national heritage, the protection \nof our environmental health and the endurance of the American tradition \nof respect for natural resources.\n  In September of 1964, the Wilderness Protection Act was passed. It \nwas a landmark in public land protection, establishing that some lands \nmanaged by the federal government should be preserved as wilderness for \nthe benefit of all Americans. My father was among the Senators who \nworked to pass that legislation.\n  Today, wilderness areas are under even greater pressure from \nincreasing development and expansion. As Governor of Indiana, I worked \nto protect state lands by establishing the Indiana Heritage Trust, \nwhich preserved sensitive areas with the proceeds from sales of \nenvironmental license plates. That initiative resulted in the \nprotection of more than 5000 acres of threatened lands.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in the Senate in starting the \nWilderness and Public Lands Caucus and carrying forward the tradition \nof stewardship of federal lands reflected in the Wilderness Act of \n1964. I would like to thank Senator Feingold in particular for his \nleadership and dedication to this issue.\n  We have the obligation and the opportunity to protect the natural \nheritage that belongs to all Americans. The Wilderness and Public Lands \nCaucus will be an important asset in pursuing that goal by providing \nsupport and education regarding federal land management and wilderness \nareas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10626-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10626-S10627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR POISON PREVENTION AND FUNDING OF REGIONAL \n                         POISON CENTERS--S. 632\n\n  On August 5, 1999, the Senate passed S. 632, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Control Center \n     Enhancement and Awareness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year more than 2,000,000 poisonings are reported \n     to poison control centers throughout the United States. More \n     than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in the home. 53 \n     percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 \n     years of age.\n       (2) Poison control centers are a valuable national resource \n     that provide life-saving and cost-effective public health \n     services. For every dollar spent on poison control centers, \n     $7 in medical costs are saved. The average cost of a \n     poisoning exposure call is $32, while the average cost if \n     other parts of the medical system are involved is $932. Over \n     the last 2 decades, the instability and lack of funding has \n     resulted in a steady decline in the number of poison control \n     centers in the United States. Within just the last year, 2 \n     poison control centers have been forced to close because of \n     funding problems. A third poison control center is scheduled \n     to close in April 1999. Currently, there are 73 such centers.\n       (3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will increase the \n     number of United States residents who have access to a \n     certified poison control center, and reduce the inappropriate \n     use of emergency medical services and other more costly \n     health care services.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The designation shall \n     apply to both wireline and wireless telephone service. In \n     making the designation, the Commission (and any such agency \n     or entity) shall provide appropriate transition periods for \n     areas in which 9-1-1 is not in use as an emergency telephone \n     number on the date of enactment of the Wireless \n     Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999.''.\n       (b) Support.--The Federal Communications Commission shall \n     encourage and support efforts by States to deploy \n     comprehensive end-to-end emergency communications \n     infrastructure and programs, based on coordinated statewide \n     plans, including seamless, ubiquitous, reliable wireless \n     telecommunications networks and enhanced wireless 9-1-1 \n     service.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nomination on the executive calendar: No. 176, the nomination \nof Judge Carlos Murguia to be U.S. district judge for the district of \nKansas.\n  I take this opportunity to inform my fellow Members a little bit \nabout Judge Murguia. I went to school with Judge Murguia. I am \ndelighted to see him join the bench in Kansas. I want to speak today \nfor a few minutes and tell my colleagues about Judge Murguia, whose \nnomination to the Federal Judiciary I understand will be agreed to \nbefore the close of business today.\n  The Federal Judiciary is a truly high honor and responsibility. Those \nnominated to serve must be men and women of the highest professional \nand personal qualifications. I am privileged and pleased today to \ncommend to the Senate Judge Carlos Murguia of Kansas City, KS. A native \nof Kansas City, Carlos Murguia is part of a remarkable family. Every \none of his four siblings have earned a law degree from the University \nof Kansas. One sister works as deputy director of legislative affairs \nat the White House. Another sister is an assistant U.S. attorney in \nArizona.\n  Judge Murguia has served as a Wyandotte County District judge since \nSeptember of 1990. He is a graduate of the University of Kansas School \nof Journalism and a graduate of my alma mater, the University of Kansas \nSchool of Law.\n  Judge Murguia took an unusual career path upon graduating from that \ninstitution of legal scholarship that has turned out so many \noutstanding attorneys. He chose to use his newly minted legal skills to \nhelp others in a generally lower-income area of Kansas city. He chose \nto help others in this area who ordinarily would not have access to \nlegal representation in situations others often take for granted.\n\n  Judge Murguia took his first step into the Judiciary while still in \nprivate practice, serving first as a part-time small claims judge for \nthe Wyandotte County district court. Later in 1990, Kansas Republican \nGovernor Mike Hayden appointed Mr. Murguia Wyandotte County District \nJudge, filling the reminder of a term of a judge who died in office. He \nwas elected to his own 4-year terms in both 1992 and 1996. Judge \nMurguia served Wyandotte County with distinction in this office for 10 \nyears.\n  Madam President, I am confident that Judge Murguia will bring to the \nFederal bench the skills and knowledge of an outstanding jurist of \npersonal integrity and with the dedication of a man who took his law \ndegree to help his fellow citizens.\n  On a personal note, when you see the demeanor of Judge Murguia and \nyou are around his presence, you recognize and see the beauty of this \nperson, the beauty of his soul, the beauty of the smile that goes on \nhis face when he sees justice being done for others. And that smile \nmourns when he sees anyone treated unjustly. He lives in his heart for \njustice. I think he is probably one of the best embodiments of that \nfrequently cited passage in Micah that reads, ``what does the Lord \nrequire of you but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly \nwith thy God''.\n  Judge Murguia fulfills that passage in Micah. For all these reasons, \nI am especially pleased to wholeheartedly commend to the Senate Judge \nCarlos Murguia nomination to the Federal district court.\n  Madam President, in that vein, I further ask unanimous consent that \nthis nomination of Judge Murguia be confirmed, the motion to consider \nbe laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nomination be \nprinted in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       Carlos Murguia, of Kansas, to be United States District \n     Judge for the District of Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/08/senate-section/article/S10636-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaties transmitted to the Senate on September 8, 1999, by \nthe President of the United States: International Convention for the \nExpression of Terrorist Bombings (Treaty Document No. 106-6); and \nTreaty with Dominican Republic for Return of Stolen or Embezzled \nVehicles, with Annexes, (Treaty Document No. 106-7).\n  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time, they be referred with accompanying papers to the Committee \non Foreign Relations, and the President's messages be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the International Convention for the \nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly on December 15, 1997, and signed on behalf of the \nUnited States of America on\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nJanuary 12, 1998. The report of the Department of State with respect to \nthe Convention is also transmitted for the information of the Senate.\n  In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented and intolerable \nincrease in acts of terrorism involving bombings in public places in \nvarious parts of the world. The United States initiated the negotiation \nof this convention in the aftermath of the June 1996 bombing attack on \nU.S. military personnel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in which 17 U.S. Air \nForce personnel were killed as the result of a truck bombing. That \nattack followed other terrorist attacks including poison gas attacks in \nTokyo's subways; bombing attacks by HAMAS in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem; \nand a bombing attack by the IRA in Manchester, England. Last year's \nterrorist attacks upon United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es \nSalaam are recent examples of such bombings, and no country or region \nis exempt from the human tragedy and immense costs that result from \nsuch criminal acts. Although the penal codes of most states contain \nprovisions proscribing these kinds of attacks, this Convention \nprovides, for the first time, an international framework for \ncooperation among states directed toward prevention of such incidents \nand ensuing punishment of offenders, wherever found.\n  In essence, the Convention imposes binding legal obligations upon \nStates Parties either to submit for prosecution or to extradite any \nperson within their jurisdiction who commits an offense as defined in \nArticle 2, attempts to commit such an act, participates as an \naccomplice, organizes or directs others to commit such an offense, or \nin any other way contributes to the commission of an offense by a group \nof persons acting with a common purpose. A State Party is subject to \nthese obligations without regard to the place where the alleged act \ncovered by Article 2 took place.\n  Article 2 of the Convention declares that any person commits an \noffense within the meaning of the Convention if that person unlawfully \nand intentionally delivers, places, discharges or detonates an \nexplosive or other lethal device in, into or against a place of public \nuse, a state or government facility, a public transportation system, or \nan infrastructure facility, with the intent (a) to cause death or \nserious bodily injury or (b) cause extensive destruction of such a \nplace, facility or system, where such destruction results in or is \nlikely to result in major economic loss. States Parties to the \nConvention will also be obligated to provide one another legal \nassistance in investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings \nbrought in respect of the offenses set forth in Article 2.\n  The recommended legislation necessary to implement the Convention \nwill be submitted to the Congress separately.\n  This Convention is a vitally important new element in the campaign \nagainst the scourge of international terrorism. I hope that all states \nwill become Parties to this Convention, and that it will be applied \nuniversally. I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and \nfavorable consideration to this Convention, subject to the \nunderstandings and reservation that are described in the accompanying \nState Department report.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 8, 1999.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of the Dominican \nRepublic for the Return of Stolen or Embezzled Vehicles, with Annexes, \nsigned at Santo Domingo on April 30, 1996. I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicles treaties being \nnegotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties \nfaced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported \nacross international borders. When it enters into force, it will be an \neffective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles that have been \nstolen or embezzled and taken to the Dominican Republic.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty, with Annexes, and give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                  William J.

It would enhance VA's ability to provide long \nterm care services to\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\naging veterans, and housing, training and other services to homeless \nveterans. It would extend VA programs to provide outreach and medical \nmonitoring services to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families. It \nwould improve and expand VA's authority to enter into ``enhanced use \nleases''--leases which permit VA to more effectively manage its large \nand costly infrastructure--and it would authorize needed construction \nprojects. Further, S. 1076 would improve benefits provided to \ninstitutionalized veterans, to the survivors of former prisoners of \nwar, and to certain Filipino veterans. Finally, it would clarify and \ncodify standards governing burial in Arlington National Cemetery and \nprovide statutory authority needed to permit the timely construction in \nWashington of a World War II Memorial.\n  One matter that has not yet been resolved prior to the reporting of \nthis bill--how proposed pilot programs to provide long term care and \nassisted living services to veterans ought to be structured--merits \nexplanation now. The Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, and I have now resolved that matter and our agreement is \nreflected in an amendment to the bill that we offer jointly today. As \namended, S. 1076 would instruct VA to initiate pilot programs to \nprovide veterans long term care and assisted living services.\n  The long term care pilot programs mandated by this legislation would \nrequire that VA--without interrupting current services--provide and \nreport on long term care services offered in separate VA ``designated \nhealth care regions'' (Veterans Integrated Service Networks or \n``VISNs'' under VA's current organizational structure) using three \nmodels: an ``in house'' model; a community-based cooperative model; and \na model representing a hybrid of the VA-staffed and community-based \napproaches. We hope to demonstrate that VA can offer the Nation a \nmeaningful methodology for managing comprehensive care to an aging \nclientele, and identify the model or models by which such care can be \nprovided most cost-effectively.\n  The second pilot program mandated by this legislation would direct VA \nto develop an appropriate model for furnishing assisted living services \nto veterans, as recommended by the Federal Advisory Committee on Long \nTerm Care. This pilot program would empower VA to provide services to \naged and disabled veterans in their homes or in other residential \nsettings to assist them with their activities of daily living--and to \nassist them in avoiding or deferring more costly hospital or nursing \nhome care. The Ranking Member and I hope to thrust VA into the \nforefront of this growing and challenging field of health care and \nfoster the development of new and cost-effective solutions to \nchallenges which all aging Americans face.\n  I urge the immediate passage of this bill as amended. And I thank the \nSenate for its attention to the needs of the Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to support this \ncomprehensive bill, which would make valuable changes to a wide range \nof veterans' benefits and services.\n  The bill we consider today, S. 1076, the Veterans Benefits Act of \n1999, addresses many initiatives--from ensuring that the surviving \nspouses of ex-POW's will be provided for compensated to furnishing job \ntraining to homeless veterans. I will mention here only a few of the \nissues which are of particular interest to me.\n  The first is long-term care for veterans.\n  S. 1076, as amended, represents a comprehensive effort to address the \nlong-term care needs of our veterans. Title I includes provisions based \non the ``Veterans' Long-Term Care Enhancement Act of 1999,'' which I \nintroduced earlier in the session. In my view, we must take a first \nstep to reach out to veterans who presently need long-term care \nservices, or will in the future. I am glad that we have done so.\n  At the outset, I want to say that my wish would be for VA to provide \nlong-term care to all veterans who need and want it. While the \nprovisions now included in S. 1076 are only one step toward determining \nwhat VA should be doing to meet the needs of veterans for long-term \ncare, I believe that it is an important step in that regard.\n  There is no doubt that demand for long-term care--for veterans and \nnon-veterans alike--is increasing. In the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA), however, we face an even more pressing demand.\n  I am proud of VA's work in responding to current demand for long-term \ncare services. VA has developed geriatric evaluation teams, home-based \nprimary care, and adult day health care--all cost-effective ways to \nassess and care for veterans. But to quote from the Report of the \nFederal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care, despite \nVA's high quality and long tradition, ``VA long-term care is \nmarginalized and unevenly funded.''\n  There are three key elements to Subtitle A of Title I. The first \nincludes provisions which clarify that long-term care is not only \nnursing home care, and that existing differences in law between \neligibility for institutional long-term care and other types of care \noffered by VA do not affect VA's ability to furnish a full array of \nnoninstitutional long-term care services.\n  Specifically, the provision would add ``noninstitutional extended \ncare services'' to the definition of ``medical services,'' thereby \nremoving any doubt about VA's authority to furnish such services to \nveterans enrolled in VA care. The term would be defined to include the \nfollowing: home-based primary care; adult day health care; respite \ncare; palliative and end-of-life care; and homemaker or home health \ncare aide visits. Veterans would have unfettered access to these needed \nand cost-effective long-term care services.\n  Second, S. 1076, as amended, would add clear authority for VA to \nfurnish assisted living services, including to the spouses of veterans. \nVA already furnishes a form of assisted living services through its \ndomiciliary care program, but the provisions in the bill would provide \nexpress authority to furnish this modality of care to older veterans \nwithin the confines of a demonstration project at a Veterans Integrated \nService Network.\n  The Report of the Federal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA \nLong-Term Care specifically notes that while many state programs are \nmoving in the direction of assisted living--to cut costs and to provide \nthe most appropriate level of care--VA cannot do so. The results of the \ndemonstration project will provide VA and Congress with a rational \nbasis from which to proceed to authorize assisted living for all \nveterans.\n  Third, VA would be mandated to carry out a series of pilot programs, \nover a period of 3 years, which would be designed to gauge the best way \nfor VA to meet veterans' long-term care needs--either directly, through \ncooperative arrangements with community providers, or by purchasing \nservices from non-VA providers.\n  While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over \nthe past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share \nits learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development \nbeyond that which met the current needs at the time. Some experts even \nbelieve that VA's expertise is gradually eroding.\n  For VA's expertise to be of greatest use to others, it needs both to \nbetter capture what it has done and to develop new learning that would \nbe most applicable to other health care entities. Those who would \nbenefit by further action to develop and capitalize on VA's long-term \ncare expertise include older veterans, primarily our honored World War \nII veterans; those health organizations, including academic medicine \nand research entities, with which VA is now connected; and finally, the \nrest of the U.S. health care system, and ultimately all Americans who \nwill need some form of long-term care services.\n  Each element of the pilot program would establish and carry out a \ncomprehensive long-term care program, with a full array of services, \nranging from inpatient long-term care--in intermediate care beds, \nnursing homes, and domiciliary care facilities--to comprehensive \nnoninstitutional services, which include hospital-based home care, \nadult day health care, respite care, and other community-base \ninterventions.\n  In each element of the pilot programs, VA would also be mandated to \nfurnish case management services to\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\nensure that veterans participating in the pilot programs receive the \noptimal treatment and placement for services. Preventive health care \nservices, such as screening and patient education, and a particular \nfocus on end-of-life care are also emphasized. In my view, VA must have \nready access to all of these services.\n  Finally, a key purpose of the pilot program would be to test and \nevaluate various approaches to meeting the long-term care needs of \neligible veterans, both to develop approaches that could be expanded \nacross VA, as well as to demonstrate to others outside of VA the \neffectiveness and impact of various approaches to long-term care. To \nthis end, the pilot program within S. 1076 would include specific data \ncollection on matters such as cost effectiveness, quality of health \ncare services provided, enrollee and health care provider satisfaction, \nand the ability of participants to carry out basic activities of daily \nliving.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and the members of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs in the House of Representatives to \nadvance the cause of long-term care in VA. And I thank Senator Specter \nfor his willingness to undertake these advancements in veterans' long-\nterm care programs.\n  Another major issue of great interest to me which S. 1076 addresses \nare specialized mental health services for veterans.\n  Last year, I directed my staff on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nto undertake a study of the services the Department of Veterans Affairs \noffers to veterans with special needs. Earlier this summer, I released \nthe report my Committee staff wrote based on their 8-month oversight \ninvestigation, which sought to determine if VA is complying with a \nCongressional mandate to maintain capacity in five of the specialized \nprograms: Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services, Blind Rehabilitation, \nSpinal Cord Injury (SCI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), and \nSubstance Use Disorders.\n  In summary, my staff determined that field personnel have just barely \nbeen able to maintain the level of services in the Prosthetics, Blind \nRehabilitation, and SCI programs, but that the PTSD and substance use \ndisorder programs are not being maintained in accordance with the \nmandates in law. Because of staff and funding reductions, and the \nresulting increases in workloads and excessive waiting times, the \nlatter two programs are failing to sustain services at the needed \nlevels.\n  This is particularly troubling because from its inception, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' health care system has developed widely \nrecognized expertise in providing services to meet the special needs of \nveterans with spinal cord injuries, amputations, blindness, and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  With specific regard to PTSD, VA has been moving to reduce inpatient \ntreatment of PTSD, while expanding its use of outpatient programs. VA's \ndecision has been fueled in part by studies of the cost effectiveness \nof various treatment approaches. The potential to stretch limited VA \ndollars to be able to treat more veterans is appealing. However, VA \nneeds to be cautious before subscribing to the idea that outpatient \ncare is as good as inpatient care for all veterans with PTSD. For some \nof the more seriously affected veterans--who have not succeeded in \nshorter inpatient or outpatient programs, are homeless or unemployed, \nor have dual diagnoses--longer inpatient or bed-based care may be a \nnecessity.\n\n  Substance use disorders also present complex treatment problems and \nhave taken perhaps the hardest hit of all the specialized programs. It \nis not surprising that treatment has shifted from an emphasis on \ninpatient to outpatient care. Some substance use disorder programs have \nterminated inpatient treatment completely, except for veterans \nrequiring short detoxifications in extreme situations. while some \nmedical centers have closed inpatient substance use disorder beds, they \nhave worked to provide alternative, sheltered living arrangements. \nUnfortunately, not all facilities have made these efforts. Many have \nmoved directly to the closure of inpatient units without first \ndeveloping these other alternatives.\n  Section 132 of S. 1076, as amended, mandates that the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs carry out programs to enhance the provision of \nspecialized mental health services to veterans. The ``Veterans Benefits \nAct of 1999'' specifically targets services for those afflicted with \nPTSD and substance use disorders. The legislation before us also \nrequires that funding will be available, in a centralized manner, to \nfund proposals from the Veterans Integrated Service Networks and the \nindividual facilities to provide specialized mental health services. \nQualified mental health personnel at the VA who oversee these programs \nshall conduct an assessment of need for the funds.\n  I must stress that these provisions are not aimed at rebuilding the \ntraditional inpatient infrastructure. Instead, the focus is on \nexpanding outpatient and residential treatment facilities, developing \nbetter case management, and generally improving the availability of \nservices.\n  In my view, VA's mental health treatment programs, in general, have \nbeen eroded to the point that veterans in some areas of the country are \nsuffering needlessly. That is why I am so pleased that S. 1076 includes \nprovisions to prompt VA to begin to rebuild some of what has been lost.\n  The third major issue of particular concern to me which S. 1076 \naddresses is emergency care for veterans. I am very pleased that it \nincludes provisions drawn directly from the ``Veterans' Access to \nEmergency Care Act of 1999,'' which would authorize VA to cover \nemergency care at non-VA facilities for those veterans who have \nenrolled with VA for their health care. I thank my colleague, Senator \nDaschle, for his leadership on this issue.\n  While VA provides a very generous standard benefits package for all \nveterans who are enrolled with the VA for their health care, enrolled \nveterans do not have comprehensive emergency care. This is a serious \ngap in coverage for veterans, as large and unexpected emergency medical \ncare bills can present a significant financial burden. That is why I \noffered this proposal at a Committee meeting. I am gratified that my \ncolleagues on the Committee chose to support it.\n  Coverage of emergency care services for all veterans is supported by \nthe consortium of veterans services organizations that authored the \nIndependent Budget for Fiscal Year 2000--AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars. The concept is also included in the Administration's FY \n2000 budget request for VA and the Consumer Bill of Rights, which \nPresident Clinton has directed every federal agency engaged in managing \nor delivering health care to adopt.\n  To quote from the Consumer Bill of rights:\n\n       Consumers have the right to access emergency health care \n     services when and where the need arises. Health plans should \n     provide payment when a consumer presents to an emergency \n     department with acute symptoms of sufficient severity--\n     including severe pain--such that a ``prudent layperson'' \n     could reasonably expect the absence of medical attention to \n     result in placing their health in serious jeopardy, serious \n     impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any \n     bodily organ or part.\n\n  S. 1076 adopts this ``prudent layperson'' standard, which is intended \nto protect both the veteran and the VA.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House Committees \non Veterans' Affairs to make this proposal a reality. Through their \nservice to our country, our veterans have earned comprehensive, high \nquality health care, and that must include emergency care, as well.\n  The final issue contained in S. 1076 to which I wish to draw \nattention is a provision to improve VA's enhanced use lease authority, \nbecause I believe it is a critical component of VA's management \nstrategy for its property. Many terrific projects that better serve \nveterans and assist the VA have been developed under this authority. I \nbelieve it is vital for VA to develop more enhanced use lease projects \nto leverage its assets, before it begins to dispose of irreplaceable \nproperty. I thank Senator Specter for accepting these provisions.\n  Since VA received enhanced use authority, it has been used to lease \nland to companies that build nursing homes where VA can place veterans \nat discounted rates, resulting in savings of millions of dollars. \nAnother use has been to provide transitional housing for homeless \nveterans. Other projects\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\nhave created reliable child care and adult day care facilities for VA \nemployees' families, so that they can care for veterans without having \nto worry about the health and safety of their loved ones. In other \nlocations, VA regional offices are moving onto VA medical center \ncampuses, resulting in more convenient access for veterans and better \ncooperation between the Veterans Benefits Administration and the \nVeterans Health Administration.\n  Section 111 of S. 1076 would remove many of the current barriers \npreventing VA from having an even more successful enhanced use lease \nprogram. It would allow VA to enter into leases of up to 55-year terms, \nrather than the current 20 and 35 years, while eliminating the \ndistinction in lease terms that exists between leases involving new \nconstruction or substantial renovation, and those involving current \nstructures. Section 111 would also authorize VA to use appropriated \nfunds from its minor construction account for contributions to capital \nactivities in order to secure the best lease terms possible.\n  Current authority for VA to enter into enhanced use leases is set to \nexpire on December 31, 2001. Projects that are currently in development \nface the possibility of negotiations not being completed prior to the \nexpiration date. Therefore, S. 1076 extends VA's authority by a \nsufficient length of time--until December 31, 2011--so as not to chill \nnegotiations in the near future.\n  I am very interested in seeing VA engage in more of these projects, \nso I am pleased to see that S. 1076 would require the Secretary to \nprovide training and outreach regarding enhanced use leasing to \npersonnel at VA medical centers. The bill also requires the Secretary \nto contract for an independent assessment of opportunities for enhanced \nuse leases. This assessment would include a survey of suitable \nfacilities, a determination of the feasibility of projects at those \nfacilities, and an analysis of the resources required to enter into a \nlease. I hope that more training--which until now has been sporadic and \nprimarily on a by-request basis--and a more systematic and centralized \napproach would assist the VA in maximizing its enhanced use lease \nopportunities.\n  In conclusion, I believe that S. 1076 represents a real step forward \nin providing veterans with the type of care that they require, and in \ngiving VA the legislative tools to carry out that care--be it emergency \ncare, long-term care, or specialized mental health treatment. When \nCongress passed VA health care eligibility reform in 1996, we told \nveterans that VA would be their comprehensive health care provider; but \nsince its enactment, we have found significant limitations and barriers \nto providing the types of care veterans need. S. 1076 tears down many \nof those barriers.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to carefully examine these critical \nprovisions and to work with Senator Specter and me to implement them. \nAmerica's veterans deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to endorse S. 1076, the \nVeterans' Benefit Act of 1999. I want to thank the distinguished \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs for all their hard work to maintain and enhance veterans' \nbenefits and for including the much needed construction renovation at \nthe Atlanta VA Medical Center. Senators Spector and Rockefeller have \nprovided excellent leadership during these challenging times of \nmatching current budget levels with the provision of promised benefits.\n  The Atlanta VA Medical Center renovation will be critical to \nproviding care for all of our veterans, men and women, in the new \nmillennium. S. 1076 proposes other needed benefits in the areas of \nservice-connected disability compensation, health and education, \nmedical facility construction and burial entitlements.\n  Again, I salute the work of Senate Veterans' Committee and I am \npleased to support S. 1076.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto, the committee substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1622) was agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1076), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
