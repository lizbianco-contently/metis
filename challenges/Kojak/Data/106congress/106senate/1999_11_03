AGRICULTURE TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES AND \n                   CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States agriculture contributes positively to the \n     United States balance of trade and United States agricultural \n     exports support in excess of 1,000,000 United States jobs;\n       (2) United States agriculture competes successfully \n     worldwide despite the fact that United States producers are \n     at a competitive disadvantage because of the trade distorting \n     support and subsidy practices of other countries and despite \n     the fact that significant tariff and nontariff barriers exist \n     to United States exports; and\n       (3) a successful conclusion of the next round of World \n     Trade Organization negotiations is critically important to \n     the United States agricultural sector.\n       (b) Objectives.--The agricultural trade negotiating \n     objectives of the United States with respect to the World \n     Trade Organization negotiations include--\n       (1) immediately eliminating all export subsidies worldwide \n     while maintaining bona fide food aid and preserving United \n     States market development and export credit programs that \n     allow the United States to compete with other foreign export \n     promotion efforts;\n       (2) leveling the playing field for United States producers \n     of agricultural products by eliminating blue box subsidies \n     and disciplining domestic supports in a way that forces \n     producers to face world prices on all production in excess of \n     domestic food security needs while allowing the preservation \n     of non-trade distorting programs to support family farms and \n     rural communities;\n       (3) disciplining state trading enterprises by insisting on \n     transparency and banning discriminatory pricing practices \n     that amount to de facto export subsidies so that the \n     enterprises do not (except in cases of bona fide food aid) \n     sell in foreign markets at prices below domestic market \n     prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring and \n     delivering agricultural products to the foreign markets;\n       (4) insisting that the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Accord \n     agreed to in the Uruguay Round applies to new technologies, \n     including biotechnology, and clarifying that labeling \n     requirements to allow consumers to make choices regarding \n     biotechnology products or other regulatory requirements \n     cannot be used as disguised barriers to trade;\n       (5) increasing opportunities for United States exports of \n     agricultural products by first reducing tariff and nontariff \n     barriers to trade to the same or lower levels than exist in \n     the United States and then eliminating barriers, such as--\n       (A) restrictive or trade distorting practices that \n     adversely impact perishable or cyclical products;\n       (B) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff-rate \n     quotas; and\n       (C) unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions or \n     other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural trade;\n       (6) encouraging government policies that avoid price-\n     depressing surpluses; and\n       (7) strengthening dispute settlement procedures so that \n     countries cannot maintain unjustified restrictions on United \n     States exports in contravention of their commitments.\n       (c) Consultation With Congressional Committees.--\n       (1) Consultation before offer made.--Before the United \n     States Trade Representative negotiates a trade agreement that \n     would reduce tariffs on agricultural products or require a \n     change in United States agricultural law, the United States \n     Trade Representative shall consult with the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Consultation before agreement initialed.--Not less than \n     48 hours before initialing an agreement relating to \n     agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices of the World \n     Trade Organization, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall consult closely with the committees referred to in \n     paragraph (1) regarding--\n       (A) the details of the agreement;\n       (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States \n     agricultural producers; and\n       (C) any changes in United States law necessary to implement \n     the agreement.\n       (3) No secret side deals.--Any agreement or other \n     understanding (whether verbal or in writing) that relates to \n     agricultural trade that is not disclosed to the Congress \n     before legislation implementing a trade agreement is \n     introduced in either house of Congress shall not be \n     considered to be part of the agreement approved by Congress \n     and shall have no force and effect under United States law or \n     in any dispute settlement body.\n       (d) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should \n     be the top priority of United States negotiators; and\n       (2) if the primary competitors of the United States do not \n     reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and export \n     subsidies in accordance with the negotiating objectives \n     expressed in this section, the United States should increase \n     its support and subsidy levels to level the playing field in \n     order to improve United States farm income and to encourage \n     United States competitors to eliminate export subsidies and \n     domestic supports that are harmful to United States farmers \n     and ranchers.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Grassley and I are \noffering is to set the negotiating objectives for agriculture for our \ntrade negotiators at the next round of trade talks. I don't think \nanybody in this Chamber appreciates any more than the current occupant \nof the chair how serious the crisis in agriculture is in our part of \nthe country. We have seen what I call a triple whammy to American \nagricultural producers: bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. That \ntriple whammy has threatened literally tens of thousands of farm \nfamilies.\n  Certainly, in my State, where we had a special crisis team at USDA \nanalyze the circumstances when the Secretary of Agriculture was coming \nto North Dakota a year ago, that team said that if something dramatic \ndid not happen in the next 2 years, we would lose 30 percent--and \nperhaps more--of the farm families in North Dakota. That is how serious \nthe circumstances are.\n  I will put up a couple of charts to demonstrate the problem we face.\n  The key determinant to farm income is farm prices. Farm prices, as \nthis chart shows, are at a 53-year low in real terms. This chart \ndepicts wheat and barley prices from 1946 to 1999, and it shows these \nprices in constant dollars. So we are comparing apples to apples. What \none can see is that prices have had a long-term downward trend over \nthis 53-year period, with one major interruption that occurred back in \nthe 1970s. I think we all recall those times, when we saw a tremendous \nspike in virtually all commodity prices. But over the long term, when \nwe compare on a fair basis, what we see is constantly declining prices, \nand we see now the lowest prices in 53 years in real terms. That is why \nwe see so many serious concerns in farm country about what the future \nholds.\n  This chart represents a little different way of looking at what faces \nour producers because this looks at not only the prices farmers \nreceive--that is the red line--but also what the farmers are paying for \nthe inputs to produce their crops. This looks at over a 10-year period. \nOne can see that the prices farmers are paying for their inputs have \nescalated rather dramatically during this 10-year period. That is not \ntrue about the prices farmers are receiving. Those prices peaked at the \ntime we were discussing the last farm bill, in 1996.\n  It was very interesting that, at the time we were told farmers were \ngoing to have a remarkable situation--they were faced with what we were \ntold at the time was permanently high farm prices because of export \ndemand--those permanently high prices lasted about 90 days. That was \njust about the time we were passing the last farm bill. After that, \nprices collapsed and collapsed on a continuous basis. We have had \nnothing but one way for prices, and that is down, down, down. That is \nthe reason we have seen a collapse of farm income.\n  This chart is another way of looking at what is happening. This shows \na comparison of the prices farmers receive--the red line--to the cost \nof their production, which is the green line. This is for wheat. Wheat \nis the dominant commodity in my State. You can see the cost of \nproduction is about $5 a bushel. But ever since the last farm bill \npassed, we have been well below the cost of production. In fact, now we \nare down to about $2.50, $2.60, $2.70 a bushel, depending on the day \nand market conditions at the time--far below the cost of production. \nThis is what is undermining financial security for American producers.\n\n  It is not just wheat. If I had put up the chart on corn, or barley, \nor on virtually any commodity, one would see the same pattern. It is \nnot just in crops; it is also in livestock. Last year, we saw hogs go \ndown to 8 cents a\n\n[[Page S13731]]\n\npound. It costs 40 cents a pound to produce a hog. So this combination \nof high input costs for farmers yet low prices for what they sell has \nput farmers in a cost/price squeeze. That squeeze is getting tighter \nand tighter. It is eliminating farm income.\n  That is why this next round of trade talks is so critically important \nbecause, very frankly, we have been playing a losing hand in \nagriculture. I think anybody who has really studied the matter \nunderstands that our chief competitors--the Europeans--are outspending \nus, outhustling us, and, as a result, they are winning markets all \nacross the world that were once ours.\n  If we just pierce the veil here and look below the surface, I think \nwhat we see is very revealing. This shows what Europe has been doing in \nterms of agricultural support over the last 3 years; that is the red \nbox. That is what Europe is spending per year, the average for the last \n3 years. The blue box is what the United States is spending under the \nlast farm bill. You can see that the disparity is enormous. The \nEuropeans are spending $44 billion a year, on average; the United \nStates, under the terms of the last farm bill, is spending $6 billion a \nyear--a 7-to-1 disparity.\n  It is very hard to be successful or to have a level playing field \nwhen the opponents are outspending you 7-to-1. We would never permit \nthis in a military confrontation. Why we permit it in a trade \nconfrontation eludes me. It is a guaranteed path to disaster. That is \nprecisely what has happened.\n  If we look at this in a somewhat different way, if we look at it in \nterms of export subsidy for agricultural commodities, and we look at \nvarious regions of the world, we see another interesting picture \nemerge. This shows in the last year for which we have full figures, \n1996, who was doing what with respect to agricultural trade subsidy. \nThere are our European friends again. They are the blue hunk of the \npie; 83.5 percent of all world agricultural export subsidy belongs to \nthe Europeans. Here is the U.S. share, at 1.4 percent, this little \npiece of the pie right here.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues think we are spending too much on \nagriculture. I hear it all the time from some of our colleagues from \nmore urban areas.\n  I say to them that you have to look at what is happening in the rest \nof the world. You have to look at what our competitors are doing. If \nyou look at what our competitors are doing, it is dramatic and it is \nclear.\n  Here are the Europeans. Nearly 84 percent of all world agricultural \nexport subsidy is accounted for by the Europeans. The United States is \n1.4 percent.\n  These aren't Kent Conrad's figures. These aren't the figures from the \nGovernor of North Dakota. These aren't figures from the agriculture \ncommissioner of North Dakota. These are the statistics from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. They show Europe is outspending us on \nagricultural export subsidies by 60 to 1. How are you going to win a \nfight when you are outgunned 60 to 1? This is totally unfair to our \nfarmers. They don't have a level playing field from which to compete. \nThey have a playing field that is totally distorted. We have to change \nthis playing field. We have to level it out. We have to make it \npossible for our farmers to compete fairly.\n  We are willing to compete against anybody at any time. But it is not \nfair to say to our farmers: You go out there and take on the French and \nGerman farmers, and while you are at it, take on the French and German \nGovernments as well. That isn't a fair fight.\n  We shouldn't abandon our farmers to that kind of circumstance. But \nthat is precisely what we have done because in the last farm bill we \ncut our support to producers in half. Under the previous farm bill, we \nwere spending, on average, $10 billion a year to support our producers \nin the face of the competition from the Europeans who were spending $50 \nbillion a year during that period.\n  What did we decide to do? Did we decide to level the playing field? \nNo. We engaged in unilateral disarmament on the pretext that if we cut \nsomehow we would set a good example for the Europeans and they would \nfollow right along.\n  Guess what. We cut our support in half for agricultural producers \nunder the new farm bill, down to $5 billion a year on average. What did \nthe Europeans do? Did they follow suit? Did they take our ``good \nexample''? I put that in quotes, our ``good example.'' No. The \nEuropeans kept right on spending.\n  Do you know why? Because they have a strategy and they have a plan. \nTheir strategy and plan is to dominate world agricultural trade. They \nare doing it the old-fashioned way. They are buying these markets.\n  I have spent a good deal of time talking to the European negotiators. \nWhat they have shared with me is as clear as it can be. They have said \nto me: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war with the United States \non agriculture. We believe at some point there will be a cease-fire in \nthis trade war. We believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and we \nwant to occupy the high ground. The high ground in this contest is \nworld market share. That is exactly the strategy and plan of our \nEuropean friends.\n  They have said to me: You know, Senator, we have much higher levels \nof support in our country than you have in yours, and we believe in all \nof these negotiations instead of leveling the playing field, and \ninstead of closing the gap, that we will be able to secure equal \npercentage reductions in the level of support on both sides.\n  If you think about it, they have much higher levels of support in \nEurope, as I have demonstrated, than we do in this country. They seek \nto get equal percentage reductions from those unequal bases leaving \nEurope always on top. That is their strategy. That is their plan. Oh, \nhow well it is working.\n\n  In the last trade talks, although the levels of support were \ndramatically uneven, was there any closing of the gap? Not at all, not \nany closing of the gap. They didn't come down. We didn't go up. Both of \nus did not engage in a pattern and practice that would narrow the \ndifferences. Instead, what they won were equal percentage reductions \nfrom those unequal bases maintaining European dominance.\n  If we let that happen again, shame on us, because we will be \nconsigning our farmers to the dustbin of financial failure. There is no \nother way this can come out. That is going to be the absolute assured \nresult if we come back with another failed negotiation.\n  Some people blame our negotiators. I personally do not. I blame us \nbecause we have sent unarmed negotiators to the negotiations.\n  In my previous job, mostly what I did was negotiate. One thing I \nlearned very early on in my previous life was that you don't win in \nnegotiation unless you have leverage. You have to have leverage in \norder to prevail in a negotiation.\n  Our negotiators have no leverage. What leverage do they conceivably \nhave when we send them in there and the other side is outgunning us on \nexport subsidies 60 to 1? How are they going to win a negotiation with \nthat sort of fact? How are they going to win when Europe has 84 percent \nof the world's export subsidy and we have 1.4 percent? How are we \npossibly going to prevail in that kind of negotiating climate? I say \nthere is very little chance that we are.\n  That is why I have introduced the FITEA bill, Farm Income and Trade \nEquity Act, to try to level the playing field, to rearm our negotiators \nto give us a chance to prevail in these negotiations.\n  That bill is gaining steam. It has gotten broad support in my own \nhome State of North Dakota. I believe it is going to get even greater \nsupport around the country.\n  Earlier this week, I went to meet in Baltimore with the State \npresidents of the National Farmers Union. I gave them an outline of the \nFITEA plan. I hope they will endorse it.\n  The national rural electric service areas have before them at their \nregional meetings opportunities to endorse the FITEA plan. It has \nalready been endorsed by eight or nine of the national rural electric \nservice areas.\n  We have to give our negotiators leverage. But at the same time we \nhave to also give them instructions. We have to tell them what their \nnegotiating objectives are in this next round of trade talks. It is our \nresponsibility. We can't leave it to the President. Certainly, it is \nhis obligation as well. But Congress has a role to play. I believe we \nought to take the opportunity to send a clear\n\n[[Page S13732]]\n\nmessage to our trade ambassador and her assistants as to what their \nnegotiating objectives are with respect to agriculture.\n  That is what we have before us in the amendment offered on a \nbipartisan basis by Senator Grassley of Iowa and myself. Senator \nGrassley and I serve on both the Agriculture Committee and the Finance \nCommittee. We have a special responsibility. We have taken it \nseriously. That is why we have come forward with a set of negotiating \nobjectives for our trade ambassador in this next round of trade talks.\n  This amendment sets out seven principal negotiating objectives for \nagriculture:\n  No. 1, we should insist on the immediate elimination of all export \nsubsidy programs worldwide. The elimination of all export subsidies \nworldwide should be the negotiating objective.\n  No. 2, we should insist that the European Union and others adopt \ndomestic farm policies that force their producers to face world market \nprices at the margin so they do not produce more than is needed for \ntheir own domestic markets.\n  It is one thing for a country to adopt domestic policy that supports \nhigher prices to meet domestic demand. It is quite another thing for \nthem to have higher prices domestically and, therefore, develop greater \nproduction than they need for the domestic market and then dump that \nsurplus on the world market at fire sale prices depressing prices for \neveryone.\n  Objective No. 2 is to insist that the E.U. and others adopt domestic \nfarm policies that force their producers to face world prices at the \nmargin.\n  No. 3, we should insist that State trading enterprises, such as the \nCanadian Wheat Board, are disciplined so that their actions are \ntransparent and so they do not provide de facto export subsidies.\n  Sometimes we fool ourselves with our own rhetoric around here. We \ntalk about free markets. Many are strong supporters of free markets. In \nagriculture, there are no free markets. We can see, through what the \nEuropeans are doing and spending to buy these markets, that we are not \ndealing in a free-market circumstance in world agricultural trade.\n  We are certainly not dealing with it with respect to our neighbors to \nthe north in Canada. There, individual farmers don't market their \ncommodities; they have a wheat board that markets for them. A very \nsignificant portion of production goes to the wheat board, and they \nmarket on behalf of all of their farmers. Does anyone think that gives \nthem all kinds of opportunities to play games in world markets? \nAbsolutely, because the prices they charge are not transparent. Anyone \ncan learn our prices any minute of any day by going to the Chicago \nBoard of Trade and seeing what commodities are selling for. Try to find \nout what our friends to the north are selling for. They don't have a \ntransparent market. They are not advertising their prices, except to \nthe major buyers in the world. The few times we have a glimpse of what \nthey are doing, we find they go to buyers before other countries and \nsay: Whatever the United States is selling for, we are selling for 5 \ncents less a bushel. That is what they are doing in order to take \nmarkets that have traditionally been ours. We have to wake up and smell \nthe coffee.\n  No. 4, we should insist on the use of sound science when it comes to \nsanitary and phytosanitary restrictions. Too often, these are hidden \nprotectionist trade barriers. On genetically modified organisms, we \nshould insist foreign markets be open to our products, but obviously we \ncan't force consumers to buy what they don't want. We have to give \nconsumers the ability to make an informed choice on whether they want \nto buy these products without letting inflammatory labels be used as \nhidden trade barriers.\n\n  No. 5, we should insist our trading partners immediately reduce their \ntariffs on our agricultural exports to levels no higher than ours, and \nthen further reduce these barriers on a cooperative and comprehensive \nbasis.\n  No. 6, we should seek cooperative agricultural policies to avoid \nprice-depressing surpluses or food shortages. My own long-term view for \nagriculture is, we desperately need to have among the major producers a \ncommon set-aside policy, a common conservation reserve policy, and a \ncommon food reserve policy.\n  No. 7, we should strengthen disputes settlement and enforce existing \ncommitments. The United States honors its international obligations, \nbut all too often our trading partners refuse to live up to their \ncommitments and use the dispute settlement process to delay our efforts \nto call them to account. That is totally unacceptable, and we need to \nsend that message very clearly.\n  These are the seven principles we believe we should send as an \ninstruction to our trade ambassador. We should say very clearly that we \nbelieve these are the things they need to accomplish in this next round \nof trade talks. I also think we should say: Don't bring back under any \ncircumstances equal percentage reductions in support from these unequal \nbases. Don't do that. That way lies permanent inferiority in the \nposition of world agricultural trade. If we want to fritter away our \nlong-term dominance, that is the path for such a result.\n  I urge my colleagues to give very careful consideration to this \namendment. Senator Grassley and I have worked in a bipartisan way in \nconsultation with other colleagues. We believe these are the \nappropriate negotiating objectives for our trade representatives in the \nagricultural sector.\n  Let me end where I began. American agriculture is in crisis. We \ndesperately need a victory in the next round of trade talks, and we \nneed it soon. Our farmers simply cannot survive year after year in a \ncircumstance in which our major competition outspends us 7-1 on \ndomestic support and 60-1 on export subsidies.\n  I believe our farmers can compete against any producer anywhere in \nthe world but they have to have a level playing field. They have to \nhave a country that is fighting for them when our chief competitors are \nfighting for their producers at every set of trade talks.\n  I hope very much our colleagues will support this amendment that lays \nout clear negotiating objectives for our trade representatives in this \nnext round of trade talks. I believe this amendment is a first step in \nthat process. I urge my colleagues to support it. I welcome \ncosponsorship, as I know Senator Grassley would, from other Members who \nare concerned about these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleague will yield for a question, I don't \nintend to take the floor.\n  After the Conrad amendment is disposed of, is it the intention of the \nchairman to have votes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am going to ask unanimous consent to set aside this \namendment. Senator Grassley desires the opportunity to comment. I think \nwe will stack votes as we did yesterday. It would be in order for \nanother amendment to be raised.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I need to go to a markup.\n  Mr. ROTH. We will be ready in a minute for another amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I could say to my friend from \nMinnesota, if he has 5 minutes, he can start.\n  Mr. ROTH. In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside this \namendment. As I said, Senator Grassley, the cosponsor of this \nlegislation, desires the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi and Senator \nAshcroft be listed as original cosponsors of the Conrad-Grassley \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I might comment on the remarks of my \nfriend from North Dakota regarding the Seattle ministerial conference \nwhich begins at the end of this month. There is no wide agreement on \nwhat the next round of negotiations will address. However, there is no \ndoubt that agriculture will be one of the matters addressed in the next \nround. There is much disagreement in other areas.\n  The idea of our setting some negotiating objectives is a good idea, \nin my view, and I think the chairman agrees.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I share that opinion. There is no question \nbut it is appropriate for Congress to help set these objectives.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, I agree very \nmuch\n\n[[Page S13733]]\n\nabout the need to develop a level playing field. One of my concerns is \nthe fact our markets are the most open markets in the world. That \nobviously includes agriculture. The purpose of these negotiations \nshould be to lower them in such a way that everyone is on an even \nplaying field. I am very sympathetic to what the Senator is proposing.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am sure the chairman will agree, and I cannot doubt \nthat my friend from North Dakota will agree, it would be much better if \nthe President were to go to Seattle with the traditional trade \nnegotiating authority other Presidents have had. This President does \nnot. It is not for the lack of the Finance Committee trying to give it \nto him. There has been a real breakdown at both ends of the avenue, as \nit were. The White House has let small political considerations enter \ninto their calculations. We are not unknown to such failings ourselves.\n\n  But the fact is, at the end of the 20th century the President of the \nUnited States does not have the negotiating authority he has had, in \nessence, for 65 years--since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of \n1934. The more, then, ought we try to speak to the coming negotiations \nin the manner suggested; the more, then, should we get this legislation \npassed else the President might decide not to go at all.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think that would be a very serious setback. Let me \ncomment on fast track. As the Senator said, our committee, of course, \nhas acted on that. I regret the President does not have this authority. \nI have to say I do not think negotiations can be effective until the \nPresident obtains it. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is an elemental fact in international relations that \nmost countries have a unitary legislative/executive branch, such that \nif the Prime Minister of Great Britain sends his Foreign Secretary to \nnegotiate, that Foreign Secretary represents a majority in the House of \nCommons. Any agreement they reach will be ratified.\n  That is not the case with us. The world discovered this in 1919 when \nthe Treaty of Versailles, negotiated by President Wilson, was not \nratified in this Chamber. That sank in over the next 20 years. So we \nhave been giving the President this authority so his representatives \ncan say: If I make an agreement, we will keep the agreement.\n  Absent that, I do not know what will come. I think I am correct--I \ntake the liberty of asking my able assistant, Dr. Podoff--we have never \nhad a multilateral GATT or WTO negotiation without the President having \ntraditional negotiating authority, have we, to complete the \nnegotiations? No.\n  This, sir, would be the first time--the first time. That is not an \nexperiment I think we should be running, but perhaps we can make up for \nit in time. In the meantime, I welcome the thoughts of my friend, our \ncolleague on the Committee on Finance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their consideration. They have been most patient in listening to me \ntoday and on the Finance Committee as I have talked about these issues. \nI appreciate, too, they believe, as I do, it is appropriate for us to \nlay out negotiating objectives for our trade representatives for this \nnext round. I hope very much our colleagues will support this \namendment. I think it is important to send a signal as to what we \nexpect our trade representatives to focus on in the agricultural \nsector.\n  Again, I thank our chairman and our ranking member very much for \ntheir assistance this morning. I note my cosponsor, Senator Grassley, \nis held up in committee. He would very much like to speak on this \namendment before it is finally considered. So I appreciate the \nconsideration of the chairman and ranking member with respect to \nproviding time for him as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise in support of an amendment \nI am sponsoring with Senator Conrad to establish trade negotiating \nobjectives for the new round of multilateral trade negotiations the \nUnited States will help launch in about four weeks with 133 other WTO \nmember nations in Seattle.\n  The principles contained in this amendment are important because the \nupcoming negotiations in agriculture are so vital to our farm economy, \nand vital to the United States.\n  The last multilateral trade round, the Uruguay Round, established, \nfor the first time, multilateral rules on market access, export \nsubsidies, and domestic support for agriculture.\n  But as significant as the Uruguay Round was for agriculture, it was \nonly a first step. Much remains to be done.\n  Agricultural tariffs in industrial countries still average more than \n40 percent, compared with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent in manufactured \ngoods.\n  The average world agricultural tariff is 56 percent. In the United \nStates, it is 3 percent. But tariffs for some agricultural products \nreach 200 percent or more.\n  Export subsidies are still far too high, and distort trade in third-\ncountry markets.\n  Producer subsidy equivalents, which measure assistance to producers \nin terms of the value of transfers to farmers generated by agricultural \npolicy, are also far higher in the European Union than in the United \nStates.\n  These transfers are paid either by consumers or by taxpayers in the \nform of market price support, direct payments, or other support.\n  The Producer subsidy equivalent for all agricultural products in the \nEU has averaged around 45 percent.\n  In the United States, the producer subsidy equivalent is only 16 \npercent.\n  So-called ``Blue Box'' spending is also out of control. This is the \ntrade-distorting spending that was authorized in the Uruguay Round.\n  Currently, the United States has no programs that fall within the \nBlue Box. But the European Union maintains huge trade-distorting \nsubsidy payments.\n  We should finally admit that the Blue Box is a mistake, and eliminate \nit completely.\n  State trading enterprises allow some countries to undercut United \nStates exports into third markets and restrict imports.\n  And the principle of sound science is being thwarted with regard to \nbio-engineered products, to the great detriment of our farm economy.\n  We need to address all of these issues in the upcoming WTO \nnegotiations.\n  But we also need to make certain that when we negotiate with our \ntrading partners, that the deal we finally implement is the one that \nwas actually negotiated, and not a different agreement that was changed \nlater through secret understanding or side arrangement.\n  This is an important principle of international law. It is also a \nbasic principle of equity and fairness.\n  Only after the WTO Agreement was signed into law did some of us in \nthe Senate learn for the first time that there was more to the Uruguay \nRound agreement than we originally thought, due to secret side \nagreements.\n  This must not happen again.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Conrad will insure that this \npractice will end.\n  The only trade deal that should be enforced is the one the parties \nactually negotiated.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, so that we can \nget this new round of trade negotiations off to the best possible \nstart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, am I correct, then, the understanding \nis before a final vote on this amendment, Senator Grassley will be \nspeaking and right now I will go forward with my amendment? Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. President, before I send this amendment to the desk, I want to \nemphasize one issue that this amendment does not speak to directly but \nwhich is very much on my mind. There is an (A) and a (B) part to this \nissue.\n  The (A) part is the economic convulsion in agriculture that has taken \nplace all across our land, and certainly in our State of Minnesota. I \nalso hasten to add there is no question in my mind that if we do not \nchange the course of policy, we are going to lose a whole generation of \nproducers.\n  The (B) part of what I want to say before going forward with this \namendment is that I have, for at least the last 6 weeks, if not longer, \nbeen involved in what I would almost have to describe as a ferocious \nfight to have\n\n[[Page S13734]]\n\nthe opportunity to bring an amendment to the floor that speaks to at \nleast part of what is going on with this crisis in agriculture. No one \namendment is the be-all or end-all. But one amendment would deal with \nall the mergers that are taking place and the ways in which these \nconglomerates are driving out family farmers across the land, the whole \nproblem of concentration of power in the food industry, in agriculture.\n  Other colleagues from agricultural States such as Minnesota have \nother ideas, but the point is that we want an opportunity to bring an \namendment to the floor that speaks to what is going on in agriculture. \nI thought we would have the opportunity to do that on this trade bill. \nWe have been clotured out. Last week, we were successful in blocking \ncloture. Now we have been clotured out, with the understanding this \nwill happen on the bankruptcy bill.\n  I want to express my skepticism on the floor of the Senate today as \nto whether or not that bankruptcy bill will be brought to the floor and \nwhether or not we will have that opportunity. I want to express some \nindignation in advance if, in fact, we end up closing out this part of \nour session and going home without having had any debate, further \ndebate about agriculture, and any effort whatsoever to alleviate the \npain and misery in the countryside. I think it should be a top priority \nfor us.\n  Over the next several days, whatever period we are dealing with, I am \ngoing to continue to fight to get this amendment out there. My \nunderstanding is we have an agreement that there will be an amendment \non agriculture that will be part of the debate we will have when the \nbankruptcy bill comes to the floor, along with minimum wage, along with \nEast Timor. That is the commitment that has been made. I certainly hope \nwe will see that commitment carried out.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2487\n\n   (Purpose: To condition trade benefits for Caribbean countries on \n        compliance with internationally recognized labor rights)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only filed amendments may be called up. Does \nthe Senator have a filed amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, the amendment has been filed. I do not \nneed to send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Which number is the amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Since I did not know it had been filed, I will speak \non the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Is it 2487?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 2487 is the number.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I just slip over and make sure we \nhave the right amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I apologize. I did not know the amendment had been \nfiled.\n  When I talk about labor rights, my colleague from New York is very \nfamiliar with the ILO. This is his fine work. What we are talking about \nis the right of association, the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, the prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or \ncompulsory labor, some kind of international minimum wage for the \nemployment of children age 15, and acceptable working conditions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENCOURAGING TRADE AND INVESTMENT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL \n                   TO BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND CARIBBEAN \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Conditioning of Trade Benefits on Compliance With \n     Internationally Recognized Labor Rights.--None of the \n     benefits provided to beneficiary countries under the CBTEA \n     shall be made available before the Secretary of Labor has \n     made a determination pursuant to paragraph (b) of the \n     following:\n       (1) The beneficiary country does not engage in significant \n     violations of internationally recognized human rights and the \n     Secretary of State agrees with this determination; and\n       (2)(A) The beneficiary country is providing for effective \n     enforcement of internationally recognized worker rights \n     throughout the country (including in export processing zones) \n     as determined under paragraph (b), including the core labor \n     standards enumerated in the appropriate treaties of the \n     International Labor Organization, and including--\n       (i) the right of association;\n       (ii) the right to organize and bargain collectively;\n       (iii) a prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or \n     compulsory labor;\n       (iv) the international minimum age for the employment of \n     children (age 15); and\n       (v) acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum \n     wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.\n       (B) The government of the beneficiary country ensures that \n     the Secretary of Labor, the head of the national labor agency \n     of the government of that country, and the head of the Inter-\n     American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT) each has \n     access to all appropriate records and other information of \n     all business enterprises in the country.\n       (b) Determination of Compliance With Internationally \n     Recognized Worker Rights.--\n       (1) Determination.--\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of carrying out paragraph \n     (a)(2), the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the \n     individuals described in clause (B) and pursuant to the \n     procedures described in clause (C), shall determine whether \n     or not each beneficiary country is providing for effective \n     enforcement of internationally recognized worker rights \n     throughout the country (including in export processing \n     zones).\n       (B) Individuals described.--The individuals described in \n     this clause are the head of the national labor agency of the \n     government of the beneficiary country in question and the \n     head of the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers \n     (ORIT).\n       (C) Public comment.--Not later than 90 days before the \n     Secretary of Labor makes a determination that a country is in \n     compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2), the \n     Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register and an \n     opportunity for public comment. The Secretary shall take into \n     consideration the comments received in making a determination \n     under such paragraph (a)(2).\n       (2) Continuing compliance.--In the case of a country for \n     which the Secretary of Labor has made an initial \n     determination under subparagraph (1) that the country is in \n     compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2), the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the individuals described in \n     subparagraph (1), shall, not less than once every 3 years \n     thereafter, conduct a review and make a determination with \n     respect to that country to ensure continuing compliance with \n     the requirements of paragraph (a)(2). The Secretary shall \n     submit the determination to Congress.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and on an annual basis thereafter, the \n     Secretary of Labor shall prepare and submit to Congress a \n     report containing--\n       (A) a description of each determination made under this \n     paragraph during the preceding year;\n       (B) a description of the position taken by each of the \n     individuals described in subparagraph (1)(B) with respect to \n     each such determination; and\n       (C) a report on the public comments received pursuant to \n     subparagraph (1)(C).\n       (c) Additional Enforcement.--A citizen of the United States \n     shall have a cause of action in the United States district \n     court in the district in which the citizen resides or in any \n     other appropriate district to seek compliance with the \n     standards set forth under this section with respect to any \n     CBTEA beneficiary country, including a cause of action in an \n     appropriate United States district court for other \n     appropriate equitable relief. In addition to any other relief \n     sought in such an action, a citizen may seek the value of any \n     damages caused by the failure of a country or company to \n     comply.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would provide for \nmutually beneficial trade between the United States and Caribbean \ncountries by actually rewarding countries that comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor rights with increased access to \nU.S. markets for certain textile goods.\n  That is what this should be about. We ought to reward countries that \nare willing to comply with internationally recognized core labor rights \nwith increased access to the U.S. market.\n  This amendment provides for enforceable standards--let me emphasize \nthis. I say to my colleagues, and I know they believe me, I am an \ninternationalist. I very much want to see expanded trade. I very much \nwant to see expanded relations with other countries. The question is \nthe terms of trade, and I am especially focused on the need to have \nenforceable labor standards.\n  Under this amendment, before any of the benefits of the CBI trade \nbill can go into effect, the Secretary of Labor will have to determine \na CBI country is providing for enforcement of the core ILO labor \nrights. That is what this amendment does.\n  The Secretary will make this determination after consulting with \nlabor people from the region and after consideration of public \ncomments. But the Secretary of Labor will make the determination to \nmake sure the country\n\n[[Page S13735]]\n\nwith which we have trade relations is providing for the enforcement of \nthe ILO core labor rights. I want to make sure these standards are \nenforceable. U.S. citizens will also have a private right of action in \ndistrict courts to enforce these provisions.\n  The alternatives in the CBI Parity bill are unenforceable. That is my \ndissent from this legislation. The CBI Parity bill merely includes \nlabor rights as an eligibility criterion which can only be enforced by \nthe administration. But the administration already enforces the GSP \nprogram and has never, not one time, suspended a CBI country, despite \ntheir terrible labor rights records.\n  Later on, I will provide, from my point of view, too much by way of \ndocumentation. That is to say, the number of petitions that have been \nfiled with the USTR under the GSP program. Every single time the \npetition has been withdrawn. There has been no real response.\n  If the administration will not use its GSP leverage to improve labor \nrights in these countries, why would we expect them to use an \neligibility criterion? The ILO is not an option because it does not \nhave the enforcement power. I want to make sure there are some \nenforceable labor standards that will apply to this CBI trade \nagreement.\n  Some examples of GSP workers' rights cases accepted for review \nagainst major CBI countries are as follows:\n  Costa Rica, 1993, right of association, right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, acceptable working conditions, petition withdrawn. That \nis the outcome.\n  Dominican Republic, 1989-1991, right of association, right to \norganize and bargain collectively--these are core labor rights--forced \nlabor, child labor, review terminated in 1991 due to introduction of \n``labor code reform.''\n  El Salvador, 1990-1994, right of association, right to organize and \nbargain collectively, review terminated.\n  Guatemala, 1992-1997, right of association, right to organize and \nbargain collectively, again, review terminated.\n  The list goes on.\n  What we want to do is parallel to what Senator Feingold has done in \nhis HOPE for Africa bill. That is, we want to apply some enforceable \nlabor standards. We want to reward countries that comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor rights. In this amendment, we \ncall for the Secretary of Labor to determine whether or not a CBI \ncountry is providing for the enforcement of ILO core labor rights. Why \nwouldn't we want to do that in a piece of trade legislation? When will \nwe?\n  Supporters of CBI parity complain that NAFTA-like benefits will help \nCaribbean workers. I have heard that argument made over and over. I \nwant to read from a report that came out in October of 1999: ``Six \nyears of NAFTA: A review from inside the maquiladoras.''\n\n  This 1999 report on the Mexican maquiladoras shows wages and \nconditions have actually deteriorated since passage of NAFTA. This was \na joint effort between the Comite Fronterizo de Obreras and the \nAmerican Friends Service Committee. I will quote from relevant sections \nof the report, ``Six years of NAFTA: A review from inside the \nmaquiladoras'':\n\n       In Mexican manufacturing, real wages have fallen by more \n     than 20 percent since 1994. It is not only that real wages \n     have remained stagnant overall, failing to keep pace with \n     inflation, but wage levels have also come under attack \n     wherever they are over the threshold considered competitive \n     by the maquiladoras.\n\n  One sees over and over, in going through this report, wage levels \ndropping, basic violations of the people to organize, and failure to \nenforce child labor standards. When I hear about NAFTA-like benefits, I \nhave to question whether or not this is the future.\n  I will speak about the CBI countries and what I call the race to the \nbottom. The CBI countries with the fastest export growth to the United \nStates have also experienced the steepest decline in wages in the \nregion. Over the last 10 years, textile and apparel imports from \nHonduras exploded by a whopping 2,523 percent. Yet from the 10 years \nspanning 1985 to 1996, wages of Honduran workers declined by 59 \npercent.\n  I will repeat this since we are talking about the benefits for the \nworkers in these countries. I am not making an argument that we should \nhave enforceable labor standards because I only care about workers in \nour country. I do care about workers in our country, and I do worry \nthat the message we're sending to workers in our country, if we do not \nhave enforceable labor standards in this agreement, is: If you dare to \norganize and bargain collectively to get a better wage and a better \nstandard of living for yourselves and your families, then these \ncompanies will just go to the Caribbean countries.\n  That is part of the message. Let me tell you why I think it is the \nmessage. This is a list of approximate apparel wages around the world. \nIn the United States, the average is $8.42. Do my colleagues know what \nit is in Colombia? Seventy to 80 cents; Dominican Republic, 69 cents; \nEl Salvador, 59 cents; Guatemala, somewhere between 37 to 50 cents; \nHaiti, 30 cents; Honduras, 43 cents; Nicaragua, 23 cents.\n  I am worried that not only is the message to workers in our country: \nLook, we will just go to these countries where we can pay 23 or 40 \ncents an hour; you cannot compete with them so you dare not call for \nbetter wages and working conditions.\n  I am also worried the message we're sending to these countries is: \nYes, there is going to be economic expansion and there is going to be \nmore trade, but the only way you can get the foreign investment is if \nyou agree to work for less than 50 cents an hour.\n  Again, I will give some figures. CBI countries with the fastest \nexport growth to the United States have also experienced the sharpest \ndecline in wages in the region. Maybe my colleagues can explain to me \nwhy this is the case.\n  Over the last 10 years, in Honduras: Apparel imports from Honduras \nexploded 2,523 percent. Yet for the same 10 years, the wages in \nHonduras declined by 59 percent.\n  In El Salvador: Apparel exports to the United States have increased \n2,512 percent, while wages have decreased 27 percent.\n  In contrast, Jamaica's export growth has been less impressive, \nculminating in an actual 17 percent decline over the past year. One \nexplanation is that Jamaica's high rate of unionization has ensured \nthat workers' wages have increased.\n  So here is the message. May I simply say to my colleagues why \nenforceable IOL standards are important: The basic right to be able to \norganize and not wind up in prison; the basic right to be able to \nbargain collectively and not wind up in prison. It is because if we do \nnot have enforceable labor standards--and we do not in this trade \nlegislation right now, and this amendment puts enforceable labor \nstandards into this legislation--then we are saying to workers in our \nStates: You had better not ask for more by way of wages. You had better \nnot be too assertive for yourselves or your families because we'll just \ngo to these CBI countries and we'll pay 50 cents an hour or less.\n  What it says to the workers in these countries--and I just gave you \nsome aggregate data--is: By the way, we're not going to guarantee your \nright to organize. We're not going to guarantee any fair labor \nstandards. We're not going to guarantee any IOL standards that will be \nenforceable. Therefore, the only way you get the investment is if \nyou're willing to work under sweatshop conditions.\n  As a matter of fact, in the CBI countries, their growth in exports to \nour country has been unbelievable--dramatic growth--but the wages have \ndeclined. The only country where that has not happened is Jamaica, \nwhich is a country where there has been unionization. So the message \nis: You don't get the trade, you don't get the investment, if you dare \nto unionize.\n  I say to colleagues, there are many articles, many testimonies, and \nthere is a GAO report which shows that workers' rights have not been \nrespected and are not respected in Central America, Haiti, and the \nDominican Republic. I do not think my colleagues are going to argue \nwith me on this. It seems the evidence is irrefutable on that point.\n  Without this amendment, the CBI Parity bill is going to help defeat \nunionizing drives in our textile plants and American workers will \ncompete with Caribbean apparel workers who are willing to work for 30 \ncents an hour--23 cents an hour actually in Nicaragua, 80 cents an hour \nin Colombia. The United States apparel workers\n\n[[Page S13736]]\n\nmake, on the average, $8.42, which is not a lot of money.\n  There is a bitter irony: Many of these workers in U.S. textile plants \nare actually immigrants from these very same countries. A large number \nof them are poor, they barely make a living wage, they are women, they \nare minorities. Without this amendment, the CBI parity bill will merely \nencourage United States corporations to set up sweatshops in the \nCaribbean. My amendment is an anti-sweatshop amendment.\n  To summarize, there ought to be enforceable labor standards. There \nare not any in this trade bill. Without enforceable labor standards, we \nare not on the side of human rights, we are not on the side of people \nin the CBI countries wanting to organize and to be able to do well for \ntheir families, and we are not on the side of wage earners in our \ncountry who are going to lose their jobs to workers in Honduras who \nwork for 40 cents an hour.\n  We ought to at least have enforceable IOL standards. That is exactly \nwhat this amendment speaks to.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his \nremarks and tell him that he finds no difference of view among the \nmanagers of this legislation. We have a managers' amendment to address \nit.\n\n  The large issue, sir, that has emerged in the context of the World \nTrade Organization is the relevance of the international labor \nconventions negotiated under the auspices of the International Labor \nOrganization, which began here in Washington in 1919. The first were \nadopted at the Pan-American Union Building. The Offices of the ILO \nitself were provided by then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin \nD. Roosevelt.\n  The problem is, at the time, these trade treaties--they were trade \ntreaties--were designed to say, just as the Senator has said: If you, \ncountry X, have a minimum wage, and country Y does not, country Y will \nhave trade advantages which will end up with employment in the original \ncountry. So do it together--improve labor standards together by means \nof international labor treaties. It is a principle.\n  We did not, until now, have any transparency. There was no \ninspection--a new idea, a post-World War II idea--an important key \nidea. There was no ranking, no reporting. We are getting there. The \nInternational Labor Organization, in 1998, issued this wonderful \ndocument: ``ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at \nWork.'' And there they are, the four basic principles. We have a lot to \ndo in this regard, but we have begun.\n  So I congratulate the Senator. He is going to speak later and longer.\n  I know the Senator from Montana, under some pressure of time, would \nlike to speak now, as I understand it, on the most agreeable subject of \nwhy this is an important bill and why he voted for it in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before yielding to the Senator from \nMontana--I will be pleased to accommodate him--my understanding is that \nbefore we come to a final vote, there will be an opportunity for \nfurther discussion of this amendment. There are some additional \ncomments I want to make, especially in response to the very helpful \ncomments of the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We understand that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was very \ndisappointed last week when it appeared that we would not have a chance \nto act on this very important piece of legislation. I was disappointed \nfor several reasons.\n  First, because there's a lot more at stake here than the four basic \nelements of this bill: CBI, Africa Trade, TAA and GSP. All four are \nimportant, and I will say a few words about each one of them.\n  But even more important is the signal that we send now. At the end of \nthis month, the United States will host the World Trade Organization \nministerial meeting in Seattle. The WTO writes and enforces the rules \ngoverning some $6 trillion in international trade. Delegations from \nover 130 nations will come participate in the meeting. They will launch \na new global round of negotiations aimed at expanding trade.\n  All of those delegations will have a common concern: Does the United \nStates still intend to lead the world on trade? They will look at the \nway we deal with the trade bill before us as an indication of how they \nshould answer that question.\n  The signals we have sent them recently are not encouraging.\n  First, we have failed to pass legislation granting negotiating \nauthority to the U.S. Trade Representative. This undercuts our ability \nto persuade other nations to offer concessions, since we are not in a \nposition to make credible offers.\n  Second, the United States has not put forward the kind of visionary, \nfar-reaching proposals needed at the onset of trade talks. Rather than \nleading the way forward, we seem to have adopted another strategy: \noffend the fewest number of people as possible.\n  While we send these weak signals, other countries have moved into the \nbreach to advance their own interests. The European Union and Japan \nmounted campaigns to paint us as foot-draggers on trade. They say that \nour proposals for trade negotiations are too narrow to allow for any \nreal bargaining. They claim that they want to talk about the full range \nof trade issues, while we want to pull major portions of the trade \nsystem off the table.\n  We know what they are really up to. They want to undercut the talks \nand make them drag on for years. That way they can avoid living up to \ntheir responsibilities on agriculture. Unfortunately, a number of \ncountries are persuaded by the picture of America's trade policy that \nEurope and Japan are painting.\n  This bill is the only opportunity the Senate will have before the \nSeattle meetings to show where America stands. It is vitally important \nthat we pass this legislation to demonstrate our commitment to free \nmarket principles, and to open, fair trading system.\n  Mr. President, I filed two amendments to the bill, both of them \ntrade-related. Both of them are on issues which are extremely important \nto Americans. I was very disappointed that we were locked out of \ndiscussing them last week.\n  One of the amendments allowed for tariff cuts on environmental goods \nas part of a global agreement in the WTO. The measure has the support \nof both business and environmental groups. This is a rare instance \nwhere both sides of the trade-environment debate agree on something. \nIt's a shame that the Senate cannot move forward on something so \nsensible.\n\n  The second amendment concerned agricultural subsidies. American \nfarmers are the most productive in the world. But they're being frozen \nout of foreign markets by European and Japanese subsidies. I filed an \namendment that would fight back by funding our Export Enhancement \nProgram.\n  This amendment required the Secretary of Agriculture to target at \nleast two billion dollars in Export Enhancement Program funds into the \nEU's most sensitive markets if they fail to eliminate their export \nsubsidies by 2003. It's time to start fighting fire with fire. This \n``GATT trigger'' should provide leverage in the next round of the WTO \nin reducing grossly distorted barriers to agricultural trade.\n  In addition to these amendments, Mr. President, I also filed a \nresolution in the form of an amendment about another important trade \nissue: telecommunications. It calls on the Administration to continue \nto pursue efforts to open the Japanese telecommunications market. This \nis another example of how Japan must shoulder its responsibilities as a \nmajor trading nation. It cannot benefit from access to foreign markets \nunless its offers access to its home market. It's simply a question of \nfairness.\n  Mr. President, I voted against cloture last week because I objected \nto the way the Majority Leader handled the bill. I was denied the \nability to do what the people of Montana sent me here to do: debate and \npass legislation. But I support the bill itself. I support each of its\n\n[[Page S13737]]\n\nelements--the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act, and the renewal of both Trade Adjustment Assistance \nand the Generalized System of Preferences.\n\n\n                Caribbean Basin Parity Initiative (CBI)\n\n  I have long supported efforts to extend additional tariffs \npreferences to the Caribbean Basin. But with conditions. The benefits \nshould be conditioned on the beneficiary countries' trade policies, \ntheir participation and cooperation in the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas (``FTAA'') initiative, and other factors. This trade bill is \nsubstantially similar to the version I supported in the 105th Congress \nwith some reservation.\n  I see a flaw in this bill, however, and would like to work to repair \nit. The bill suggests criteria the President can use when deciding \nwhether to grant CBI benefits. It is a long list of about a dozen \nitems. Criteria like Intellectual Property Rights. Investment \nprotections. Counter-narcotics. Each one is important. The bill should \nmake these criteria mandatory.\n  In particular, I believe that the President should be required to \ncertify that CBI beneficiaries respect worker rights, both as a matter \nof law and in practice. We can't maintain domestic support for open \ntrade here at home unless our programs take core labor standards into \naccount.\n  We want to help our Caribbean neighbors compete effectively in the \nU.S. market. But we don't want them to compete with U.S. firms by \ndenying their own citizens fundamental worker rights.\n  It only seems reasonable that as we help the economic development of \nthese nations, we also help them enforce the laws already on their \nbooks. The majority of these countries already have the power and only \nneed the will to ensure that their citizens see the benefits of \nenhanced trade--decent wages, decent hours and a decent life.\n  Overall, I believe that CBI parity is the right thing to do--if it \ndoes what it is intended to do. That is lift the people of the \nhurricane devastated countries out of poverty and ensure them a better \nway of life.\n  I also believe that the United States must lead by example. \nSensitivity to labor and environment must play a role in our trade \ndecisions and actions around the world.\n  It's tragic that partisan politics keeps the United States Senate \nfrom taking these actions.\n\n\n                   African Growth and Opportunity Act\n\n  I have the same concerns about labor in terms of the African Growth \nand Opportunity portion of the bill. But I supported the Chairman's \nmark, which included a provision requiring U.S. fabric for apparel \nproducts produced in eligible sub-Saharan African countries.\n  Developing markets is in the best interest of us all. And the trade \nbill would help Africa move in that direction. But this bill is about \nmore than trade. It is about hope.\n  It is about bringing the struggling nations of sub-Saharan Africa \ninto our democratic system. It is about establishing stability and a \nframework wherein the citizens of these nations can enjoy the fruits of \nprosperity. It is about building a bridge between the United States and \nAfrica that will be a model for all nations.\n\n\n                      Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n  The third part of the bill renews the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram. We cannot expect to maintain a domestic consensus on trade if \nwe fail to assist those who are adversely affected. For 37 years, this \nprogram helped Americans adjust to the forces of globalization.\n  I would like to acknowledge Senator Moynihan, who originated this \nprogram, in another demonstration of his wisdom and foresight. I have \nseen the effects of this program in Montana. The renewal of Trade \nAdjustment Assistance translates to 330 Montana employees impacted and \napproximately $44 million in gross annual sales preserved.\n  This legislation is long overdue. TAA authorization expired on June \n30. There are families who are displaced in the world economy, and they \nare living off this transitional benefit--200,000 eligible workers.\n  While we delay, certified firms anxiously await funding. This is \nfundamentally unfair--especially for employees of firms fighting import \ncompetition that is beyond their control. They cannot afford to wait \nwhile TAA is caught up in the annual battle for funding as the \n``perennial bargaining chip'' for other trade proposals. That's just \nineffective government. It's time to pass this legislation.\n\n\n                   Generalized System of Preferences\n\n  Finally, let me say a word about GSP renewal. This is the fourth part \nof the trade bill. This is also a question of effective government. \nOver the years, the program has lapsed periodically when renewal \nlegislation was delayed. Like TAA, the latest lapse occurred on June \n30. Four months later, we still haven't acted on its renewal.\n  Who gets hurt? Not just foreign companies. A lot of American firms \nget hurt. That includes both American importers and exporters. A lot of \nthe American firms produce abroad and then export to the United States. \nMuch of this is internal company trade. That's the reality of today's \nglobal economy.\n  When GSP lapses, these companies are suddenly required to deposit \nimport duties into an account. Customs holds the money until renewal \nlegislation is signed. Eventually the companies get their money back. \nBut they don't know how long renewal legislation will take. So they \ndon't how much they'll have to set aside, or how long the money will be \nin escrow.\n  How can we expect businesses to operate efficiently under such \nconditions? These cycles of GSP lapsing and then being renewed \nrepresent government at its worst. We have a responsibility to provide \nbusiness and consumers with a consistent, predictable set of rules. We \nneed to fix this GSP lapse as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, a lot of effort, a lot of thought, a lot of time has \ngone into this bill. Much time has also gone into formulating \namendments. It was a great disappointment to see this effort unravel \nover partisan politics. We have a second chance this week. Let's not \nsquander the opportunity. We can and should work together to pass this \nbill.\n  We were elected to this body to pass legislation not to bicker. Let's \ndo what the people sent us here to do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to express the wish that \nevery Member of the Senate will have heard, or will have read, the \nremarks of the Senator from Montana. There speaks the American voice. I \ntrust it will be heard. Thanks to him, it will prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act and to discuss two amendments I hope to offer. I \nwould like to begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe committee for their good work on this bill. Anyone who has spent \ntime in Africa knows the poverty and environmental problems inherent on \nthat continent. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, I believe, is \nthe most hopeful vehicle for positive change that has come about. It \nopens the door to trade, investment, economic growth, and a higher \nquality of life for people of African nations. It will give Africans \noptions and new abilities to build economically, to develop, to improve \nopportunities for trade worldwide, and to build new businesses on \nAfrican and Caribbean soil.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa is a market of some 700 million people. Yet less \nthan 1 percent of our Nation's total trade is currently conducted with \nnations of this region. Expanding trade with this emerging market will \nhelp keep America competitive with Europe and Asia, who are already \nexpanding their markets in the African nations. As the nations of sub-\nSaharan African reform their economies to spur economic growth, U.S. \nexporters will have access to new and larger markets for their \nproducts. This, in the long run, creates and sustains American jobs.\n  Just as important, this legislation contains provisions to support \nand encourage democracy and human rights in sub-Saharan Africa. A \ncountry is not eligible for trade and investment benefits if it engages \nin gross violations of internationally recognized human rights and does \nnot respect basic labor rights, such as the right to organize and \nbargain, the right of association, and acceptable working conditions.\n\n[[Page S13738]]\n\nNow, I recognize that those rights aren't as strong and enforceable as \nsome might want. Nonetheless, they are the basic rights that are \ninherent in virtually every trade bill.\n  Finally, as President Clinton noted, deepening our economic ties with \nthese nations will also strengthen our cooperative efforts to address a \nhost of transnational threats, such as environmental degradation, \ninfectious disease, and illicit drug trafficking. I had intended to \noffer an amendment to address any potential impact this legislation \nmight have on the domestic apparel industry of our Nation. The \namendment I would have introduced would have created a tax credit of 30 \npercent for the first $12,300 in the first year of employment, rising \nto 50 percent over 5 years for domestic garment and sewn manufacturers \nwho hire a worker who is at or below the poverty line in this country. \nFor an individual, that is $8,240; for a family of four, it is $16,700.\n  However, both the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee have made it clear they don't believe tax credit amendments \nshould be offered to this legislation, and I respect that. The offset \nwe also had in mind, it turns out, has been utilized. However, the \namendment has been scored. I will not offer this domestic textile \nworker tax credit amendment on this bill, though my intention is to \noffer it as a separate bill with an offset at a later time.\n  I think this legislation would provide real incentive for domestic \nmanufacturers to keep jobs in the United States, to hire American \nworkers, and to keep them on the job. Moreover, by targeting the \nbenefits to employees who, before being hired, are living at or below \nthe poverty line, the amendment would also help move families off of \nwelfare and public assistance and provide them good jobs in which they \ncan support themselves and their families.\n\n  My second amendment addresses the need for the United States to \nremain in the forefront of the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa.\n  Mr. President, this bill inadvertently threatens to undermine the \nfight against AIDS in Africa. Approximately 34 million people, if you \ncan believe it, in sub-Saharan Africa--that is the equivalent of the \npopulation of the State of California--are or have been infected with \nAIDS or HIV. And 11.5 million people of those infected have died--11.5 \nmillion people. These fatalities comprise 83 percent of the world's \ntotal HIV/AIDS-related death. Eighty-three percent of the death from \nAIDS in the world are in the sub-Saharan African countries. So the \nimpact of AIDS in Africa is huge. It continues to be a major threat to \nthe well-being of the entire African Continent. Frankly, it even \nthreatens the well-being of this legislation if it is left unaddressed.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation carries with it intellectual property \nrights for the American pharmaceutical companies which prevent the \nlicensing, manufacture, and sale of cheaper generic AIDS drugs. That is \na practice known as ``compulsory licensing.''\n  Without compulsory licensing, a practice fully consistent with \ninternational law, the vast majority of HIV/AIDS patients in Africa \ncould not afford the more expensive drugs from American pharmaceutical \ncompanies and, thus, more will suffer and die simply without treatment. \nAIDS drugs in this country literally cost several hundred dollars a \nmonth. They must be taken several times a day regularly, and they often \nnecessitate other drugs to ward off serious side effects of AIDS-\nreducing drugs.\n  The amendment I have authored, which is cosponsored by Senator \nFeingold, on which we have worked with the staff on both sides, and \nwhich we believe will be acceptable to both sides, draws on a provision \nin Senator Feingold's HOPE for Africa bill. It allows the countries of \nsub-Saharan Africa to pursue compulsory licensing by preventing the \nU.S. Government from enforcing one specific U.S. intellectual property \nright that, when implemented, would prevent the license, manufacture, \nand sale of generic AIDS drugs in Africa.\n  For those of my colleagues who may be concerned that this amendment \nmay undermine wider intellectual property rights, this amendment \nacknowledges the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related \naspects of intellectual property and that that is the presumptive legal \nstandard for intellectual property rights.\n  The WTO, however, allows countries flexibility in addressing public \nhealth concerns, and the compulsory licensing process under this \namendment is consistent with the WTO's balancing of intellectual \nproperty rights with the moral obligation to meet public health \nemergencies such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n  When 11 million people die of a single disease, it certainly deserves \nand merits this kind of consideration.\n  In effect, this amendment will allow the countries of sub-Saharan \nAfrica to continue to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS \npharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with more \naffordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n  It is clearly in the national interest of the United States to \nprevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and I believe that \nthis amendment is an important improvement to this legislation if we \nare to continue to assist the countries of the region to bring this \ndeadly disease under control.\n  I am pleased to support the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative because I believe they are both in the \nnational interest of this country.\n  I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their support of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the amendment of the Senator from California to the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. First, let me thank Senator Feinstein for \nher leadership on this critical issue. This very provision is \nincorporated in my own HOPE for Africa bill, S. 1636, and I am \nespecially pleased she is offering that language as an amendment to \nthis bill today.\n  AGOA's aim is to strengthen economic ties between the United States \nand the diverse states of sub-Saharan Africa, fostering economic \ndevelopment and mutually beneficial growth. I think that we can all \nagree that this is a worthy goal. The disagreement is about how we get \nfrom here to there.\n  It is my belief that no U.S.-Africa trade bill will succeed unless it \naddresses the underlying context for growth and development in Africa. \nThe United States needs to pass legislation that will help set the \nstage for a real economic partnership.\n  The Feinstein-Feingold amendment is a good start because it is \nimpossible to address Africa's economic and social development problems \nwithout taking serious action to combat the region's HIV/AIDs epidemic.\n  In 1998, four out of every five HIV/AIDs-related deaths occurred in \nsub-Saharan Africa. In fact, HIV/AIDS kills over 5,000 Africans each \nday.\n  Common decency tells us that this is a humanitarian catastrophe. \nBasic logic also tells us that it is economically devastating.\n  AIDS attacks the most productive segment of society--the young adults \nwho would otherwise be the engine in Africa's economy. And it leaves \nfar too many children orphaned, preparing to take their place in \nsociety without the guidance and security that their parents would have \nprovided.\n  And the health-care costs associated with AIDS are astronomical. \nLife-savings medications can cost $12,000 per year--an impossible \nburden in countries where average per-capita annual income often barely \nexceed $1,000.\n  How can the United States expect to find a strong economic partner in \nAfrica if it ignores these facts?\n  This amendment does not hide from these realities. It approaches them \nhead-on, by prohibiting U.S. funds from being used to change the \nintellectual property laws of African states.\n  That means that taxpayer dollars will not be spent to help \npharmaceutical companies undermine the legal efforts of some African \nstates to gain and retain access to lower cost pharmaceuticals.\n  It is important to be clear--this amendment does not allow African \nstates to ``get away with something.'' It explicitly refers to the \nlegal means by which these countries are entitled to address their \npublic health emergencies.\n  These legal methods, which are permitted under the agreement on Trade \nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, lower prices for \nconsumers by creating competition in the\n\n[[Page S13739]]\n\nmarket for patented goods through a procedure called compulsory \nlicensing. TRIPS is an agreement administered by the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Compulsory licensing does not ignore the rights of patent-holders. \nPharmaceutical companies holding patents on HIV/AIDS drugs are paid a \nroyalty under these arrangements.\n  This amendment simply prohibits the United States from spending money \nto undermine an entirely legal fight for survival that is being waged \nin Africa today.\n  It is legal. It is the right thing to do. And ultimately, it is in \nAmerica's interest, as healthier African people will undoubtedly lead \nto healthier African economies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from California. She seeks to address a most \ncritical problem, one that is unbelievable, as she pointed out, with 11 \nmillion a year dying from this disease.\n  We have been working. We expect to come together on an amendment that \nwill be acceptable to both sides.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman very much. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan \nGreenspan has said numerous times that increased trade has raised the \nstandard of living and the quality of life for almost all countries \ninvolved in trade, and especially the quality of life in our own \ncountry. Chairman Greenspan believes the No. 1 benefit of trade is not \nsimply jobs but an enhanced standard of living. I can think of no more \nimportant enhancement to the standard of living of America's hardest \npressed working families than to increase the minimum wage. Surely, it \nis appropriate to send a message on this legislation that increased \ntrade must definitely mean a better quality of life for the working \npoor.\n  I had hoped to offer an amendment to this bill to raise the minimum \nwage. Regrettably, it was perhaps the only vehicle that was going to be \nleft in this year of this particular session. But the majority leader's \nactions prevented me from doing that. This trade bill has been offered \nto enhance the standard of living for workers in Africa and the \nCaribbean. I am certainly in favor of that. But there are honest \ndisagreements as to whether the proposal before us effectively does so.\n  While we express our concern for the workers in these nations, we \ncannot forget the workers in our own country. I believe the American \npeople will hold this Congress responsible for refusing to address so \nmany issues which are critical to our families and our communities, and \nthe majority, I believe, has once again turned a deaf ear to the pleas \nof the American people for action. I regret this latest missed \nopportunity.\n  I take this opportunity as we are coming into the final days of this \ncongressional year to express what I know has to be the frustration of \nabout 12 million Americans who had hoped this Congress would have \nraised the minimum wage, or at least had the opportunity to debate this \nissue and discuss this issue and consider this issue during this past \nsummer, or this past fall, or even prior to the time that we were going \nto go into recess. But we have been denied the opportunity to do so. \nEvery legislative possibility has been excluded from us doing so up to \nthis time, and even excluded on this piece of legislation.\n  I join with all of those who share this enormous frustration and a \ncertain amount of disgust at the way this issue is being treated as we \nare moving into these final days.\n  We now have seen some modification or adjustment to prior positions \nof opposition to any increase in the minimum wage which had been \nexpressed by the Republican leadership in the House and also in the \nSenate. Now, evidently, there is a bidding war in the House of \nRepresentatives--hopefully, it won't take place in the Senate, but \ncertainly in the House of Representatives--about not what we can do for \nthe working poor but how many additional tax breaks we can add on to \nthe minimum wage when we consider it in the House of Representatives.\n  If we extend the minimum wage over a longer period of time, for some \n3 years, actually the benefits that special interests would receive by \nthe tax considerations, which in the House position would reach $100 \nbillion over 10 years, which isn't paid for, the only way you could \nassume they could be paid for would be out of Social Security because \nit is not paid for--and the bidding war wants to keep adding that until \nfinally, evidently, the financial interests, which are the most opposed \nto any increase in the minimum wage, would finally say: All right, \nlet's go ahead because the benefits we are going to receive so exceed \nand outweigh the modest increase in the increase in the minimum wage \nthat it is worthwhile.\n  As we are coming to the end of this session, we are finding that this \nSenate refuses to address an issue which cries out for fairness and \ndecency as the minimum wage slips further and further back for working \nfamilies at the lower end of the economic ladder, who are in many \ninstances doing such important work as teachers aides in the classrooms \nof this country, are doing important work in nursing homes and looking \nafter the elderly people, or working in the great buildings of this \ncountry at nighttime in order to clean them so the American economy and \nefficiency can continue during the course of the day, that we have \ndecided in this body evidently that we are going to leave this session \ngranting ourselves a $4,600 pay increase and denying a one dollar-an-\nhour pay increase for over 11 million of our fellow citizens who are \nworking at the lower rung of the economic ladder. That is not right. \nThat is not fair. That is wrong.\n\n  We ask ourselves: Why should this be the case? Certainly we have not \nheard those who have resisted us in bringing this matter to the floor \nmake the economic argument that, well, this will mean an increase in \nthe numbers of unemployed Americans. They haven't been willing to make \nthat. They have made it at other times, and it was so totally refuted \nduring the last increases in the minimum wage that they evidently are \nnot prepared to come out and debate that issue.\n  The other argument, that it was going to be an inflator in terms of \nour general economy, has been refuted completely, as a practical \nmatter. The last time we raised the minimum wage it was demonstrated \neffectively that there was virtually no increase in the cost of living. \nWe are denied the opportunity of even hearing a well thought out \nargument for opposing the minimum wage. All we hear is the same, tired, \nold arguments that have been disproved time in and time out.\n  What we see as a result is that without the increase in the minimum \nwage, there is a continued deterioration in the purchasing power of the \nminimum-wage workers. Even without the minimum wage, if we did not \nconsider it until even 2000 or 2001, we would be back to $4.80 an hour, \nclose to the lowest point in the last 40 years of minimum wage, at a \ntime of unprecedented economic prosperity for everyone except those at \nthe lowest rung of the economic ladder.\n  We will not even debate the issue. If Members want to vote against \nit, they can do so, but why deny Members the opportunity to debate the \nissue and take the time on this particular measure? Members cannot make \nthe argument that it will take a lot of time after what we have gone \nthrough in the past days where, effectively, from a parliamentary point \nof view, we were in a stalemate in the Senate without any amendments \nbeing even considered on the trade bill for a number of days.\n  We could have dealt with this issue in a matter of hours. We are \ncertainly prepared to deal with this issue in a relatively short time \nperiod--a few hours if necessary. Obviously, the majority, the \nRepublicans, retain their rights in terms of a very modest increase in \nthe minimum wage, 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year. \nThat is too high for our Republican friends. We can debate that and at \nleast have the Senate work its will. The position taken by the \nRepublican leadership on the other side has been, if we are going to \nextend it, they will deny us the opportunity to bring the minimum wage \nup this year. If we bring it up at the end of the session, we will put \nit, effectively, well into next year and carry it on to the following \nyear, which will extend it perhaps $1.00 over 5 years.\n\n[[Page S13740]]\n\n  Still, we will carry on the tax goodies which, over a 10-year period \nin the proposal recommended by the Republican leadership, will be $100 \nbillion in tax breaks for the special interests. That is what is \nhappening. That is what is so unacceptable.\n  This morning, there was an excellent editorial in the Washington \nPost, and I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1999]\n\n                        The Minimum Wage Squeeze\n\n       The minimum wage should be increased, and the increase \n     should not become a political football. Unfortunately, there \n     is more than a little risk that it will become a football in \n     the remaining days of the session.\n       The wage, now $5.15 an hour, was last increased in 1997. \n     The president has proposed taking it up another dollar an \n     hour: 50 cents next Jan. 1 and 50 cents a year thereafter. \n     Republicans and some Democrats would spread the increase over \n     an additional year. That's something reasonable people can \n     disagree about. The wage ought not be allowed to lose ground \n     to inflation, and perhaps in real terms ought to be a set \n     higher than it has been in recent years, though the \n     government powerfully supplements it with the earned-income \n     tax credit, food stamps and other benefits.\n       The wage itself, however, has become almost a secondary \n     issue. Those sponsoring a slower increase also want to use \n     the bill as a vehicle for some of the tax cuts the president \n     vetoed earlier in the year. Ostensibly, these are to make \n     whole the smaller businesses that would have to pay the \n     higher wage. But the data suggest that little of the benefit \n     would go to such employers. These are costly cuts in the \n     estate tax, tax treatment of pension set-asides, etc., that \n     would mainly go to people of very high income. No provision \n     is made to offset the costs, which tend to be understated in \n     that early on they would be relatively low and only later \n     begin to rise.\n       The president has rightly threatened, mainly on these \n     fiscal grounds, to veto the bill. It may well be that the \n     bill will have to include some tax relief to pass, but the \n     relief should be targeted and paid for. The gatekeepers seek \n     too heavy a toll. The price of a bill to help the working \n     poor ought not be an indiscriminate tax cut for those at the \n     very top of the economic mountain.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This article reminds everyone how the interests of some \nof the hardest working Americans are being toyed with by the Republican \nleadership. They say maybe we will add a little more in terms of tax \nbreaks if we consider the increase in the minimum wage.\n  This increase is a matter of enormous importance and consequence for \nthe people receiving it. Sixty percent are women; over 75 percent of \nminimum wage workers heading up families are women. It is an issue in \nterms of children. It is a family issue. It is an issue relating to men \nand women of color since one-third of those who receive the minimum \nwage are men and women of color. It is a civil rights issue, a family \nissue, a children's issue, a women's issue. It is a fairness issue. Yet \nwe are denied it.\n  How quickly this institution went ahead with a $4,600-per-year \nincrease for their pay while denying this side the opportunity to vote \non 50 cents an hour over each of the next two years for the minimum-\nwage worker, an increase of $2,000 a year for people working at the \nlower end of the economic ladder. Yet, $4,600 for the Members of \nCongress.\n  It is wrong to play with the life and the well-being of these \nworkers. They are being toyed with by considering how much in \nadditional tax breaks we will provide for special interests. That is \nwhat the bidding is that is going on. It is not the Congress or \nleadership acting in these workers' best interest.\n  What does $2,000 mean to a minimum-wage family? The two increments, \nof 50 cents each, mean 7 months' of grocery. That means a lot to a \nfamily. It is 5 months of rent. It is 10 months of utilities. It is 18 \nmonths of tuition and fees at a 2-year college for a family of four \nliving on the minimum wage.\n  While many parts of our country have experienced the economic boom, \nwe have found another very important area of need for minimum-wage \nworkers: Housing. In so many areas of this country, the housing costs \nhave gone off the chart and are virtually out of the reach of the \nminimum-wage workers. The hours a minimum-wage worker would have to \nwork in Boston for a one-room apartment--100 a week. It is absolutely \nimpossible to understand why we are not dealing with this issue.\n  This chart/table shows what happened when we had the increase in the \nminimum wage in 1996 and 1997. The unemployment rates continued to go \ndown. This is true in the industry that has expressed the greatest \nreservation about a minimum-wage increase, the restaurant industry. \nThey have increased their total workers by 400,000 over the period \nsince the last increase in the minimum wage. They are out here day in \nand day out trying to undermine and lobby against the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  This is not just an issue in which Democrats are interested, although \nwe are interested in and we are committed to it. I daresay if we had a \nvote on an increase in the minimum wage, the way we have identified it, \nwe would get virtually every member of our party and perhaps a few \ncourageous Republicans as well.\n  This is what Business Week says about the increase in the minimum \nwage:\n\n       Old myths die hard. Old economic theories die even harder . \n     . . higher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. \n     Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher \n     minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.\n\n  This is from Business Week--not a labor organization, although they \nwould agree--from Business Week, which understands it. They have \nprobably reviewed carefully what happened in the State of Oregon that \nnow has the highest minimum wage with the largest growth rate in terms \nof reduction of unemployment when they introduced the minimum wage. \nWhy? Because people not working went into the labor market, it created \nmore economic activity, and they paid more in taxes. The whole economy \nmoved along together. We are glad to debate it if people want to \ndispute that.\n  What does this mean in people's lives?\n  Melissa Albis lives in North Adams, MA. She works for the local \nBurger King for $5.25 an hour. She has five children all under 12. She \nis struggling to pay her $550-a-month rent and is looking for less \nexpensive housing because she fears she and her children will be \nevicted if she cannot earn more.\n  Cathi Zeman, 52 years old, works at the Rite Aid in Canonsburg, PA, a \ntown near Pittsburgh. She earns $5.68 an hour: Base pay of $5.43, plus \n.25 for being a ``key carrier.'' Her husband has a heart condition and \nis only able to work sporadically, so she is the primary earner in her \nfamily. An increase in minimum wage means a lot to Cathi.\n  Shirley Briggs is a senior citizen living near Williamstown, MA. Her \nhusband passed away in 1982, and even though she has arthritis, she \nworks for $5.50 an hour to try to make ends meet. Even with supplement \nincome and Social Security, she has trouble paying for medicine. ``My \nincome is not enough to live.'' Minimum wage means a lot to Shirley.\n  Dianne Mitchell testified in June 1998 that she made $5.90 an hour at \na laundry in Brockton, MA. For Dianne, with three daughters and a \ngranddaughter, living on minimum wage is nervewracking. She is ``always \njuggling food and utilities,'' even having to choose one over the \nother. An increase in the minimum wage would give women like Dianne \npeace of mind--they could provide for their families.\n  Cordelia Bradley testified at a Senate forum last year she was \nworking at a clothing chain store outside of Philadelphia. She and her \nson lived in a rented room for $300 a month. She hoped to have her own \napartment, but at the current minimum wage that goal was out of reach.\n  Kimberly Frazier, also from Philadelphia, testified she was a full-\ntime child care aide earning $5.20. A child care aide, how many times \nare we going to hear long speeches about children and looking out for \nchildren; children are our future; we need to do more caring for \nchildren. Kimberly Frazier is earning $5.20 an hour as a full-time \nchild care aide. With three children, her pay barely covers the bills \nfor rent, food, utilities, and clothes for her children. For Kimberly \nand her family, a pay increase of $1 an hour could make a real \ndifference.\n  This is enormously important to individuals. Republicans want to see \nhow little they can do for the workers, and how much, evidently, they \ncan do for the corporations and special interests. You cannot look at \nthe conduct of leadership in these last 4 weeks and not\n\n[[Page S13741]]\n\nunderstand that is what is happening. The workers are being nickled and \ndimed. This is absolutely unacceptable.\n  We are going to continue. The days are going down, the hours are \ngoing down, but we are resolute in our determination, and we are not \ngoing to have a bidding war out here on the floor of the Senate on this \nissue. We are not going to permit the toying with the lives of American \nworkers who are playing by the rules, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks \na year, who want to provide for their children. They should not have to \nlive in poverty in the United States of America. By denying us the \nopportunity to do something about this, the leadership, Republican \nleadership, is denying us a chance to deal with that issue, and it is \nfundamentally and basically wrong.\n  I will speak just briefly on another matter.\n  In passing the Norwood-Dingell bill, a large bipartisan majority in \nthe House voted for strong patient protections against abuses by HMOs. \nDespite an extraordinary lobbying and disinformation campaign by the \nhealth insurance industry, the House approved the bill by a solid \nmajority of 275 to 151. Mr. President, 68 Republicans as well as almost \nevery Democrat in the House stood up for patients and stood up against \nindustry pressure.\n  Now the insurance industry and its friends in the Republican \nleadership are at it again. Their emerging strategy is, once again, to \ndelay and deny relief that American families need and that the House \noverwhelmingly approved. Every indication is that the intention of the \nRepublican leadership is to see that this legislation, as it passed the \nHouse of Representatives, will not reach the President for his \nsignature.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, Senator Lott's response to the \npassage of the House bill is that the House-Senate conferences on other \nlegislation have a higher priority and resolving the differences on \nthis bill will take some time.\n  According to the Baltimore Sun, Senator Lott also indicated Congress \nmight not have the time to work out differences or approve a final bill \nbefore it adjourns for the year. Senator Nickles said the conference \ncommittee will probably not begin serious work until early next year.\n  I say: Why don't we consider the House bill--the bill that passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly with 68 Republicans--a bipartisan bill with \nDemocrats and Republicans working together? Why don't we pass that in \nthe Senate this afternoon? We could do that. I certainly urge that we \ngo ahead and do that today. Every day we fail to pass the Patients' \nBill of Rights, we are permitting insurance company accountants to make \nmedical decisions that doctors and nurses and other trained medical \npersonnel should have the opportunity to make. That is why the \nPatients' Bill of Rights is so important.\n\n  We believe that medical professionals, trained, dedicated and \ncommitted to their patients, should make those decisions, not \naccountants. This chart shows what we will see as long as we permit \naccountants to make health care decisions. We are going to see about \n35,000 patients every single day will have needed care delayed. \nSpecialty referrals will be denied to 35,000 patients. It may be that a \nchild with cancer will see a pediatrician but doesn't get the necessary \nreferral to see a pediatric oncologist. Mr. President, 31,000 patients \nare forced to change doctors every day; 18,000 are forced to change \nmedication because the HMOs refused to reimburse the medicine their \nphysician prescribed. The final result is that 59,000 Americans every \nday experience unnecessary added pain and suffering; 41,000 Americans \nsee their conditions worsen every day that we fail to act.\n  We still have time to act in the final days of this session. \nRepublicans are beginning to lay the groundwork for a failed \nconference. Comparing the Senate and House bills, Congressman Bill \nThomas says you don't see many crossbreeds between Chihuahuas and Great \nDanes walking around. That is quite a quote--we don't see many \ncrossbreeds between Chihuahuas and Great Danes walking around.\n  I say, let's do what every health care professional organization in \nthe United States has urged us to do, and pass the House bill. I am \nstill waiting for the other side to list one major or minor health \norganization that supports their proposal: Zero, none, none. Every one \nof them--every doctors' organization, patients' organization, nursing \norganization, children's organization, women's health organization, \nconsumer organization--supports our proposal.\n  Here is how Bruce Johnston of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce put it:\n\n       To see nothing come out of the conference is my hope. The \n     best outcome is no outcome. But if the strategy of delay and \n     denial ultimately breaks down, the Republican leadership once \n     again has an alternative to try to weaken the House bill as \n     much as possible.\n\n  As the Baltimore Sun reported:\n\n       The House majority whip suggested the Republican-dominated \n     House conference would not fight vigorously for the House-\n     approved measure in the conference committee. Mr. DeLay said, \n     ``Remember who controls the conference: the Speaker of the \n     House.''\n\n  That ought to give a lot of satisfaction to parents who are concerned \nabout health care for their children. It ought to give a lot of \nsatisfaction to the doctors who are trying to provide the best health \ncare. This is what the House majority whip suggested: Remember who \ncontrols the conference: the Speaker of the House--unalterably opposed \nto the program.\n  The conference that produces legislation that looks like the Senate \nRepublican bill will break faith with the American people, make a \nmockery of the overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives, and \ncause unnecessary suffering for millions of patients. Every day we \ndelay in passing meaningful reforms means more patients will suffer and \ndie.\n  Finally, I do not think, when we consider minimum wage and consider \nhealth, we have addressed these issues in the last few days. These are \nthe matters about which most families are concerned. These are the \nissues they want addressed. The Republican leadership is considering \nwhat they will do on the bankruptcy issue. We have seen great economic \nprosperity. Do you know who is going bankrupt, by and large? It is the \nmen and women who have lost out in the mergers, the supermergers that \nhave brought extraordinary wealth and accumulation of wealth to \nindividual stockholders. It is families who have had to pay increased \ncosts for prescription drugs. It is women who are not receiving their \nalimony payments or women who are not getting child care support--there \nare some 400,000 of them. These are the individuals who are going into \nbankruptcy. Their needs should be protected.\n\n  We have to ask ourselves, if we are going to call bankruptcy up, why \naren't we dealing with minimum wage? Why aren't we working on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Why are we not coming to grips with these \nissues, which are at the center of every working family's hopes and \ndreams.\n  In the months since the House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill and the \nRepublican leadership has failed to allow a conference to proceed, 1 \nmillion patients have had needed care delayed; 1 million patients have \nbeen denied or delayed referral to a specialist; 940,000 patients have \nbeen forced to change doctors; more than 535,000 patients have been \nforced to change medication; Mr. President, 1.8 million patients have \nexperienced added pain and suffering as a result of health plan abuses, \nand 1.2 million patients have seen their conditions worsen because of \nhealth plan abuses.\n  In the final days of this Congress, we can still take some important \nsteps that will have a direct impact on the well-being of families who \nare at the lower end of the economic ladder. We can still take \nimportant steps that will have a direct impact on families who are \nfaced with health care challenges. We can have a positive impact. We \nhave had the hearings. We have had the debates. We have had the \ndeliberations. All we need is to have the vote the way the House of \nRepresentatives had the vote. We can pass what has been a bipartisan \nbill in the House of Representatives in a matter of a few short hours.\n  The Republican leadership has waited a month since the House bill was \npassed to start this conference, effectively pushing action to next \nFebruary at the earliest. Today is another litmus test of their \nintention with the appointment of House conferees. We expect those \nconferees to be stacked against meaningful reform.\n  We are prepared to participate in a fair conference, and we are \nwilling to\n\n[[Page S13742]]\n\nenter into a reasonable compromise, but we are sending notice today \nthat we will not tolerate a charade designed only to protect insurance \ncompany profits while patients continue to suffer. We will come back to \nthis issue over and over until the American people prevail.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2408\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to very much thank the \nchairman and manager of the bill for accepting amendment No. 2408, \nwhich I offered and was cosponsored by Senator Durbin of Illinois, with \nregard to anticorruption efforts and the desire to do something about \nthe fact that bribery is an important problem worldwide. It poisons the \nbusiness environment and distorts the normal practices of the \nmarketplace. Bribery undermines democracy and leads to a lower global \neconomy, and when corruption goes unchecked, everybody loses.\n  To pass the U.S. trade package without addressing corruption simply \ndoesn't make sense, particularly if the package claims to actually \npromote growth and opportunity in Africa. Of the 16 sub-Saharan African \nstates rated in the Transparency International 1999 Corruption \nPerception Index, 12 ranked in the bottom half.\n  The amendment Senator Durbin and I have offered expresses a sense of \nCongress that the United States should encourage the accession of sub-\nSaharan African companies to the OECD Convention combating bribery of \nforeign officials in international business transactions. The OECD \nConvention criminalizes bribery of foreign officials to influence or \nretain business. Some have had said OECD standards are too demanding \nfor the developing economies of Africa. But if we are going to engage \nin a new economic partnership with Africa, I think we need to leave \nthis double standard behind. Transparency, integrity, and the rule of \nlaw are as important in Mali and Botswana as they are right here at \nhome.\n  Ever since Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, \nunder the leadership of one of my predecessors, Senator William \nProxmire of Wisconsin, we have shared a consensus in this country that \neconomic relations depend upon a foundation of fair play. This \namendment incorporates that reality in African trade regulations. This \nanticorruption amendment also sends an important signal. It tells sub-\nSaharan states that responsibilities come with benefits in any trade \npartnership. If this Congress is serious about engaging Africa \neconomically, we have to make these responsibilities crystal clear.\n  I, again, thank the Chair for accepting this amendment. I also \ncommend Senator Durbin, who has taken the lead--and I joined him--on \nanother amendment having to do with this corruption issue. I am hopeful \nand optimistic that item will be accepted as well.\n  We have provided two different important provisions that will move \nforward with regard to the corruption problem in general and \nspecifically with regard to the African nations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2409\n\n(Purpose: To establish priorities for providing development assistance)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with regard to amendment No. 2409, I \nurge Members to look at the Statement of Policy in the text of the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act. In this section the bill asserts \ncongressional support for a series of noble causes, such as supporting \nthe development of civil societies and political freedom in the region, \nand focusing on countries committed to accountable government and the \neradication of poverty.\n\n  But then those causes seem to disappear. The implication is that the \nUnited States plans to support for these worthy goals--goals that are \nin our own self-interest--through a series of limited trade benefits.\n  Nowhere does AGOA mention the role that development assistance plays \nin pursuing the very ends that it advocates--the eradication of poverty \nand the development of civil society.\n  This omission sends an alarming signal. It suggests that the United \nStates may delude itself into thinking that trade alone will stimulate \nAfrican development.\n  Trade alone cannot address the crippling effects of the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic, which has lowered life expectancies by as much as seventeen \nyears in some African countries. Striking at the most productive \nsegment of society--young adults--HIV/AIDS has dealt a brutal blow to \nAfrican economic development, and has left a generation of orphans in \nits wake.\n  And trade alone will not provide sufficient access to education or to \nreproductive health services for African women--yet both elements are \ncrucial to developing Africa's human resources.\n  This amendment expresses a sense of Congress that the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic and chronic food insecurity should be key priorities in U.S. \nassistance to Africa. It also prioritizes voluntary family planning \nservices, including access to prenatal healthcare; education and \nvocational training, particularly for women; and programs designed to \ndevelop income-generating opportunities, such as micro-credit projects.\n  This amendment also mandates that the Development Fund for Africa be \nre-established for aid authorized specifically for African-related \nobjectives. The DFA allows USAID more flexibility in its Africa \nprogram. Perhaps most importantly, it is symbolic of U.S. commitment to \nAfrican development.\n  In addition, my amendment requires USAID to submit a report to help \nthe United States to get smarter about how it administers development \nassistance, and will ensure that our assistance fosters dynamic civil \nsocieties across the diverse nations of Africa.\n  This amendment sends an important signal. Even as the United States \nconsiders closer trade relations with sub-Saharan Africa, this country \nwill not abandon its commitment to responsible and well-monitored \ndevelopment assistance.\n  Mr. President, I understand that a point of order is likely to be \nraised to this amendment. I understand the consequence of that. But I \nwant to offer the amendment. I call up amendment No. 2409.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2409.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n\n   TITLE __--DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES\n\n     SEC. __01. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In addition to drought and famine, the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic has caused countless deaths and untold suffering \n     among the people of sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (2) The Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that \n     543,000,000 people, representing nearly 40 percent of the \n     population of sub-Saharan Africa, are chronically \n     undernourished.\n       (b) Amendment to Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--Section \n     496(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2293(a)(1)) is amended by striking ``drought and famine'' and \n     inserting ``drought, famine, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic''.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Continued dumping and subsidy offset.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to all antidumping and \n     countervailing duty assessments made on or after October 1, \n     1996.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as noted, there are two modifications to \nthe amendment. They are minor modifications. One relates to the court \nwhich will have jurisdiction. Instead of the Court of International \nTrade, it will be the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \nAnd the second is the striking of language citing antitrust laws, which \nhas been deleted to avoid any possible question as to whether this is a \nFinance Committee jurisdictional matter and appropriate amendment for \nthis bill.\n  The essence of this bill is to provide a private right of action to \ndamaged, injured parties when goods are imported into the United States \nwhich are dumped in violation of U.S. trade laws and in violation of \ninternational trade laws. Many American industries have been decimated \nas a result of this illegal practice, and the existing remedies are \ntotally insufficient to provide adequate safeguards for the violation \nof these trade laws.\n  This bill does not deal with any issue of inappropriate consideration \nfor domestic industries and is really not protectionist, as that term \nhas been traditionally defined. The international trade laws are \nspecific that the goods ought not to be sold in the United States at a \nlower price than they are sold in the country from which the exports \nare made and imported into the United States. Our trade laws in the \nUnited States preclude dumped goods from coming into this country. \nInternational trade laws preclude dumped goods.\n  This is an approach I have been advocating for more than 17 years \nnow, with my initial bill having been introduced in the 97th Congress, \nS. 2167, on March 4, 1983. I followed up with similar legislation in \nthe 98th Congress, S. 418 on February 3, 1983; in the 99th Congress, \nwith S. 236; in the 100th Congress, with S. 361; in the 102d Congress, \nwith S. 2508. The thrust has always been the same, that is to provide a \nprivate right of action so injured parties could go into Federal court \nand secure redress on their legal rights because the proceedings \nthrough section 201, through the Department of Commerce, through the \nInternational Trade Commission, are so long that they are virtually \nineffective.\n  If an injured party goes into the Federal court under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, it is possible to get a temporary restraining \norder on affidavits within 5 days, then a prompt preliminary hearing \nand a preliminary injunction and prompt equitable proceedings for a \npermanent injunction.\n  The initial legislation, which was introduced back in 1982, called \nfor injunctive relief. The pending amendment provides for a remedy of \nduties or tariffs equal to the amount of the dumping, the difference \nbetween what the product would be sold at in the United States compared \nto what the product is being sold at in the home country.\n  I have a list of antidumping duty orders in effect on March 1, 1999. \nI ask unanimous consent this list be printed in the Congressional \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the 5 pages which I am submitting, \nthere are some 290 items which are being subjected to the antidumping \norders as of March 1 of this year.\n  Some illustrative provisions: In Argentina, there is a dumping order \non carbon steel; as to Bangladesh, a dumping order on cotton shop \ntowels; Belgium, a dumping order on sugar; Canada, a dumping order on \nred raspberries; Chile, a dumping order on fresh cut flowers; China, a \ndumping order on garlic. So the list goes on and on and on.\n  When I testified at the hearing before the Finance Committee in favor \nof this bill, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, made a comment \nthat this kind of provision might well be applied to wheat and wheat \nfarmers, where they are subjected to dumping from other countries. I \nsuggest to my colleagues who are listening to this on C-SPAN, or to the \nstaffs, that there is hardly a State--there may be no State--which is \nunaffected by dumping where goods come in from a foreign country and \nare sold in the United States at a price lower than they are being sold \nin the foreign country in violation of U.S. trade laws and in violation \nof international trade laws.\n\n  The remedy has been modified to provide for the duties or tariffs, as \nI have stated, in order to comply with GATT, because a question had \narisen as to whether injunctive relief was appropriate under GATT. I \nfrankly believe it is. But to avoid any problem, the relief has been \nmodified to duties or tariffs.\n  The difficulty with the proceedings with the existing laws is the \ntremendous length of time which is taken. For an illustration, there \nwas an antidumping order issued as to salmon. It was initiated on July \n10, 1997. The order was finally issued on July 30, 1998--time elapsed, \n380 days.\n  A second illustrative case involved garlic from China, initiated on \nFebruary 28, 1994; the order issued on November 16, 1994--200 days.\n  A third illustration, magnesium from Ukraine: Initiated April 26, \n1994; the order issued May 12, 1995--360 days.\n  Hot rolled steel from Japan: The initiation of the action was October \n27, 1998; the order issued on June 19, 1999. These are only \nillustrative of the enormous lapse in time.\n  Contrasted with what can happen in a court of equity, a temporary \nrestraining order can be issued within 5 days on affidavits, prompt \nproceedings for preliminary injunctions, prompt proceedings for \ninjunctive relief generally.\n  The difficulty with existing law is that the decisions are made based \nupon political considerations and foreign relations, and not based upon \nwhat is right for American industries who are being undersold by these \ndumped goods and have suffered a tremendous loss of employment.\n  My State, Pennsylvania, has been victimized by dumping for the past 2 \ndecades. Two decades ago, the American steel industry employed some \n500,000 individuals. Today that number has dwindled to 160,000, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the American steel industry has spent \nsome $50 billion in modernizing.\n  Under existing laws, the executive branch has the authority to issue \nsuspension agreements. One illustration of that was a suspension \nagreement issued on July 13 of this year when Secretary Daley announced \nthe United States and Russia had reached agreements to reduce imports \nof steel. That was immediately followed by strenuous objections by a \nnumber of steel companies operating out of my State, Pennsylvania--\nBethlehem Steel, LTV, National Steel Corporation, U.S. Steel Group--\nwhere they made strenuous objection to these suspension agreements \nwhich undermine the effectiveness and credibility of U.S. trade laws \nand a rule-based international trade system.\n  I recall, in 1984, a time when the American steel industry was \nespecially hard hit by imports, dumped imports.\n  The International Trade Commission had issued an order 3-2 in favor \nof the position of American Steel. The President had the authority to \noverrule that decision. Senator Heinz and I then made the rounds and \ntalked to International Trade Representative Brock who agreed that the \nInternational Trade Commission order in favor of American Steel should \nbe upheld. We talked to Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige who \nsimilarly agreed. We then talked to Secretary of State George Shultz \nwho disagreed, as did Secretary of Defense Weinberger, with Secretary \nof State Shultz putting it on\n\n[[Page S13747]]\n\ngrounds of U.S. foreign policy and Secretary of Defense Weinberger \nputting it on grounds of U.S. defense policy.\n  When these matters are left to the executive branch, the executive \nbranch inevitably does a balancing of what is happening in Russia, what \nis happening in Argentina, what is happening in Japan, what is \nhappening in Korea.\n  It is certainly true that when the suspension agreements were entered \ninto by Secretary Daley on July 13, 1999, the Russian economy was in a \nprecarious state, but then so were certain aspects of the economy of \nwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The thrust of taking the matter to the courts is that justice will be \ndone in accordance with existing law, contrasted with what the \ndesirability may be for U.S. foreign policy or for U.S. defense policy.\n  There is stated from time to time a reluctance to take matters to the \ncourt, but my own view, having had substantial practice in the Federal \ncourts as well as the State courts, is that is where justice is done. \nIf there is a case that could be made to show there is a violation of \nU.S. trade laws and foreign trade laws on dumping, those legal \nprinciples will be administered by the courts. Where the wheat industry \nis being victimized by dumping or the steel industry is being \nvictimized by dumping or the sugar industry is being victimized by \ndumping or the fresh cut flower industry is being victimized by \ndumping, justice will be done in the Federal courts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                               ANTIDUMPING DUTY ORDERS IN EFFECT ON MARCH 1, 1999\n                   [Duty orders revoked by Sunset Review remain in effect until Jan. 1, 2000]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    CASE NUM AND COUNTRY                                     PRODUCT                   DAT INI\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA-357-007  ARGENTINA.......................................

The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's \namendment. I do so do for three reasons. First, there is no evidence \nthat the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws have failed \nto deliver relief to injured industries. My colleague argues that the \namendment is required to address the unfair trade practices facing the \nsteel industry. I would have preferred not to have to revisit the many \npoints that were made in the context of the debate over the steel quota \nlegislation this past summer. This bill is about trade and investment \nwith Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. I prefer we keep our \nfocus there. That said, since my colleague's amendment has raised those \nissues before us yet again, I think it is important to remind my \ncolleagues about the points that were made at length in this past \nsummer's debate.\n  You may recall that, at the time, the steel industry and the \nsteelworkers made the point that they faced a sudden surge of increased \nimports of steel and were sufficiently threatened that they sought to \nimpose direct quotas on imports of various steel products. They argued \nthat the existing import relief laws were inadequate to the task of \naddressing that surge. What the debate revealed was quite a different \nstory. In fact, while imports into the United States did surge \ndramatically in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, they then \ndropped precipitously in response to the filing of a series of \nantidumping measures. Imports have continued that downward trend as a \nresult of those unfair trade actions and the suspension agreements \nnegotiated by the Commerce Department that effectively blocked any \nfurther imports of hot and cold rolled products from Russia and other \ncountries engaged in below cost sales into the United States market. \nWhat lessons should we draw from that\n\n[[Page S13750]]\n\nexperience? One is that the existing laws work exactly as they are \nintended. They provide an effective and efficient means of obtaining \nrelief from unfairly dumped or subsidized imports. Indeed, as the Wall \nStreet Journal pointed out in an article published in the midst of the \nsteel industry's filing of dumping actions this past year, the mere \nfiling of an unfair trade action under existing laws has a dramatic \nimpact on prices. The article quoted Curtiss Barnette, the chief \nexecutive of Bethlehem Steel as acknowledging that trade cases had \nbecome a ``part of the Bethlehem's ``normal business-planning \nprocess,'' and acknowledging that, even where dumping actions failed, \n``You have won some interim relief and you have said you're going to \nprotect your rights.''\n  Nicholas Tolerico, executive vice president of Thyssen, a Detroit-\nbased steel processing and importing unit of a German steelmaker, made \nthe point even more emphatically. He indicated that, among importers \nfaced with the prospect of an antidumping action, ``the response is \njust to stop importing.'' The same holds true for foreign exporters \nfaced with unfair trade complaints even when they eventually win \ncases. The article quoted the chairman of Ispat International, one of \nthe largest steel manufacturers in the world to the effect that his \ncompany had cut exports to the United States from a wire-rod mill in \nTrinidad and Tobago by 40 percent simply due to the risk inherent in \ntrade litigation even though Trinidad's steelmakers eventually won the \ncase. Why is that the case? Some statistics might help here.\n\n  The reason that both exporters and importers of steel halt trade the \nminute a trade case is filed is because of the record compiled by U.S. \nindustry. The Department of Commerce grants relief to the petitioning \nindustry in over 90 percent of the cases filed under the antidumping \nand countervailing duty laws. Due to the deference that the Court of \nInternational Trade is obliged to pay to the Commerce Department's \ndecisions under current law, the Department's decisions are upheld over \n90 percent of the time. In other words, if you are an exporter of steel \nfacing an unfair trade action in the United States, there is a 9 in 10 \nchance that you will face some considerable penalty. Given that steel \nis a commodity product, and microeconomic theory would dictate that all \nsuch products would be priced to the margin, you, as the foreign \nexporter, are likely to find yourself priced out of the competitive \nU.S. market with even a slight dumping our countervailing duty added \nonto the price of your current shipments.\n  Now, let's look at it from an importer's perspective. Let's say you \nare in the automobile industry in the United States, or one of the \nother steel consuming industries that employ more than 40 persons in \nthe United States for every person employed in the steel industry here. \nIn fact, let's say you are the plant manager for the Dodge Durango \nplant in Delaware and you are operating as efficiently as you possibly \ncan to compete with your competition in the hotly contested market for \nsport utility vehicles. You operate on the basis of ``just in time'' \ndelivery to ensure that you carry as little inventory as possible. You \ndo that, in part, to reduce the associated costs and, in part, to take \nadvantage of any change in prices for component parts that may help you \ncompete in your market. That, however, can make you more vulnerable to \nprice swings in the market for component parts. Then, suddenly, the \nsteel industry files a series of dumping actions. Do you continue to \nimport steel when you could be faced with a dramatic increase in price \nif the case succeeds? No. You stop importing from the targeted country \nor companies in order to reduce your risk.\n  The net result is that the cases filed before the Commerce Department \nbegin to raise prices as soon as they are filed simply because the \nmarket is responding to the fact that the Commerce Department, 9 cases \nout of 10, is going to impose a significant penalty at the end of the \nday. Now, would the result be the same if these cases were litigated \nbefore the Federal courts, as my colleague's amendment would require? I \nstrongly doubt that. The cases are complex, the facts frequently are in \ndispute, and the outcome less assured because of the nature of the \nlitigation process.\n  Those who have spent time litigating in the Federal courts tell me \nthat they do not quote odds on cases to their clients even on sure \nwinners due solely to the risks of litigation. Those with experience \nlitigating before Federal courts tell me that the likely result of a \nshift of jurisdiction from the administrative agencies to the courts \nwould be a more intrusive review--without the deference the courts \ncurrently pay to Commerce Department decisions. The net result would be \ngreater uncertainty as to the result in these cases, which, for the \nsteel industry, would ultimately spell a less reliable outcome than \nthey currently achieve before the administrative agencies.\n\n  In short, the dumping and countervailing duty laws appear to be \nworking as designed and the change suggested by my colleague would \nsimply increase the uncertainty of the outcome from the steel \nindustry's perspective. Second, there is no evidence that shifting the \nburden of investigating foreign unfair trade practices to the courts \nwould in any way enhance the prospect for prompt relief. At hearings \nearlier this year before the Finance Committee, those who have \nlitigated under the ``rocket docket'' at the Commerce Department and \nthe International Trade Commission have complained about the fact that \nthey do not get relief as promptly as they like. But, no one suggested \nthat a shift of jurisdiction to the courts would some how improve the \nsituation. Given the record of the courts in handling complex economic \nlitigation in other areas, it is not clear to me that shifting the \nburden of the initial investigation to the courts, with any allowance \nat all for the normal process of discovery between private litigants, \nwould provide a benefit to the petitioning industry in these cases.\n  While both petitioners and respondents complain about their treatment \nbefore the administrative agencies, largely due to what they consider \nto be the arbitrary basis for their decisions, both sides to the \nlitigation seem to agree that the cases themselves are completed as \nrapidly as possible. That not only helps provide relief to the \npetitioning industry on as timely a basis as practical, it also has the \nsignificant benefit of deciding the issue for the rest of the players \nin the marketplace. What that really does is reduce the uncertainty in \nthe market that the filing of the case creates. So the plant manager at \nthe Dodge Durango facility in Delaware can rely on decisions in making \nhis own assessment of who to purchase steel from for the coming \nproduction run.\n  Finally, let me say that my colleague's proposal may simply be ahead \nof its time. What it suggests is something akin to an antitrust \nremedy--in other words, litigation between private parties that reduces \nthe Government's role in the process. I personally think that there \nwould be real merit to examining that sort of proposal in the Finance \nCommittee in the future. And I would welcome the opportunity to do so \nrather than forcing a vote on the proposal today. The reason I say that \nthe proposal may be ahead of its time is that an antitrust remedy is \nrelevant when the actions involved are solely those of private parties. \nThat is not the case with most foreign unfair trade practices today. \nEven dumping is not solely a function of private pricing decisions by \nforeign producers. As long as governments continue to distort markets, \nwhether through high import tariffs on U.S. steel exports or heavy \nsubsidies to their own domestic producers, prices in the marketplace \nfor products like steel will not equilibrate based solely on private \nactions.\n  Thus, for example, dumping is often the result of a country \nmaintaining a closed market in which its companies can maintain a \nrelatively high profit margin, which effectively allows those producers \nto cross-subsidize their exports to the United States. A private right \nof action does not reach that conduct. That is conduct that the United \nStates must address at its root--which is the government-induced \ndistortion of the market, rather than the private pricing decisions of \nthe foreign producers.\n  What that means for the propose shift of the jurisdiction to the \nFederal courts proposed by my distinguished colleague's amendment is \nthat it is premature. Neither he nor I would suggest that the steel \nindustry's current\n\n[[Page S13751]]\n\nconditions are shaped solely by private pricing decisions. In fact, the \nprincipal problem facing the steel industry is the global overcapacity \ncreated by government protection of their home markets and \nsubsidization of their exports to our shores. I therefore, ask my \ncolleague to withdraw his amendment in order that the Finance Committee \ncould take a look at the proposal and explore the ramifications of the \nfar-sighted suggestions in greater depth. Failing that, I must oppose \nthe amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I join in the Chairman's request and also in his very \nproper remarks about the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. I believe it \nhas been since 1982 that the Senator began offering amendments to this \neffect. The antidumping laws themselves have a much longer history and \nhave been through several major revisions, most recently in the Uruguay \nRound, which we implemented in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in \n1994.\n  I think the idea of looking into this, as the Chairman suggests, is a \nvery good one. But for the moment, sir, it is ineluctably the case that \nthe amendment, as drafted, is inconsistent with the World Trade \nOrganization's antidumping agreement in a number of significant ways. \nIt does not say that we are wrong, but that we would be up against the \nagreed-upon international trading rules.\n  We have an international meeting of the World Trade Organization at \nthe end of this month in Seattle. I do not think we should arrive there \nthis way, particularly as other countries are seeking to reopen \nnegotiations once again on these issues, arguing that they are an \nantiquated idea.\n  So I join in expressing the hope that the amendment might be \nwithdrawn. We can take the idea with us to Seattle as something for \nother countries to consider when they approach our Government about \nmodifying our existing laws.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the antidumping procedures are not \nantiquated at all. I have noted some 290 antidumping orders in effect \nas of March 1 of 1999 dealing with a wide variety of products: Steel, \nsugar, towels, raspberries, fresh cut flowers--the list goes on and on.\n  The grave difficulty is that the enforcement rests with the executive \nbranch, and the executive branch is more concerned with foreign policy \nmatters and defense policy than with any specific U.S. industry.\n  The trade-off is made, decimating industries and costing thousands of \njobs in an unfair way. As of July 12 of this year, there were \nbankruptcies of five medium-size steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede \nSteel, Gulf States, Qualtech, and Geneva.\n  When the argument is made that there will be an effect on prices of \nautomobile manufacturers, that is true. But our laws are designed to \nprovide fairness as fairness and justice relate to the steel industry \nand the auto industry. The auto industry ought not to be able to buy \nsteel from a foreign importer where it is dumped--sold in the United \nStates at a price lower than it is sold in the foreign country.\n  When the distinguished chairman of the committee makes a reference to \nwire rod, it ought to be noted that steel wire rods continued at record \nhigh levels, more than 14 percent over levels about a year ago in \nSeptember of 1998. The wire rod industry has sustained serious damage, \nlosses of some $94 million during the first half of 1999. A petition \nwas filed on December 30, 1998, and the President, expected to make his \ndetermination by September 27, 1999, to postpone that decision, on \nSeptember 28, claimed that the matter was still under review. To date, \nthere hasn't been a decision.\n  Contrast that with what could be obtained in a court of equity, where \na decision could be made on affidavits on an ex parte order in 5 days, \nwithin a few weeks on a preliminary injunction. It is not true that the \nFederal courts are unable to handle these serious matters. They do \nhandle complicated antitrust matters all the time and deal with complex \neconomic matters. If a damaged party is in a position to prove the \ncase, they move into court and get a prompt decision in a court of \nequity, certainly nothing like a year's delay.\n  The line pipe industry filed a section 201 petition with the ITC \nclaiming that, in 1998, some 331,000 net tons of lime pipe had been \nimported into U.S. markets at an increase of 49.5 percent over 1997. \nThis petition was filed on June 30, 1999. The ITC issued an affirmative \nfinding on October 28, 1999, but the President is not expected to \nreview the matter until December 17 of this year, long after an \nequitable court would have been able to take care of it.\n  The lamb issue is similar. On September 30, 1998, the American sheep \nindustry filed a section 201 petition to stop the flood of imported \nlamb into the United States. During the 1998 Easter/Passover season, \nU.S. slaughtered lamb prices were at a 4-year low, some 60 cents a \npounds. On March 26, 1999, the ITC unanimously decided in favor of the \nindustry and forwarded its recommendation to the President for decision \nby late May. In this case, the President did not make a decision to \nprovide relief to the industry until July 7, 1999, which shows the \nenormous delay in proceedings under the International Trade Commission.\n  When the suggestion is made about having the matter taken up in \nSeattle, the grave difficulty is that the international trade \nagreements leave the ultimate discretion with the executive branch, and \nthat works to the disadvantage of the American company and the American \nworkers. We have provided that there would not be an opportunity for \njudge shopping, to go into a court in a jurisdiction where the industry \nwas located where most of the damage had been done, by providing that \nthe jurisdiction would be lodged in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I think it is a matter of fundamental fairness as to whether our \ntrade laws will be enforced, our trade laws consistent with GATT.\n  We see, again and again, enormous delays, very little effect, and \nthen the executive branch taking over with suspension agreements to \nprotect the Russians instead of seeing to it that there is justice for \nAmerican industry and for American workers. This goes far beyond the \nquestion of steel, which is a major matter in my State. It goes to \nvirtually every product on the books, as illustrated by the some 290 \nproducts which are subjected to antidumping orders in effect as of \nMarch 1, 1999.\n\n  This is an idea I have been pushing since 1982. My own experience in \nthe court system, as a trial lawyer, shows me that when you go to \ncourt, you get the laws enforced--you have justice--contrasted with the \nexecutive branch decision, which will vary on many collateral \nconsiderations: U.S. foreign policy and U.S. defense policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What does it take for a sufficient second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One-fifth of those Senators present.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The determination is one-fifth of the Senators present?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Constitution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If there are two Senators present and both agree to a \nrollcall--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The presumption is that there are 51 Senators \npresent, and it takes 11 in order to get the yea and nay call.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is a rebuttable presumption, Mr. President. As the \nChair notes, there are not 51 Senators present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is precluded from determining who is \npresent without having a quorum call.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if the quorum shows there is not a quorum present, \nthen what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate cannot proceed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Except by unanimous consent to remove the quorum call?\n\n[[Page S13752]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And by----\n  Mr. SPECTER. At which point, the Chair could make a determination if \nthere were 51 Senators present until the quorum call, and with the 51 \nSenators not being present, the Senate could not proceed, so it is \ncircular.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those are the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I shall move to ask for the yeas and nays at a later \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2487\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak earlier about \nthe amendment I had introduced, and then we cut off the discussion to \nenable Senator Baucus to have a chance to speak on the floor. I look \nforward to comments by my colleague from Delaware, but I think what I \nwill first try to do is summarize this amendment and then hear what my \ncolleague, Senator Roth, has to say.\n  This amendment would provide for mutually beneficial trade \nrelations--that is what we talked about earlier--between the U.S. and \nCaribbean countries by rewarding those countries that comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor rights with increased access to \nthe U.S. market for certain textile goods.\n  Secondly, it would provide for enforceable labor standards. Before \nany of the CBI trade bill's benefits could go into effect, the \nSecretary of Labor would have to determine that a CBI country is \nproviding for enforcement of ILO core labor rights. The Secretary would \nmake this determination after consulting with labor officials in these \nother countries and after public comments. But the Secretary of Labor \nmakes the final decision. U.S. citizens would have a private right of \naction in district court to enforce these provisions.\n  This amendment would basically apply the labor standards of Senator \nFeingold's HOPE for Africa bill to CBI countries. Supporters of CBI \nparity claim that NAFTA-like benefits will help the Caribbean workers. \nI want to point out again--because I am an internationalist and I am \ninterested in mutually beneficial trade--that an October 1999 report on \nMexican maquiladoras by the Comite Fronterizo de Obreros shows that \nwages and conditions have actually deteriorated since NAFTA. If NAFTA \nhasn't helped Mexican workers, why would NAFTA parity help CBI workers? \nI already presented data this morning, and I won't do it again.\n  In October of 1999, the CFO Border Committee of Women Workers issued \na report detailing what happened to workers in the Mexican maquiladoras \nsince the passage of NAFTA. They found that the maquiladoras paid the \nlowest wages in Mexican industry; that real wages in Mexican \nmanufacturing have declined by more than 20 percent since 1994; that \nwage levels have come under attack whenever they are over the threshold \nconsidered competitive by the maquiladoras; that border workers have \nendured a sharp decline in their standard of living since NAFTA; that \nthe practice of using child labor in the maquilas is widespread; and \nthat in the name of NAFTA, Mexican companies, aided by their \ngovernment, are ``waging a tireless and surreptitious campaign of dirty \ntricks to stamp out unions in the maquiladoras.'' That is the report.\n  The same is true of the CBI countries. Those countries, which have \nthe fastest growth in exports to the United States, have experienced \nthe steepest decline in wages in the region. Honduran apparel exports \nto the United States increased 2,523 percent over the last 10 years but \nwages declined by 59 percent. In El Salvador, it was 2,512 percent and \nwages declined 27 percent. Jamaica had the least export growth, one \nreason being the rate of unionization in Jamaica.\n  You have average wages of 78 cents in Colombia, 69 cents in the \nDominican Republic, 30 cents in Guatemala, and 23 cents in Nicaragua.\n  Basically, what we are saying again to workers in our own country is, \nif you organize and try to bargain collectively to make a better wage, \nthese apparel companies will just go to these Caribbean countries. We \nwill just basically undercut your right to organize.\n  I am in favor of the right of people to organize in our country. What \nwe say to the workers in these countries is that if you want to make \nmore than 35 cents an hour, or 43 cents an hour, and you join a union, \nor try to bargain collectively, we will deny you your right to do so. \nWe don't have any enforceable labor standard to make sure these abuses \ndon't continue to take place.\n  Sometimes I think the wage earners in our country are portrayed in \nsome of this debate as if they are greedy or are portrayed as if they \nlook backward and they don't understand this new international economy. \nI think in many ways this debate is about that.\n  What would you think if you were working for $8.50 an hour and you \nsaw adopted on the floor of the Senate a trade agreement without any \nenforceable labor standard, which meant you were going to be competing \nagainst people who make 30 cents an hour or against people making 30 \ncents an hour in Guatemala? They are never going to get to $8.50. But \ndon't we want to take these ILO standards and basic human rights \nstandards and make sure they are enforceable? That way you can have the \nuplifting of the living standards of people in these countries.\n  Without this amendment, this CBI parity bill is going to merely \nencourage U.S. corporations to set up sweatshops in the Caribbean. This \nis an antisweatshop amendment. This amendment does not require that CBI \ncountries match U.S. wages in work and working conditions, although 67 \npercent of the American people think the minimum wage of our trading \npartners should be raised to U.S. levels. That is not going to happen. \nBut that is not what the amendment does. It only requires these \ncountries to respect the core ILO labor standards before we give them \nadditional benefits.\n  It is a human rights amendment. This amendment basically says we \nshould not be encouraging these CBI countries to compete against our \nworkers by setting up sweatshops, and it says that we have to make sure \nthere is some means of enforcing such antisweatshop standards.\n  I want to support trade agreements. People in our country want to \nsupport trade agreements. But do you want to know something. The reason \nthe trade policy is losing its legitimacy with the American people--I \nthink probably poll after poll shows that the American people are \nsuspicious of these trade agreements--is because they know they put our \nworkers in a terrible position because they know there aren't \nenforceable labor standards, because they know there aren't enforceable \nhuman rights standards, and they tout these trade agreements as being \ngreat for the apparel industry, great for these corporations, and \nterrible for wage earners.\n  That is what this vote on this amendment is all about. Are you on the \nside of working people in our country so that they know they can \norganize in textile plants and the apparel industry, and they won't \nbasically be shut out and the companies won't be able to say, goodbye; \nwe are going to these other countries because we don't have to abide by \nany labor standards? Are you on the side of these workers or are you on \nthe side of these corporations? American workers compete with Caribbean \napparel workers earning from 23 cents an hour in Nicaragua to 80 cents \nan hour in Colombia. Our workers make about $8.42, on average.\n\n  Who is going to benefit from extending NAFTA benefits to the CBI \ncountries without enforceable labor standards?\n  All I am asking with this amendment, I say to my colleague from \nDelaware, is enforceable labor standards. It is not going to be the \ntextile workers. It is not going to be the workers in the CBI \ncountries. It is going to be the American textile companies that want \nto shift production to sweatshops offshore so they can save labor \ncosts.\n  Can I repeat that one more time?\n  Who is going to benefit from this trade legislation without this \namendment? Who is going to benefit from extending NAFTA benefits to the \nCBI countries without enforceable labor standards? Not American textile \nworkers; not working people in our country;\n\n[[Page S13753]]\n\nnot the workers in the CBI countries. It is the American textile \ncompanies that are going to benefit that want to shift production to \nsweatshops offshore so they can save labor costs.\n  I say to Republicans and Democrats alike: Whose side are you on? If \nyou are on the side of working people, if you are on the side of the \nright of people to be able to organize, if you are on the side of \nworking people in these CBI countries and poor people in these CBI \ncountries, and you are on the side of human rights of people in these \ncountries, at the very minimum, we ought to vote for this amendment \nwhich will put some teeth into some enforceable labor standards. The \nalternatives to this amendment are unenforceable.\n  Let me be clear about that. I don't want a Senator to come to the \nfloor and say we have already dealt with labor standards. The CBI \nparity merely includes labor rights as an eligibility criteria which \ncan only be enforced by the administration. The administration already \nenforces the GSP program and has never suspended one CBI country \ndespite their terrible labor rights record.\n  If the administration won't use its GSP leverage to significantly \nimprove labor rights, why would it use eligibility criteria? Nobody can \nseriously argue that this administration would deny eligibility to a \nCBI country based on labor rights violations. They have never done it.\n  The GAO issued a report last year that listed the various GSP worker \nrights in CBI countries accepted for review. In each case--I gave \nexamples earlier, so I will not do it again--the petitions were \nwithdrawn usually after some nominal changes in the CBI country labor \nlaw. But in one CBI country after another, labor laws are flouted, \noften openly.\n  There have been 95 worker rights petitions against CBI countries \nunder GSP. None, not one, has led to investigation and suspension. The \nILO is not an acceptable substitute because it has no enforcement \npower.\n  This amendment speaks to the compelling need to have enforceable \nlabor standards. The ILO has no enforcement power. The managers' \namendment directs the President to ``seek the establishment in the ILO \nof a mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of each of the \ncore labor conventions that ILO members have ratified.'' I commend \nSenators Graham and Moynihan for their effort in this direction. But, \nagain, I have to say this on the floor of the Senate. The ILO has no \nenforcement power, so I am not sure how the ILO can ensure effective \nimplementation. I think enforceable standards for core ILO labor rights \nneed to be built into the trade agreement itself.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n  You have to take these basic ILO labor rights, and you have to make \nsure that enforceable standards are there built into the trade \nagreement. Otherwise, what you have is a CBI parity bill which is going \nto actually provide an incentive for CBI countries to move in the \nopposite direction.\n  I welcome the provision in the managers' amendment on increased \ntransparency. Let me repeat that. I think it is a good idea. It will be \nuseful. But I don't believe it is an enforceable standard that will \nencourage CBI countries to improve conditions for working people. That \nis what this is all about. I don't want anybody to misunderstand this \namendment. This amendment is based upon a belief in the importance of \ninternational trade relations. It is based upon the importance of \nmaking sure we address the standard of living in CBI countries and the \nstandard of living of working people in our country. But you can't do \nthat unless you have enforceable labor standards. That is what this \namendment calls for.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I will wait to hear what my \ncolleagues have to say.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2402\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify the acts, policies, and practices that are \nconsidered unreasonable for purposes of section 301 of the Trade Act of \n                                 1974)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I filed on a timely basis an amendment \nnumbered 2402. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment, and I ask for consideration of amendment No. 2402.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2402.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. UNREASONABLE ACTS, POLICIES, AND PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 301(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2411(d)(3)(B)(i)) is amended by striking subclause (IV) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(IV) market opportunities, including the toleration by a \n     foreign government of systematic anticompetitive activities, \n     which include predatory pricing, discriminatory pricing, or \n     pricing below cost of production by enterprises or among \n     enterprises in the foreign country (including state trading \n     enterprises and state corporations) if the acts, policies, or \n     practices are inconsistent with commercial practices and have \n     the effect of restricting access of United States goods or \n     services to the foreign market or third country markets,''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask consent a vote occur on or in relation \nto the pending amendment No. 2487, of Senator Wellstone, and No. 2347, \nthe Specter amendment, at 3:30, with 4 minutes prior to each vote for \nexplanation. I further ask consent it be in order for me to make a \nmotion to table at this point on both amendments with one show of \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to table the above-described amendments, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, amendment No. 2402 deals with section 301 \nof the Trade Act. As a backdrop for this discussion, I wish to mention \nquickly several pieces of information.\n  First, we discuss the issue of trade with a backdrop of a trade \ndeficit that is quite alarming. Almost everyone in this country now \nsays a $25 billion-a-month trade deficit is unsustainable. The \nmerchandise deficit is worse than this. But this is the trade deficit \nof goods and services. The trade deficit is spiking up, up, up, way \nup--a very difficult circumstance for this country. We must do \nsomething to address it.\n  What does this deficit result from? This chart shows imports and \nexports. We can see exports are a flat line, with imports spiking \ndramatically.\n  The section 301 trade law remedy, which I intend to discuss briefly \nin a moment, describes something that relates to a trade dispute we \nhave not only with Canada but others, a state-sanctioned monopoly \nselling Canadian wheat. This is what has happened with respect to the \nshipment of Canadian durum wheat into this country. It was almost \nnothing and then spikes up. It came down when this country enforced a \ntariff rate quota against Canada. This is unfair trade by a state-\nsanctioned monopoly with secret prices. It is unfair to our farmers who \nhave flat prices. We produce more than we can use or consume \ndomestically, and we have an avalanche of Canadian grain coming into \nour country traded unfairly by a state trading enterprise.\n  Is this problem receding or growing? The first 6 months of this year \nis nearly double the first 6 months of last year. Last year was a \nrecord high. This is just durum wheat, a small issue, but big in North \nDakota and big for family farmers--just one issue.\n\n  What about a state trading enterprise or state monopoly that trades \nCanadian grain, or agricultural products to Australia, and decides they \nwill have a trade relationship that doesn't play fair, for example, in \nAlgeria? Assume that Canadians say: We will use our state trading \nenterprise and we intend to ship our grain to Algeria at 10 cents a \nbushel and take away the United States Algerian market. Is it fair \ntrade? Is it actionable for the United States to file a 301 trade \ncomplaint? I think it ought to be. The law is unclear.\n  I propose with this amendment a simple process to clarify that \nsection\n\n[[Page S13754]]\n\n301, a remedy in trade law, can be applied to predator pricing by state \ntrading enterprises in third-country markets. Very simple. The law is \ncompletely unclear whether this now exists. I think it does; some \npeople think it does not. In any event, I think it ought to.\n  If a state trading enterprise--for example in Canada, the Canadian \nwheat board--decides to push the United States out of a foreign market \nwith predator pricing, is that not actionable by the United States? Of \ncourse, it should be. Our amendment clarifies that the actions, \npolicies, and practices that are unreasonable and inequitable, that \ndestroy market opportunities, are actionable under 301.\n  Anyone who is proud we have eliminated the fiscal policy deficit in \nour country--and I am among those--ought to be alarmed by this chart. \nOur budget policies have created a fiscal policy that is largely now in \nbalance. We do not have growing, swollen Federal budget deficits, and \nthat is a success; it belongs to everyone involved in public policy. \nHowever, this is a failure; this is a deficit that is running out of \ncontrol.\n  The trade deficit is a very serious problem. We must remedy it. One \nway to remedy it is to be able to respond to unfair trading practices \nwith remedies that work. This green book produced by the U.S. trade \nambassador describes foreign trade barriers. In the bowels of this book \nrests the story about why our producers are unable to access foreign \nmarkets. It is a big, thick book, nearly 500 pages, country after \ncountry after country. One way to address these issues is to decide we \nare going to take action against those that discriminate against \nAmerican producers with unfair trade practices.\n  A final point. I turn to Japan in this green book. Japan has agreed \nto gradually reduce tariffs on imports of beef, pork, fresh oranges, \ncheese, et cetera. Japan has a $50 to $60 billion trade surplus with \nus; we have a deficit with them, and it has gone on forever. Even after \nour negotiations on beef, if one buys a T-bone steak in Tokyo this \nafternoon, there is a 40.5-percent tariff on every single pound of beef \nthat goes into Japan. It is unforgivable. This country cannot persuade \nour trade partners to trade fairly.\n  I ask we include in this piece of legislation something that \nstrengthens section 301, that gives the United States a remedy to go \nafter unfair trade practices. I hope the majority and minority will \ndecide to accept this amendment and take it to conference. It is a \nsmall amendment. Nonetheless, I think it is very important to American \nproducers--not just farmers but manufacturers, all producers.\n  I ask for some time to discuss this amendment with staff. Therefore, \nI ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2430\n\n (Purpose: To limit preferential tariff treatment to countries with a \n gross national product that does not extend 5 times the average gross \n    national product of all eligible sub-Saharan African countries)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment 2430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2430.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATIONS ON PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     may not exercise the authority to extend preferential tariff \n     treatment to any country in sub-Saharan Africa provided for \n     in this Act, unless the President determines that the per \n     capita gross national product of the country (calculated on \n     the basis of the best available information including that of \n     the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) is \n     not more than 5 times the average per capita gross national \n     product of all sub-Saharan African countries eligible for \n     such preferential tariff treatment under this Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Delaware that \nI am fully supportive of the efforts to provide opportunity for trade \nthat will be mutually beneficial between the United States and Africa \nand the Caribbean. I have been to the floor now on more than one \noccasion talking about the merits of this bill. It is not perfect, but \nit is a good piece of legislation, and one I am convinced will be \nmutually beneficial to the nations included.\n  I believe my amendment will make this bill better and will clarify \nsomething which I think was the intention of this bill but may have \nbeen lost in the drafting.\n  This amendment simply says we will prohibit countries with a per \ncapita GDP five times the average of all sub-Saharan African nations \nfrom participating in the Generalized System of Preferences portion of \nthis legislation. Let me explain.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act, I believe, should live up to \nits billing; namely, this legislation should provide an opportunity for \ngrowth in Africa, not outside of Africa. As I stated last week, this \nbill is also an opportunity for businesses in my home State and for the \nwhole country, but it is important we do not lose sight of this \nobjective.\n  Faced with tight budgets, the United States will not make the same \ncontributions to foreign aid as we have in the past. To replace this \nshortfall, we are relying on the great American promise of opportunity. \nIn this case, the opportunity is represented by access to the greatest \nmarket in the world--our market. In essence, this bill is an invitation \nfor Africa and the Caribbean to offer their best to America, to compete \nin our marketplace and, in so doing, raise the standard of living on \nboth sides of the relationship.\n  The success of this new relationship between Africa and America rides \non the ability of poor African States to capitalize on greater market \naccess. Until now, they have been unable to do so, but one of the \npromises of this bill is it will attract additional investment in the \nregion. With the necessary infrastructure and capital, Africa may \ncompete in international markets and establish the requisites for a \nrobust manufacturing base. The question becomes: If new foreign \ninvestment comes to Africa, where will it be applied?\n  I believe it is the intent of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as \nin the House, to assist the countries generally known as sub-Saharan \nAfrica. We want to turn around two decades of economic decline in \nplaces such as Kenya, Tanzania, Liberia, and Ghana. That is the point \nof this amendment.\n  If the United States is going to take this step, it is important we \nmake certain the results assist the intended nations. We need to have \nconfidence that the direct investment inspired by this legislation is \ndirected to the countries that need it most.\n  I restate that this amendment I am offering will try to make a good \nbill even better by prohibiting the Generalized System of Preferences \nto countries with a per capita GDP five times the average of all the \nsub-Saharan nations. The average per capita GDP in Africa, for anyone's \ninterest, is $1,798. Thus, the cutoff of participation would be a per \ncapita GDP of $8,987. This per capita cutoff is more than $2,500 more \nthan South Africa, and also more than the per capita GDP in Russia, \nBrazil, Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. It is a reasonable cap.\n  Why is this important? This amendment does not seek to target any \nparticular country, but it is important to know there is an island \nnation off the coast of Africa, Mauritius, that already has a GDP of \n$10,300. Furthermore, this island is closer to Africa than any other \ncontinent, and it is hardly the kind of place I believe our colleagues \nor the American public would conceive as part of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n  One might well wonder how this island of over 1 million people has \nbeen able to attain such economic success. The answer is a well-\ndeveloped textile industry. Through investments, Mauritius has managed \nto create a mature apparel processing shipment and manufacturing hub \nright in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It is a very tiny island with \nover 1 million inhabitants, but it is well developed. Its GDP would \nmake countries in Europe green with envy.\n\n[[Page S13755]]\n\n Mauritius can proudly boast of unemployment rates that would be \nwelcomed in countries in Europe and is unheard of on the African \nContinent.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid if nations similar to this are included in \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act, much of, if not all of, the \nopportunity will go to the country that is already successful and \nhardly needs our assistance and directed help.\n  If, after a hard-fought battle to bring this legislation to the \nfloor, all we accomplish is to raise the standards of a small island \nwhere standards are already raised and already has a successful \nindustry, I do not think we have done much, and we have truly toiled in \nvain.\n  Again, this amendment creates objective and dynamic criteria for who \ncan and cannot participate. It does not attempt to single out any \nparticular place. But I do use that as an example of something I do not \nthink is our intention.\n  If we are successful, the average per capita GDP of Africa will \nincrease as the continent moves forward. A more wealthy nation, such as \nthe one I have described, may be eligible to participate later on. \nHowever, at this juncture, I believe we must remain focused on our \nobjective. That is why I urge our manager, the Senator from Delaware, \nto take a look at this amendment. I hope it can be acceptable to both \nsides as we work to make this bill even better.\n  I do not think it was our intention to move investments to a place \nthat is already developed, and it is not fair to our industry in the \nUnited States. Our intention is to increase and bolster the \ninfrastructure investment in the continent of Africa itself, \nparticularly countries that are known as sub-Saharan Africa.\n  So with this small amendment, we can correct and make that clear. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment and thank them for their \nattention on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose my colleague's amendment.\n  I do so because this amendment will undermine the very objectives \nthis legislation is trying to further. In essence, this amendment says \nthat if a country has managed to do well in that desperately poor and \npolitically unstable region, its access to our market will be cut \ndramatically. I can't imagine a more damaging or more ironic signal to \nsend.\n  Let me be a little more specific about my concerns. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to use tariff preferences to spur investment in the \nsub-Saharan African countries. That investment will help create \neconomic growth and create jobs in a region that has suffered so \nterribly for so long.\n  My colleague's amendment, however, would tell the Africans to watch \nout if they start succeeding, because their access to our market will \nbe taken. It is an ironic signal to send.\n  While the signal that it will send to the Africans is unfortunate, \nthe signal it will send to investors is particularly damaging.\n  Let me explain. This legislation is designed to encourage increased \ninvestment in the sub-Saharan region. This amendment would undermine \nthat objective by telling investors that they cannot count on the \nmarket access that this legislation provides over the long term. As an \ninvestor, nothing is more troubling than uncertainty. When investors \ncannot count on what the future will hold in terms of market access, \nthen they will avoid the region.\n  Given the political and economic uncertainties that already exist in \nthat region--and given the disincentives that this creates for \ninvestors--adding more uncertainty through this amendment would be \nparticularly cruel.\n  This amendment also ignores the fact that trade among the African \ncountries themselves is vital to their economic future and to the \neffectiveness of this legislation. The rules of origin in my \nlegislation are specifically designed to encourage the Africans to \nenter into economic partnership amongst themselves.\n  Such partnering is particularly important among these nations because \nthey each have different resources and capabilities. We should, \ntherefore, encourage each of these countries to take advantage of their \ncomparative advantage.\n  My colleague's amendment, however, would selectively exclude certain \ncountries in that region. This, unfortunately, will undermine the \nprocess of economic integration and partnering among the African \nnations that is vital to sound economic development in that region.\n  This amendment seems to suggest that the economic growth of the sub-\nSaharan region must rely exclusively on trade with the United States. \nWhile we would all like to think that that is enough to spur growth and \ninvestment in that region, we all know that it is not.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, could I ask unanimous consent to respond \nfor a moment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I could not hear the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes to \nrespond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Please do.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Delaware should know I am going to \ncertainly support this bill. It is not my intention to offer an \namendment that would in any way weaken this bill. But I also believe \nvery strongly that we should not be presenting false hope or providing \nloopholes or providing special treatment; that if our objective is \nclearly to develop Africa the continent of Africa and not islands off \nits shore, if it is to really develop sub-Saharan Africa, then we \nshould shape a bill that will actually do this.\n  I say to the Senator, without this amendment, which clearly outlines \nthat the per capita GDP I am suggesting is five times higher than any \nAfrican nation currently--if we do not adopt this amendment, I could \nsee clearly that the industries would just continue to go over to this \none island off Africa, undercut some of the American industries, not \nresult in investment in Africa, and give help to a particular place \nthat does not need help. That does not make any sense to me.\n  So I offer this amendment in good faith. I have to say, respectfully, \nI do not understand the arguments against this amendment because, \nagain, the per capita GDP in Africa is currently $1,798, and the \nbusiness community knows they would be free to continue to do work \nuntil the per capita income reached $10,000, which is the cap. That \nwould be many years down the line and would give them the stability \nthey need but not allow us to be circumvented by an island that is not \npart of sub-Saharan Africa and I think could undercut our intentions.\n  I thank the Senators for extending me the time to respond. I look \nforward to a vote on this later today.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2487\n\n  Mr. ROTH. These comments I will now make are in connection with the \nWellstone amendment No. 2487.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Wellstone amendment No. \n2487. This amendment is very similar to one we tabled yesterday, and \nshould be tabled today for similar reasons.\n  This amendment denies benefits until the U.S. Secretaries of Labor \nand State determine that the beneficiary country is enforcing \ninternationally recognized human rights. In and of itself, this is \nunnecessary and duplicative. The managers substitute already contains \ncriteria that the President must take into account in determining a \nbeneficiary country's eligibility that includes the internationally \nagreed upon core labor standards.\n  I will address later in my statement the concern of the Senator from \nMinnesota as to the use of these criteria.\n  But this amendment goes further. It would force beneficiary countries \nto guarantee that the head of the national labor agency of that \ncountry, the U.S. Secretary of Labor, and an international union \nbureaucrat have access to all the private business information and \nrecords of all business enterprises in that country.\n  This undermines the sovereignty of these nations, and represents an \nintrusion on the privacy of their small businesses. The practical \neffect would be\n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\nthat no country would ever allow an international union head to peek \ninto the business dealings of all of their citizens. These countries \nsimply would not choose to enjoy the trade benefits offered in this \nbill--and rightly so.\n  This amendment would also create an unprecedented private cause of \naction in U.S. courts if a U.S. citizen wants to seek compliance by \nthose countries with the labor standards. This would invite \nunnecessary, wasteful litigation, and would create novel discovery \nactivities by U.S. courts, to say the least.\n  To sum up, the provisions of this amendment would simply eviscerate \nthe goals of this bill and is nothing more than protectionism by \nanother name. The labor standards in the managers' substitute and the \nflexibility given to the President provide an appropriate means for \nregular dialog with the beneficiary countries on labor issues.\n  Let me be clear that the labor standards in the managers' \nsubstitute--and which are reflected in current law--are effective. As \nmy colleague may know, CBI benefits are linked to a country's \neligibility for the GSP program. If a country violates one of the \nrequirements of the GSP program by, for example, failing to afford \nworkers internationally recognized workers' rights, then that country \nwill lose eligibility for both GSP and the CBI program.\n  The labor standards under the GSP program are not meaningless. In \nfact, 11 countries have been suspended from GSP benefits since 1985 for \nlabor standard violations. Six countries are currently suspended. What \nthis should tell us is that the system works, both under GSP and under \nmy legislation for the CBI countries.\n  As evidence of the effectiveness of these criteria, I cite a June \n1998 GAO report that concluded that the GSP and CBI programs have led \nto improvements of workers' rights in the beneficiary countries.\n  This is not the only evidence, however. In fact, the best way to tell \nwhether the management's amendment presents an effective approach to \nthe protection of labor standards is by asking those most affected: \nnamely, the workers. I have with me a list of the labor unions in the \nCaribbean and Central America who endorse my approach on this issue. \nThese leaders understand that the manager's amendment provides an \neffective way to protect workers, while at the same time spurring \ninvestment and economic growth that creates jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             CBI Unions That Support CBI Trade Enhancement\n\n\n                              el salvador\n\n       Ricardo Antonio Soriano, Secretary General of \n     FESINCONSTRANS, Federacion de Sindicatos de la Industria de \n     la Construccion Similares Transportes y, Otras Actividades.\n       Anibal Somoza Penate, Secretary General of CGS, \n     Confederacion General de Sindicatos.\n       Israel Huiza, Secretary General of FESINTRABS, Federacion \n     de Sindicatos de Trabajadores de Alimentos, Bebidas y \n     Similares.\n       Miguel Ramirez, Secretary General of FESTRAES, Federacion \n     Sindical de Trabajadores de El Salvador.\n       Miguel Angel Lantan, President of FUNEPRODES, Fundacion \n     para la Educacion Progreso y Desarrollo del Obrero \n     Salvadoreno.\n       Salvador Carazo, Secretary General of OSILS, Organizacion \n     de Sindicatos Independientes, Libres Salvadorenos.\n       Jesus Amado Perez Marroquin, Secretary General de FLATICOM, \n     Federacion Laboral de Sindicatos, Independientes de \n     Transporte, Comercio y Maquila.\n       Juan Jose Huezo, FENASTRAS, Federacion Nacional Sindical de \n     Trabajadores Salvadorenos.\n       Juan Edito Juarez, FUSS, Federacion Unitaria Sindical de El \n     Salvador.\n\n\n                                 haiti\n\n       Fignole St. Cyr, Secretary General, Centrale Autonome des \n     Travailleurs, Haitiens (CATH).\n       Marc Antoine Destin, Secretary General, Confederation des \n     Taravailleurs Haitiens (CTH).\n       Jacques Pierre, President, Konfederasyon Ouvriye Travaye \n     Ayisyen (KOTA).\n       Patrick Numas, Secretary General, Organisation General \n     Independante des Tavailleurs Haitiens (OGITH).\n\n\n                           dominican republic\n\n       Mariano Negrontejada, Secretary General, Confederacion \n     Nacional de Trabajadores Dominicanos (CNTD).\n       Jacobo Ramos, Secretary General, Federacion Unitaria de \n     Trabajadores de Zonas Francas (FENATRAZONAS).\n\n\n                                honduras\n\n       Israel Salina, Secretary General, Confederacion Unitaria de \n     Trabajadores de Honduras (CUTH).\n       Felicito Avila Ordonez, President, Central General de \n     Trabajadores (CMT).\n       Felicito Avila Ordonez, President, Central de Trabajadores.\n\n\n                                jamaica\n\n       Lloyd Goodleigh, General Secretary, Jamaica Confederation \n     of Trade Unions.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. For these reasons, I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the discussion of this trade bill, we \nhear a lot of talk about the different things involved in trade and how \nwe want to lift countries up; that the essence of this trade bill \nbefore us is to open up the avenues and the corridors of free trade so \npeople living in Third World countries, in Africa specifically, can \nbegin to enjoy some of the benefits of increased production, increased \ndistribution of goods and services, and an increased standard of \nliving. That is what the proponents of the trade bill are arguing.\n  I am not here to argue against that. I believe free trade, if it is \npracticed as free trade, it can have genuine beneficial effects on all \nparties involved. There are anomalies, however, in the trade structure \nthat keep the benefits of open and free trade from being genuinely and \nbroadly distributed among people in Third World countries. There are a \nlot of these, but I believe the single most important feature, \ninstitution or practice of Third World countries that inhibits their \neconomic growth, inhibits their social growth, even if they are allowed \ninto a free trade structure, is the use and practice of abusive child \nlabor.\n  Child labor is the last vestige of slavery on the face of the Earth. \nIt is widespread. It is condoned--if not openly, at least passively--by \nmany of the major industrial nations of the world. I think it is time \nwe get rid of this last vestige of slavery: child labor.\n  I have an amendment that is very simple and straightforward. It \nbuilds on the international consensus that emerged from the ILO \nconference in Geneva this summer in which the delegates unanimously \nadopted a convention to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The \namendment simply states that in order to be eligible for the trade \nbenefits in this bill, a country must meet and effectively enforce the \nstandards regarding child labor, as established by the ILO convention \n182 for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. It is just \nthat simple. In other words, if a country wants the benefits of this \ntrade bill, they must meet and effectively enforce the standards of the \nrecently adopted ILO convention 182.\n  This convention defines the worst forms of child labor as: all forms \nof slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, or the sale and \ntrafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of \nchildren for use in armed conflict; child prostitution, children \nproducing and trafficking narcotic drugs; or any other work which by \nits nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely \nto harm the health, the safety, and the morals of children. These are \nthe provisions of ILO convention 182.\n  As I stated earlier, for the first time in history, this last June, \nthe world spoke with one voice in opposition to abusive and \nexploitative child labor. Countries from across the political, \neconomic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to Moslem, from Buddhist \nto Christians--came together to proclaim unequivocally that ``abusive \nand exploitative child labor is a practice which will not be tolerated \nand must be abolished.''\n  So gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is \nan acceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstances. \nGone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is \nacceptable because of cultural traditions. And gone is the argument \nthat abusive and exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the \nroad to economic development. When this convention was approved, the \nUnited States and the international community as a whole laid these \narguments to rest and laid the groundwork\n\n[[Page S13757]]\n\nto begin the process of ending the scourge of abusive and exploitative \nchild labor.\n  Additionally, for the first time in its history, the U.S. tripartite \ngroup to the ILO--consisting of representatives from government, \nbusiness, and labor--unanimously agreed on the final version of the ILO \nconvention 182.\n  I believe strongly that the time has come to say to countries: If you \nwant the trade benefits outlined in this bill, you must, at a minimum, \nenforce international standards on abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. That is at a minimum.\n\n  So let me be clear about what is meant by abusive and exploitative \nchild labor. This is not about kids working on the family farm. It is \nnot about kids who work after school. There is nothing wrong with that. \nI worked in my youth when I was in school. Probably most of us in the \nChamber today worked when we were young and in school. There is nothing \nwrong with that, and that is not what we are talking about. The \nconvention that the ILO adopted in June deals with children who are \nchained to looms, who handle dangerous chemicals, who ingest metal dust \nfrom working around machinery, children who are forced to sell illegal \ndrugs, forced into prostitution, forced into armed conflict, forced to \nwork in factories where furnace temperatures exceed 1,500 degrees.\n  Let me refer to this chart again and repeat, for the sake of \nemphasis, what the convention does. It abolishes the harshest forms of \nchild labor, including child slavery, child bondage, child \nprostitution, use of children in pornography, trafficking in children, \nthe forced recruitment of children for armed conflict, the recruitment \nof children in the production or sale of narcotics, and hazardous work \nby children. Those are the abusive and exploitative forms of child \nlabor that are covered.\n  According to the ILO, in Latin America and the Caribbean there are an \nestimated 17 million children working. In Africa--and we are on the \nAfrica trade bill--80 million children are working. In Asia, about 153 \nmillion children are working. There are about half a million in \nOceania, in the islands of the southwest Pacific. This totals about 250 \nmillion children world wide that are working full time.\n  They are forced to work with no protective equipment under hazardous \nand slave-like conditions. They endure long hours for little or no \ncompensation. They simply work only for the economic gain of others. \nThey are denied an education and denied the opportunity to grow and \ndevelop.\n  I paint this in sharp contrast to afterschool jobs that kids have so \nthey can have some more spending money to buy the latest CD. These kids \nare not buying CDs. They are not even in school. They are kept out of \nschool and are forced to work.\n  Again, I know firsthand what this is about. I have some charts here, \nsome pictures. Last year, my legislative assistant, Rosemary Gutierrez, \nand I traveled to several countries in South Asia to investigate child \nlabor. This happens to be a picture that was taken outside of a \ncompound in Katmandu, Nepal. This was on a Sunday evening, shortly \nafter dark, maybe about 7 or 7:30 in the evening. I had heard repeated \nstories about children who were working, making carpets, children as \nyoung as 5 to 7 years of age. But I also knew from others I had talked \nto that if you asked to visit one of these plants, by the time you got \nthere, they had the kids out the back door. So nobody could ever see \nthem.\n  Well, it turned out that, through mutual acquaintances, we located a \nyoung man--I don't know how old he is now, maybe 21 or 22 years old--\nwho had been a former child laborer in one of these plants. He knew of \na plant where he knew the guard at the gate on this Sunday evening in \nquestion. So what we did is, we got in an unmarked car and we drove to \nthe outskirts of Katmandu and went up to this compound. Later, we found \nout we were mistaken and the owner was in fact there. So we went up to \nthe gate, four or five of us, with this young Nepalese man. He got us \nin the gate.\n  This was the picture I took outside the gate. There is a sign posted \nvery prominently in Nepalese and in English. As you can see, it says, \n``Child labour under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited.'' They have \nthese signs all over. So I took a picture of it.\n  We went to the gate of this compound. We walked down a fairly narrow \nalleyway. There were low-lying buildings on our left and right. We went \ndown a few hundred yards and turned to our left to this carpet factory. \nWe went into the carpet factory. Mind you, this is on a Sunday evening, \nand it is about 7:30. Here is what we found. I can tell you this is \nwhat we found because I took the picture. There were dozens and dozens \nof kids working in this building, with a lot of dust around; carpets \nput off a lot of dust when they make them. I took this picture of these \ntwo kids. I had the young man who spoke Nepalese there, and we were \nable to talk to them a little.\n\n  As best I could figure out, he was about 7 and she was about 8. This \nwas at 7:30 in the evening. You can't see because the flashbulb wasn't \nstrong enough, but there are dozens of children sitting in rows up and \ndown the aisles working.\n  Here is a better picture, and I am in it. My staff assistant took \nthis picture. These kids are 8, 9, 10, 11 years old, all the way back \nhere, on both sides, up and down, working at 7:30 at night. These are \nkids who work probably 12 to 14 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week. When \nthey are not working, they are taken out of here to those low-lying \nbuildings where they sleep and eat; that is where they live. They are \nnot allowed to go out. They are not allowed to go out on the streets. \nThey are not allowed to get an education, go to school. They go from \ntheir little Quonset hut, where they stay like stacks of cord wood. \nThen they are herded in here, work 12 to 14 hours a day, and they are \nherded back into the building. They are 7, 8, 9 years of age.\n  I said: What happens when they get to be 12, 13, or 14? I didn't see \nany children there that old there. Well, sometimes the boys go into \ndifferent kinds of work, and the girls are sold into prostitution. You \ndon't have to take my word for that; you can talk with anybody in the \nU.N., the ILO, and talk about the trafficking of young girls from Nepal \nto India, some as far away as Saudi Arabia.\n  I met with some young girls who had been sold into prostitution. \nThere is an organization in Nepal of women trying to repatriate these \nyoung women, get them back to their country and their villages. Some \nwere sent as far away as Saudi Arabia. Trafficking in prostitution--\nthat is what we are talking about in this amendment. We are not talking \nabout kids working after school. We are talking about these kids. \nShould a country that permits this and condones this and doesn't take \nactive steps to stop it--should they, I ask you, get the benefits of \nthis trade bill?\n  Here is another kid. I did not take this picture. This is not my \npicture. I admit that. But there is a young boy in the Sialkot region \nof Pakistan. He is 8 years old. His name is Mohammad Ashraf Irfan. You \nmay not be able to see it from there, but he is making surgical \nequipment. These are scissors used in surgery that are shipped to this \ncountry. Think about that. Think about that the next time you go into \nthe doctor's office. It is clean, it is sterile, you have a wound, and \nthey are going to sew you up or they are going to make you well again. \nYou see those little scissors come out, or the little knife, and the \nthings they use. Think about Ashraf here who is 8 years old. Look at \nhim. The next time you go into a doctor's office, think about Ashraf \nand think about hundreds of thousands like him sitting there day after \nday. He has no protective goggles, no protective equipment on his \nhands, and he is making surgical equipment to be used in the finest of \ndoctor's offices and hospitals in Europe and America. That is what we \nare talking about in this amendment.\n  I believe our goal must be to encourage and to persuade other \ncountries to build on the prosperity that comes with trade and to lift \ntheir standards up. Exploited child labor in other countries not only \npenalize Ashraf to a lifetime of illiteracy, low wages, bad health, and \nnot only does it condemn him to that, and hurt his life, but the fact \nthey exploit him means that it unfairly puts workers in our country and \nother countries at a disadvantage.\n  You can't compete with slavery. This is slavery. You can dress it up \nand call it what you want. But this is about the nearest thing you can \nget to slavery.\n\n[[Page S13758]]\n\n Yet, unfortunately, the legislation before us does not address this \nissue. It simply relies on the criteria of the Generalized System of \nPreferences, or GSP, to extend countries trade benefits.\n  Is that adequate to what we know is going on in the world?\n  This criteria in GSP has been on the books since 1984--15 years. And \nchild labor today is worse than it was 15 years ago.\n  Let me explain that the USTR, our own Trade Representative office, in \nits implementation and enforcement of GSP, has, I believe, abused the \nlanguage in the statute that calls for taking steps to afford respect \nfor workers' rights, including child labor. They have interpreted that \nany gesture made by a country will satisfy the requirements of GSP.\n  There is a list of five internationally recognized workers' rights \nprovisions in GSP. Here they are: One, the right of association; two, \nthe right to organize and bargain collectively; three, a prohibition on \nthe use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; four, a minimum age \nfor employment of children; five, acceptable conditions of work with \nrespect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and \nhealth.\n  If a country takes steps--we don't say how big a step--if a country \ntakes one teeny, little bit of a step in any one of those areas, they \nare allowed GSP benefits. They may have the most abusive forms of child \nlabor, but if they have taken steps --for example, to have the right of \nfree association--there you go. They have satisfied the requirements. \nQuite frankly, these countries should be taking steps in all five areas \nand enforcing the laws they have on the books.\n  The fact is, there are laws in Nepal against the use of child labor \nin these looms. There are laws in Pakistan against what Ashraf Irfan is \ndoing. They all have laws on the books. They are just not enforcing \nthem. Many of these countries have been able to provide cosmetic and \nunenforceable actions. Then they are recognized as having taken steps, \nand they are off the hook. In fact, the principal sponsor of the GSP \ncriteria, an individual I served with in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Don Pease, wanted to set a high standard to ensure that \ncountries not only have laws on their books with regard to these rights \nand minimum age requirements but that they were also being \nenforced. When it got to conference, it was watered down. We have that \ntoday. If they meet just one of those criteria, that is all they have \nto do.\n\n  Fifteen years later after GSP, we now have a universal standard \nadopted this June by the ILO in Geneva. The ILO convention 182 is a \nwell-defined, internationally accepted standard that I believe should \nbe the criteria in granting any country U.S. trade benefits. ILO \nconvention 182 that will hold everyone to one real and enforceable \nstandard that was unanimously agreed to in Geneva this past June.\n  Again, as I have said before, I believe in free trade. I voted for \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement. But I also believe in a level \nplaying field. I also believe you should use trade to try to lift \ncountries up--not lift countries up on the backs of children but to \nlift those countries up alongside of us.\n  U.S. workers can't compete with slaves. U.S. workers can't compete \nwith 8-year-old kids working 12 and 14 hours a day who are paid almost \nnothing. You can dress it up any way you want. You can use whatever \nfancy words and language you want. That is slavery. These kids don't \nhave a choice. They are forced to work in unbearable conditions. They \ndon't have a choice. They do not have any freedom and liberty. Is that \nnot the definition of slavery? Children are exploited for the economic \ngain of others. The child loses, the family loses, this country loses, \nand we in the world lose, too.\n  Every child lost to the workplace in this manner is a child who will \nnot receive an education, learn a valuable skill, and help this country \ndevelop economically, or become a more active participant in the global \nmarket. When just one child is exploited in this manner, every one of \nus is diminished.\n  Recently, I came across a startling statistic. According to the \nUNICEF report entitled ``The State of the World's Children 1999,'' \nnearly 1 billion people will enter the 21st century--the new \nmillennium--1 billion people will enter unable to read a book, or \nunable to sign their name because they are illiterate. This is a \nformula for instability, violence, and conflict down the road.\n  Nearly one-sixth of all humanity--think about it; three and a half \ntimes the population of the United States--next year won't even be able \nto read a book or sign their name.\n  This is the reason: Because they were denied an education when they \nwere young. They were forced to work in front of rug looms, or making \nsurgical equipment, glassware, and metals in mines and places such as \nthat.\n  I believe it is shocking. I believe children making pennies a day \nspells disaster and conflict down the road. In cold, hard, economic \nterms, children making pennies a day will never buy a computer, they \nwill never buy the software to run it, they will never purchase the \nlatest music CD or a VCR to play American-made movies.\n  By allowing abusive and exploitative child labor to continue, we not \nonly doom the child to a future of poverty and destitution, we doom \nfuture markets for American goods and services.\n  Why in our trade bill do we not just look one foot in front of our \nnose? We think about next year or the year after. Why not think about \n10, 15, or 20 years from now, when 8-year-old Ashraf Irfan is in his \ntwenties and thirties? What will he be buying? Will he buy a computer? \nWill he buy software and log on to the Internet? Will he buy clothes? \nNo; he will be functionally illiterate. He will go to a store and watch \ntelevision and see how the rest of the world lives and say, Why do I \nlive like this?\n  It is ripe for revolutions, wars, insurrections, and instability all \nover the world.\n  Some say child labor shouldn't be dealt with in trade measures. I \nthink this is wrongheaded thinking and closed minded. I believe we \nshould be addressing child labor issues on trade measures. After all, \nwe are ultimately talking about our trade policy. Not too long ago, \nagreements on intellectual property rights were not considered measures \nto be addressed by trade agreements. In the beginning, only tariffs and \nquotas were addressed by GATT because they were the most visible trade-\ndistorting practices.\n  As time went on and as we began to develop more and more intellectual \nproperty in this country, we said we ought to include intellectual \nproperty rights and services, too. Now they have become an integral \npart of our trade agreements. The trade bill two years ago had several \npages on intellectual property rights and one small, ineffectual \nparagraph on child labor. Now the WTO will consider rules dealing with \nforeign direct investment. That is another new step. A part of our \ntrade agreements will now involve foreign direct investment and \ncompetition policy.\n  When I looked at the trade bill two years ago and saw all the pages \ndealing with intellectual property rights and I saw the little, \nineffectual paragraph that actually turned the clock back on child \nlabor, I thought to myself, if we can protect a song, can't we protect \na kid? Think about it. We are going to protect someone's song so it \ncan't be stolen, used, recorded, or sung by anybody else in the world--\nwe can protect that; but we can't protect this kid? Tell me that child \nlabor is not an apt policy for trade policy and trade bills. I believe \nit is time we do this. We as a nation cannot ignore what is happening.\n  In 1993, this Senate put itself on record in opposition to the \nexploitation of children for economic gain by passing a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that I submitted. That was in 1993. It was a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. Nonetheless, it passed. In 1994, I requested \nthe Department of Labor to begin a series of reports on child labor. \nThese reports now consist of five volumes representing the most \ncomprehensive documentation ever assembled by the Government on this \nissue. Earlier this year, President Clinton issued an Executive order \nprohibiting the U.S. Government from procuring items made by forced or \nindentured child labor. We are making progress.\n  Some may say we have not even ratified convention 182 ourselves, so \nhow do we expect others to abide by that? The chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Helms, had a hearing about 2\n\n[[Page S13759]]\n\nweeks ago on this. I thought it was a great hearing. I am pleased to \nreport to my colleagues, just today the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported out the new ILO convention. I am hopeful we will \nhave it on the floor to get a unanimous vote and to ratify that before \nwe leave this year. I have every reason to believe we will before we \nleave this year.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have a couple of votes at 3:30. There is no \ntime agreement. The Senator may speak as long he desires. Both managers \nof the bill are in a position to accept the amendment of the Senator \nor, if the Senator desires a recorded vote, we can have that, too. They \nare willing to accept this amendment. There is an order in effect that \nthere will be two votes at 3:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will abruptly finish my remarks.\n  Mr. REID. And then make a decision.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Normally, I would say fine to accept it, but since the \nForeign Relations Committee passed it out this morning and I believe we \nwill have it before the Senate before the end of the year, I think it \nis important for the Senate to express itself on this issue on the \nforms of abusive and exploitative child labor. It is important we do \nthat. We have taken so many steps and come so far, we ought to do that. \nI am hopeful my colleagues will support this.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senator Helms, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and Mr. Wellstone from Minnesota. There is \na pretty broad philosophical spectrum encompassed on this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside, and I ask to call up my amendment No. 2495.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what was the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. To set aside the amendment and call up my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to work out a time sequence. \nThe Landrieu amendment is now pending. It is my understanding that we \nhave two votes set and Landrieu makes three votes; is the Senator \nwilling to make his the fourth vote in that stack?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes; I have no problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor and has \nstated a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside, and I ask that my amendment No. 2495 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend, he has \nno problem, if his amendment is called up, having his the fourth after \nthese other three?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. I don't have any problem with that, no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware objects. Objection \nis heard. The Senator from Iowa continues to have the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thought I had just agreed to have the \namendment voted on.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield for a question to my colleague from Nevada. \nWe are trying to work out an arrangement.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, and the manager of the bill, this is my \nunderstanding of what the managers want to occur. We already have two \namendments pending and there are motions to table those two amendments. \nThe Landrieu amendment is going to come on as the third matter. They \nalso want to move to table that. That can only be done while the \namendment is pending. So that amendment is pending now.\n  I suggest there be a tabling motion made and then the Senator will \noffer his amendment, and his amendment be voted up or down.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me see if I can revise my unanimous \nconsent.\n  I ask unanimous consent after the Landrieu amendment is disposed of, \nin whatever form that disposal may take, that I be recognized to call \nup my amendment, amendment No. 2495, and to have the yeas and nays on \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator is advised he \ncannot obtain the yeas and nays by unanimous consent. That part of his \nconsent cannot be granted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, we will have the unanimous consent \nrequest. Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask consent a vote occur on or in relation \nto the pending amendment--the Landrieu amendment to H.R. 434 in the \nvoting sequence occurring at 3:30 p.m. today, with all the parameters \nprovided for the first two amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nLandrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2505\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the extension of permanent normal trade \n      relations to Albania and Kyrgyzstan, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2505.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, President Clinton recently emphasized that \nwhile expanding trade, we also need to have basic labor standards so \nthat people who work receive the dignity and reward of their work. The \nPresident said the WTO should create a working group in Seattle on \ntrade and labor and asked, ``How we can deny the legitimacy or the \nlinking of these issues, trade and labor, in a global economy?''\n  How, indeed? The rhetoric sounds right--that we should link the \ngranting of trade benefits to whether countries are abiding by \ninternationally recognized standards on such things as child labor, \ncollective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational \nhealth and safety and other worker rights. This should be especially \nthe case when these countries have freely undertaken such obligations \nin treaties or conventions. This is a laudable objective and one that \nthe Administration is now promoting. But how do we implement this \nobjective?\n  We have our first test case under consideration before the Senate \ntoday. We should begin to promote standards on such things as child \nlabor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, \noccupational health and safety and other worker rights as part of our \ntrade relationships by considering progress on those goals when \nunilaterally granting a trade benefit. In considering whether to grant \na country a unilateral trade benefit, the President surely ought to \nconsider the extent to which that country has undertaken its own \nexisting obligations, obligations under treaties and conventions it has \nfreely entered into relative to child labor, collective bargaining, the \nuse of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and \nother worker rights. Unfortunately, in the bill under consideration \ntoday, the President is not required to even consider this factor.\n  Mr. President, the trade bill we are considering contains two \nprovisions that would provide trade benefits to certain countries \nunilaterally without asking that reciprocal action be taken.\n  This bill is flawed and it doesn't live up to our repeatedly stated \nbeliefs. It contains no required consideration of\n\n[[Page S13760]]\n\nthe extent to which a beneficiary country has undertaken to live up to \nits own commitments to internationally recognized standards on such \nthings as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced \nlabor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights, before \nthe country may receive the trade benefit conferred in the bill. I \nbelieve the extent to which a country demonstrates a willingness to \nabide by its own commitments freely undertaken, be it to labor \nstandards, or anything else, should be an element that is at least \nconsidered when determining a country's eligibility to receive special \nbenefits.\n  As the bill is currently written, before granting the trade benefits, \nthe President must make certain determinations, such as determining if \nthe country has demonstrated a commitment to undertake WTO obligations \nand to take steps to join the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas \n(FTAA). Only as a secondary consideration, the President may consider, \nwhen determining if the country has demonstrated a commitment to the \nWTO and FTAA, additional criteria, including the extent to which the \ncountry provides internationally recognized worker rights.\n  This is not strong enough because it is a discretionary standard that \nthe President is not required to even consider and it is also only a \nsecondary consideration that can be taken into account when making a \ndetermination as to whether a country has demonstrated a commitment to \npursue certain other ends. It is not an end in itself.\n  It seems to me that the type of trade benefit we are considering \ntoday, a one-way-granting by the United States of duty free treatment, \nis a logical place to include a consideration of whether a country is \nattempting to live up to its own obligations it has freely undertaken \nwith regard to standards on such things as child labor, collective \nbargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and \nsafety and other worker rights.\n  The President has said he wants to start to link trade and labor \nstandards and will take steps to try to achieve this in the next round \nof WTO negotiations starting in Seattle. We should start here at home \nby requiring that the extent to which a beneficiary country has \ndemonstrated a commitment to abide by obligations it has already \nundertaken in treaties and conventions it has freely entered into \nrelative to child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or \ncoerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights. \nIf we can't even include such a consideration in today's legislation, \nhow do we expect to succeed in including such provisions in a \nmultilateral negotiation of over 130 member nations?\n  Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which would require \nconsideration of internationally recognized labor standards when \ndetermining if a CBI country may benefit from unilateral trade \npreferences. My amendment would require the President, when designating \na CBTEA beneficiary country, to consider the extent to which the \ncountry provides internationally recognized worker rights, such as the \nright of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively; \nprohibition on the use of any form of coerced or compulsory labor and a \nminimum age for the employment of children.\n  Most CBI countries are signatories of the International Labor \nOrganization conventions. Considering the extent to which these \ncountries abide by their own international obligations is the least we \ncan do when considering whether they deserve to receive unilateral \ntrade preferences from us.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Roth, for including in the manager's package an \namendment by Mr. Sarbanes and myself expressing the sense of the \nCongress with respect to the issue of debt relief for poor countries. \nOur resolution simply expresses the desire of this body to work with \nthe President and the international community to forgive the debt owed \nto us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from \nthese countries to reform their economies and work toward a better \nquality of life for their people. This follows on legislation we \nintroduced earlier this month to accomplish this important objective.\n  Our effort today is premised on the notion that we must help these \npoverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them \nthe economic opportunity to liberate their futures. This issue has \nunited people of diverse interests and backgrounds from all around the \nworld. There is a growing sense across the cultural and political \nspectrum that debt burdens are a major impediment to economic reform \nand the alleviation of the abject poverty facing the world's poorest \ncountries. And there is increasing certainty that debt forgiveness--if \ndone right--can be a positive force for change in the developing world. \nOur resolution makes clear that the objectives of debt relief should be \nthe promotion of policies that promote economic growth, openness to \ntrade and investment, and the development of free markets. I am glad \nthe full Senate is joining us in this endeavor.\n  Today, Mr. President, the world's poorest countries owe an average of \n$400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much \nmore than most people in these countries make in a year--in fact more \nthan one billion people on Earth today live on less than a dollar a \nday. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor \ncountry's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic \nrestructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water \nand sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments \nwould require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a \ncountry where one child in six dies before the age of five, little \nmoney remains to finance initiatives that would improve the country's \neconomic prospects, its openness to trade and investment, or the \nstandard of living of its people. Among sub-Saharan African countries--\nmany of the very countries we're looking to help in the trade package \nbefore us today--one in five adults can't read or write.\n  Mr. President, the problems in the developing countries that yield \nsuch grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental \ncommitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside \nworld. We cannot solve all these problems today. Rather, we are simply \naffirming to the world that the small step of debt relief is one that \ncan and should be taken without delay.\n  The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has \nbeen ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international \ncommunity and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest \ncountries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign \ncreditors. What's more, the payments that are being made are hampering \nprogress toward more free, open, and economically vibrant economies. \nThe external debt for many developing nations is more than twice their \ngross domestic product, leaving many unable to even make interest \npayments. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. The \nquestion is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we \ncan encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in \nexchange for our forgiveness.\n  In Uganda, for example, debt relief obtained under the existing debt \nforgiveness programs has cleared the way for a doubling of classroom \nsize, allowing twice as many children to attend school as before. This \ntype of benefit is real. It is tangible. And it will bring untold \nbenefits to the country in future years. We must do more to encourage \nthese types of programs and debt relief is one vehicle that can help \neffect real change in the developing world.\n  Prudent debt relief is in all of our best interests. It is an \ninvestment in the commitment of the world's poorest countries to \nimplement sound economic reforms and help their people live longer, \nhealthier and more prosperous lives.\n  Our amendment today is another step toward this goal and I thank my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program.\n  Let me begin by stating--as others have on this issue--that I believe \nstrongly in the concept of free and fair trade, and I have always \nsupported legislation that opens foreign markets, assures that trade \nagreements are enforceable, and provides the opportunity\n\n[[Page S13761]]\n\nfor competitive U.S. firms to do business overseas. I support \nlegislation of this type because I feel that in the long run it \nincreases the economic welfare of our nation and leads to substantial \nand measureable benefits for Americans. Exports now generate over one-\nthird of all economic growth in the United States. Export jobs pay ten \nto fifteen percent more than the average wage. Depending upon who you \nlisten to, it has generated anywhere from two to eleven million jobs \nover the last ten years. Without expanded trade brought on as a result \nof globalization, we will end up fighting over an ever-decreasing \ndomestic economic pie. Trade is inevitable, it is the terms of trade \nthat we debate.\n  And this debate is important, because while many Americans are \nenjoying unprecedented opportunities as a result of the process of \nglobalization, others are not so fortunate. Clearly, free trade has \nnegative attributes, and the United States has not been immune to them. \nIn my state alone over the last two years we have seen several thousand \npeople laid off in trade-related plant closures--from high-tech to \napparel to copper. Many more New Mexicans have been forced to find \nother work because they can no longer compete on an international \nbasis. The vast majority of these people live in rural communities \nwhere there really isn't anything else for them to do in terms of \nemployment. When I talk to these people, they ask me: Where am I \nsupposed to work now? Where do I find a job with a salary that allows \nme to support a family, own a house, put food on the table, and live a \ndecent life? Where are the benefits of free trade for me now that my \ncompany has gone overseas? What good are cheaper products when I no \nlonger have a salary to pay for them?\n  These are tough questions, especially from someone who is trying to \npay a mortgage, or get their children an education, or buy food for the \ntable, and they deserve an answer. In my opinion, the answer does not \nlie in protectionism, as many would suggest, because it is no longer a \nlegitimate option. It is impossible to go back in time and trade only \nwithin our own borders. Instead the answer lies in the development of \nprograms that provide people with the skills to be gainfully employed \nand provide companies with the tools so they can become internationally \ncompetitive. It is through workforce development and technological \ninnovation. Globalization is inevitable. It is not going to stop. \nTherefore, the question for us in this Chamber is: How we can manage it \nto benefit the national interest of the United States? How can we make \nit work for our people? How can we establish an environment where high-\nwage jobs can be obtained and communities sustained?\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is supposed to do just that. \nAs my good friend and colleague Senator Moynihan has pointed out on the \nfloor many times, this program and its component parts are part of a \nvery reasonable agreement with American workers and companies: If \nAmericans lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements entered into \nby the U.S. Government, then the U.S. government should assist these \nAmericans in finding new employment with equivalent or better wages. If \nthe U.S. government supports an open trading system, it is responsible \nto repair the negative impacts this policy has on its citizens. If you \nlose a job because of U.S. trade policy, you should have some help from \nthe U.S. Government in getting unemployment benefits and retraining to \nget a new job that pays you as much or more as you were getting before.\n  And, since its inception, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has \nattempted to do just that. It has over the years consistently helped \nindividuals and companies in communities across the United States deal \nwith the transitions that are an inevitable part of a changing \ninternational economic system. It helps people that can work and want \nto work to continue to work in productive jobs that contribute to the \neconomic welfare of our country.\n  But, as good as the Trade Adjustment Assistance program is, it is not \nwithout flaws, and these flaws frequently make the program difficult to \nuse for those that need it most. Even worse, in some cases, it is \nsimply unavailable for those who need it most.\n  What are some concrete examples of these problems? In my state of New \nMexico, we have over the last few years seen a serious lack of \ncoordination between the federal and state agencies responsible for the \nprovision of unemployment benefits and retraining, and we have seen a \nnear complete incompatibility of application procedures. This lack of \nharmonization has made potential recipients run in circles to find \ninformation and advice that would help them find viable work.\n  We have passed legislation that provides benefits to some individuals \nthat are not available to others. For instance, the NAFTA Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program provides unemployment benefits and \nretraining for those who have been negatively impacted by trade or \nshifts in production overseas, but the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram only provides retraining in the case of former, not the latter. \nFurthermore, secondary workers--individuals who with their company \nprovide direct inputs into primary manufacturing facilities--are not \neligible for any support at all, this in spite of the fact that they \ntoo may lose their jobs when a primary facility is forced to close. How \ndo you explain these programmatic differences to workers who need help, \nand need it now?\n  Another problem: Trade Adjustment Assistance provides assistance to \nworkers in specific communities, but it does not provide assistance to \nthose communities that have been significantly impacted by trade or \nshifts in production overseas. No evaluation of community needs, no \nstrategic plan for economic development, no technical assistance to \nhelp a community recover from what has happened. Thus, while we provide \nfederal funds so workers can retrain to find employment, in many cases \nthere is no simply gainful employment to be had in the community. There \nis no work to retrain for that pays a living wage. In other words, \nthere is no linkage between retraining programs and community workforce \nneeds. Individuals thus have a choice: stay in town on unemployment \nuntil it runs out, take a lesser paying job that disallows them from \nproviding for themselves and their family, or relocate to a region that \nhas employment to offer. In either case, the community loses. And this \nis happening with disturbing frequency not only in New Mexico, but in \nrural communities across the United States. Ask any of my colleagues, \nand they will tell you they have heard the same story.\n\n  I would argue that in some very specific cases foreign trade or the \ntransfer of production overseas has had a such an impact on a community \nthat it is analogous to a natural disaster. The impact on the community \nis so severe, pervasive, and painful that it is equivalent to a flood, \ntornado, or earthquake. In many cases, not just individuals, but an \nentire community has become dislocated, and is not prepared as a \npolitical or economic entity to take the steps needed to recover. Not \nonly the individuals, but the community, needs help to get back on its \nfeet.\n  So what must be done in these circumstances? In this country we have \norganized a unique approach to first anticipate, and then respond to, \nnatural disasters--the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA--\nand it is designed to integrate the federal/state/local activities to \nobtain optimal recovery. Why not have this kind of coordinated program \nfor trade? We organize this kind of response through the Department of \nDefense and the Office of Economic Adjustment when a military base \ncloses in a community. Why not have such a program for communities \naffected by trade? I am not talking about giving funds to those in need \nin perpetuity. I am talking about establishing a coherent strategic \nplan with an entry and exit policy that helps individuals and \ncommunities develop a workforce plan, create good jobs for their \ncitizens, and become viable economic competitors in the international \nmarketplace.\n  The time is ripe to examine these issues, and in my view it is time \nto think outside the box. There are too many inconsistencies in \nexisting unemployment and re-training benefit programs--Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Job \nTraining Partnership Act, the Workforce Investment Act, and \nunemployment insurance--and they must be examined so we can make them \nefficient and effective mechanisms for our\n\n[[Page S13762]]\n\nworkers. In my view, these problems are not necessarily the fault of \nthe Department of Labor, which administers many of the programs I refer \nto today. The problems are indicative of an ad hoc approach to policy \nformation over the years, and it is time to align these programs so \nthey will have the maximum benefit effect for those who need them. \nTrade Adjustment Assistance is an excellent idea and it has served us \nwell, but it is time that it be refined to better fit the needs of an \nincreasingly interdependent international political economy.\n  To this end, I offer a very straightforward amendment today, and an \naction that I see as a first, but very important, step to more \ncomprehensive Trade Adjustment Assistance reform. The immediate goal of \nthe amendment is to obtain the information necessary to make informed \ndecisions on how to proceed in future legislation. My amendment asks \nthat the General Accounting Office study this issue, and, within nine \nmonths, offer Congress specific data and recommendations concerning the \nefficiency and effectiveness of federal inter-agency and federal and \nstate coordination of unemployment and retraining activities associated \nwith the following programs: the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, \nthe NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance program, the Job Training \nPartnership Act, the Workforce Investment Act, and the Unemployment \nInsurance Program. The report will examine the activities since the \nenactment of the NAFTA agreement on January 1, 1994, and will include \nanalysis of many of the issues I mentioned previously: the \ncompatibility of program requirements and application procedures \nrelated to the unemployment and retraining of dislocated workers in the \nUnited States, the capacity of these programs to assist primary and \nsecondary workers negatively impacted by foreign trade and the transfer \nof production to other countries, and the effectiveness of the \naforementioned programs relative to the re-employment of United States \nworkers dislocated by foreign trade and the transfer of production to \nother countries. This is an unambiguous and uncomplicated amendment, \nand it will help us chart a course for the future.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance is a necessary part of our national trade \npolicy toolbox, and I believe it has done an admirable job over the \nyears. But we all know it will become even more important as our \ncountry becomes more integrated into the global economy. For this \nreason, it is time that it be made more effective, and that its goals \nbe better defined. I believe this amendment will assist us in this \neffort, and I hope that my colleagues will support the passage of this \nbill when it comes to a vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to present legislative \nbackground and history on a provision contained in the Manager's \nAmendment to the African Growth and Opportunity Act adopted this \nevening by consent. Constituents in my state in the wool fabric \nindustry have been concerned about any revision to tariff reduction and \nphase-out schedules that would unfairly alter their competitive posture \nand force layoffs of Connecticut employees.\n  The final language in the provision states that, ``It is the sense of \nthe Senate that U.S. trade policy should place a priority on the \nelimination or amelioration of tariff inversions that undermine the \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. consuming industries, while taking into \naccount the conditions in the producing industry in the United States, \nespecially those currently facing tariff phase-outs negotiated under \nprior trade agreements.'' I want to note that this provision as adopted \nwas modified to reflect specific concerns I raised about it. While this \nprovision merely expresses a ``sense of the Senate'' and is in no way \nlaw or binding, I do want to provide background on the intent of the \nprovision.\n  I note, first, that language in the provision as originally proposed \ndirecting the inclusion of the ``wool fabric'' industry sector in this \nprovision was specifically deleted in the version that passed in the \nManager's Amendment, underscoring the Senate's clear intent that this \nprovision is not directed at this sector.\n  Second, the provision specifically requires that full account be \ntaken of ``conditions'' in the various ``producing industry in the \nUnited States,'' indicating that whatever further action Congress may \nwant to consider in the future on this issue, or that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative may raise in future negotiations, must assure fairness \nand equitable treatment to those currently producing in the United \nStates. Furthermore, the language specifically states that special \nattention and equity is to be provided to ``those currently facing \ntariff phase-outs negotiated under prior trade agreements.'' Since my \nconstituents in the wool fabrication sector specifically fall into \nexactly that posture, properly relying on phase-out schedules \nnegotiated in prior trade agreements, this protection and assurance is \ndirected at their concerns, which, in turn, is why their industry \nsector was dropped from application of this provision.\n  I further appreciate the assurances provided me by the Managers of \nthis bill that I will be provided full notice of any consideration of \nthis issue in conference and that it will be resolved in a manner \nsatisfactory to me in representation of my constituent's concerns.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the managers' amendment has been worked on \nby the distinguished ranking member, Senator Moynihan, and myself. We \nhave worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. This represents \nthe results. There is no objection from the Democrat or Republican \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply confirm the chairman's \nstatement. I thank all who have worked very hard on this extensive \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the managers' \namendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for a voice vote.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2505) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the ranking member of the committee for his \ncooperation and help.\n  I think now we are about ready to proceed with the votes.\n  A quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2487\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is entitled to 2 \nminutes of his time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment provides for enforceable \nlabor standards. This is about the terms of trade and wanting to make \nsure with the CBI countries that when it comes to the right to organize \nand bargain collectively, people are not imprisoned for asserting this \nright, and that basic human rights and basic labor rights are met. In \nthat way, we will have a trade agreement with enforceable labor \nstandards that says to wage earners in our country: You are not going \nto lose your job in the apparel industry to other countries because \nthey are paying 35 cents an hour and violate basic labor rights. It \nalso says to workers in CBI countries: It is a benefit to you; you do \nnot have to depend on investment by only making 35 or 40 cents an hour \nand not able to have basic human rights and labor rights.\n  This amendment calls for enforceable labor rights. It is the right \nthing to do. It is all about the right terms of trade, and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the managers' amendment which has just \nbeen adopted at the behest of Senator Levin, myself, and others, \nrequires that core labor standards are necessary matters that the \nPresident must consider in granting these trade privileges. Of course, \nthe Generalized System of Preferences incorporates substantially the \nsame measures. The President is authorized to consider countries' \ncompliance with these standards. Indeed, the President has already \nendorsed the\n\n[[Page S13763]]\n\ncore labor standards through the ILO Declaration adopted in 1998. There \nis no need to micromanage his handling of foreign affairs.\n  In the interest of moving this measure along, with full agreement \nwith the purposes of the Senator from Minnesota, I move to table the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 4 minutes equally divided before \na vote on the motion to table amendment No. 2347.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides for a private \nright of action to go into Federal court and stop dumped goods from \ncoming into the United States in order to enforce U.S. trade laws and \ninternational trade laws, consistent with GATT.\n  For example, today, if you take a case under 30201, the International \nTrade Commission takes up to a year to have it acted on, and then the \nadministration can have a suspension order and eliminate it totally. \nDumped goods are unfairly taking jobs from farmers, where dumped wheat \ncomes into the United States. Textiles are dumped, steel is dumped, \nlamb is dumped; and the administration consistently decides these \ncases--as they did on steel with Russia--on a suspension agreement as \nto what is going to help the Russian economy for foreign policy and \ndefense reasons, as opposed to seeing to it that United States trade \nlaws are enforced that prohibit dumping--selling in the United States \nat a lower cost than illustratively selling in Russia.\n  This would give an injured party a chance to go to court and get an \ninjunction within a few weeks, to have countervailing duties imposed, \nwhich would be an effective way to see to it that our antidumping laws \nare enforced and we do not have the disintegration of industries such \nas steel or unfair practices for wheat farmers, lamb farmers, and the \nlike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's \namendment. I do so because there is no evidence that the current \nantidumping and countervailing duty laws have failed to deliver relief \nto injured industries. Indeed, it is not clear to me that shifting the \nburden of the initial investigation to the courts, with any allowance \nat all for the normal process of discovery between private litigants, \nwould help the petitioning industry in these cases.\n  While both petitioners and respondents complain about their treatment \nbefore the administrative agencies, largely due to what they consider \nto be the arbitrary basis for their decisions, both sides to the \nlitigation seem to agree that the cases themselves are completed as \nrapidly as possible. They also agree that the current system provides \nmore certainty and predictability.\n  Given that, I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the \nimplications of shifting these cases to the Federal courts. While the \nsystem is not perfect, the fact is that petitioners have been very \nsuccessful in these cases. Moreover, the system is surprisingly quick \nand responsive, given the complexity of these cases. Anybody who has \nspent years before the Federal courts in a complex commercial matter \ncan tell you that the current system of litigation of unfair trade \ncases administratively is quite rapid.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to table the \namendment. No such change, as proposed by this amendment, should be \nadopted without thorough study on the part of the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this rollcall vote and \nfuture rollcalls in this series be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2347. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``no''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided for a vote on the motion to table the Landrieu \namendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will not ask my colleagues to vote. I \nwill ask for the vote to be vitiated. However, I want to spend 1 minute \non this amendment because there seems to be a misunderstanding about \nsome of the facts. With all respect to the chairman and ranking member \nwho do not support this amendment, perhaps we will have longer to \ndebate this in the years to come.\n\n[[Page S13764]]\n\n  It is my understanding--and I am supporting this bill--that our idea \nis to help develop the continent of Africa in a mutually beneficial way \nthat helps our Nation, also. However, in the current draft of the bill, \nthere is an island that is included which is technically part of \nAfrica. There are 1 million inhabitants and the per capita GDP is \n$10,300, far exceeding other nations, such as Sudan with a GDP of $875; \nEthiopia, with a GDP of $520; Somalia, with a GDP of $600 per year per \ncapita.\n  I don't understand why we are including some islands that are already \ndoing very well--in fact, better than some of our European nations. I \nbring this to the attention of the Senate. I will not ask for a vote. \nThe ranking member has said there are administrative provisions in this \ntrade agreement that make it clear our efforts are directed to the \nnations that need development and not to give preferential treatment to \nnations or areas that are already quite developed.\n  That is my only point. I am not going to ask the Senate to vote on \nit. Perhaps we will have a time to discuss this in the next year or the \nnext Congress.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. She \nis absolutely right. We should address this issue. We will. I thank her \nfor bringing it before us and do not forget to come back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we dispense with the \nvote on the motion to table the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe my amendment is next in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has an inquiry. Is it the intention \nof the Senator from Delaware--is the motion to withdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator withdrew her amendment and I asked unanimous \nconsent we dispense with the vote on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2430) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For how long? Is it 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought my amendment was pending, under the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would need to call up the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2495\n\n (Purpose: To deny benefits under the legislation to any country that \n does not comply with the Convention for the Elimination of the Worst \n                         Forms of Child Labor)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I call up amendment 2495.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2495.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no benefits under this Act shall be granted to any \n     country (or to any designated zone in that country) that does \n     not meet and effectively enforce the standards regarding \n     child labor established by the ILO Convention (No. 182) for \n     the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the President, \n     after consultation with the Trade Policy Review Committee, \n     shall submit a report to Congress on the enforcement of, and \n     compliance with, the standards described in subsection (a).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under the understanding, I am going to \ntake just a couple of minutes. Even though there was no time agreement, \nthere was an understanding. I know people want to vote on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will yield, the Senate will be \nin order.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by my \ncolleague from North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, and also by my friend from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone. As you can see, this has broad philosophical support.\n  I also at this moment inform my colleagues and thank Senator Helms \nfor reporting out just this morning, from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the Convention 182 on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of \nChild Labor. That is record time. It was just adopted in June of this \nyear. Then it had to go through some legal reviews and the President \nsubmitted to the Senate on August 5, 1999. So I want the chairman to \nknow how much we appreciate the expeditious handling of that and the \nfact it is reported out. I am hopeful we can get a vote on it before we \ngo out toward the end of this year.\n  The reason I had the clerk read the entire amendment is because it is \nnot very long and not very convoluted. All it says, basically, is no \ncountry will get the benefits of this bill unless they adopt and \nenforce the provisions of this Convention 182 that was just adopted in \nJune.\n  I might point out that there are 160 signators to this Convention. It \nis the first time in history the entire three representatives of the \nILO Tripartite group, which are representatives from government, \nbusiness, and labor agreed on the final form of a convention out of \nILO. So it has broad support.\n  This talk about the worst forms of child labor, child prostitution, \nchild trafficking in drugs, child trafficking itself, hazardous work, \nany forms of bondage or slavery--all of those are listed under 182. All \nthis amendment says is the benefits of this bill cannot go to any \ncountry that does not adopt and enforce the provisions of 182.\n  I hope we can get a vote on the convention itself before we go out \nthis fall. I believe it will say to all these countries in Africa: We \nare willing to trade with you, we are willing to help, but if you are \ngoing to have child prostitution, if you are going to traffic in kids, \ngoing to use kids in the drug trade, if you are going to chain them to \nlooms, and you are not going to let them go to school, you are not \ngoing to permit them to have their own childhood--you are not going to \nget the benefits of this trade bill.\n  I think it is the least we can do, to try to help take one more step \nforward in eliminating child labor throughout the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we can all thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor bringing this matter forward. I think we are all close to being \nunanimously in support of the objectives.\n  I note, of 160 signatories to the convention, only one country has \nratified it; that is the Seychelles, an island complex in the Indian \nOcean with a population of 75,000.\n  Building up an international regime in which this convention will \ntake hold and have consequences for the children is going to be the \nwork of a generation. It will be well worth it, but we are only at the \nbeginning. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is to be \ncongratulated and thanked for reporting the bill out. But we have not \nratified it. That is the situation we face. But let us go forward with \nthis vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2495.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, Mr. Kennedy would \nvote ``aye.''\n\n[[Page S13765]]\n\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 351 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     McCain\n  The amendment (No. 2495) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH.

AGRICULTURE TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES AND \n                   CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States agriculture contributes positively to the \n     United States balance of trade and United States agricultural \n     exports support in excess of 1,000,000 United States jobs;\n       (2) United States agriculture competes successfully \n     worldwide despite the fact that United States producers are \n     at a competitive disadvantage because of the trade distorting \n     support and subsidy practices of other countries and despite \n     the fact that significant tariff and nontariff barriers exist \n     to United States exports; and\n       (3) a successful conclusion of the next round of World \n     Trade Organization negotiations is critically important to \n     the United States agricultural sector.\n       (b) Objectives.--The agricultural trade negotiating \n     objectives of the United States with respect to the World \n     Trade Organization negotiations include--\n       (1) immediately eliminating all export subsidies worldwide \n     while maintaining bona fide food aid and preserving United \n     States market development and export credit programs that \n     allow the United States to compete with other foreign export \n     promotion efforts;\n       (2) leveling the playing field for United States producers \n     of agricultural products by eliminating blue box subsidies \n     and disciplining domestic supports in a way that forces \n     producers to face world prices on all production in excess of \n     domestic food security needs while allowing the preservation \n     of non-trade distorting programs to support family farms and \n     rural communities;\n       (3) disciplining state trading enterprises by insisting on \n     transparency and banning discriminatory pricing practices \n     that amount to de facto export subsidies so that the \n     enterprises do not (except in cases of bona fide food aid) \n     sell in foreign markets at prices below domestic market \n     prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring and \n     delivering agricultural products to the foreign markets;\n       (4) insisting that the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Accord \n     agreed to in the Uruguay Round applies to new technologies, \n     including biotechnology, and clarifying that labeling \n     requirements to allow consumers to make choices regarding \n     biotechnology products or other regulatory requirements \n     cannot be used as disguised barriers to trade;\n       (5) increasing opportunities for United States exports of \n     agricultural products by first reducing tariff and nontariff \n     barriers to trade to the same or lower levels than exist in \n     the United States and then eliminating barriers, such as--\n       (A) restrictive or trade distorting practices that \n     adversely impact perishable or cyclical products;\n       (B) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff-rate \n     quotas; and\n       (C) unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions or \n     other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural trade;\n       (6) encouraging government policies that avoid price-\n     depressing surpluses; and\n       (7) strengthening dispute settlement procedures so that \n     countries cannot maintain unjustified restrictions on United \n     States exports in contravention of their commitments.\n       (c) Consultation With Congressional Committees.--\n       (1) Consultation before offer made.--Before the United \n     States Trade Representative negotiates a trade agreement that \n     would reduce tariffs on agricultural products or require a \n     change in United States agricultural law, the United States \n     Trade Representative shall consult with the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Consultation before agreement initialed.--Not less than \n     48 hours before initialing an agreement relating to \n     agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices of the World \n     Trade Organization, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall consult closely with the committees referred to in \n     paragraph (1) regarding--\n       (A) the details of the agreement;\n       (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States \n     agricultural producers; and\n       (C) any changes in United States law necessary to implement \n     the agreement.\n       (3) No secret side deals.--Any agreement or other \n     understanding (whether verbal or in writing) that relates to \n     agricultural trade that is not disclosed to the Congress \n     before legislation implementing a trade agreement is \n     introduced in either house of Congress shall not be \n     considered to be part of the agreement approved by Congress \n     and shall have no force and effect under United States law or \n     in any dispute settlement body.\n       (d) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should \n     be the top priority of United States negotiators; and\n       (2) if the primary competitors of the United States do not \n     reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and export \n     subsidies in accordance with the negotiating objectives \n     expressed in this section, the United States should take \n     steps to increase the leverage of United States negotiators \n     and level the playing field for United States producers in \n     order to improve United States farm income and to encourage \n     United States competitors to eliminate export subsidies and \n     domestic supports that are harmful to United States farmers \n     and ranchers.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for point of clarification, this is a \nmatter\n\n[[Page S13771]]\n\nthat has now been negotiated so that we could reach agreement on the \nnegotiating objectives for our trade representatives at the WTO Round.\n  I thank all the Members who have participated in this, certainly my \ncosponsor, Senator Grassley of Iowa, and a special thanks to the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee for \ntheir assistance in working this out.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2427 and ask \nunanimous consent that it be modified with the language I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Would the Senator tell me what the modification is?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the Senator, we have worked this out with you \nand your staff.

ENCOURAGING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADE AND \n                   INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A mutually beneficial United States Sub-Saharan Africa \n     trade policy will grant new access to the United States \n     market for a broad range of goods produced in Africa, by \n     Africans, and include safeguards to ensure that the \n     corporations manufacturing these goods (or the product or \n     manufacture of the oil or mineral extraction industry) \n     respect the rights of their employees and the local \n     environment. Such trade opportunities will promote equitable \n     economic development and thus increase demand in African \n     countries for United States goods and service exports.\n       (2) Recognizing that the global system of textile and \n     apparel quotas under the MultiFiber Arrangement will be \n     phased out under the Uruguay Round Agreements over the next 5 \n     years with the total termination of the quota system in 2005, \n     the grant of additional access to the United States market in \n     these sectors is a short-lived benefit.\n       (b) Treatment of Quotas.--\n       (1) Kenya and mauritius.--Pursuant to the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing, the United States shall eliminate the \n     existing quotas on textile and apparel imports to the United \n     States from Kenya and Mauritius, respectively, not later than \n     30 days after each country demonstrates the following:\n       (A) The country is not ineligible for benefits under \n     section 502(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2462(b)(2)).\n       (B) The country does not engage in significant violations \n     of internationally recognized human rights and the Secretary \n     of State agrees with this determination.\n       (C)(i) The country is providing for effective enforcement \n     of internationally recognized worker rights throughout the \n     country (including in export processing zones) as determined \n     under paragraph (5), including the core labor standards \n     enumerated in the appropriate treaties of the International \n     Labor Organization, and including--\n       (I) the right of association;\n       (II) the right to organize and bargain collectively;\n       (III) a prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or \n     compulsory labor;\n       (IV) the international minimum age for the employment of \n     children (age 15);

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the two floor leaders--the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee--for allowing me \nto make this modification to my amendment.\n  I understand they will be opposing it, but I very much appreciate \ntheir willingness to allow me to offer it in the form I want.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act is all about increasing our \nlevel of trade with sub-Saharan Africa. That's a worthy goal, because \nthe current level of trade between the American and the African people \nis depressingly small. Africa represents only 1 percent of U.S. \nimports, 1 percent of U.S. exports, and 1 percent of U.S. foreign \ndirect investment. AGOA's supporters want to see those numbers \nincrease, and that is what I want as well. However, the principal trade \nbenefit appearing in AGOA is temporary preferential access to the U.S. \nmarket for textiles and apparel. This kind of legislation discourages \nthe economic diversification that Africa needs to build economic \nstrength.\n  AGOA does renew the GSP program, but does not amend it to provide \nduty-free benefits for many of Africa's primary exports. This \namendment, if accepted, will make the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct much more meaningful in terms of potential trade, while at the same \ntime ensuring that this legislation does no harm. It expands the list \nof African products eligible for duty-free access to U.S. markets, \nwhile at the same time adding important qualifications to ensure that \ngrowth does not come at the expense of human development.\n  My amendment would make goods listed under the Lome Convention \neligible for duty-free access, provided those goods are not determined \nto be import-sensitive by the President of the United States. Products \ncovered include all of sub-Saharan Africa's industrial products, all \nprimary mineral products, and most of Africa's agricultural products, \nsuch as fruits, nuts, cereals, cocoa, and basketware. These provisions \nmean more trade opportunities for more African people.\n  That's an important idea--opportunities for African people. In fact, \nunlike the African Growth and Opportunity Act as it stands now, this \namendment would ensure that Africans themselves are employed at the \nfirms receiving benefits. My amendment requires that any textile firm \nreceiving trade benefits must employ a workforce that is 90 percent \nAfrican. In addition, my amendment requires that 60 percent of the \nvalue-added to a product comes from Africa. These provisions hold out \nan incentive to African governments, businesses, and civil societies to \ndevelop their human resources. And that would not only be good for \nAfrica, but it would be good for America as well, as our trade partners \nin the region gain economic strength. At the same time that this \namendment does more for Africans, it also takes important steps to \nprotect American jobs from being lost to transshipment.\n  Trans-shipment occurs when textiles originating in one country are \nsent through another before they come to the United States. In this \nway, the actual country of origin can ignore U.S. quotas. Approximately \n$2 billion worth of illegally transshipped textiles enter the United \nStates every year. The U.S. Customs Service has determined that for \nevery $1 billion of illegally transshipped products that enter the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S13774]]\n\nStates, 40,000 jobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost.\n  Those who think that transshipment isn't going to be a problem in \nAfrica had better think again. An official website of China's Ministry \nof Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation quoted an analyst as saying \nthat:\n\n       Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment, \n     technology and personnel could not only greatly increase \n     sales in African countries, but also circumvent the quotas \n     imposed in commodities of Chinese origin imposed by European \n     and American countries.\n\n  The Chinese know that standard United States protections against \ntransshipment are weak and easy to defeat.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act, as it currently stands, \nrelies on the same old weak protections that have led to these \nstatistics--the same textile visa system that China and the other \ncountries have manipulated in the past. This inadequate system requires \ngovernment officials in the country of manufacturing to give textiles \nvisas before those textiles can be exported, in order to certify the \ngoods' country of origin. But often, corrupt officials simply sell \nvisas to the highest bidder.\n  My amendment would create a new system--one that makes the U.S. \nimporter responsible for certifying where textiles and apparel were \nproduced. This gives U.S. entities a strong financial stake in the \nlegality of their imports. Instead of relying on foreign officials, \nthis standard relies on the American companies who operate right here, \nunder American law. This amendment also requires foreign governments to \ncooperate with Customs Service investigations into transshipment, or \nrisk losing their trade benefits.\n  If we pass this amendment, countries that want to skirt U.S. trade \nregulations will have to re-think their designs on Africa. As the \nSenate moves to increase the levels of legal trade between the United \nStates and Africa, we must think carefully about the context in which \nwe conduct our trade relations. Labor rights, human rights, and \nenvironmental protections are given short shrift by the current version \nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This is a recipe for social \nunrest and distorted development, and it is clearly in the United \nStates' best interest to address these issues.\n  We are all affected when logging and mining deplete African \nrainforests and increase global warming. We are all degraded when the \nproducts we buy and use are created by exploitation and abuse. And we \nall reap the benefits of an Africa where freedom and human dignity \nreign, creating a stable environment in which business can thrive. \nAmerican ideals and simple good sense require that we be vigilant in \nthis regard. This amendment contains provisions to address labor \nrights, human rights, and environmental protection. Mr. President, \nAfrica labor unions have been opposing AGOA for good reasons. This \namendment takes their concerns seriously. It clearly spells out the \nlabor rights that our trade partners in Africa must enforce in order to \nreceive benefits. These include the right of association, the right to \norganize and bargain collectively, a prohibition on forced labor, \nminimum age of 15, and provisions for acceptable conditions with \nrespect to wages, hours, and safety.\n  This amendment also provides for a monitoring procedure that involves \nthe Africa Region branch of the International Confederation of Free \nTrade Unions in compliance reporting. These provisions go far beyond \nthe labor protections in the current bill, which are linked to GSP--and \nthey do so for a reason. GSP labor rights provisions are rarely \nenforced. Some African countries--such as Equatorial Guinea--receive \nGSP currently yet do not allow the establishment of independent free \ntrade unions. Clearly, GSP is not enough to ensure the growth and \nopportunity are not exchanged for abuse and exploitation.\n  This amendment would also deny benefits to countries engaging in \nsignificant human rights abuses. Mr. President, that is stronger \nlanguage than AGOA currently contains, and it sends a clear signal \nabout the kinds of partners the United States is seeking in Africa. As \nit stands, AGOA contains no environmental provisions whatsoever. Yet in \nsome African countries like Tanzania, 85 percent of the population \nlives directly off the land. Clearly, development in Africa is \ncontingent on environmental sustainability. My amendment grants \nadditional trade benefits to U.S. and other foreign investors from \ndeveloped countries when they use the same environmental technology and \npractices in Africa that they use at home. This amendment makes AGOA \nmore important and more responsible. If we are serious about engaging \nin Africa, let's make a genuine effort, rather than a token one. Let's \nmake a responsible effort rather than an indifferent one.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, regretfully, but once again, I rise in \nopposition to this measure. It would add overly restrictive African \ncontent and citizenship requirements, and the transshipment penalties \nare extraordinary. On the matter of citizenship, sir, I would not doubt \nthat there are 30 garment shops, factories, if you like, floors or \nlofts, in New York City, in Manhattan, where a majority of the \nemployees are not American citizens. They are legal immigrants, they \nhave rights of American workers, they are paid, and they pay taxes. But \nin the course of the last three centuries, we have seen enormous \nmovements of labor from one place to another, a lot of recycling.\n  If I could take one moment, since it is quiet and we have some \ndistinguished Senators here, recently there was a study of illegal \nimmigration from Mexico by some very fine sociologists, American and \nMexican. The question is, Under what circumstances would illegal \nimmigration increase? The answer is that immigration would increase if \nyou sealed the borders because it is circular. People come up north to \nwork. They raise money, and they go back and they can buy a car. Then \nthey return. If there was a real wall, they would not go back. The \nworld economy has been such since the 18th century. Exceedingly, these \nare good intentions of the Senator who offered essentially the same \namendment yesterday.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I hope Senators are not confused by the \ncomments of the Senator from New York. Certainly, the 90-percent \nrequirement with regard to workers in Africa is one of many provisions \nin this. This is not the same amendment as yesterday. This involves \nlabor protections, human rights protections, environmental protections, \nexpanding the list of goods. This is a much broader alternative. In \nfact, it is essentially the HOPE alternative. So I hope the Senators \nvote for this. Although we received 44 votes on the transshipment \namendment, this is by no means a vote on this particular provision. I \nwant to be clear about that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator is right. If I \nmischaracterized his amendment, I apologize. It is an extension of \nyesterday's amendment. Would he accept that characterization?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It covers a range of topics that have nothing to do \nwith yesterday's amendment. It expands the number of products and trade \nand an alternative provision of what should be done. The Senator is \ncorrect that a couple of provisions are the same. I think many other \nprovisions are of substantial importance, and I hope people regard this \nas an alternative approach.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I accept the Senator's account.\n  Again, I make a motion to table the amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13775]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2410\n\n(Purpose: To provide expedited trade adjustment assistance for certain \n                      textile and apparel workers)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2410.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR TEXTILE AND APPAREL \n                   WORKERS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, workers in \n     textile and apparel firms who lose their jobs or are \n     threatened with job loss as a result of either (1) a decrease \n     in the firm's sales or production; or (2) a firm's plant or \n     facility closure or relocation, shall be certified by the \n     Secretary of Labor as eligible to receive adjustment \n     assistance at the same level of benefits as workers certified \n     under subchapter D of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 not later than 30 days after the date a petition for \n     certification is filed under such title II.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we consider the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, I rise to speak about the status of the United States \ntextile and apparel industry. Last week I made a more complete \nstatement regarding the demise of the industry, done in the name of \nfree trade, under the guise of promoting market-based economies and \ndemocratic governments in developing countries.\n  The result of these trade agreements on the textile and apparel \nindustry in the United States has been a flood of imports and a \nsignificant impact on employment. In my own state, the loss of textile \nand apparel jobs has been particularly devastating. Since 1987, South \nCarolina has lost nearly one-third of all textile jobs and over 50 \npercent of all its apparel jobs.\n  Another concern I have is how our legislation impacts our broader \nforeign policy and drug control objectives. I am concerned that as we \npropose to drastically increase container shipping through the \nCaribbean, we will be exposing our Nation to the potential for a \ntremendous increase in illicit drug imports.\n  Mr. President, the key to resolving many of our hemispheric problems \nis coordinating our criminal justice efforts, defense requirements, \nforeign policy, and economic and trade strategy toward Latin American \ncountries. We cannot afford to look at these in isolation of one \nanother.\n  Finally, let me highlight some of the more dangerous elements of \nlegislation which some in Congress are proposing. While the Senate bill \nalleviates some of the worst of these issues, I want the record to be \nclear on why these provisions must never become law. If, by some \nchance, this bill moves to a conference with the House, there may be an \neffort to incorporate some of these proposals. This would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  There are some in Congress who would favor the quota-free entry into \nthe United States for apparel made in the Caribbean Basin countries \nfrom fabric produced anywhere in the world. Such a provision would void \nthe Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.\n  Another flawed proposal is the scheme to use Tariff Preference \nLevels, whereby fabric produced anywhere in the world may be used in \napparel sewn in the Caribbean Basin countries and imported duty-free \nand quota-free into the United States. Such preferences are permitted \nunder NAFTA. Canada has used its preferences to export into the United \nStates textile and apparel products made of non-North American yarns \nand fabrics. This violation of NAFTA has permitted $300 million from \ntextile mills in Europe and Asia to severely damage U.S. manufacturers \nof wool suits and wool fabrics as well as other U.S. producers. \nLikewise, Mexico is now sending textiles and apparel made from cheap \nAsian yarns and fabrics into the United States. Tariff Preference \nLevels are bad for the American textile and apparel industry and for \nits workers. They must not be permitted to be extended further.\n  Perhaps the worst provisions proposed in the House bill are those \nrelated to transshipment. Transshipment is the practice of producing \ntextile and apparel goods in one country, and shipping it to the United \nStates using the quota and tariff preferences reserved for a third \ncountry. The most egregious part of the House bill is that it fails to \ninclude provisions for origin verification identical to those in \nArticle 506 of the North American Free Trade Act. This could lead to \nAfrica and the Caribbean Basin being used as an illegal transshipment \npoint by Asian manufacturers. It would encourage the use of non-U.S. \nproduced fiber and fabric in apparel goods entering the United States \nduty-free.\n  Finally, the House bill grants overly generous privileges and \npreferences to African and the Caribbean Basin countries in a \nunilateral fashion. There is little incentive for these countries to \ngrant reciprocal access for products made in the United States.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that unfair trade policies have \nnegatively impacted employment levels in this important sector of our \neconomy. There is no reason to believe the trade bills we are debating \nwill lead to a different result. Furthermore, these bills raise serious \nnational defense and foreign policy questions. Finally, many \nprovisions, which unfortunately might be included in the final \nlegislative product, would cause unnecessary harm to the textile and \napparel industry in the United States. The textile and apparel firms \nmay survive as they adapt to our legislative actions and changing \neconomic conditions. American textile workers may not be so fortunate. \nThis is my main concern--for those textile and apparel workers who work \nhard, pay their taxes and raise their families. This is why I have \nreservations about this bill.\n  Mr. President, that is also why I am proposing an amendment to this \nbill. My amendment would correct an injustice in the current Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program. If you accept the premise that it is \ngood policy for the Senate to enact legislation that will result in \nAmericans losing their jobs, then you must agree that Trade Adjustment \nAssistance is a program which deserves our support. This program \nprovides extended unemployment insurance coverage and retraining \nbenefits to displaced workers. It is the least we can do for the \nAmericans working in the textile and apparel industry who will lose \ntheir jobs because of this bill.\n  My amendment would correct weaknesses in the current program. The \nDepartment of Labor would have 30 days to certify that the employees \nwho are going to lose or who have lost their jobs would be eligible for \nthe highest possible level of benefits available under the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment number 2410 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It clarifies that \ntextile workers who lose their job as a result of plant closure or \nrelocation or as a result of a decrease in production or sales, shall \nreceive trade adjustment assistance benefits from the Department of \nLabor. These benefits shall be the same as those available to workers \nwho become employed as a result of NAFTA-related job losses.\n  I urge support for this amendment. It is the least we can do for the \nthousands of Americans who are going to lose their jobs as a result of \nthis legislation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on amendment No. 2410 \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2410) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nthink we are getting close to a vote on the Feingold amendment \nmomentarily, or in the next few moments, and a vote on final passage.\n  First, I want to compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for \ntheir leadership in managing this bill. This wasn't the easiest bill in \nthe world to manage. They handled it professionally and with great \nclass. I think we are getting ready to pass a good bill. I\n\n[[Page S13776]]\n\nthink we are going to pass a bill that proves, one, the Senate in 1999 \nis not isolationist and protectionist. It proves we can help a lot of \nour fellow people across the world by expanding trade, whether they be \nin Africa or whether they be in the Caribbean nations. We want to help \nthem through trade, which we believe is mutually beneficial.\n  So I particularly compliment the two managers of this bill for their \noutstanding work and bringing to a close a bill that I think will be a \nreal compliment to the first session of this Congress.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2480\n\n(Purpose: To provide a waiver of a section 901(j) denial of foreign tax \n  credit in the national interest of the United States, and to expand \n   trade and investment opportunities for U.S. companies and workers)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2480.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . APPLICATION OF DENIAL OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT \n                   REGARDING TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH RESPECT TO \n                   CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 901(j) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to denial of foreign tax credit, etc., \n     regarding trade and investment with respect to certain \n     foreign countries) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Waiver of denial.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with \n     respect to taxes paid or accrued to a country if the \n     President--\n       ``(i) determines that a waiver of the application of such \n     paragraph is in the national interest of the United States \n     and will expand trade and investment opportunities for U.S. \n     companies in such country, and\n       ``(ii) reports such waivers under paragraph (B).\n       ``(B) Report.--Not less than 30 days before the date on \n     which a waiver is granted under this paragraph, the President \n     shall report to Congress--\n       ``(i) the intention to grant such waiver, and\n       ``(ii) the reason for the determination under subparagraph \n     (A)(i).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply on or after February 1, 2001.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment is to allow \nthe President of the United States a waiver to section 901, which \ndenies foreign tax credits if he determines it is in the national \ninterest of the United States and also to expand trade and investment \nopportunities for U.S. companies and workers.\n  Again, I appreciate the cooperation of both managers of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I call for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2480) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2402\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I call up the Dorgan amendment No. 2402.\n  There is no further debate on this amendment. I ask that we proceed \nwith a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2402) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2427\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we are now prepared to return to Senator \nFeingold's amendment, No. 2427 and proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2427. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously \nagreed to managers' amendment be modified with a technical change which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 621. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TARIFF INVERSIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that United States trade \n     policy should, while taking into account the conditions of \n     United States producers, especially those currently facing \n     tariff phase-outs negotiated under prior trade agreements, \n     place a priority on the elimination or amelioration of tariff \n     inversions that undermine the competitiveness of United \n     States consuming industries.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2325\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated on the substitute amendment and the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2325) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture motion on the underlying bill be vitiated and the bill be read \na third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is a difficult vote for me. This bill \ncontains provisions I support such as the reauthorization of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act (TAA) and the Africa Growth and Opportunity \nAct. But the\n\n[[Page S13777]]\n\nCBI provision of the bill is troubling because it extends benefits \nunilaterally without assurances that reciprocal trade benefits will be \ngranted to U.S. products.\n  However, with the adoption of the Levin-Moynihan amendment some \nprogress is assured because under this amendment, the President would \nbe required to take into consideration the extent to which a country \nprovides internationally recognized worker rights, including child \nlabor, collective bargaining, the use of forced or coerced labor, \noccupational health and safety and labor standards before the trade \nbenefit can be granted.\n  The adoption of this amendment is a major reason I have decided to \nvote for this bill.\n  I hope this provision can be further strengthened in Conference. \nHowever, at a minimum, Senator Moynihan has assured me a strong effort \nwill be made to retain the provision in Conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Comparison of Levin-Moynihan Amendment with Underlying Bill\n\n          (Criteria for Designating CBTEA Beneficiary Country)\n\n       Under the Senate bill prior to adoption of the Levin-\n     Moynihan amendment, to designate a beneficiary CBTEA country, \n     the President must determine that a country has demonstrated \n     a commitment to three things: (I) undertake its obligations \n     under the WTO on or ahead of schedule; (II) participate in \n     negotiations toward the completion of the FTAA or a \n     comparable trade agreement; and (III) undertake other steps \n     necessary for that country to become a party to the FTAA or a \n     comparable trade agreement.\n       It then allows the President to consider ten criteria for \n     making the determination that a country has demonstrated a \n     commitment to the above three things. Among the ten criteria \n     that can be considered is; the extent to which a country \n     provides protection of intellectual property rights; the \n     extent to which the country provides protections to investors \n     and investment of the U.S. and; the extent to which the \n     country provides internationally recognized worker rights.\n       The Levin-Moynihan amendment would require that in \n     designating a beneficiary country, the President must \n     consider the extent to which that country has demonstrated a \n     commitment to each of the 13 criteria in the underlying bill. \n     In other words, the Levin-Moynihan amendment elevates the \n     criteria in the underlying bill to a mandatory status for \n     consideration. Under this amendment, the President, in \n     designating a country as a CBTEA country, must take into \n     account, for instance, the extent to which the country \n     provides internationally recognized worker rights, including:\n       (a) the right of association, (b) the right to organize and \n     bargain collectively, (c) prohibition on the use of any form \n     of coerced or compulsory labor, (d) a minimum age for the \n     employment of children, and (e) acceptable conditions of work \n     with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and \n     occupational safety and health.\n       Some of the other specifically recognized items for \n     mandatory consideration in our amendment are: (a) whether the \n     country has met specific counter-narcotics certification \n     criteria, (b) the extent to which the country becomes a party \n     to and implements the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption, (c) the extent to which the country affords to \n     products of the U.S. tariff treatment that is no less \n     favorable then the most favorable tariff treatment provided \n     by the country to any other country pursuant to any free \n     trade agreement to which such a country is a party, other \n     then the Central American Common Market or the Caribbean \n     Community and Common Market.\n       Under the Levin-Moynihan amendment consideration of these \n     items is no longer just an option. The President must take \n     these factors into consideration.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this bill was not an easy bill for me to \nsupport. While I believe that fostering trade with our neighbors leads \nto growth both here and abroad, I also know that some companies use \ntrade to take advantage of foreign low wage workers. I had hoped that \nthis bill would take stronger measures to ensure that labor and \nenvironmental rights received greater respect.\n  I opposed cloture initially on this bill because it would unfairly \nlimit the ability to improve the bill. After an agreement was worked \nout to allow trade related amendments, I decided to support cloture to \nmove the legislation forward. I supported amendments that would have \nrequired labor and environmental agreements and stricter oversight of \nimports to avoid trans-shipment. I was disappointed that these \namendments were not agreed to, but I encourage the conferees to \ncontinue fighting for these important issues.\n  Some important changes were made. The Senate included a provision to \nhelp our farmers cope with the negative effects of trade agreements. \nThis Trade Adjustment Assistance for farmers parallels the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program that has helped so many industrial \nworkers. Senator Harkin offered an amendment that will go a long way \ntoward eliminating child labor in these developing countries if they \nhope to take advantage of the benefits in this legislation. This \nprovision makes the bill more humane, and reflects our moral values, \nnot just our economic interests.\n  While the bill is not perfect, increasing opportunity for some of the \npoorest countries is an important goal and deserves the support of the \nSenate. The countries of the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa know that \ntrade and investment coupled with aid programs are more effective than \nforeign aid alone. The countries involved support this bill and look \nforward to a chance to sell their products in our market.\n  The struggle for labor standards is a long road, but that journey \ncannot start if people do not have jobs. There is no way to improve \nworking conditions for the unemployed. Only when trade and investment \nbring jobs to these countries will workers be able to organize and \nfight for better conditions. Many of these countries are new \ndemocracies that have much to learn about the benefits of protecting \ntheir workers. We should remember that the United States is a democracy \nthat is 225 years old, and that the backbone of our labor laws are only \n65 years old. Those laws did not come easily. There was a long, bitter, \nand sometimes bloody fight before the United States saw the wisdom of \nprotecting workers rights. We need to continue our efforts, both at the \ngovernment and non-governmental level, to convince these countries to \nfollow our example. Unfortunately, our trade negotiators have only \nrecently come to the conclusion that labor rights matter to workers \nhere and abroad.\n  Making access to the U.S. market difficult is not going to improve \nthe lot of workers in Africa and the Caribbean. The more we do to \nengage these countries and improve the climate for investment, the \ncloser these countries get to moving out of poverty and toward \nprosperity.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am, unfortunately, unable to be \npresent for this vote, but would like to express my support for the \nfinal passage of the amended version of H.R. 434, the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act. This legislation includes a modified version of \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act, the United States-Caribbean \nBasin Trade Enhancement Act, and reauthorization of the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences (GSP) and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) \nprograms.\n  This legislation will end up helping more than 1 billion people begin \nto enjoy the benefits of democracy and the free market system. \nUnfortunately when most Americans think of recent politics in Sub-\nSaharan Africa and the Caribbean, they only think of dictatorships, \ncivil wars, and people crushed in the grip of poverty. It is a \ncompelling portrait and shows the necessity of this legislation.\n  However, there is hope in the nightly news reports. Both in the \nCaribbean and in Africa, democracy and economic development are \nemerging from the shambles of the past. According to a 1998 global \nsurvey by Freedom House, 30 countries in Africa are now politically \nfree or partially free. In addition, these countries are beginning to \npursue policies of economic development that will help their citizens \nrise above the debilitating poverty of the past. In 1998, while the \nAsian economic crisis pummelled other countries, Africa's economies \nactually grew by an average rate of 3.1 percent.\n  Democracy and market economics also are established in the Caribbean. \nThe civil wars in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala have ended. \nUnfortunately, many of these countries are still suffering from the \neffects of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges, and need these trade benefits \nto rebuild their economies.\n  This year's elections in Nigeria and South Africa, and the upcoming \nelection in Guatemala, exemplify the democratic developments in Africa \nand the Caribbean. As the bulwark of freedom and liberty, the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S13778]]\n\nmust do all that it can to ensure that democracy and market economics \ncontinue to spread and grow. This legislation is crafted to aid these \ntransformations.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act establishes a special GSP \nprogram to give duty and quota-free treatment to selected African \ntextiles and goods, and enhances cooperation between the United States \nand Sub-Saharan Africa. It is my hope that the President will use the \nprovisions of this legislation to seriously pursue a free trade \nagreement with the leaders of Sub-Saharan African countries. The United \nStates-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act grants selected exports \nfrom Caribbean nations the duty- and quota-free treatment that has \nbenefitted Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  Finally, the reauthorization of the GSP program helps many other \ndeveloping countries benefit from preferential trade treatment. These \nGSP provisions will help developing countries become members of the \nglobal community and prosper in the growing world marketplace. Also, \nthis legislation will reinforce the core American values of freedom and \nequal opportunity that are a cornerstone of our great country. This \nlegislation is based on the commonsense principle that if you give a \nnation a handout, you feed it for a day, but if you teach its people to \ngrow and trade, you assist them in becoming independent and self-\nreliant.\n  This legislation also helps U.S. workers and companies. U.S. exports \nto the Caribbean nations exceeded $19 billion last year, and produced a \n$2 billion trade surplus. This trade has created 400,000 American jobs. \nIn 1998, the United States exported $6.5 billion in goods to Sub-\nSaharan Africa. This trade supported over 100,000 American jobs. \nHowever, the United States only has a 7% share in the African market, \nwhile Europe has a 40% share. More U.S. trade and investment in both \nthe Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa will increase U.S. market share \nand create more American jobs.\n  While I support this legislation, I believe that it can be improved \nduring the conference with our colleagues from the House side. The \nHouse-passed version of the African Growth and Opportunity Act includes \nprograms under the auspices of the Export-Import Bank and Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation that will give American companies \nincentives to invest in Africa. Also, I am concerned that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that ``almost no apparel imports \nwould qualify for special treatment'' under the textile provisions of \nthe Finance Committee amendment. The House-passed version of the bill \nremoves quotas and duties on all African textile imports, and will be \nof much greater benefit to the African nations as well as to the U.S. \nIt is my hope that the conferees will adopt these provisions in the \nHouse-passed version of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. These \nmeasures will ensure true economic development and increased U.S. \nmarket access in Africa.\n  In addition, I have some concerns about the provision of the bill \nreferring to the excise tax collected on rum. This provision increases \nby $3.00 the amount of the excise tax on rum that is transferred to \nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands retroactively from June 30, \n1999, to October 1, 1999. The bill earmarks $0.50 of this tax for the \nPuerto Rico Conservation Trust Fund. I am aware of the importance of \nhelping our territories to become economically self-reliant, while also \nprotecting their environments. However, I believe that we should look \nat more efficient ways to achieve this goal. It makes no sense for the \nfederal government to collect a tax and then turn it all back over to \nthe territories. I hope that this provision will be stricken from this \nlegislation, and that we can more thoroughly examine how to help our \nterritories achieve economic growth without unnecessary federal \nbureaucracy and taxation.\n  I am also concerned about certain other provisions that have found \ntheir way into this legislation. This legislation includes a provision \nto extend TAA benefits to farmers and fishermen. I know that the \ncollapse of foreign markets abroad has hurt American farmers and \nbelieve that this issue should be given more consideration. I am also \nconcerned by provisions included for Oregon power plant workers to \napply for TAA benefits after their eligibility has expired, provisions \nto allow a company with operations in Connecticut and Missouri to \nobtain a refund on duties it paid on imports of nuclear fuel \nassemblies, and $2 million earmark for a two-year study on how American \nLand Grant Colleges and not-for-profit international organizations can \nimprove the flow of American farming techniques and practices for \nAfrican farmers. These measures should be examined in the usual \nauthorization process to ensure that it is considered on merit and not \nspecial interests. It should not be attached to this legislation when \nSenators have not had a chance to examine the costs and benefits.\n  In conclusion, I support this historic legislation to ensure the \nprogress of democracy and economic development in Africa, the \nCaribbean, and other developing countries. By promoting freedom and \ninterdependence, the United States can help millions of people live in \na future without repression where any child's potential is limited only \nby their dreams.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of \nutmost importance to American suit manufacturers in New York and around \nthe country, an issue that my colleague Pat Moynihan has been fighting \non for many years.\n  I am referring to an anomaly in America's tariff policy that harms \nAmerican companies like Hickey-Freeman, Pietrafesa, and other producers \nof fine wool suits.\n  Our response will determine whether this country will be able to \nsupport companies that manufacture suits with a ``Made in America'' \nlabel.\n  My general belief is that free trade is a boon to the overall \neconomy. But our wool tariff policy is a patchwork quilt of part free \ntrade, part high tariff, part no tariff: policies stitched together \nwith no rhyme or reason as to how it will impact U.S. companies and \nconsumers.\n  Under the current tariff schedule, U.S. suit companies that must \nimport the very high quality wool fabric used to make high-end men's \nsuits pay a tariff of 30 percent on that fabric. These American \ncompanies, in turn, compete with companies that import finished wool \nsuits from other countries, which pay a 19 percent tariff on the \nfinished suit. And since the NAFTA agreement, U.S. importers of suits \nmade in Canada and Mexico pay no tariff whatever.\n  And those Canadian and Mexican suit manufacturers pay no, or very \nlow, duties on their imported wool fabric from Italy and elsewhere. \nThey, in effect, get a perfectly free ride into the U.S. market, while \nAmerican clothing companies, employing American textile workers, have \nto pay to play.\n  Where is the consistency here? All we have today are randomly placed \nzero, 19 percent, or 30 percent tariffs with no concern over the big \npicture: American companies and American jobs.\n  In fact, U.S. companies have been fighting a war of attrition for \nnearly ten years, a war which they are slowly losing, due solely to \nAmerican laws.\n  So we are now at a crossroads.\n  Some domestic fabric manufacturers support the tariff policies \nbecause they argue that Hickey-Freeman and other high-end suit \nmanufacturers ought to buy their fabric here in the U.S. That would be \ngreat--if there was ample domestic supply of the fabric these suit \ncompanies require: But there is not.\n  According to leading American fabric manufacturers, U.S.-produced \nhigh-end wool fabric supply falls short of demand by more than 2.5 \nmillion square meters. That leaves Hickey-Freeman, a Rochester, New \nYork, institution since 1899, Pietrafesa of Syracuse New York, and \ndozens of other fine suit manufacturers with two options: import more \nthan half of their wool fabric at a 30 percent tariff, or shift their \noperations to countries where they will not be hindered by the \nrestrictive added costs they face here.\n  In other words, these American companies are virtually compelled to \nmove their operations out of the U.S. by these irrational U.S. laws.\n  That is why the textile workers unions are fighting hard to repeal \nthese unfair tariff policies. Indeed, since 1991, fine suit \nmanufacturers in New York and around the country have been forced to \nclose dozens of manufacturing\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\nfacilities, and lay off more than 10,000 employees.\n  Don't get me wrong: I support the idea of free trade. I believe that \nour nation is the strongest and most prosperous on earth, and in such a \nstrong global leadership position, due to our open trading system, and \nour principles of free trade which we help instill on other nations \naround the world.\n  But what I'm talking about today is not free trade. It is a hodge-\npodge of non-sensical trade laws. These wool tariffs give the advantage \nto foreign companies in other countries in their ability to compete in \nour market.\n  All I ask for is a level playing field--I believe that under fair \ntrade and competition the U.S. worker and U.S. industries will prevail. \nBut they will not be given a chance if the deck is stacked against \nthem. Under current law, the game is fixed.\n  Now, I recognize that good faith negotiations are ongoing between \nAmerican fine wool suit manufacturers, domestic wool producers, \nSenators Moynihan and Roth, Members of this body from interested \nstates, and the White House. Senator Moynihan has, for many years, made \nthis unfair wool tariff a cornerstone of his efforts to ensure fair \ntrade. And I am doing what I can to help move these negotiations along.\n  But I want to make clear that we need to resolve this issue as soon \nas possible. The American fine suit industry and their employees can \nwait no longer. Too many jobs have already been lost due to these \ntariffs, and too many more remain on the line.\n  The trade package currently under consideration in the Senate \nprovides the best opportunity to finally provide economic justice to \nAmerican companies struggling to compete in a global trading system \nwhich is still struggling to work out its kinks.\n  I believe that reasonable minds will resolve this issue when the \nfacts are clear to all involved. And the main fact is that loyal, \nproductive, U.S. companies are currently at a serious disadvantage in \nits own home economy. That should not stand.\n\n\n                    Amendments No. 2379 and No. 2483\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my reasons for voting \nto table amendments No. 2379 and No. 2483 sponsored by Senator \nHollings. The two amendments would have required the United States to \nnegotiate side agreements with the countries named in the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act and the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade \nEnhancement Act concerning labor standards and the environment similar \nto the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation and the North \nAmerican Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. Mandating that the \nUnited States negotiate agreements before providing the benefits \ngranted to these countries under this act would have had the effect of \nnullifying the bill.\n  Labor and environmental issues should be considered when negotiating \ntrade agreements. In today's global economy, the economic actions of \none country can have profound implications for the entire world \neconomy. We witnessed this firsthand with the recent global economic \ncrisis. Just as the economic decisions of one person in Indonesia can \nhave significant consequences for someone in Germany, the living \nstandards, working conditions, and the environment standards of workers \nin Peru or Malaysia can have an impact on our workers here in the \nUnited States.\n  The two amendments offered by Senator Hollings have admirable goals, \nhowever they are unworkable in the context of this bill. Because this \nbill calls for the United States to take the unilateral action of \nreducing tariffs on a wide range of products in order to provide \nincentive for these countries to develop their economies, it would be \nout of place to mandate negotiations that were designed to accompany \nbilateral trade agreements. If we are serious about protecting workers \nand the environment, we should include them as part of a bilateral \nnegotiation when our trading partners will have obligations to fulfill.\n  Our goal with this bill is to improve and grow the economies of sub-\nSaharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. We are doing this by opening \nour markets in the hope that these economies will integrate into the \nworld economy as responsible trading partners and will develop as \nfuture markets for our exports.\n  The two amendments offered by Senator Hollings would have had the \neffect of neutralizing the underlying bill to support economic \ndevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. I could \nsupport similar amendments when they are raised in the context of trade \nagreements when side agreements can be enforced.\n\n\n                        tariffs on wool fabrics\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the chairman and ranking \nmember for their efforts on an issue that is important to workers in \nIllinois, as well as those in New York and other states. Specifically, \nI refer to their efforts and leadership in addressing the need to \nmodify tariffs on wool fabrics used in the men's suit industry. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of S. 218 introduced by Senator \nMoynihan at the beginning of this year, and have worked with both \nSenators from New York and many other colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, on this issue.\n  Because of a loophole in NAFTA, Canadian suitmakers have become our \nlargest source of imported suits at the expense of tens of thousands of \nAmerican workers who have seen their plants close. I am a supporter of \nNAFTA--I voted for it and I believe it is good trade policy for our \ncountry. However, as part of NAFTA, concessions were made by our U.S. \nnegotiators to allow Canada to bring Canadian manufactured suits in to \nthe United States, duty-free. Canada proceeded by removing its tariffs \non imported wool fabrics, setting up a situation where its \nmanufacturers could import the same fine wool fabrics American \nmanufacturers import, manufacture a suit in Canada, and export that \nsuit to the United States, without paying a single tariff. Our U.S. \nmanufacturers are forced to pay over 30 percent in tariffs for this \nsame fine wool fabric. All our manufacturers ask for from us is to \nprovide a level playing field on which they can compete.\n  This has been a difficult issue to resolve because of the various \nstakeholders involved. However, unless the final trade bill offers some \nrelief for this industry, more Americans will lose their jobs as a \nresult of our own U.S. trade policies.\n  The pending amendment will allow this issue to be resolved in \nconference, and I commend both our majority and minority committee \nleaders for their efforts.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I also thank my chairman for his work, \nand that of his staff, in addressing an issue that I have worked on for \nmany years. I first started this effort with my friend Congresswoman \nLouise Slaughter a number of years ago. Since that time even more \nAmericans have lost their jobs as a result of tariffs on wool fabric--\nfabric that is not produced in the quantity and quality needed by our \ndomestic industry. I believe that we are close to finalizing an \napproach to finally resolve this issue, and I commend the chairman for \nhis willingness to work with us on this important matter.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on behalf of the thousands of workers in \nNew York, I join my colleagues in thanking both Chairman Roth and \nSenator Moynihan for their work on this issue. Earlier this year I was \nvisited by one of these workers, Mr. Fred Cotraccia, a Shop Steward for \nHickey-Freeman of Rochester, NY. At that time he explained to me the \nimportance of providing relief to the suit manufacturing industry, and \nhe presented me with a teddy bear dressed in an American-made, hand-\nmade, fine wool fabric suit. In a letter from him accompanying the bear \nhe says, ``Please stand up for American jobs . . . My livelihood and \nthe livelihood of thousands of other hard working American employees, \ndepends on you supporting our jobs--please choose `made in America.' ''\n  A number of my Senate colleagues received a similar type letter, and \na similar request to help save their jobs. I believe we have made \nsignificant strides in finding a way to provide relief to this industry \nat the expense of no one, but to the benefit of many.\n  Mr. KERRY. Today we must vote on a package of bills that are intended \nto promote trade and thereby lift-up the economies of sub-Saharan \nAfrican and Carribean Basin nations. I believe strongly in that \npremise. I believe that\n\n[[Page S13780]]\n\nfree and fair trade can improve the lives of workers in developing \nnations and is vital to improve our economy at home. On balance, this \nachieves those goals, and I therefore support it.\n  Much of the debate surrounding this package of trade bills has \ncentered on the provisions dealing with Africa. This is proper, as it \nis the AGOA portion of the bill that I am most concerned about. Many \nargue that AGOA is the last chance for Africa to develop a textile \nindustry. In 2005, current quotas on textiles from Asia and other parts \nof the world will be lifted. If we lift those quotas on sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries now, those countries may have some chance to develop \ntheir textile industry in the next five years, before Asia--especially \nChina--has a chance to dominate textile manufacturing. If Africa does \nnot develop its textile industry now, there is no way it will be able \nto compete with China in 2005. This would not only hurt African \nnations, who will be without a textile industry, but it will hurt US \napparel manufacturers, who will have one less resource to produce their \nproducts and will be forced to send more of their work to China.\n  That said, this bill fails to address many of the crucial problems \nfacing Africa, and it would be tragic if this were the final word on \nAfrica. First, this bill fails to address the perhaps the single \ngreatest barrier to economic growth and development in Africa: the \nspread of AIDS. Unless our efforts to combat this epidemic are \nbolstered immediately, this public health disaster will result in \nsevere economic distress for African countries. The effect of this \ndisease, which strikes people in their most economically productive \nyears, cannot be ignored if we expect these countries to be effective \ntrading partners. It is imperative and entirely appropriate to include \nAIDS relief in this legislation. A recent study in Namibia estimated \nthat AIDS cost the country almost 8 percent of its GNP in 1996. Another \nanalysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5 percent smaller in 2005 \nthan it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will \nbe 10 percent lower.\n  The microeconomic outlook is not much better. Businesses across sub-\nSaharan Africa are already suffering at the hands of HIV. In Zimbabwe, \nfor instance, life insurance premiums grew four-fold in just two years \nbecause of AIDS deaths. Some companies there have reported a doubling \nof their health bills. In Botswana, companies estimate that AIDS-\nrelated costs will soar from under one percent of wages in 1999 to five \npercent by 2005. In Zambia and Tanzania, some companies have already \nreported that costs resulting from AIDS-related health costs and lower \nproductivity have exceeded total profits. Without addressing a health \ncrisis of this enormity, we are ignoring one of the most important \nimpediments to development of the African continent.\n  The second concern I have with the AGOA bill is that it ignores the \ngreat albatross of debt that hangs around the neck of the African \npeople and is a tremendous impediment to their economic growth and \ndevelopment. AGOA provides no debt relief to Africa, despite the fact \nthat Africa's crushing $230 billion debt burden is a massive obstacle \nto economic and social progress. By ending the vicious circle of debt \nand debt servicing, debt relief for Africa would open the way for \nprivate investment in African enterprises, investment that is critical \nto the long-term development and growth of every economy.\n\n  I believe that the United States should play a prominent role in \nreducing the debt burden of nations that are unable to achieve \nsustainable economic growth and development under the constraint of \nservicing their national debts. Our economic relationship with Africa \nmust take the long view and advance policies that will build a solid \nbasis for continued growth, rather than simply extending the short-\nsighted, debt-centered policies of decades past.\n  Unfortunately, many amendments that would have begun to address the \nweaknesses of the AGOA bill failed on the Senate floor. I supported \namendments that would have improved labor and environmental standards \nand that would have better addressed transhipment concerns. Although \nthose amendments failed, I will, nevertheless, support this package, \nnot because I am fully satisfied with its treatment of Africa, but \nbecause as a whole, the package includes other important trade measures \nthat will not only bolster the economies of developing nations, but \nwill have a positive economic impact here at home. I have long been a \nproponent of Trade Adjustment Assistance as a way to help U.S. workers \nand industries that have been harmed by trade. The Generalized System \nof Preferences is also a crucial to developing countries by stimulating \ntheir exports. I am pleased that this package includes these very \nimportant programs.\n  Finally, the CBI portion of the package will put our neighbors in the \nCaribbean on more equal footing with Mexico. By providing duty free \ntreatment to apparel assembled in the Caribbean basin only if US \nfabrics are used, this bill will strengthen the economy and long term \nstability of Caribbean Basin countries. This will go a long way to help \nthem to recover from the extensive damage they suffered during \nHurricanes Mitch and Georges. The U.S. has a trade surplus with \nCaribbean Basin which has led to more and better jobs in my home state \nof Massachusetts and throughout the country.\n  Because the balance of the package of trade bills before us today is \nfavorable, I support the bill with the sincere hope that we revisit the \nissues of concern to sub-Saharan Africa soon.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have stepped back from the brink. A \nweek ago it appeared that we would reject this essential trade \nlegislation. The first in five years. Weeks before the opening of the \nThird Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, which \nwill launch a new round of trade negotiations. Here in the United \nStates, in Seattle.\n  As a tribute to the patience of our esteemed chairman, Senator Roth, \nand our leaders Senators Lott and Daschle, we somehow agreed to revive \nthe bill. We now move one step closer to providing the President with \nlegislation that will confirm, when he arrives in Seattle, that the \nUnited States Senate remains committed to open trade policies.\n  I join the chairman of the Finance Committee in urging the Senate's \nsupport for this package of trade measures which includes the Finance \nCommittee's sub-Saharan African and CBI trade bills, as well as the \nreauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs. Each of these measures was \napproved by the Finance Committee with near unanimous support.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan noted, in a speech he \ndelivered in Boston on June 2, the ``recent evident weakening of \nsupport for free trade in this country.'' We appear to be turning \nagainst trade policies that we have pursued for 65 years. It is hard to \nunderstand this in a period when, as the New York Times reported last \nFriday:\n\n       The American economy turned in its best quarterly \n     performance of the year this summer, virtually guaranteeing \n     enough momentum to carry the nation to its longest economic \n     expansion in history early next year.\n\n  Let me repeat that last phrase--``its longest economic expansion in \nhistory. . . .'' Not just peacetime, or just wartime, but ``in \nhistory.''\n  And what are the benefits of this unprecedented economic expansion--\nan expansion that started in April 1991, is now in its eighth year, \nwill break the record of 107 months in February 2000, and shows no sign \nof ending? The answer is clear: an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent--a \nlevel not seen in almost 30 years; and near zero inflation.\n  To what can we attribute this remarkable performance of the American \neconomy?\n  I dare say that if the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930 was one of the \ncauses of World War II, then trade liberalization is one of the reasons \nfor the unprecedented expansion.\n  Other factors I would cite are just-in-time inventories--made \npossible by the information age, the 1993 deficit reduction act, Alan \nGreenspan, and perhaps some ``good luck.''\n  Given the tremendous transformation of the American economy--between \n1960 and 1998 manufacturing employment dropped from 30 to 15 percent of \ntotal employment--there inevitably were and will be dislocations. Since \n1962 we have eased the cost of\n\n[[Page S13781]]\n\ndislocation to workers by providing Trade Adjustment Assistance--\nassistance which will expire at the end of this week. More than 200,000 \nworkers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. The bill before \nus would continue Trade Adjustment Assistance, something we ought to do \nas we enact trade liberalization policies.\n  I would also note that this legislation reflects our commitment to \nhonor the ILO's core labor standards, a commitment made by all 174 \nmembers of the ILO. The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and \nRights at Work, adopted at the 86th International Labor Conference, \ndeclares that ``all members, even if they have not ratified the \nConvention in question, have an obligation, arising from the very fact \nof membership in the Organization, to respect, to promote, and to \nrealize, in good faith'' these core labor standards; (1) freedom of \nassociation and the effective recognition of the right to collective \nbargaining; (2) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory \nlabor; (3) the effective abolition of child labor; and (4) the \nelimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n  Under the managers' substitute the President must assess the \ncompliance of the CBI and sub-Saharan African countries with these core \nlabor standards--these ``internationally recognized worker rights.''\n  The Generalized System of Preferences--which we put in place a \nquarter century ago--was the United States' response to the plea of \ndeveloping countries that the industrial world ought to give them an \nopportunity--and a bit of an incentive--to compete in world markets. \nThe theme then--as today--was that ``trade, not aid'' would ultimately \nwean countries from their dependence on foreign aid and help diversify \ntheir economies. This legislation will continue this important program.\n  The bill puts in place--at long last--a trade policy with respect to \nsub-Saharan Africa, a policy that is long overdue. The economic \nchallenges facing sub-Saharan Africa today may be even greater than \nthey were at the height of the cold war. Consider the differing paths \nof South Korea and Ghana: in 1958, the year after Ghana achieved \nindependence, its per capita GDP, at $203, exceeded that of South Korea \n($171 at the time). Forty years later, in 1998, South Korea's per \ncapita income had soared to $10,550, even after the Asian financial \ncrisis, while Ghana's stood at a modest $390.\n  The Africa trade legislation in this package will not reverse years \nof neglect and decline, but it may provide a decent start.\n  And we endorse with this legislation President Reagan's Caribbean \nBasin Initiative--begun in 1983--updating the program to enable the CBI \ncountries to remain competitive even as the NAFTA has eroded their \nmarket positions. The chairman and I met 6 weeks ago with the \nPresidents and Vice Presidents and Foreign Ministers of a number of the \nCBI states--the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, \nCosta Rica. They made a simple request--that we allow our trade to \ngrow. And so this legislation will do.\n  This is legislation which deserves strong support here in the Senate, \nso that we can quickly move to a conference with the House and send the \nPresident to Seattle negotiations with the bipartisan backing of trade \nliberalization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His patience, his \nhistorical perspective on trade, and the key role he has played through \nthe years were instrumental in getting this legislation through. I want \nto say I think it gives a clear statement to our neighbors in the \nCaribbean, Central America, and Africa that we are willing to invest in \na long-term economic relationship--a relationship of partners and a \ncommon endeavor of expanding trade, enhancing economic growth, and \nimproving living standards.\n  I also think, most importantly, it will send a very clear signal to \nour partners around the world that isolationism is dead, that liberal \ntrade policies are still supported overwhelmingly. It signals, I \nbelieve, that the United States is prepared to engage constructively in \nthe wider world around us and to provide the kind of leadership \nnecessary to reach our common goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I stand here to assert that we would not \nbe here at this moment without the revered chairman of the Committee on \nFinance. He has kept to a party tradition that goes back generations. \nHe has enabled us, sir, to pass the first trade bill in this Senate in \n5 years. We were beginning to send a signal that was ominous and could \nhave been, in the end, ruinous. But we have stepped back from that \nbrink, and we have William Roth of Delaware to thank.\n  I thank all of our wornout and excellent associates, David Podoff, \nDebbie Lamb, Linda Menghetti, and Tim Hogan on our side, and all of the \nmajority staff. I see Frank Polk over there, and Grant Aldonas, Faryar \nShirzad and Tim Keeler. It is a fine moment. Let us hope we make the \nmost of it, sir.\n  With great thanks to all, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, during the course of our debate on the \nfloor of the Senate today, we have considered a myriad of important \namendments to a very important trade bill. The attention of Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle was focused on the floor, of course, but it was \nalso focused on our Cloakrooms, the rooms that are a few feet away from \nme. Again, on television, every time we walked in the Cloakroom, we \nlooked up to see another all-news channel with pictures that were \nincredible. Of course, the footage today comes from the city of \nSeattle, WA. Seattle, WA, has become another battlefront in America's \nendless gun war. Seattle, WA, erupted in violence today.\n  As I stand here now, I don't know if they have been able to apprehend \nthe terrorist who was involved in this. They were searching for him. \nThe latest news suggests that two people are dead and two are \ncritically wounded. I know some eight or nine schools have been locked \ndown with children inside in the surrounding neighborhood, for fear \nthey might become victims of senseless gun violence as well.\n  One of my colleagues in the Senate, Patty Murray, lives in Seattle, \nWA, just a few blocks away from the scene. She has been on the phone \nall day calling her son, a grown man who is working at a business \nnearby, to make certain he was safe. Her plea to her son to take care, \nI am sure, has been repeated over and over thousands of times by the \nresidents in Seattle who are worried about their loved ones who might \nbe in the path of another gun terrorist.\n  This surreal scene that seems to be unfolding in Seattle as we watch \nthe television screen shows SWAT teams going through the neighborhoods \nof that lovely city with bulletproof shields, trying to find this gun \nterrorist, schools locked down, people staying behind closed doors for \nfear if they walk out in the street, they will literally be killed, as \ntwo already have been.\n  This is what happened today in the State of Washington. But America's \nfamilies should also know what did not happen today in the city of \nWashington--Washington, DC. What did not happen today was a meeting \nbetween House and Senate conferees to finish work on a commonsense gun \ncontrol bill to try to keep guns out of the hands of those who would \nmisuse them--kids, criminals, people with a history of violent mental \nillness.\n  The Nation was shocked and the Senate was shocked a few months ago \nwith the Columbine killings--shocked into finally doing something. We \npassed a bill by one vote, the tie-breaking vote being that of Vice \nPresident Al Gore, who came to this floor and voted for the bill which \nprovided, very modestly, that before a person can buy a gun at a gun \nshow, we have the right to know whether they have ever been convicted \nof a violent crime or whether they have a history of violent mental \nillness.\n  Is it a radical idea to try to keep guns out of the hands of kids, \ncriminals, and those who are unstable? Most American families don't \nfind that radical. I am glad we passed that bill. We sent it over a few \nhundred feet away to the House of Representatives so that, in our \nbicameral Government, they could do their part of the job.\n  Well, in the ensuing time between it leaving the Senate and arriving \nin the House, the people with the gun lobbies in Washington got very \nbusy. They lined up enough votes to literally stall and kill that bill. \nSo we have the only attempt in this congressional session for sensible \ngun control being stopped in its tracks by the gun lobby on Capitol \nHill. Yet day after frightening day, another city across the United \nStates of America is subjected to senseless gun violence.\n  Today, it was Seattle. Yesterday, it was Honolulu, HI, where a man \nwalked into the company where he once worked and killed seven people \nwith a handgun, a man who had a history of psychological problems. When \nthey finally apprehended him and searched his home, they found some 18 \ndifferent weapons, semiautomatic weapons, shotguns, and handguns--a \nsmall arsenal in the hands of a person who was turned down when he \nattempted to get a firearm owner's permit in 1994.\n\n  That was Honolulu yesterday; Seattle today, two more victims.\n  I need not tell you that nothing happened on Capitol Hill yesterday \nto deal with gun violence, and nothing happened today as this senseless \nviolence unfolds in Seattle. You have to ask yourself whether the men \nand women elected to the Senate and to the House of Representatives can \nwalk blindly by the television screens and ignore this endless war of \ngun violence in America that unfolds every day.\n  Have we become so oblivious to the pain that is being visited upon \nAmerica by the proliferation of guns in the hands of those who \nshouldn't have them? You would have to draw the conclusion that the gun \nlobby has blinded this Congress to the reality of gun violence in \nAmerica.\n  Sadly, what happened in Honolulu yesterday and is happening in \nSeattle even as we speak is repeated day in and day out across America. \nWe lose 13 children every single day in America, as many children as \nwere killed in Columbine we lose every day in gun violence.\n  Have we become so callous we can't even feel this any longer, that we \ndon't understand what is happening to our country, this great and noble \nNation which has allowed itself to disintegrate into areas of violence \nthat, frankly, people around the world can't even understand? How can \nthis Nation that has so much to say for itself stand by and do \nliterally nothing when it comes to this gun violence?\n  This Congress has been at its worst when it comes to responding to \nthis national crisis--at its worst. This Congress has been a captive of \nthe gun lobby, unable and unwilling to promote even the most basic and \nmodest provision in the law to protect families across America. We \nstand idly by.\n  Some even argue, well, the answer is to give everyone in America a \ngun. What a solution that would be, the so-called ``concealed carry \nlaw.'' So that no matter what restaurant you walk into, what high \nschool basketball game you attend, what mall you stroll through, never \nknowing if that little argument in the corner is going to erupt into \ngunfire because people are packing guns right and left. What an answer. \nThat is no answer whatsoever. America's families know it.\n  Let me tell you something else that recently happened. Senator Boxer \nof California put a provision in an appropriations bill which said as \nfollows: No licensed gun dealer in the United States can sell a gun to \na person they know to be intoxicated. They accepted the amendment on \nthe floor. As soon as it got to conference, the gun lobby took it out. \nThink about that. They would even want us to allow gun dealers to sell \nguns to intoxicated people. How irresponsible can you be?\n  When I tried to put in an amendment that held gun owners who are \nlicensed legally responsible for the safe storage of their own guns \naway from children--beaten back by the gun lobby, unacceptable. Many \nStates have put that standard in the law. But in Washington we wouldn't \neven consider it as we see day after weary day children finding the gun \ncabinet, reaching in, getting a handgun, killing themselves, or some \ninnocent playmate whose family may not have even known there was a gun \nin the residence.\n\n  When we tried to put a provision in the law to say you can't buy more \nthan one gun a month in the United States, unacceptable; one gun a \nmonth, unacceptable.\n  This fellow in Honolulu and others build up a personal arsenal and \nbuild up their own psychological problems to the point where they break \nand turn on innocent people.\n  I hope those who serve in Congress understand that we will be held \naccountable and should be held accountable. But I hope even more that \nfamilies across America who are afraid of gun violence in their \ncommunities and who are fed up with what the gun lobby has done to this \nCongress will speak out. That is the only way this will change. You \nhave to ask your candidate for Congress, the House Member or Senate: \nWhere do you stand? Where are you going to be when it comes to sensible \ngun control? Will you stand up for the families of America or will you \nstand up for the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association? It is a \nvery basic question. If it is not asked and\n\n[[Page S13783]]\n\nanswered, the sad reality is that what happened today in Seattle and \nwhat happened yesterday in Honolulu could happen in anyone's hometown \ntomorrow.\n  We have been told by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nHenry Hyde, that it is not likely the conference will meet in the next \nfew days on this gun control bill. That is a shame. We may leave this \nyear doing absolutely nothing to make America's streets safer.\n  Frankly, this Congress, again, has put first things last. We have \ndone some good things today; we are proud of them, I am sure. But \ntonight's news will not herald our accomplishments on the Senate floor. \nTonight's news reports another tragedy in America, a tragedy in America \nwhich this Senate and this House of Representatives refuses to even \nacknowledge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I can't help but lament that we have an \nadministration that has prosecuted fewer people for gun violations than \nany administration in modern history. That is something that could be \ndone today. It could have started this afternoon; It could have begun 7 \nyears ago; but it was not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13783-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13783-S13791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that under the \nprevious agreement I call up the conference report to accompany S. 900, \nthe Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     900), to enhance competition in the financial services \n     industry by providing a prudential framework for the \n     affiliation of banks, securities firms, insurance companies, \n     and other financial service providers, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     House as follows:\n       That the Senate recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the House to the text of the bill and agree to \n     the same with an amendment and the House agree to the same.\n       That the House recede from its amendment to the title of \n     the bill; signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 2, 1999.)\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in case any of our colleagues are watching, \nlet me try to outline what we were going to do tonight.\n  Senator Sarbanes and I are going to make opening statements tonight. \nIt is our understanding that no one else wishes to speak tonight. Then \nit would be our objective to reserve the remainder of our time for the \ndebate tomorrow. Then the Senate would begin the process of shutting \ndown for the evening.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, there is a time \nagreement which has been entered into, which I hope all Members are \naware of, with 4 hours equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking member. There is an hour for Senator Shelby, and an hour for \nSenator Wellstone, 30 minutes for Senator Bryan, and 20 minutes for \nSenator Dorgan.\n  I understand Senator Wellstone intends to be here in the morning at \n9:30 to start using his time, which is when the Senate will come in. I \npresume we will then work right straight through.\n  I think we ought to say to Members that we intend to try to carry \nthis thing through to completion and run our time straight through, \nwhich would enable us to finish this bill by mid afternoon.\n  I understand the House would like to act on this matter yet tomorrow. \nOf course, that would be assisted, if we could move it through the \nSenate in a reasonable time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: If quorum calls are registered, is the time \nthen drawn down equally from allocations of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only by unanimous consent. Otherwise, it is \ncharged to the side to which it is assigned.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am sure the chairman and I can work that out between \nus. I think it would be our intention not to have quorum calls. We want \npeople to come and use this time, and not end up drawing it down.\n  I think we ought to, in effect, alert our Members to that effect, and \nalso of our desire to be able to move straight through. So for Members \nwho wish to speak beginning about 10:15 or 10:30, the thing will be \nopen for Members to get time and speak on this conference report.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I join Senator Sarbanes in urging Senators \nwho want to speak on the bill, and I know there will be many, to be \nhere. The clock will run. We will have to take a break right before 12 \no'clock to swear in Senator Chafee, but except for that period of time \nwhere we will be off this bill, it will be my intention, and I know it \nis the intention of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, to stay \non the bill until we finish it.\n  Today we are bringing to the floor a bill that has been a long time \nin the making. When Glass-Steagall was adopted, Franklin Roosevelt \ncalled it the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted \nby the American Congress. In fact, Time magazine just yesterday called \nit the defining financial legislation of the 20th century. Yet, while \nit is both of those, or has become both of those, Senator Glass almost \nimmediately after the adoption of the Act bearing his name began to \nhave second thoughts and started the process of overturning Glass-\nSteagall.\n  We are here today with a bill which I believe will prove to be the \nmost important banking bill in 60 years. It does overturn the key \nprovision of Glass-Steagall that basically divided the American \nfinancial system into securities and banking halves. In the process an \nunnatural competitive environment was created, and over time, the \nmarket and the regulators have through a variety of innovations sought \nto undo this separation.\n  This bill we bring to the floor of the Senate basically knocks down \nthe barriers in American law that separate banking from insurance and \nbanking from securities. These walls, over time, because of innovative \nregulators and because of the pressure of the market system, have come \nto look like very thin slices of Swiss cheese. As a result, we already \nhave substantial competition occurring, but it is competition that is \nlargely inefficient and costly, it is unstable, and it is not in the \npublic interest for this situation to continue.\n  The Financial Services Modernization Act strikes down these walls and \nopens up new competition. It will create wholly new financial services \norganizations in America. It will literally bring to every city and \ntown in America the financial services supermarket.\n  Americans today spend about $350 billion on financial services--on \nfees and charges and interest. Most people who have looked at the \ncapacity for our markets under a more rational system believe, as I \nbelieve, that there are tens of billions of dollars of savings for the \nAmerican consumer that will be produced by the reforms of this bill.\n  This bill will allow Dicky Flatt, a printer in Mexia, Texas, to go to \nthe bank and take the checks he has received in his print shop that day \nand do his banking, deal with his insurance business, work on the \nretirement program that he and his wife and his employees have, all in \none location with all the efficiencies and synergies that come from \nthat.\n  This is a dramatic bill that will produce new products. It will \nproduce a diversity of financial services and products that we have \nnever seen before. Because of the competition in allowing these three \nmajor industries to compete head on, these products will be produced \nand these services will be provided at lower prices than we have ever \nseen.\n  There has been great debate in the media, and it will go on until the \nfacts are in, as it should. That is what happens in a free society. But \nwhen people ask me who benefits from this bill, I answer, everybody who \nuses financial\n\n[[Page S13784]]\n\nservices will benefit from this bill: Everybody who borrows money, \neverybody who has a checking account or a credit card, everybody who \nbuys insurance or securities, everybody who is engaged in modern \nfinancial transactions. When you sum all that up, that is everybody in \nAmerica, for all practical purposes.\n\n  Once we had decided to tear down these barriers, the logical question \nwas, in providing these new financial services and these new products, \nhow were they going to be provided? Were they going to be provided \nwithin the bank itself, or were they going to be provided in a holding \ncompany, separated from the bank? We had a very heated debate and, I \nbelieve, a debate with very high intellectual content on that subject \non the floor of the Senate. It was decided in the Senate by a \nrelatively close vote. It is one of these issues on which everybody's \neyes glaze over, but it is an issue that has profound importance.\n  What we have produced in this bill, which is what is always produced \nin the legislative process, is a compromise. I think the compromise on \nthe question of whether banks should provide these new services within \nthe bank or outside the bank is a good compromise, and I strongly \nsupport it. I want to congratulate Larry Summers, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, and Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, for working out this compromise. I very \nstrongly support it.\n  The compromise allows banks, under very limited circumstances, to \nprovide some of these expanded services within the bank. Basically, \nthose circumstances try to deal with two problems about which many have \nbeen concerned. I have been concerned about them, Alan Greenspan was \nconcerned about them, and others were as well. We were concerned about \nsafety and soundness and concentration of financial activities within a \nbank, driven by the potential for a bank benefiting from a subsidy \nbecause deposits are insured by the taxpayer, because the bank has \naccess to the Fed window in borrowing money at lower rates than anybody \nelse, and because of the bank's access to the Fed wire, and \ntransferring funds risk free.\n  I believe the compromise deals with that by very severely limiting \nwhat banks can do within the bank, requiring that banks, in order to \nprovide even limited financial services within the bank, be extremely \nwell managed and well capitalized. That is, they have to have at least \nan A rating on their subordinated debt. Subordinated debt is the last \ndebt to be paid, so if you are a bank and you have outstanding \nsubordinated debt, that obligation is paid after the depositors, after \nthe creditors, after everybody. For a bank to have an A or an AA or an \nAAA rating, it has to be extraordinarily well managed and well \ncapitalized, and banks will not be able to engage in activities within \nthe bank unless they meet that test.\n  We eliminate the double counting of assets that is inherent in \nproviding these services within the bank. If you provide securities \nactivities and services within the bank by setting up a securities \noperating subsidiary in the bank, you put capital into that securities \nbusiness, but because it is under the umbrella of the bank, it counts \nas part of the capital of the bank even though it is committed to \ncapitalizing the securities business. What we require in this \ncompromise--and I think wisely require--is that we eliminate this \ndouble counting by saying the capital that is invested in the \nsubsidiary cannot count as part of the capital of the bank.\n  We limit all subsidiaries that banks can engage in, and the \ninvestments they can make within the bank itself, to no more than 20 \npercent of the capital of the bank.\n  So these are very strict limitations. We have an outright prohibition \non many activities. In terms of where we started and in terms of the \nlegitimate concerns that were raised on both sides, I think this is a \nvery strong and a very good compromise.\n  The second major feature of the bill is that we promote and \nstrengthen functional regulation. Under the bill, the general rule is \nthat if you are a bank and you are in the securities business, you are \nregulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If you are a bank \nand you are in the insurance business, you are regulated by the state \ninsurance commissioner in the area where you are engaged in the \ninsurance business. If you are a bank and you are engaged in banking, \nyou are regulated by the bank regulator. By opting for functional \nregulation, we preserve consumer protection, we lower costs.\n  One of the issues on which an extraordinary amount of time was spent \nand which for 99.99 percent of the American people would be meaningless \nis the whole issue about swaps and derivatives. We currently have \nliterally trillions of dollars of swaps and derivatives in the global \neconomy that have become the underpinnings of the financial structure \nof the country. They are used by sophisticated parties. We went to \ngreat lengths in this bill not to upset the current regulatory \nenvironment for these products, to see that we did not create any new \nlaw giving anybody any new, or removing any existing, jurisdiction over \nswaps or derivatives. I thank Chairman Levitt and Chairman Greenspan \nfor their help on this issue.\n  Probably the most contentious issue in the bill, as it turned out, \nwas not the decision to repeal Glass-Steagall but what to do with the \nso-called Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The CRA was a bill \ncreated in 1977, that started out as a very small program, but over the \nyears it has grown to be a very large program with increased \nenforcement and with greater impact due to the tremendous mergers \ntaking place among financial institutions in America. CRA has literally \nbecome bigger than General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler combined. It has \nevolved in such a way that it not only involves loans but cash \npayments.\n  Concerns were raised--and I as chairman of the committee raised many \nof those concerns--that we needed to begin to see a reform process. We \nhave two changes in the bill that are related to reforming CRA. By far \nthe most important is the sunshine provision. The sunshine provision is \nvery important because it recognizes that banks are making CRA payments \nas part of compliance practices, that while these payments are made \nwith private funds, they are made under public direction. As a result, \nthis money takes on a very clear government tint because it is paid \nsubstantially in part as a way of complying with a Federal mandate that \nhas become a cost of business for people who are engaged in commercial \nbanking in America. Because of the fact that these funds are paid as a \nresult of a Federal mandate and a Federal law and a Federal regulatory \nprocess, these funds do take on the characteristic of public funds.\n  A decision was made in this bill to make two fundamental changes that \nI believe will change CRA's operation in America. The first was a \ndecision to require a public disclosure and reporting of CRA \nagreements. I believe this is fundamentally important. If I am a \ncommunity activist and I am paid $175,000 in cash by a bank to promote \nobjectives within the community, if people who live in the community \ndon't know that I received the $175,000, purportedly to serve the needs \nof the community, how can they hold me accountable as to how I used the \nmoney?\n  Second, we require on an annual basis both the bank and the recipient \nof money and things of value under the Community Reinvestment Act to \ndisclose in a report what was done with the money. The language of the \nbill is very precise and quite demanding on this subject. While we have \nmade a strong effort to give the regulators the ability within this \nlanguage to reduce regulatory burden and paperwork, the language of the \nlaw is very clear, and regulators are given no power to decide to \nnegate or refuse to implement this law as it is written. The language \nis very clear. The language says in setting out the reporting \nrequirement: ``The accounting referred to in [the report] shall include \na detailed, itemized list of the uses to which such funds have been \nmade, including compensation, administrative expenses, travel, \nentertainment, consulting and professional fees paid, and such other \ncategories, as determined by regulation by the appropriate Federal \nbanking agency with supervisory responsibility over insured depository \ninstitution.''\n\n[[Page S13785]]\n\n  It is our intent that the regulators clearly have the authority \nwithin reason to try to minimize regulatory burden. If some of this \ninformation is included in someone's tax return and they want to submit \ntheir tax return in lieu of the report, clearly the regulator has the \npower to allow that to be done and to make the tax return public. If \nthe tax return did not include this information, it could not be \naccepted in lieu of this information.\n\n  The flexibility is flexibility in a reasonable enforcement of the \nlaw; it is not flexibility on the part of the regulator to decide to \nnegate the law. As chairman, I say when we wrote ``detailed'' and \n``itemized,'' we meant it.\n  As I have discussed with other Members, if one is talking about \ntaking somebody to lunch at McDonald's--we are talking about de minimus \namounts--obviously the regulator has the ability to set rules of \nreason. If one is talking about expenditures of substantial amounts of \nmoney either in individual expenditures or the aggregate of those \nexpenditures, or talking about reporting items specifically listed in \nthe law when we wrote it, we meant it. This is critically important. If \none is a CRA activist in a city, and they go to Atlanta to a CRA \nconference, that is a legitimate expenditure to be reported. People \nexpect to see that on their report. If they went to Hawaii for 3 weeks, \nthat should be reported, and people at the local newspaper would have a \nright, and I think a responsibility, to ask what they were doing with \nthat expenditure.\n  What we are trying to do is reasonable. I urge the regulators to \ncomply with the law and enforce it as it has been written.\n  The second reform of CRA we undertake is regulatory relief. Our \nranking member and I got a good laugh out of my arithmetic. Senator \nByrd objected to people bringing calculators or computers on the floor, \nso without the aid of my trusty calculator, I estimated the cost of \ncompliance with CRA was $1 trillion when I meant to say $1 billion. The \npoint is, for small banks, many of whom have fewer than 10 employees, \n$1 billion is a lot of money. What we have done in regulatory relief is \nthis. We said that every bank in America with less than $250 million in \nassets will be audited for CRA compliance once every 4 years as the \nnormal audit process if they had a satisfactory rating on their last \nCRA evaluation. If they had the highest CRA rating, an outstanding, \nthen they would be audited every 5 years. People who work hard to get \nan outstanding rating would thereby be rewarded.\n  We put into the language the flexibility, for reasonable cause, that \nthe regulators could go back on a case-by-case basis and reduce or \nincrease the intervals at which such audits would occur. By reasonable \ncause, we mean based on the actions of the bank, the record of the \nbank. We are not here giving or intending to give, nor can it be \nreasonably construed to give to the regulators, any kind of blank check \nto alter the intention of this law. If they have a finding on a factual \nbasis that something has changed, they have the right, as anyone would \nexpect, to go in and to audit more or less frequently. However, they \nhave to have a finding based on facts.\n  When this bill came to the floor of the Senate about a year ago, it \nhad two provisions expanding CRA. One was a provision that said that \nbeing out of compliance with CRA was a violation of banking law and \ncould have, in extreme circumstances, subjected a bank officer or \ndirector to fines of up to $1 million, and could have given the \nregulator the ability to impose strong sanctions against the bank as \nwell. That provision is not present in this bill.\n\n  The second provision of the old bill required a maintenance of a CRA \nrating in order for a bank to conduct certain activities. That \nprovision is not in this bill. That is critically important, because \nthat would literally have given the regulator the ability to force a \nfinancial services holding company, that might have hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in assets in the holding company, to unwind \ninvestments as a result of literally one branch being out of compliance \nwith CRA.\n  This bill is very simple and, again, the language is very precise, \nand meant to be. It says that on the day you become a financial \nservices holding company, you have to have been in compliance with your \nlast CRA report. In other words, with the last audit that was done, you \nhave to have had one of those two ratings, satisfactory or outstanding. \nThis would be in the last CRA report that was filed, and if you had \nthat rating, you are automatically qualified.\n  Once a company becomes a financial services holding company, they can \ninvest any amount of their money and grow any activity already in \nengaged in within the financial services holding company, without \nregard to CRA. If they want to commence a new activity, on the date \nthey make that undertaking they have to have been in compliance with \nCRA as certified on their last CRA report. This does not trigger a new \naudit. This does not entertain any new protest. It simply is a \nverification by the regulator that on that day of commencing their new \nactivity, their most recent evaluation will have shown that they had at \nleast a satisfactory CRA rating.\n  The next issue we dealt with was financial privacy. When we dealt \nwith the bill in the Senate, this had not yet become an issue that had \ninflamed the public's consciousness. We adopted the provisions of the \nminority substitute related to privacy, and it basically had to do with \npeople who willfully misrepresent themselves to get financial data. We \ncome down on them like a ton of bricks, as we should. But by the time \nthe House acted, financial privacy had become a substantial issue, and \nthe House included very extensive privacy provisions.\n  We have made changes to those privacy provisions, and I believe we \nhave strengthened them, and we have made the bill better. I want to \nvery briefly say a couple of things about privacy.\n  Obviously, in the new world in which we live, we have become \naccustomed to people knowing a great deal about us. The day I turned \n50, I got a kit from AARP with all kinds of applications for AARP and a \ntube of Preparation H. One might say my privacy was invaded, that \nsomehow AARP found out I was 50 years old. My children got a great \nlaugh out of the Preparation H. One could say that somehow my privacy \nhad been breached, but do we really want a society where an \norganization such as AARP cannot get access to information about when \nwe turn 50 and invite us to join? I chose not to join because 50 \nsounded younger every minute to me; 57 sounds younger than it used to.\n  I have hunting dogs, and like many people who have enlightened \nhabits, I subscribe to Gun Dog magazine. I guess because I subscribe to \nGun Dog magazine, I get every hunting catalog, every fishing catalog, \nevery dog food catalog, every dog accessory catalog on the planet. I \nliterally get two or three of them a week. Quite frankly, I love \ngetting them.\n  Did Gun Dog magazine violate my most intimate secrets by selling the \nlist so that I get, every once in a while, free samples of dog food or \ndog bones or a dried pig's ear? I get a lot of things in the mail. I do \nnot think my privacy is being violated. Maybe some people object to \nthat, but I do not.\n  What I have tried to do, and what I think we have done in this bill, \nis we tried to set a rule of reason. Above the archway going into \nDelphi, the ancient Greeks wrote: Moderation in all things. It is a \nhard thing for somebody who feels as strongly about things as I do to \nremember, but everyone should remember it.\n\n  We did not want to kill off the information age before it was ever \nborn. We are not writing the final word on privacy. This is something \nwe want to watch and follow and see where abuses are and, when they \noccur, try to fix them. But, on the other hand, we all benefit. Some \npeople could say we lose.\n  I do not get a Neiman Marcus catalog. One might ask: How come I do \nnot? Neiman Marcus catalogs cost a lot of money to print and mail, and \nthey have somehow figured out enough about me to figure that I do not \nbuy luxury items, so they do not send me a Neiman Marcus catalog. \nAgain, is that an invasion of my privacy? Is my freedom somehow \ndiminished? I do not think so. The point is, if Neiman Marcus can get \nthe catalog to people who are likely to buy something, they can sell it \nat a lower price, so society benefits.\n  This is what we did on privacy: The most important thing we did was \nnot\n\n[[Page S13786]]\n\nin the House bill. It was an amendment that was offered by Senator \nGrams and Senator Santorum that put into the bill for the first time a \nfull disclosure requirement. It requires every bank in America, when \nyou open your account, to tell you precisely what their policy is: Do \nthey share personal financial information within the bank? Do they \nshare it outside the bank? We have a comprehensive listing of the \nconditions they have to meet. Do they disclose nonpublic information \nonce you are no longer a customer? And what do they do to protect \ninformation?\n  Why is this important? This is important because this is the ultimate \nprotection of privacy. If I do not believe a bank protects my privacy, \nI do not want to bank with them. I can bank with somebody else. If \nmillions of people feel the way I do, you will get banks that will set \nout policies of not sharing information, and they will attract \ncustomers.\n  For example, I am proud to have an American Express card. American \nExpress is a great American company. And I am proud I have been a \nmember since 1970 something. They say that they do not share my \ninformation on that card with anybody.\n  I do not get that same guarantee from another card, but I get that \nguarantee from American Express. I happen to have a variety of credit \ncards. Obviously, I am not very worried about it, but if I were worried \nabout it, I could just use my American Express Card. So I have an opt-\nin when people give me full information. If I do not like their policy, \nI do not become their customer. I can opt out. That is the basic \nfreedom.\n\n  I just add, freedom is based on knowledge and the right to choose, \nnot based on government. I believe that we are guaranteeing that with \nfull disclosure.\n  Second, we adopted the House provision that said if the bank was \ngoing to use, or the financial services holding company was going to \nlet people outside the bank have access to, the information, they have \nto give you the right to opt out. That provision was adopted.\n  Finally, we have a provision in the language which will allow \nfinancial institutions to partner with other financial services \nproviders. This will give flexibility that we hope will be implemented \nto allow, in particular, small banks to share information with their \nbusiness partners in a manner so that they can compete with a larger \ncorporation that does a variety of activities within the corporation or \namong its affiliates.\n  Let me talk about one other issue, and then I want to say some thanks \nand stop, because I know Senator Sarbanes wants to speak, and we want \nto go home.\n  This is not the end of the process. I believe this is the most \nimportant banking bill in 60 years. But there will be another banking \nbill within 10 years, and it will deal with commerce. Banking and \ncommerce is already a reality. This bill is a pause, and it is only a \npause, and it is not going to last very long.\n  One of the things that is in this bill, which I am opposed to--it was \nadopted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and here we live by \nmajority rule, by and large--but basically this was a provision that \nsaid if you went in and invested money as a commercial company, in a \nthrift--and many people did when many thrifts were in trouble and we \ndid not have money enough to shut them down--that now you cannot sell \nyour charter unless the charter is broken apart into its component \nparts.\n  I do not believe this provision and other prohibitions against \ncommerce and banking will last very long. It is just my opinion. I do \nnot view with any great horror the possibility of going to Wal-Mart and \nhaving them sell financial services. In fact, I view it as something \nthat would be good. They now do it all over America in partnership with \ncity banks in those towns, but they can only get partners where they \nhave enough customers to make it worthwhile to the bank.\n  The idea they might someday be able to provide the service as part of \nthe overall functioning of Wal-Mart, through a thrift charter or \nthrough a credit union charter or a banking charter, I see that as a \npositive thing. I suspect that a very substantial number of Wal-Mart \nemployees do not have a banking relationship with a credit union or an \nS or a bank. Many of their customers do not. And taking services to \nthem, I would view as a public good, not a public evil. But other \npeople see it differently.\n  What we are doing in this bill is agreeing that we have a pause. I do \nnot believe it will last long. I think in 10 years we will have \nwidespread commerce and banking in America.\n  I want to just say some thanks.\n  I thank Al D'Amato. I do not want people to forget that this bill did \nnot start on my watch as chairman. This bill started when Al D'Amato \nwas chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. And while that bill did \nnot become law, and while in some ways this bill is very different from \nthat bill, in other ways the two bills are very similar.\n  Al D'Amato did probably his best legislative work in his career in \nhelping to move this process forward. When we started, we started where \nAl D'Amato left off. So I think the former chairman of this committee \nis due a substantial amount of the credit. I wanted to be sure that I \nbegan with that, and I did not want to forget to say that.\n  I thank Senator Lott for his strong, committed support. I think it is \nclear, without his support, with the long and difficult negotiations we \nhave had, that this bill would be very different from what it is today. \nI can assure you, as every Member of the Senate knows, when you have \nyour leadership's support, it is like having a good stone wall to your \nback in a gun fight. It does not keep you from getting killed, but at \nleast nobody shoots you in the back. It has been a very important thing \nto me as we have negotiated out this bill, very important in a \ndifficult process.\n  I thank Senator Sarbanes, who is very knowledgeable and experienced \non these issues. I thank him for his input, and that has been input \nthat has varied, from issues to issues themselves, to advice on how, as \na brand new chairman, I was conducting my part of the conference. I \nwould have to say that more often than not I think he was right in the \ncomments he made. I believe I have learned from that process.\n  I thank Senator Johnson, the first Democrat who signed the conference \nreport.\n  I thank Senators Dodd and Edwards and Schumer and Bayh. They were \nreal catalysts in getting the administration together with us to push \nthe ball over the goal line. I think they contributed significantly in \ndoing that.\n  I thank Chairman Leach, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, \nwho also served as the chairman of the conference. There have been \npeople in the media who tried to portray this conference as a contest \nsomehow between Congressman Leach and me. I do not think that is fair \nto me or to Congressman Leach. I think Chairman Leach did a great job. \nI think he contributed to the process. I would have to say there were \ndifficult times in trying to work things out. Our approaches were very \ndifferent. But in the end, it worked. And the great thing about success \nis, it has a thousand parents, and we can all claim credit; and we \nwould have all rightly gotten blamed had we failed.\n  I thank Chairman Bliley. I knew Tom much better than I knew \nCongressman Leach when we started the process. I thank him for his \nleadership on securities issues and on the bill itself.\n  I thank Congressmen LaFalce and Vento, the ranking Democrat members \nof the House Banking Committee, for their input and their knowledge and \ntheir leadership.\n  I thank Congressman Richard Baker, who I believe is a very talented \nyoung man, and certainly one of the most knowledgeable people in the \nHouse of Representatives on banking issues.\n  I thank Larry Summers and Gene Sperling. I had many hours of \nnegotiating with them and others, and alone with them. If you could \nmake a living selling them something or buying something from them to \nresell, you would be pretty good. They negotiated hard. They were \ntotally honorable in their negotiations. I am glad that we reached a \nproduct that they have enthusiastically endorsed and I have endorsed.\n  I thank Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. Chairman Levitt raised legitimate security concerns that I \nthought should be addressed. I and others sat\n\n[[Page S13787]]\n\ndown with Chairman Levitt and heard him out, and he had a substantial \nimpact on the bill.\n  I thank Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. I have said it \non many occasions--and I am always happy to say it again--Alan \nGreenspan is the greatest central banker in American history; therefore \nby definition, the greatest central banker in the history of the world. \nHe probably had as much impact on this bill as any non-Member did. His \ninput and impact were always positive. And from the operating \nsubsidiary issue, to virtually hundreds of other issues, his input was \ncritically important.\n  And his general counsel, Virgil Mattingly, is one of these \nindispensable people who the public never knows about--thinks of them \nas faceless bureaucrats--but the reality is, his institutional \nknowledge and good sense had a substantial impact on this bill.\n  I thank all of my Republican colleagues on the conference. We had, at \nleast in my opinion, an effort on the part of some on the House side to \ntry to satisfy everybody. As a result, we got all sorts of amendments \nthat came over to our side of the conference which basically were in \nconflict with the underlying logic of the bill, many of them popular, \nas various interest groups tried to go back and recut their deal once \nmore or gain some special privilege or special advantage. I thank \nSenator Shelby, Senator Mack, Senator Bennett, Senator Grams, Senator \nAllard, Senator Hagel, Senator Enzi, Senator Santorum, Senator Bunning, \nand Senator Crapo for consistently and courageously voting down every \none of those amendments.\n\n  We have one of the cleanest pieces of major legislation I have seen \nand, I believe, one of the cleanest bills that has passed Congress in \nthe last 20 years, in large part because these Members knew what they \nwanted to do. They took a position, and they stuck with it consistently \nthroughout the process.\n  I thank Senator Bennett, who was chairman of the Subcommittee on \nFinancial Institutions, the subcommittee with jurisdiction over major \nportions of this bill. I thank Senator Hagel for his leadership on \nFederal Home Loan Bank issues. I thank Senators Grams and Santorum on \nprivacy issues.\n  Finally, I want to thank some people on my staff. I thank Dina Ellis, \nwho has done all the hard work on CRA. She is a very sweet lady with a \nvery soft voice, but she is a very serious, tough person. Much of our \nsuccess in bringing sunshine to CRA and regulatory relief to smaller \nbanks has been due to her great work.\n  I thank Christi Harlan, who has taken the dullest of issues that are \ntotally incomprehensible to most people and done an excellent job in \ntrying to communicate to the media in a form they could understand what \nwas going on and why it mattered.\n  I thank Steve McMillin, who is an indispensable staff member to me. \nHe came to work for me right out of college from the University of \nTexas. I am from Texas A, so I didn't start with any kind of \noverwhelming expectations. But Steve McMillin has become an \nindispensable person to me as a legislator. It would be virtually \nimpossible to run my office and do what I do without him.\n  I thank Geoff Gray for his legal work in burrowing in on the issues \nthat didn't seem important until he spoke up. But when he spoke up, \nthey became very important.\n  I thank Linda Lord. Linda Lord, throughout this process, has known \nmore about this bill and more about the underlying law that it changed \nthan all the staff members of all the Members of the House and Senate, \nof all the staff members of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank \nand the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all of the outside \nlawyers who were hired by people to represent their interests, all \ncombined. Her knowledge and the force with which she has presented it \nhave had a dramatic impact on this bill. In fact, the words of this \nbill are largely her words. She has been an indispensable person in \ndoing this bill.\n  I thank Joe Kolinski, who organized the conferences. It was a \nnightmare, moving from place to place. He was able to do it all. The \nmikes always worked. There was plenty of water. It was always crowded, \nwhich made people uncomfortable and got them to move on, which was very \nhelpful.\n  Finally, I thank our staff director, Wayne Abernathy. Wayne started \non the Banking Committee as an intern and is now the staff director. He \nknows everything about these issues. I trust his judgment as well as I \ntrust my own judgment. I think I can sum up his contribution--the way I \nfeel about him--by simply quoting a great philosopher who once said: In \nno way can you get a keener insight into the true nature of a leader \nthan by looking at the people with whom he surrounds himself. I would \nbe very proud to have anybody on Earth judge me by Wayne Abernathy. I \nthink they would be giving me mercy and not justice by doing it.\n  I thank everybody for their contribution, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999.\n  The Congress has struggled for over two decades with the issue of \nwhether to permit banks to affiliate with securities firms and \ninsurance companies. This issue raises important questions for the \nsafety and soundness of the financial system, important questions about \nthe concentration of economic power, important questions about consumer \nprotection, and important questions about access to credit for all \nAmericans.\n  These are far-reaching and difficult public policy issues. The fact \nthat they are so far-reaching and difficult, combined with differences \namong affected financial sectors--sectors of the financial industry \nover what should be contained in legislation and how to balance the \nconcerns of consumers, the important consideration of safety and \nsoundness and of assuring that the credit system will work to the \nbenefit of all Americans--has made the enactment of a bill a \nsignificant challenge over an extended period of time.\n  In recent years, actions by regulators have permitted significant \naffiliations between banks and nonbank financial companies to take \nplace. It is very important to keep that in mind as we consider \nenacting a piece of legislation because one has to be very much aware \nof what has transpired and the changes that have taken place in the \nfinancial arena as they consider the changes this legislation would now \npermit. Very frankly, the issue for Congress is not whether these \naffiliations should occur, because they have occurred one way or \nanother, but whether they should take place on an orderly basis in the \ncontext of a responsible statutory framework or, instead, on an ad hoc \nbasis as permitted by the regulators.\n  In my view, the preferable circumstance is for these affiliations to \ntake place in the context of a responsible statutory framework \nestablished by the Congress, a framework that provides the regulators \nsufficient authority to protect the safety and soundness of the \nfinancial system, which maintains the separation of banking and \ncommerce, protects consumers, preserves the relevance of the Community \nReinvestment Act, and provides a choice to banks to conduct their \nexpanded activities either through a holding company or a subsidiary of \nthe bank.\n  It was not clear at the beginning of this Congress whether these \ngoals could be achieved. The Senate passed a bill by the relatively \nclose margin of 54-44 that, in my judgment, did not meet these \nobjectives and was the object of a strong veto threat by the President. \nThe House of Representatives, on the other hand, had passed a bill that \nlargely met these objectives and that the Administration was prepared \nto support.\n  Today I am pleased to say to my colleagues that, in my view and in \nthe view of the Administration, the bill produced by the conference \ncommittee is perceived as basically meeting the necessary standards. It \nis for that reason I am prepared to support the conference report. It \nis my understanding that the President is prepared to sign this \nlegislation into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary Summers to \nSenator Daschle stating the Administration's position, indicating their \nstrong support for this legislation and urging its adoption, be printed \nin the Record at the end of my statement.\n\n[[Page S13788]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to lay out \nwhy, on balance, I believe the enactment of this conference report is \nin the public interest.\n  First, the legislation gives the regulators significant authority to \nsupervise newly affiliated financial companies and protect the safety \nand soundness of the financial system. I started with the safety and \nsoundness issue because I think it is paramount. I think the U.S. \neconomy, in large part, depends on the confidence in the safety and \nsoundness of our economic and financial institutions. If we are to lose \nthat confidence, which exists not only in this country, but around the \nworld, I think we would be in severe difficulties in a very broad and \nfundamental economic sense. So safety and soundness, I think, always \nhas to be at the very top of the list of our concerns.\n  Specifically, section 114 of the conference report provides the \nFederal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC \nauthority to place restrictions or requirements on relationships or \ntransactions between a bank and an affiliated company or a subsidiary, \nappropriate to prevent an evasion of any provision of law applicable to \ndepository institutions, or--and I quote the bill now, soon to become a \nstatute, I hope--``to avoid any significant risk to the safety and \nsoundness of depository institutions, or any Federal deposit insurance \nfund, or other adverse effects, such as undue concentration of \nresources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or \nunsound banking practices.''\n  This important and broad delegation of authority to require \n``firewalls'' to protect the federally insured bank from nonbank \naffiliates or subsidiaries emphasizes the important burden being placed \non the regulators by this legislation to develop a coherent, \nresponsible, safe and prudent approach to the supervision of the \nfinancial system. The permission contained herein for the expansion of \nactivities calls for vigilant supervision of the financial system by \nthe regulators. The legislation, in my view, provides the regulators \nthe authority to do the job, but the responsibility will be on them to \ncarry it out.\n  So this ``firewall'' provision that is in the conference report, \nwhich was actually taken from the House bill--we had no comparable \nprovision on this side--gives the regulators the authority, I believe, \nto ensure a responsible, safe, and prudent approach. But it places, I \nthink, a significant responsibility upon the regulators to exercise \nthis authority in a way that it ensures that these objectives are \nrealized.\n  This legislation also codifies a principle of functional regulation \nunder which bank activities are generally supervised by bank \nregulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and \ninsurance activities by insurance regulators. New financial activities \nare the joint responsibility of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, \nwhich also serve as the umbrella regulators respectively of a financial \nholding company or a bank and its operating subsidiaries.\n  Now, secondly, the conference report strengthens the separation that \ncurrently exists in our financial system between banking and commerce. \nFinancial authorities, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary \nBob Rubin, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, and many \nother commentators, such as Henry Kaufman, Gerald Corrigan--and the \nlist goes on--have expressed strong concerns about the mixing of \nbanking and commerce, particularly in light of the recent experiences \nin Asia.\n  The conference report, therefore, closes the so-called unitary thrift \nholding company loophole to the separation of banking and commerce. The \nreport before us prohibits all unitary thrift holding companies from \nhaving commercial affiliates. In addition, it prohibits exists unitary \nthrift holding companies from being transferred to commercial \ncompanies. This prohibition on transfer to commercial companies was \nadded to the Senate bill on the floor by an amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Johnson of South Dakota, and it carried in the \nSenate by a 2-to-1 vote and was subsequently adopted by the conference \ncommittee.\n  In addition, the conference report contains important limitations \nsimilar to the House bill on merchant banking activities and activities \ncomplementary to financial activities that are designed to maintain the \nseparation of banking and commerce.\n  In regard to merchant banking, the conference report allows a \nfinancial holding company to retain a merchant banking investment only \nfor a limited period of time and generally prohibits the company from \nroutinely managing or operating a nonfinancial company held as a \nmerchant banking investment. Importantly, the conference report also \ngives the Federal Reserve and the Treasury the authority to jointly \ndevelop implementing regulations on merchant banking activities that \nthey deem appropriate to further the purposes and prevent evasions of \nthe conference report and the Bank Holding Company Act. Under this \nauthority, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury may define relevant \nterms and impose such limitations as they deem appropriate to ensure \nthat this new authority does not foster conflicts of interest or \nundermine the safety and soundness of depository institutions, or the \nconference report's general prohibition on the mixing of banking and \ncommerce.\n  In regard to activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be \ncomplementary to financial activities, it is expected that such \nactivities will not be significant in size, and determinations will be \nmade on a case by case basis.\n  Third, with respect to consumer protections, the conference report \ncontains important protections for consumers regarding the sale of \nuninsured financial products by banks. The conference report provides \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission significant authority to \nsupervise the securities activities of banks and includes several \ncrucial investor protections. The conference report incorporates \nprovisions to ensure the SEC can adequately regulate bank-sponsored \nmutual funds. These provisions are necessary to ensure that the SEC has \nadequate information about and inspection authority over bank \ninvestment advisers to inspect for trading violations, such as front-\nrunning and personal trading.\n  The provisions also address potential significant conflicts of \ninterest that may impact banks that advise registered investment \ncompanies. The conference report also ensures SEC protections for new \nhybrid products and for most sales of securities by banks. It also \nincludes protections for sales of sophisticated securities instruments \nto retail investors.\n  Similarly, the conference report requires the Federal banking \nagencies to issue consumer protection regulations within one year, \napplicable to the sale of insurance by any bank or other depository \ninstitution, or by any person on behalf of such an institution. The \nregulations will give protection over several aspects of insurance \nsales, such as sales practices, including anti-tying and anti-coercion \nrules; advertising; location, limiting sales to an area physically \nsegregated from where deposits are taken; and qualification and \nlicensing of sales personnel.\n  The conference report also preserves important authorities for the \nStates to provide consumer protection on bank sales of insurance \nproducts. These protections were in the House bill and were included in \nthe Senate bill by an amendment offered by Senator Bryan during the \nmarkup in the Banking Committee. It was in the legislation that came to \nthe Senate floor, and was passed by the Senate.\n  Fourth, with respect to the operating subsidiary issue, the \nconference report contains a provision authorizing banks to conduct \ncertain new activities through an operating subsidiary of the bank. I \nwill not go into this provision in detail. I simply note that it was \nworked out between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve over an \nextended period of time, and was crucial to the Administration giving \nits support to this bill. It will give financial services firms some \nlatitude in choosing the corporate structure that best serves their \ncustomers.\n  In regard to the Community Reinvestment Act, this legislation \nestablishes a fundamental principle: No bank or financial holding \ncompany can\n\n[[Page S13789]]\n\nengage in any new activities authorized by the bill, or engage in any \nnew merger or acquisition authorized by the bill, if the bank or \nfinancial holding company does not have a satisfactory CRA rating.\n  This requirement on a bank or financial holding company for a \nsatisfactory CRA rating in order to benefit from the new powers \nprovided by the legislation was necessary to preserve the relevance of \nCRA in the new financial world which will be created by this bill. \nWithout it, a bank's CRA performance would have become irrelevant to \nwhat will likely be the most intense area of activity in the financial \nindustry. And the acceptance of this provision was essential for the \nAdministration, and indeed for the Democratic members of the conference \ncommittee, to support the conference report.\n  The conference report does not contain two provisions with respect to \nCRA that were in the Senate bill, and I think would have been very \ndamaging. One would have provided a safe harbor for banks from public \ncomment on their CRA performance when they submitted an application to \na regulator. The second exempted rural banks with assets under $100 \nmillion from CRA altogether.\n  The conference report does contain a provision providing for banks \nwith assets under $250 million to have CRA examinations once every 4 \nyears if they have a satisfactory rating, and once every 5 years if \nthey have an outstanding rating. The regulators do retain authority to \nexamine a bank at any time for reasonable cause.\n  The conference report also contains a provision requiring public \ndisclosure and reporting on CRA agreements. The conference report \nexplicitly directs the regulators to ensure that regulations prescribed \nby the agencies do not impose an undue burden on parties. In this \nregard, the statement of managers specifically provides that the \nreporting requirements of the provision can be fulfilled by the \nsubmission of a group's annual audited financial statement, or its \nFederal income tax return.\n  This was a provision that was intensely discussed and negotiated. The \nconcept of public disclosure which was in the Senate bill was accepted \nby the conferees. The question that had to be worked out was exactly \nwhat did that mean and what was the reach of it and the requirements of \nit. As with many other provisions of this bill, the regulators will \ncarry a particular responsibility to implement these provisions in a \nreasonable and responsible way.\n  Finally, let me point out where the conference report does not fully \naddress two important areas. First, I do not think that the right of an \nindividual to financial privacy is adequately protected. I expect that \nissue will be discussed at some length by some of my colleagues in the \ncourse of the debate on this conference report. Second, we have not \ndealt with what I think is a very important issue of what is called \n``too big to fail.''\n\n  On the issue of privacy, last January I introduced the ``Financial \nInformation Privacy Act of 1999'' together with a number of my \ncolleagues, some of whom serve on the Banking Committee. I am frank to \nsay I believe the central issue in this debate on privacy boils down to \nanswering the question: To whom does this personal financial \ninformation belong, the individual, or the financial institution? I \nthink upon reflection most people would answer the individual.\n  This legislation introduced earlier this year would have given an \nindividual the right to ``opt out'', which would mean the right to say \n``no'' to the sharing of or selling of his or her personal information \nto an affiliate within a financial services holding company. It also \nwould have required an ``opt-in'' for the selling of such information \nto a third party. An ``opt-in'' would require a customer's informed \nconsent before selling or sharing confidential customer information \nwith an unaffiliated third party.\n  Neither of these provisions are included in the legislation before \nus. However, we were able to include in the conference report an \namendment that I proposed which ensures that the Federal Government \nwill not preempt stronger State financial privacy laws that exist now \nor may be enacted in the future. As a result, States will be free to \nenact stronger privacy safeguards if they deem it appropriate.\n  I am very frank to say that I think Americans are becoming \nincreasingly concerned about this issue of financial privacy \nprotection. I predict that this issue of privacy will not go away with \nthe passage of this legislation. I know Senators Bryan and Shelby took \na very strong lead in the conference committee on the privacy issue, \nalong with a number of their colleagues from the House. Many of those \nwho were very supportive of that effort will want to speak at some \nlength on this subject during the discussion of this conference report, \nand they have specifically reserved time in order to do that.\n  The conference report also fails to deal with the creation of \ninstitutions which may be deemed ``too big to fail.'' The legislation \nbefore us substantially transforms the structure of the financial \nservices industry by eliminating restrictions on the affiliations of \nbanks, insurance companies, and securities firms. Despite the benefits \nwhich may accrue from such affiliations, there continue to be \nlegitimate concerns that mergers permitted under this bill would create \nfinancial organizations so large that they would be deemed ``too big to \nfail.''\n  Organizations as diverse as the American Enterprise Institute, the \nBrookings Institution, and the former Bankers Roundtable have \nrepeatedly encouraged us to address the ``too big to fail'' problem by \nrequiring large banking organizations to back some portion of their \nassets with subordinated debt. Regrettably, the conference report \ncontains no such mandatory subordinated debt requirement or other \nmarket policing mechanisms. The report does contain an 18-month study \nto be conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury \nDepartment regarding the use of subordinated debt to protect the \nfinancial system, and to protect federally ensured deposit funds from \nthe ``too big to fail'' institutions.\n  While obviously I think it would have been better to address this \nissue directly in the legislation, I certainly hope that 18 months from \nnow, if not sooner, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury will \npresent the Congress with a joint recommendation together with \nlegislative proposals on how best to deal with the issue of ``too big \nto fail.'' In trying circumstances, the consequences of failing to deal \nwith this issue could be extremely severe. I am hopeful that the \nFederal Reserve Board and the Treasury will come back with a joint set \nof recommendations we can place into law.\n\n  These issues--dealing comprehensively with privacy and with ``too big \nto fail''--remain to be addressed as we move into the future.\n  Finally, I want to make a brief observation about the context in \nwhich we are working and have to consider this legislation. The need \nfor this legislation has been influenced by the marketplace. In seeking \nto respond to the financial needs of their customers, securities firms \nhave offered bank-like products, banks have offered insurance-like \nproducts, and both banks and insurance companies have engaged in \nsignificant securities activities. This blurring of the lines among \nbanks, securities, and insurance products has been taking place in the \nmarketplace since at least the mid-1970s.\n  Those who look at this endeavor and say we don't want to allow any of \nthis affiliation to take place need to appreciate and understand, it \nhas been happening in a significant way. A development which began the \nblurring of the distinction between securities and bank products was \nthe offering by securities firms of cash management accounts. That \ndevelopment added a bank deposit transaction feature to a securities \naccount. It allows customers to write checks on their money market \nfunds, enabling those accounts to function much like the traditional \nchecking account. Subsequently, marketplace changes, regulatory \nactions, and court decisions have enabled banks to sell insurance and \nto develop annuity products that have insurance characteristics but are \ndefined as bank products.\n  On the commercial banking side, interpretations of existing laws have \nbrought about a significant shift in ownership of firms underwriting \nsecurities. As of this past September, all the top 20 bank holding \ncompanies had what are known as section 20 subsidiaries that may engage \nunder certain conditions in securities underwriting.\n\n[[Page S13790]]\n\n  Updating our financial services laws is not only important to enable \nfinancial services firms to respond to the financial service needs of \ntheir customers, it is also important in order to ensure that \nappropriate regulatory oversight is maintained in the evolving \nmarketplace.\n  In my view, this conference report will put in place a rational \nlegislative framework for the future evolution of the U.S. financial \nservices industry. It is a framework that will preserve safety and \nsoundness, maintain the separation of banking and commerce, provide \nmeaningful consumer protections, and preserve the relevance of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I extend my congratulations to the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Gramm. It has been a long ride, as one might say, with its ups \nand downs. However, the ship has been brought into port, so to speak. \nWith the various accommodations worked out in the course of the \nconference, I expect the very close vote on the Senate bill will shift \nvery markedly in the direction of support for this conference report.\n  I echo Senator Gramm's commendation of House Banking Committee \nChairman Leach who was chairman of the conference committee. Chairman \nLeach showed great fairness and calm under pressing circumstances. He \nkept the process working at times when it might otherwise have been in \nsome jeopardy. Congressman LaFalce as ranking member of the House \nBanking Committee, Congressman Bliley and Congressman Dingell, the \nchairman and ranking member of the House Commerce Committee, and indeed \nall the members of the conference who in one way or another played very \nconstructive roles in trying to work this situation out deserve \ncommendation.\n  I am particularly grateful to my Democratic colleagues on \nthe Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for working through \nand joining together as we sought to achieve legislation that would \nmeet our desires and meet the perceptions of the Administration and \ntherefore bring about a Presidential signature at the end of this \nprocess. All Members on both sides of the aisle did not want to go \nthrough this very extended process and then have it vetoed and have to \nstart all over again. Fortunately, we have accomplished that.\n\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan played a significant role, \nas did the members of his staff who are extremely able, as did Treasury \nSecretary Summers and the members of his Treasury staff. I also \nacknowledge the role Bob Rubin has played in shaping where we are \ntoday, although he is no longer Secretary of the Treasury. Chairman \nGramm appropriately recognized the role Chairman D'Amato played in \nmoving this legislation along. The Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, \nwas important on the investor protection provisions.\n  Finally, I thank the staff on this side of the aisle. Chairman Gramm \nhas recognized staff on his side of the aisle. I have high respect for \ntheir commitment and their competency. I don't think people fully \nappreciate the kind of dedication staff provides when Members are \nworking through a very complex, complicated piece of legislation such \nas this. In this we have not only the concepts on which to reach \nagreement, but we have to work the concepts in the statutory language \nin a way that embodies what the understanding was that will also work \nin a technical and complex way. We are dealing with the sort of issues \nwhere, if it does not work, there are problems. I am hopeful we won't \nhave to come back with extended technical corrections with respect to \nthis legislation. If that is the case, obviously, we bow our heads to \nthe staff.\n  On our side, I acknowledge our staff director Steve Harris, Marty \nGruenberg, Patience Singleton, Dean Shahinian, Mitchell Feuer, Michael \nBeresik, Jonathan Miller, Yael Belkind, Erin Hanson, and Christen \nSchaefer. That is a long list, but it is a long list because some of \nthe people are no longer on the staff. This issue has been going on \nlong enough that people have come and gone. A number of those I listed \nare no longer on the staff, but they were here through at least part, \nif not a lot, of this effort. They made a significant contribution. It \nwould be an oversight not to reference them.\n  Tomorrow, obviously, we will resume the debate. We will have the \nopportunity to hear from a number of our colleagues on this issue. I \nanticipate we will be able to go to a vote by midafternoon on this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: The Administration strongly supports passage of \n     S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. This legislation \n     will modernize our financial services laws to better enable \n     American companies to compete in the new economy.\n       The bill makes the most important legislative changes to \n     the structure of the U.S. financial system since the 1930s. \n     By allowing a single organization to offer any type of \n     financial product, the bill stimulate competition, thereby \n     increasing choice and reducing costs for consumers, \n     communities and businesses. Americans spent over $350 billion \n     per year on fees and commissions for brokerage insurance, and \n     banking services. If increased competition yielded savings to \n     consumers of even 5 percent, they would save over $18 billion \n     per year.\n       Removal of barriers to competition will also enhance the \n     stability of our financial services system. Financial firms \n     will be able to diversify the product offerings and thus \n     their sources of revenue. They also will be better able to \n     compete in global financial markets.\n       The President has strongly supported the elimination of \n     barriers to financial services competition. He has made \n     clear, however, that any financial modernization bill must \n     also preserve the vitality of the Community Reinvestment Act, \n     enhance consumer protection to the privacy and other areas, \n     follow financial services firms to choose the corporate \n     structure that best serves their customers, and continue the \n     traditional separation of banking commerce. As approved by \n     the Conference Committee, S. 900 accomplishes each of these \n     goals.\n       With respect to CRA, S. 900 establishes an important, \n     prospective principle: banking organizations seeking to take \n     advantage of new, non-banking authority must demonstrate a \n     satisfactory record of meeting the credit needs of all the \n     communities they serve, including low and moderate income \n     communities. Thus, S. 900 for the first time prohibits a bank \n     or holding company from expanding into newly authorized \n     businesses such as securities and insurance underwriting \n     unless all of its insured depository institutions have a \n     satisfactory or better CRA rating. Furthermore, CRA will \n     continue to apply to all banks, and existing procedures for \n     public comment on, and CRA review of, any application to \n     acquire or merge with a bank will be preserved. The bill \n     offers further support for community development in the form \n     of a new program to provide technical help to low- and \n     moderate-income micro-entrepreneurs.\n       The bill includes other measures affecting CRA that have \n     been narrowed significantly from their earlier Senate form. \n     The bill includes a limited extension of the CRA \n     examinational cycle for small banks with outstanding or \n     satisfactory CRA records, but expressly preserves the \n     ability of regulators to examine a bank any time for \n     reasonable cause, and does not affect regulators ability \n     to inquire in connection with an application. Finally, the \n     bill includes a requirement for disclosure and reporting \n     of CRA agreements. We believe that the legislation and its \n     legislative history have been constructed to prevent undue \n     burdens from being imposed on banks and those working to \n     stimulate investment in underserved communities.\n       In May, the President stressed the importance of adopting \n     strong and enforceable privacy protections for consumers \n     financial information. S. 900 provides protections for \n     consumers that extend far beyond existing law. For the first \n     time, consumers will have an absolute right to know if their \n     financial institution intends to share or sell their personal \n     financial data, and will have the right to block sharing or \n     sale outside the financial institutions' corporate family. Of \n     equal importance, these restrictions have teeth. S. 900 gives \n     regulatory agencies full authority to enforce privacy \n     protections, as well as new rulemaking authority under the \n     existing Fair Credit Reporting Act. The bill also expressly \n     preserves the ability of states to provide stronger privacy \n     protections. In addition, it establishes new safeguards to \n     prevent pretext calling, by which unscrupulous operators seek \n     to discover the financial assets of consumers. In sum, we \n     believe that this reflects a real improvement over the status \n     quo; but, we will not rest. We will continue to press for \n     even greater protections--especially effective choice about \n     whether personal financial information can be shared with \n     affiliates.\n       We are pleased that the bill promotes innovation and \n     competition in the financial sector, by allowing banks to \n     choose whether to conduct most new non-banking activities, \n     including securities underwriting and dealing, in either a \n     financial subsidiary or an affiliate of a bank.\n       The bill also promotes the safety and soundness of the \n     financial system by enhancing the traditional separation of \n     banking and\n\n[[Page S13791]]\n\n     commerce. The bill strictly limits the ability of thrift \n     institutions to affiliate with commercial companies, closing \n     a gap in existing law. The bill also includes restrictions on \n     control of commercial companies through merchant banking.\n       Although the Administration strongly supports S. 900, there \n     are provisions of the bill that concern us. The bill's \n     redomestication provisions could allow mutual insurance \n     companies to avoid state law protecting policyholders, \n     enriching insiders at the expense of consumers. The \n     Administration intends to monitor any redomestications and \n     state law changes closely, and return to the Congress if \n     necessary. The bill's Federal Home Loan Bank provisions fail \n     to focus the System more on lending to community banks and \n     less on arbitrage activities short-term lending that do not \n     advance its public purpose.\n       The Administration strongly supports S. 900, and urges its \n     adoption by the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lawrence H. Summers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sarbanes for his kind \nremarks and for remembering Bob Rubin, who was a very major contributor \nto this bill. Let me also say that I think it would be helpful if in \nthe morning everyone will come over so we do not have long pauses. My \nconcern is that we do have a lot of people who are going to want to \nspeak on this bill. We are going to be forced to try to stay with the \nschedule because the House wants to vote on this tomorrow afternoon. So \nI hope people will come over and speak so we do not end up with this \nproblem where people are given 1 or 2 minutes when they have something \nthey need to say.\n  I think that can be avoided if people come over early.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the chairman will yield, I want to echo the \nchairman's comments. I say to our colleagues, if Senators will come \nearly on and we can perhaps sequence them, we can give them more time \nthan if some of the time is used up in quorum calls. Waiting for people \nto come becomes lost time. Then, when people come over, we may be very \nlimited in how much time we have available to give them.\n  If Senators have statements they want to make of some consequence, we \nvery much hope they will come over and do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we both want to reserve the remainder of \nour time for use tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13791-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, a moment on a matter that is not \nincluded in the trade legislation that has just been approved by the \nSenate--the near-exorbitant tariff on fine wool fabrics. This modest \nproposal appears to have generated an inordinate amount of controversy, \nall the more baffling because the facts are so persuasive.\n  We have just a few suit manufacturers left in the United States, \nincluding Hickey-Freeman, which has produced fine tailored suits in \nRochester, New York since 1899. Our tariffs are stacked against them.\n  There is only a limited supply in the United States of fine wool \nfabric. The suit makers must import significant quantities of this \nfabric, at a current tariff rate of 30.6%. But importers can bring in \ncompletely finished wool suits duty free from Canada and Mexico, and \nsubject to a 19.8% duty when imported from other sources. This anomaly \nin our tariff schedule--this tariff ``inversion''--puts domestic \nmanufacturers of wool suits at a significant disadvantage.\n  Senators Schumer, Durbin, Hagel, Mikulski, Specter, Nickles, \nFitzgerald, Santorum, Gramm, and Thompson have joined me in sponsoring \na very modest measure that would provide temporary relief to the suit-\nmakers. We have proposed that the tariff on the very finest wool \nfabric--produced in only limited quantities in the United States--be \nsuspended for a short period, and that the tariff on other classes of \nfine wool fabric be reduced to 19.8%--hardly a negligible tariff. This \nwas an effort to provide some relief to our suit makers.\n  Through the good offices of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, we \nundertook to address the concerns that has been raised when our bill \nwas first introduced. After a series of meetings with all of the \ninterested parties--and there are many--we modified our proposal to \naddress, in a constructive way, the concerns that were raised.\n  Our first compromise proposal was rejected out of hand. No \ncounterproposal was forthcoming. The objection stems chiefly from two \nsources: a fabric manufacturer that is not currently producing the fine \nwool fabric at issue--but promises to do so in the future, principally \nfrom a plant it is building in Mexico; and from the American Sheep \nIndustry Association--this despite the fact that wool of the quality \nrequired for suit fabric is sourced overwhelmingly from Australia.\n  I am at a loss to explain the vehemence of the opposition. The fabric \nproducer that so strongly opposes this legislation--Burlington \nIndustries--is positioning itself to compete in the global market. As \nit ought to do.\n  On January 26, 1999, the company announced a major reorganization. To \nquote, ``operations will be streamlined and U.S. capacity will be \nreduced by 25%.'' Let me repeat: ``U.S. capacity will be reduced by \n25%.'' The company announced that 2900 jobs would be eliminated, an \nannouncement made just one month after the company reported to its \nshareholders--on December 2, 1998, that ``we have launched a major \ngrowth initiative in Mexico.''\n  There followed an announcement to its customers that the fine wool \nfabric used to manufacture men's suits--so called ``fancies''--would \nnot be available for a time.\n  Even so, we cannot get agreement on tariff relief for our suit \nmakers, who have greater need than ever for imported fabric. They must \nstill pay a 31% tariff on imported fine wool fabric. We ought to enable \nthem to remain competitive, just as Burlington has taken steps to \nremain competitive.\n  We have kept at it. In recent days, our efforts have intensified. \nWith a great deal of good will on the part of all interested parties, \nit appears that we may be inching toward an agreement that would, in \nfact, benefit all parties in some measure.\n  We have included a place-holder in the trade legislation--not a \nsolution to the wool tariffs problem, but a provision that will allow \nour discussions to continue over the next several days.\n  I do thank the chairman and his staff--particularly Grant Aldonas--\nfor their efforts, as well as the considerable interest and attention \nof Senators Durbin, Schumer, and Baucus, all of whom are eager, as am \nI, to work this out. I intend to continue to work with our chairman and \nwith others to resolve this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13791-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13791-S13793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the issue of prescription drugs for the \nNation's senior citizens is back in the headlines this morning with yet \nanother study having been published that millions of senior citizens in \nAmerica cannot afford their prescriptions.\n  This is the 12th time I have come to the floor in recent days to talk \nabout this issue because I think it is so critical that the Senate act \nin a bipartisan way to deal with what are clearly the great out-of-\npocket costs for the Nation's older people. Specifically, as this \nposter next to me says, I have been urging senior citizens to send in \ncopies of their prescription drug bills to each of us in the Senate in \nWashington, DC.\n  The reason I hope we will hear from seniors around the country is \nthere is one bipartisan bill, one that is before the Senate now, to \ndeal with this question of prescription needs for seniors. It is the \nbill on which Senator Olympia Snowe and I have teamed up in recent \nmonths, and 54 Members of this body, the majority, have already voted \nfor the funding plan that is laid out in the Snowe-Wyden legislation. \nSo we have 54 Members of the Senate on record as supporting a specific \nplan to cover prescription drugs for the Nation's older people.\n  The model in the Snowe-Wyden legislation is something that every \nMember of the Senate is familiar with because it is the model we have \nfor health care for ourselves and our families. The\n\n[[Page S13792]]\n\nSnowe-Wyden legislation is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity Act. It would ensure that seniors would get \ntheir medicine at an affordable rate because our bill would allow them \nthe bargaining power that big organizations, big purchasers such as the \nhealth maintenance organizations would have.\n  The tragedy today with respect to our Nation's seniors and \nprescriptions is they get shellacked twice; first, because Medicare \ndoes not cover prescriptions. When the program began in 1965, it did \nnot cover prescriptions initially. Second, because the big buyers, the \nhealth maintenance organizations and the other big purchasers, are able \nto use their clout in the marketplace, those folks can get a discount \nand a senior citizen in rural Oregon or rural New Mexico or another \npart of this country in effect has to subsidize with their dollars the \nbreak the large organizations are getting.\n\n  Frankly, there are other ideas for dealing with this issue. \nColleagues on both sides of the aisle have them. What I am trying to do \nto support the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan legislation is to come to the \nfloor and, as this poster says, ask our seniors to send copies of their \nprescription drug bills directly to us in the Senate in Washington. I \nam going to, as I have done on 11 previous occasions recently, actually \nread from some of these bills so we can make the case for how urgent \nthis need is.\n  For example, I recently received a letter from a woman in Portland \nwho described to me what she and her husband are facing with respect to \ntheir prescription drug costs. This couple in Portland has a combined \nincome of about $1,500 a month. She spends, from that $1,500-a-month \nincome, $230 on prescription drugs and he spends about $180 a month. So \nthe two of them, an elderly couple in Portland, are spending more than \n$400 a month on prescription drugs. They are spending upwards of $4,000 \na year on their prescription medicine and, as they reported to me, they \nhave no insurance to cover these costs.\n  This morning in Washington we saw, again, more press conferences on \nthis issue. I guess we can go day after day having dueling press \nconferences with respect to this issue of prescription drugs. We can \nhave a lot of finger pointing, we can have a lot of bickering, a lot of \nquarreling about how serious the problem is and what to do about it, \nbut there is one bipartisan bill that uses marketplace forces to try to \ndeal with this issue. The Snowe-Wyden legislation steers clear of price \ncontrols. We do not have a Federal regime for handling this benefit. It \nis not one-size-fits-all Federal policy. It uses marketplace forces to \nmake sure seniors have choices and options and alternatives for their \nprescription medicines. It is based on a model that all of us are \npretty familiar with because we utilize the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan.\n  I want to go through a couple more of these cases. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana is here to speak on an important \nmatter, as are other colleagues. But I do, as part of this effort, want \nto highlight with these specific cases some of what we are seeing all \nacross this country as seniors walk this economic tightrope, balancing \ntheir food costs against their fuel costs, and their fuel costs against \ntheir medical bills and find themselves, again and again, not in a \nposition to pay for their prescriptions.\n  I received another letter in the last few days from a senior citizen \nin Oregon. She is on seven prescriptions. She has heart disease; she \nhas high blood pressure and diabetes. She and her husband exist on \nSocial Security and a tiny disability check. They get a couple of \nthousand dollars a month maximum in their income. Every month, they \nspend at least $300 of it on prescription drugs. That is just the wife \nin the household. Her husband has to spend additionally on prescription \ndrugs. This particular elderly person wrote and said if it were not for \nthe free samples that she was getting from her physician, she simply \ncould not meet her expenses.\n  Another letter I received described a senior taking five prescription \ndrugs. She has high blood pressure and high thyroid. She has an income \nof a little under $1,000 a month. She spends about $100 a month on \nprescription drugs. And she wrote me:\n\n       I am lucky that my kids will give me a hand when I have \n     difficulty in affording my prescriptions.\n\n  As part of this effort to have the Senate deal with this urgent need \nfor older people in a bipartisan way, I would like to see the Senate \nconsider the one bipartisan bill before us now, the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation. But I am sure colleagues have other ideas, and I think if \nwe will listen to the senior citizens of this country who are sending \nme and our colleagues copies of these bills--as the poster says, ``Send \nin copies of prescription drug bills directly to us here in the \nSenate''--we can help the Senate deal with this issue on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I am going to wrap up this afternoon with a question I hope a lot of \ncolleagues are asking with respect to prescription drug coverage: Can \nour Nation afford to cover prescription drug costs of older people? My \nanswer to that is: I believe we cannot afford not to ensure that our \nseniors get this coverage. I want to cite an example before I wrap up.\n  Last week, I talked about the evidence we are seeing with the new \nanticoagulant drugs. These are important drugs that can help seniors \nprevent strokes and debilitating illnesses. As a result of seniors \ntaking these medicines, which cost about $1,000 a year, there is \ndocumented medical evidence now that these drugs can help prevent \nstrokes, which cost upwards of $100,000 a year. So think about the \ninvestment, the wise investment--not just from a health standpoint, not \njust from the standpoint of trying to make sure our seniors get a fair \nshake but purely from a financial standpoint--the benefit of having \nseniors get prescription drug coverage, getting, for example, these \nanticoagulant drugs that cost about $1,000 a year, and seeing a savings \nas a result of the older person not having a stroke, of that person not \nincurring $100,000 in expenses that would be involved in treating the \nstroke.\n  I was director of the Gray Panthers at home for about 7 years before \nI was elected to the Congress. Prescription drugs were important then. \nYou would always hear from seniors that they want this coverage. But \nthe prescriptions today are even more important because they can help \nkeep seniors well. Prescriptions today, helping to lower blood \npressure, helping lower cholesterol, are drugs that are going to help \nus hold costs down for the Medicare program.\n  As we all know, Medicare Part A, the hospital portion, the \ninstitutional portion of the program is particularly expensive, and \nthese drugs today, if we can get decent Medicare coverage for the \nNation's older people, will help us save some of the money that would \notherwise be spent under Part A of the program when seniors incur these \ndebilitating illnesses.\n  I intend, as I have done now on 12 occasions, to keep coming to the \nfloor to urge seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug \nbills directly to us in the Senate in hopes we can get bipartisan \naction. I am very proud that the Snowe-Wyden funding plan got 54 votes, \na majority of votes in the Senate already for going forward with a \nspecific plan to fund this program, but I am sure colleagues have other \nideas.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here. He has \nbeen very involved in the question of Medicare. I was very honored when \nSenator Moynihan, last week, spoke favorably about the SPICE \nlegislation we have introduced. Colleagues have plenty of ideas on how \nto deal with it, but what is important is we go forward in a bipartisan \nway and not wait until after another election which is literally a year \naway.\n  In the hope the Senate will act in a bipartisan way, I intend to keep \ncoming back to the floor to discuss this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nterrific statement and his terrific work with our colleague from Maine \non a very important piece of legislation. The President has said time \nand again, as have most of us, as the Senator from Oregon has pointed \nout, that we would never even think of designing a Medicare program \ntoday without having prescription drug coverage. It would be \nunthinkable, particularly because of the advances in science and \ntechnology which, at a minimal cost, help keep\n\n[[Page S13793]]\n\npeople well and out of hospitals and out of difficulty and pain and \nsuffering. It would be cost-effective to the taxpayer.\n  I thank him and commit to him my intention to continue to work with \nhim and with many Members on both sides of the aisle until we can \nresolve this problem and answer the legitimate needs and requests of \nour seniors in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13793-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY JUDGES\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Long recognized as one of the nation's quickest, most \ninnovative and fairest, The Delaware corporate bankruptcy court's \ncaseload has grown to the point that at least one additional judge is \nnecessary. I want to commend a number of my congressional colleagues \nfor joining with me to address this situation.\n  Yesterday, Senator Grassley and Representative Gekas held a joint \nhearing on the need for additional bankruptcy judges. Representative \nMike Castle was among those who testified at this hearing, and I \nunderstand he eloquently elaborated on Delaware's status as the busiest \nbankruptcy venue per judge in the nation.\n  Simply put, more capable judges are needed to tend to corporate \nbankruptcy cases in Delaware and a select number of other states. \nRealizing this, Senator Paul Coverdell has introduced S. 1830, to \nprovide for the appointment of additional temporary bankruptcy judges. \nI, along with Senator Biden and a number of other Senators, have \ncosponsored this vital proposal.\n  I commend my fellow sponsors of this legislation as well as the \nchairmen of the subcommittees of jurisdiction for holding yesterday's \nhearing. I look forward to working with them on this important matter \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13793-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I am also pleased to transmit \nmy written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the \nAgreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment \nStatement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. (In accordance with section \n123 of the Act, as amended by title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform \nand Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified annex \nto the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with \nthe Director of Central Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified \ninformation, will be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint \nmemorandum submitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary \nof Energy, which includes a summary of the provisions of the Agreement \nand the views of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is also enclosed.\n  A U.S. company and an Australian company have entered into a contract \njointly to develop and evaluate the commercial potential of a \nparticular uranium enrichment process (known as the ``SILEX'' process) \ninvented by the Australian company. If the commercial viability of the \nprocess is demonstrated, the U.S. company may adopt it to enrich \nuranium for sale to U.S. and foreign utilities for use as reactor fuel.\n  Research on and development of the new enrichment process may require \ntransfer from the United States to Australia of technology controlled \nby the United States as sensitive nuclear technology or Restricted \nData. Australia exercises similar controls on the transfer of such \ntechnology outside Australia. There is currently in force an Agreement \nBetween the United States of America and Australia Concerning Peaceful \nUses of Nuclear Energy, signed at Canberra July 5, 1979 (the ``1979 \nAgreement''). However, the 1979 Agreement does not permit transfers of \nsensitive nuclear technology and Restricted Data between the parties \nunless specifically provided for by an amendment or by a separate \nagreement.\n  Accordingly, the United States and Australia have negotiated, as a \ncomplement to the 1979 Agreement, a specialized agreement for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation to provide the necessary legal basis for transfer \nof the relevant technology between the two countries for peaceful \npurposes.\n  The proposed Agreement provides for cooperation between the parties \nand authorized persons within their respective jurisdictions in \nresearch on and development of the SILEX process (the particular \nprocess for the separation of isotopes of uranium by laser excitation). \nThe Agreement permits the transfer for peaceful purposes from Australia \nto the United States and from the United States to Australia, subject \nto the nonproliferation conditions and controls set forth in the \nAgreement, of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive \nnuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities, \nto the extent that these relate to the SILEX technology.\n  The nonproliferation conditions and controls required by the \nAgreement are the standard conditions and controls required by section \n123 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by the Nuclear Non--\nProliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA), for all new U.S. agreements for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation. These include safeguards, a guarantee of \nno explosive or military use, a guarantee of adequate physical \nprotection, and rights to approve re-transfers, enrichment, \nreprocessing, other alterations in form or content, and storage. The \nAgreement contains additional detailed provisions for the protection of \nsensitive nuclear technology, Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear \nfacilities, and major critical components of such facilities \ntransferred pursuant to it.\n\n[[Page S13794]]\n\n  Material, facilities, and technology subject to the Agreement may not \nbe used to produce highly enriched uranium without further agreement of \nthe parties.\n  The Agreement also provides that cooperation under it within the \nterritory of Australia will be limited to research on and development \nof SILEX technology, and will not be for the purpose of constructing a \nuranium enrichment facility in Australia unless provided for by an \namendment to the Agreement. The United States would treat any such \namendment as a new agreement pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic \nEnergy Act, including the requirement for congressional review.\n  Australia is in the forefront of nations supporting international \nefforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional \ncountries. It is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and has an agreement with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the application of full-scope \nsafeguards to its nuclear program. It subscribes to the Nuclear \nSupplier Group (NSG) Guidelines, which set forth standards for the \nresponsible export of nuclear commodities for peaceful use, and to the \nZangger (NPT Exporters) Committee Guidelines, which oblige members to \nrequire the application of IAEA safeguards on nuclear exports to \nnonnuclear weapon states. In addition, Australia is a party to the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, whereby it \nhas agreed to apply international standards of physical protection to \nthe storage and transport of nuclear material under its jurisdiction or \ncontrol.\n  The proposed Agreement with Australia has been negotiated in \naccordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and other \napplicable law. In my judgment, it meets all statutory requirements and \nwill advance the nonproliferation, foreign policy, and commercial \ninterests of the United States.\n  A consideration in interagency deliberations on the Agreement was the \npotential consequences of the Agreement for U.S. military needs. If \nSILEX technology is successfully developed and becomes operational, \nthen all material produced by and through this technology would be \nprecluded from use in the U.S. nuclear weapons and naval nuclear \npropulsion programs. Furthermore, all other military uses of this \nmaterial, such as tritium production and material testing, would also \nnot be possible because of the assurances given to the Government of \nAustralia. Yet, to ensure the enduring ability of the United States to \nmeet its common defense and security needs, the United States must \nmaintain its military nuclear capabilities. Recognizing this \nrequirement and the restrictions being placed on the SILEX technology, \nthe Department of Energy will monitor closely the development of SILEX \nbut ensure that alternative uranium enrichment technologies are \navailable to meet the requirements for national security.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this Agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and House International Relations Committee as \nprovided in section 123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous \nsession period provided for in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous \nsession period provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto pay tribute to a former colleague of mine and a fellow Californian, \nformer Congressman Augustus F. Hawkins, by renaming the Federal \nbuilding located at 10301 South Compton Avenue, in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, currently known as the Watts Finance Office, as the \nAugustus F. Hawkins Post Office Building.\n  Gus Hawkins was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1907. His family \nmoved to Los Angeles when he was 11 to escape the racial discrimination \nthat was prevalent in the South at that time. This experience made him \na passionate advocate of racial justice and social equality, and he \ncommitted his life to the service of others.\n  His efforts began in the California Assembly where he passed the \nstate's first law against discrimination in housing and employment. \nBuilding on that success, he passed other important legislation \nconcerning minimum wages for women, child care centers, workers' \ncompensation for domestic employees, and the removal of racial \ndesignations on state documents.\n  In 1962, Gus was elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives. During his 28 years in office, he served on the \nCommittee on House Administration, and served as Chairman for both the \nJoint Committee on Printing and the Committee on Education and Labor. \nHe authored more than 17 federal laws dealing with civil rights, \neducational improvements, job training and employment opportunities. He \nfought tirelessly for the rights of children, the poor, the disabled, \nthe elderly, and minorities.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Gus was recognized as a \nhardworking man of integrity who cared little for personal accolades \nwhile concentrating on the issues affecting his constituents. He has \ncontinually pursued fairness and opportunity for all.\n  Designating the Watts Finance Office Building as the Augustus F. \nHawkins Post Office Building is an honor befitting his 56 years of \nservice to his community and to the State of California.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1847.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto pay tribute to a former colleague of mine and a fellow Californian, \nformer Congressman Mervyn Malcolm Dymally, by renaming the post office \nlocated at 701 South Santa Fe Avenue in Compton, California, currently \nknown as the Compton Main Post Office, as the Mervyn Dymally Post \nOffice Building.\n  Mr. Dymally came to this country in 1945 from Cedros, Trinidad, \nBritish West Indies. In 1960, he began his political career by working \nas a field coordinator for John F. Kennedy during the Presidential \ncampaign. Mr. Dymally's own service as an elected official began when \nhe was elected to the California State Assembly in 1963 and then to the \nState Senate in 1967, where he served for eight years. Next, he was \nelected Lieutenant Governor of the State of California and was the \nState's highest ranking black elected official.\n  Building on a career of political success, Mervyn Dymally was elected \nto the United States House of Representatives in 1981. During his six \nterms in office, he served on several committees, including the Post \nOffice and Civil Service Committee; the Committee on the District of \nColumbia, where he chaired its Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education; \nand the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where he was the Chair of \nthe Subcommittee on International Operations.\n  As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, Mr. Dymally's passion \nbecame immediately evident when he visited 20 African countries in his \nfirst year. He worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the plight of \nAfricans and to monitor U.S. assistance levels to African and Caribbean \nnations. Throughout his distinguished career, he was recognized for his \nleadership in humanitarian efforts.\n  Since retirement from Congress in 1992, Mr. Dymally is busier than \never. He serves as President of the Grace Home for Waiting Children and \nas Chairman of the Caribbean Action Lobby. In addition, he is the \nPresident of a consulting firm and a Professor at the Central State \nUniversity in Ohio.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Denver \nWater Reuse project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              The Denver Water Reuse Project Authorization\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to reintroduce a \nbill that will help millions of water consumers throughout my state. \nThis bill is based on S. 2140, legislation I introduced last year, \nwhich passed out of the full Senate.\n  The Denver Water Department has developed a unique plan to re-use \nnon-potable water for irrigation and industrial uses. In the arid West, \nwhere growing populations and changing values are place increasing \ndemands on existing water supplies, water and availability remain \nimportant issues. Recent conflicts are particularly apparent in the \nWest where agricultural needs for water are often in direct conflict \nwith urban needs. This legislation will help remedy some of this \nconflict.\n  This bill authorizes the Denver Water Department to access federal \nfunds to assist in the implementation of this plan. The State of \nColorado, the Colorado Water Congress, the Denver Board of Water \nCommissioners, and the Mayor of Denver have fully endorsed this \nlegislation. I am pleased to assist these interested parties with this \nworthwhile proposal.\n  The Denver Water Department serves over a million customers and is \nthe largest water supplier in the Rocky Mountain region. Over the past \nseveral years Denver Water has developed a plan to treat and re-use \nsome of its water supply for uses not involving human consumption, such \nas irrigation and industrial purposes. In this manner, Denver will \nstretch its water supply without the cost and potential environmental \ndisruption of building new reservoirs. It will also ease the demand on \nfresh drinking-quality water supplies.\n  The Denver Nonpotable Reuse Project will treat secondary wastewater, \nthat is water which has already been used once in Denver's system. It \nis an environmentally and economically viable method for extending and \nconserving our limited water supplies. The water quality will meet all \nColorado and federal standards. The water will still be clean and \nodorless, but since it will be used for irrigation and industrial uses \naround the Denver International Airport and the Rocky Mountain Wildlife \nRefuge, the additional expense to treat it for drinking will be \navoided.\n  The nonpotable project will be constructed in three phases and \nultimately will result in an additional useable water supply of 15,000 \nacre feet. The use of the nonpotable water for irrigation and \nindustrial customers will make potable water supplies available for up \nto 30,000 homes.\n  Construction will include a treatment plant and a distribution system \nthat is separate from the potable water system. Phase I will serve \ncustomers in the vicinity of the reuse plant, including a Public \nService Company power plant, other industrial users and other public \nareas. Phase II will add irrigation for parks and golf courses in the \nformer Stapleton Airport and the recently closed Lowry Air Force Base \nredevelopment areas. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which is being \nconverted to a national wildlife refuge, will also use the reuse water \nto maintain lake levels on-site and to provide water for wildlife \nhabitats. Phase III will serve existing parks as well as new \ndevelopment of a commercial corridor leading to the Denver \nInternational Airport. With the construction of Phase II, the \nirrigation, heating and cooling, and car washing facilities at Denver \nInternational Airport will convert to reuse water, where a dual \ndistribution system has already been installed.\n  In the West, naturally scarce water supplies and increasing urban \npopulations have furthered our need for water reuse, recycling, \nconservation, and storage proposals which are the keys to successfully \nmeet the water needs of everyone. This plan would benefit many \nColoradans, and would help relieve many of the water burdens faced in \nthe Denver region. Again, I'd like to thank the interested parties for \ntheir support, and I am hopeful this bill can be quickly passed and put \ninto effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and copies of letters of \nsupport from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the Colorado \nWater Congress, the Denver Board of Water Commissioners, and the Mayor \nof Denver be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: I am writing to support the \n     inclusion of the Denver Water Nonpotable Reuse Project on the \n     Title XVI authorizing list. Inclusion of this project \n     recognizes the importance of creative procedures to meet \n     future water needs for metropolitan Denver. As it becomes \n     more and more difficult to provide water supplies for a \n     rapidly growing metropolitan area, innovative projects such \n     as reuse and conjunctive use must supplant existing capacity. \n     Denver Water's reuse plant will produce over 1,000 acre feet \n     of usable water supply by treatment of effluent for \n     industrial and irrigation purposes. The reuse water will be \n     treated to attain important public health standards even for \n     those limited purposes.\n       Resuse of water is valuable not only for Denver, but for \n     other areas of Colorado. Reuse of water will delay the need \n     to develop new water supplies from other water sources. This \n     project has wide-spread support in Colorado. Your efforts to \n     see Denver Water's Nonpotable Reuse Project listed as a \n     Bureau of Reclamation approved project are appreciated. Thank \n     you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Greg Walcher,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Colorado Water Congress,\n\n                                     Denver, CO, October 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As you well know, the chronic water \n     shortages in Colorado have forced Colorado Water supply \n     agencies to develop water in new and ingenious ways. One of \n     the best water projects being planned is Denver Water's \n     Nonpotable Reuse Project that will take water already used, \n     treat it and deliver it for industrial and irrigation supply. \n     This project will supply about 15% of Denver's anticipated \n     water shortfall without building a new reservoir, without \n     tremendous federal compliance costs, and without a new \n     transbasin diversion.\n       The Water Congress has members throughout the state of \n     Colorado; and I know of no opposition to this project. I \n     understand you are trying to get the project listed pursuant \n     to Title XVI of the Bureau of Reclamation approved reuse \n     projects list. You have the support of the Colorado Water \n     Congress. Thank you for your consideration in this endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard D. MacRavey,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Denver Board of\n\n\n                                          Water Commissioners,\n\n                                     Denver, CO, October 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: I appreciate your support and \n     sponsorship of the bill that adds the Denver Nonpotable Reuse \n     Project to Public Law 102-575 Title XVI, the U.S. Bureau of \n     Reclamation's authorized list. This project allows us to \n     conserve potable water sources and helps us to defer \n     importation of water from the Western Slope. As I think you \n     know, we are only seeking authorization, not federal funding, \n     for the Denver Reuse Project.\n       We are planning a project that will provide over 15,000 \n     acre-feet of nonpotable supply. That, in turn, frees up \n     enough treated water supply to provide for some 30,000 homes. \n     It represents a substantial portion of the supply that will \n     be needed for future demand in the Denver Water system as an \n     expanding population strains our limited water resources. By \n     reclaiming wastewater for irrigation and industrial use, we \n     can serve growth in a way that is environmentally responsible \n     and economic.\n       Please feel free to call upon us should you need further \n     information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       H.J.

We certainly acknowledge \n     the importance and value of our limited water resources \n     throughout Colorado. Reuse efforts allow us to reduce or \n     minimize the Denver metro area's demands on limited Colorado \n     River sources.\n       Once again, thank you for your support.\n           Yours truly,\n                                              Wellington, E.

A bill to designate segments and tributaries of White Clay \nCreek, Delaware and Pennsylvania, as a component of the National Wild \nand Scenic Rivers System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n            The White Clay Creek Wild and Scenic Rivers Act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Roth, \nin introducing a bill that would designate the White Clay Creek and its \ntributaries in Delaware and Pennsylvania as a unit of the National Wild \nand Scenic Rivers System.\n  It has been eight years since I introduced the bill authorizing the \nstudy of the White Clay Creek watershed, and thirty years since I began \nmy efforts to protect this unique and valuable region from the over \ndevelopment and urban sprawl that are of increasing concern to all of \nus.\n  The White Clay Creek watershed is a truly remarkable environment, \ncovering 107 square miles and draining over 69,000 acres in Delaware \nand Pennsylvania. Centrally located between the densely urbanized \nregions of New York and Washington, D.C., the White Clay Creek \nwatershed is within a 2 hour drive of eight million people.\n  Its diversity of natural, historic, cultural and recreational \nresources, as detailed in the National Park Service's Resources and \nIssues Report in September of 1994, is extraordinary. The watershed is \nhome to a wide variety of plant and animal life, archeological sites \ndating back to prehistoric times, a bi-state preserve and state park, \nand a source of drinking water for the region.\n  It became clear, early on, that these resources warranted the federal \nprotection provided under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. \nWith the introduction of my legislation today, we are entering the last \nmajor phase of seeing that protection become a reality.\n  Before I begin to speak on the particulars of today's legislation and \nthe study process that got us to this point, I think it is important to \nnote that while there are over 150 National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nacross this nation, the White Clay Creek brings with it two \ndistinctions: Specifically, it will be the first and only Wild and \nScenic River in Delaware; and, it is the first and only river to be \nstudied for designation on a watershed basis.\n  The study of the White Clay Creek for possible inclusion in the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System recently culminated with the \nrelease of a National Park Service study report in September of this \nyear. The study process began in 1992, when Congress directed the \nNational Park Service to convene a study task force consisting of state \nand local governments, community organizations, watershed residents and \nlandowners within the White Clay Creek watershed.\n  As described in the study legislation, the duties of the task force \nwere to evaluate the eligibility and suitability of the White Clay \nCreek and its tributaries, and to develop a management plan for the \npreservation and protection of the watershed. Fifteen local governments \nin Delaware and Pennsylvania participated in the study task force.\n  I stated during hearings on the study legislation, before the Senate \nSubcommittee on Forests and Public Land\n\n[[Page S13801]]\n\nManagement in November of 1991, that there was tremendous support for \nthe study and subsequent designation. However, I realized that with the \ndiverse group of individuals, organizations and agencies making up the \ntask force, the possibility for conflict in determining which segments \nshould be designated and what protections afforded them, could be \ngreat.\n  What I could not have expected and what I am extremely pleased to \nreport is that the support for protection of the White Clay Creek is so \nstrong, that over 190 miles of the approximately 400 river miles \nstudied in the watershed are being requested for designation today. \nClearly, Delawareans and Pennsylvanians alike understand the value of \npreserving areas as unique as the White Clay Creek.\n  And, the legislation I am introducing will do just that. It directs \nthe National Park Service to incorporate 190.9 miles of the White Clay \nCreek and its tributaries into its National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem. Along with the designation, all 15 local governments within the \nwatershed area have unanimously supported, through the passage of \nresolutions, the ideals and goals of the White Clay Creek Management \nPlan. The plan, developed by the White Clay Creek Task Force, will \nensure long-term protection of the White Clay Creek watershed, \nemphasizing the importance of local governments working together, which \nis key in obtaining the federal designation I am seeking today.\n  Designation of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries will bring \nnational attention to the unique cultural, natural and recreational \nvalues of the area. It will provide an added level of protection from \nover development, by requiring an in-depth review by the National Park \nService of any proposed project requiring federal permits or federal \nfunding in the affected area. And finally, it elevates the value of the \nwatershed when applying for state, local and federal preservation \ngrants.\n  Of the 69,000 acres in the watershed, 5,000 acres are public lands \nowned by state and local governments, the rest is privately owned and \nmaintained. There are no federal lands within the watershed and no \nfederal dollars will be used to purchase any land within its \nboundaries.\n  I believe the protection of the White Clay Creek watershed to be one \nof the most important environmental initiatives I have undertaken since \ntaking office in 1973, and it is my hope that Congress will act quickly \non this bill so it can be preserved not only for us, but also for all \nthe generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 1850. A bill to amend section 222 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to modify the requirements relating to the use and disclosure of \ncustomer proprietary network information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   telephone call privacy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about privacy and about \nhow we can regain some control over our personal information. Privacy \nis an increasing concern for all Americans. And the public rightly \nbelieves that their control over some of their most personal \ninformation is being slowly but surely eroded.\n  Today I introduce legislation that would help end that erosion. The \n``Telephone Call Privacy Act of 1999,'' would prevent \ntelecommunications companies from using an individual's personal phone \ncall records without their consent, in order to sell that individual \nproducts or services.\n  Most Americans would be stunned to learn that the law does not \nprotect them from having their phone records sold to third parties. \nImagine getting a call one night--during dinner--and having a \ntelemarketer try to sell you membership in a travel club because your \nphone calling patterns show frequent calls overseas. My legislation \nwould prevent this from occurring without the individual's permission.\n  Mr. President, no one denies that the rapid development of modern \ntechnology has been beneficial. New and improved technologies have \nenabled us to obtain information more quickly and easily than ever \nbefore. Students can participate in classes that are being taught in \nother states, or even other countries. Current events can be broadcast \naround the world as they happen. And companies have streamlined their \nprocesses for providing goods and services.\n  But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They \nhave made it easier to track personal information such as medical and \nfinancial records, and buying habits. And in turn, our ability to keep \nour personal information private is being eroded. I have to say there \nare times when it feels like companies know more about me than I know \nmyself.\n  The list of ways our privacy is being eroded is growing longer and \nlonger. And sadly telephone call privacy got added to the list this \nAugust when the 10th Circuit struck down FCC regulations aimed at \nprotecting privacy and implementing congressional intent.\n  The decision was the result of a suit filed by U.S. West against the \nFCC arguing that its regulations restrict the ability of carriers to \nengage in commercial speech with customers. In August, the Tenth \nCircuit issued its decision in the case and agreed with U.S. West. The \ncourt stated that ``privacy is not an absolute good because it imposes \nreal costs on society.''\n  I believe the court was terribly wrong. Individuals have a reasonable \nexpectation that their calling habits are not being shared with third \nparties without their knowledge or permission. And when I weigh the \nright of people to control who has access to their personal information \nagainst the ability of companies to use only one of many marketing \nmethods, there is no question that the right of people to privacy is \noverriding. Surely people have a right to control some of their most \nprivate information. And surely they have the right to prevent \nharassing and unwanted solicitations. I for one cannot believe that \nexpanding the variety of marketing techniques at a company's disposal \nis more important than a person's privacy right.\n  Mr. President, let me describe how my legislation would address the \nproblem. Current law defines information about who we call, how often, \nand how long we talk to them as ``customer proprietary network \ninformation,'' or ``CPNI.'' It is possible for telephone companies to \ntrack an individual's CPNI and use it to market various products and \nservices to that person.\n  My legislation requires that consumers be notified about potential \ndisclosures of their private calling information and allows them to \nhave some measure of control over how their information can be used. \nSpecifically, my bill would do two things.\n  First, if a telecommunications carrier wishes to use CPNI in order to \nmarket its own products or services to them, it must provide each \ncustomer with a clear and conspicuous notice stating the type of \ncalling information that may be used and the purpose for which it will \nbe used. The customer may contact the carrier to deny permission to use \ntheir information within 15 days of the notice. If the customer does \nnot contact the carrier in that time, the carrier can use the \ncustomer's CPNI to market its products and services to that customer. \nIn other words, customers are provided with a limited opportunity to \n``opt-out'' of the sharing of their information under these \ncircumstances.\n  The second part of my bill addresses situations where a carrier \nwishes to share a customer's CPNI with a third party, such as a \ntelemarketer. In these situations, in addition to providing the \ncustomer with notice, the carrier must also receive prior written \napproval from the customer. My bill clearly spells out that customers \nmust affirmatively ``opt-in'' before a carrier can sell calling \ninformation to any third party.\n  The ``Telephone Call Privacy Act'' also allows for some reasonable \nand common sense exceptions. If a telecommunications carrier uses a \ncustomer's CPNI to provide the customer with the very services the \ncarrier used to obtain the calling information, or if law enforcement \nor the courts require CPNI for certain reasons, the carrier does not \nneed to provide the customer with notice and the opportunity to opt-out \nor opt-in.\n  Mr. President, consumers are very worried about how their personal \ninformation is being used. In 1994, a Harris Survey assessed Americans' \nviews about privacy. It found that eighty-two percent of people \nsurveyed are concerned about threats to their personal\n\n[[Page S13802]]\n\nprivacy. And more specifically, more than half the people surveyed also \nstated they would be concerned if an interactive service engaged in \n``subscriber profiling'' or using an individual's purchasing patterns \nto determine what types of goods and services to market to them. The \nsurvey also showed that people are less concerned about subscriber \nprofiling if they are provided with notice that a profile would be \ncreated and how it would be used, and also if they are given access to \nthe information in the profile.\n  Something must be done to empower consumers to prevent their private \ncalling information from being used without their consent. The \nTelephone Call Privacy Act is an important step towards this goal. I \nbelieve the principles set forth in my legislation are a reasonable way \nto protect privacy and do not unduly burden the ability of businesses \nto market their products and services.\n  As Justice Brandeis said in his famous dissent in Olmstead v. U.S., \n``the right to be let alone [is] the most comprehensive of rights and \nthe right most valued by civilized men.'' The government must not only \nrefrain from violating this right, but it must also ensure its \npreservation. I believe the Telephone Call Privacy Act is a sensible \nmeans to achieving this goal. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1850\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks in support of \nthe 4-H postal stamp resolution.\n  We must not fail to notice all the admirable efforts of youth today \nacross the country. One fine example of young people joining together \nto make a positive impact in our country is the 4-H Youth Development \nProgram. In the year 2002, 4-H will celebrate its 100th Anniversary. To \nrecognize this national organization's achievements, I am submitting \nthis resolution urging the U.S. Postal Service to create a stamp in \nhonor of their centennial.\n  4-H is comprised of over 6 million youth, 45 million alumni, and over \n600,000 volunteers. As the 4-H pledge states, they are working everyday \nto become positive members of ``their clubs, their communities, their \ncountry and their world.'' Although this program started at the turn of \nthe century focusing on rural agriculture and homemaking, today it \nboasts a diverse group with nearly a quarter of its members coming from \ncentral cities.\n  With programs in every state and 80 other countries, 4-H has \ndemonstrated the importance of its ideals. Members follow the motto \n``To make the best better.'' Their mission is to create supportive \nenvironments enabling youth and adults to reach their full potential. \nIn this way they become capable, competent and caring citizens. As a \nresult, participation in 4-H programs has helped reduce violence, \nsubstance abuse, teen pregnancy, and unethical behavior in millions of \nyouth.\n  Every state has seen the benefits of 4-H membership. A recent report, \n``Programs of Excellence'' demonstrates this. Published by the USDA, \nthe report highlights noteworthy 4-H programs in various states from \nNew Jersey to New Mexico. In my state of Idaho, 4-H achieved \nrecognition for its programs in youth development and ethics in \nagriculture. Idaho's ``Know Your Government'' conferences were \napplauded for giving youth positive attitudes toward government and \nincreasing civic involvement and government knowledge.\n  This positive organization deserves our support and recognition. A \ncentennial stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service is the perfect way \nto honor and celebrate a job well done.\n\n[[Page S13805]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13804-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13804-S13805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 218--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT A \nCOMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED RECOGNIZING THE 4-H YOUTH \n                    DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM'S CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, \nMr. Bryan, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Chafee, \nMr. Cleland, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nDaschle, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Edwards, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, \nMr. Frist, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, \nMr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, \nMr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Mack, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Moynihan, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Robb, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Roth, Mr. Santorum, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Thomas, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Voinovich, \nMr. Warner, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs:\n\n                              S.

Res. 219\n\n       Whereas Walter Payton was a hero, a leader, and a role \n     model both on and off the field;\n       Whereas for 13 years, Walter Payton thrilled Chicago Bears' \n     fans as the National Football League's (NFL's) all-time \n     leading rusher--and as one of the greatest running backs ever \n     to play the game--culminating with his induction into the \n     Professional Football Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas after retiring from professional football in 1987, \n     Payton continued to touch the lives of both his fellow \n     Chicagoans and citizens of his native state of Mississippi, \n     as a businessman and a community leader;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was born 1954 to Mrs. Alyne Payton \n     and the late Mr. Edward Payton, and his historic career began \n     as a star running back at Columbia High School in his native \n     hometown of Columbia, Mississippi, which he called ``a \n     child's paradise.'' He went on to choose Jackson State \n     University over 100 college offers, and to set nine \n     university football records, eventually scoring more points \n     than any other football player in the history of the National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association;\n       Whereas the first choice in the 1975 NFL draft, Payton--or \n     ``Sweetness'' as he was known to his fans--became the NFL's \n     all-time leader in running and combined net yards and scored \n     110 touchdowns during his career with the Bears;\n       Whereas Walter Payton made the Pro Brown nine times and was \n     named the league's Most Valuable Player twice, in 1977 and \n     1985;\n       Whereas in 1977, Payton rushed for a career-high, 1,852 \n     yards and carried the Bears to the playoffs for the first \n     time since 1963;\n       Whereas Payton broke Jim Brown's long-standing record in \n     1984 to become the league's all-time leading rusher, and \n     finished his career with a record 16,726 total rushing yards;\n       Whereas in 1985-86, Walter Payton led the Bears to an \n     unforgettable 15-1 season and Super Bowl victory--the first \n     and only Super Bowl win in Bears' history;\n       Whereas Payton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of \n     Fame in 1993, and was selected this year as the Greatest All-\n     Time NFL Player by more than 200 players from the NFL Draft \n     Class of 1999;\n       Whereas Walter Payton matched his accomplishments on the \n     football field with his selfless actions off the field on \n     behalf of those in need. He excelled academically as well as \n     athletically, earning a degree in special education from \n     Jackson State University in just three and one half years, \n     and going on to undertake additional graduate study. Payton \n     worked throughout his adult life to improve the lives of \n     others through personal involvement with many charitable \n     organizations. He was particularly active in working with \n     children facing physical, mental, or economic challenges. In \n     1988, he established the Halas/Payton Foundation, which \n     continues his legacy of community involvement to help educate \n     Chicago's youth;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was a dedicated man of faith and \n     principle, who, as a life-long Baptist, was known for his \n     deep reverence for God; and, as a gracious and selfless \n     citizen, was a devoted father with sterling personal \n     integrity and a warm sense of humor. Walter Payton will \n     always be remembered as a true gentleman with a heart full of \n     genuine and active concern for others;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was truly an American hero in every \n     sense of the term;\n       Whereas the members of the Senate extend our deepest \n     sympathies to Walter Payton's family and the host of friends \n     that he had across the country; and\n       Whereas Walter Payton died tragically on November 1, 1999, \n     at age 45, but his legacy will live in our hearts and minds \n     forever: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) hereby recognizes and honors Walter Jerry Payton (A) as \n     one of the greatest football players of all time; and (B) for \n     his many contributions to the Nation, especially to children, \n     throughout his lifetime; and\n       (2) extends its deepest condolences to Walter Payton's \n     wife, Connie; his two children, Jarrett and Brittney; his \n     mother, Alyne; his brother, Eddie; his sister, Pam; and other \n     members of his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13805-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13805-S13809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        ROTH AMENDMENT NO. 2505\n\n  Mr. ROTH proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2325 proposed by him \nto the bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment policy \nfor sub-Sahara Africa;

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FAIR ACCESS TO \n                   JAPANESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES AND \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a deep and sustained interest in \n     the promotion of deregulation, competition, and regulatory \n     reform in Japan.\n       (2) New and bold measures by the Government of Japan \n     regarding regulatory reform will help remove the regulatory \n     and structural impediments to the effective functioning of \n     market forces in the Japanese economy.\n       (3) Regulatory reform will increase the efficient \n     allocation of resources in Japan, which is critical to \n     returning Japan to a long-term growth path powered by \n     domestic demand.\n       (4) Regulatory reform will not only improve market access \n     for United States business and other foreign firms, but will \n     also enhance consumer choice and economic prosperity in \n     Japan.\n       (5) A sustained recovery of the Japanese economy is vital \n     to a sustained recovery of Asian economies.\n       (6) The Japanese economy must serve as one of the main \n     engines of growth for Asia and for the global economy.\n       (7) The Governments of the United States and Japan \n     reconfirmed the critical importance of deregulation, \n     competition, and regulatory reform when the two governments \n     established the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and \n     Competition Policy in 1997.\n       (8) Telecommunications is a critical sector requiring \n     reform in Japan, where the market is hampered by a history of \n     laws, regulations, and monopolistic practices that do not \n     meet the needs of a competitive market.\n       (9) As the result of Japan's laws, regulations, and \n     monopolistic practices, Japanese consumers and Japanese \n     industry have been denied the broad benefits of innovative \n     telecommunications services, cutting edge technology, and \n     lower prices that competition would bring to the market.\n       (10) Japan's significant lag in developing broadband and \n     Internet services, and Japan's lag in the entire area of \n     electronic commerce, is a direct result of a noncompetitive \n     telecommunications regulatory structure.\n       (11) Japan's lag in developing broadband and Internet \n     services is evidenced by the following:\n       (A) Japan has only 17,000,000 Internet users, while the \n     United States has 80,000,000 Internet users.\n       (B) Japan hosts fewer than 2,000,000 websites, while the \n     United States hosts over 30,000,000 websites.\n       (C) Electronic commerce in Japan is valued at less than \n     $1,000,000,000, while in the United States electronic \n     commerce is valued at over $30,000,000,000.\n       (D) 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to the \n     Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools \n     are connected.\n       (12) Leading edge foreign telecommunications companies, \n     because of their high level of technology and innovation, are \n     the key to building the necessary telecommunications \n     infrastructure in Japan, which will only be able to serve \n     Japanese consumers and industry if there is a fundamental \n     change in Japan's regulatory approach to telecommunications.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the appropriate officials in the executive branch \n     should implement vigorously the call for Japan to undertake a \n     major regulatory reform in the telecommunications sector, the \n     so-called ``Telecommunications Big Bang'';\n       (2) a ``Telecommunications Big Bang'' must address \n     fundamental legislative and regulatory issues within a \n     strictly defined timeframe;\n       (3) the new telecommunications regulatory framework should \n     put competition first in order to encourage new and \n     innovative businesses to enter the telecommunications market \n     in Japan;\n       (4) the Government of Japan should ensure that Nippon \n     Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and its affiliates \n     (the NTT Group) are prevented from using their dominant \n     position in the wired and wireless market in an \n     anticompetitive manner; and\n       (5) the Government of Japan should take credible steps to \n     ensure that competitive carriers have reasonable, cost-based, \n     and nondiscriminatory access to the rights-of-way, \n     facilities, and services controlled by NTT, the NTT Group, \n     other utilities, and the Government of Japan, including--\n       (A) access to interconnection at market-based rates;\n       (B) unrestricted access to unbundled elements of the \n     network belonging to NTT and the NTT Group; and\n       (C) access to public roads for the installation of \n     facilities.\n\n     SEC. 610.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE DEBT \n                   RELIEF FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The burden of external debt has become a major \n     impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many \n     of the world's poorest countries.\n       (2) Until recently, the United States Government and other \n     official creditors sought to address this problem by \n     rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt \n     reduction.\n       (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of \n     the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their \n     capacity to repay.\n       (4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the \n     international community that all multilateral and bilateral \n     creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, \n     would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.\n       (5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to \n     address concerns raised about country conditionality, the \n     amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings \n     realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that \n     the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and \n     poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.\n       (6) Recently, the President requested Congress to provide \n     additional resources for bilateral debt forgiveness and \n     additional United States contributions to the HIPC Trust \n     Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should work together, \n     without undue delay and in concert with the international \n     community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the \n     world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic \n     growth and poverty alleviation;\n       (2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief \n     should be designed to strengthen and expand the private \n     sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the \n     development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic \n     growth in beneficiary countries;\n       (3) this program of debt relief should also support the \n     adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that \n     benefits are shared widely among the population, such as \n     through initiatives to advance education, improve health, \n     combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental \n     protection;\n       (4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and \n     implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad \n     participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and \n     should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken \n     into account;\n       (5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief \n     if that country does not cooperate with the United States on \n     terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of \n     the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict \n     or spends excessively on its military; and\n       (6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in \n     many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund \n     must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to \n     eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open \n     market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of \n     gold.\n\n     SEC. 615.

ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Corruption and bribery of public officials is a major \n     problem in many African countries and represents a serious \n     threat to the development of a functioning domestic private \n     sector, to United States business and trade interests, and to \n     prospects for democracy and good governance in African \n     countries.\n       (2) Of the 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa rated by the \n     international watchdog group, Transparency International, as \n     part of the 1998 Corruption Perception Index, 13 ranked in \n     the bottom half.\n       (3) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign \n     Public Officials in International Business Transactions, \n     which has been signed by all 29 members of the OECD plus \n     Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, and the Slovak Republic \n     and which entered into force on February 15, 1999, represents \n     a significant step in the elimination of bribery and \n     corruption in international commerce.\n       (4) As a party to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery \n     of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions, the United States should encourage the highest \n     standards possible with respect to bribery and corruption.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should encourage at every opportunity the \n     accession of sub-Saharan African countries, as defined in \n     section 6, to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of \n     Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions.\n\n     SEC. 618.

Section 456 of the District of Columbia Home Rule \n     Act (section 47-231 et seq. of the D.C. Code, as added by the \n     Federal Payment Reauthorization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-\n     373)) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``District of \n     Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance \n     Authority'' and inserting ``Mayor''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``Authority'' and \n     inserting ``Mayor''.\n       Sec. 170. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The District of Columbia has recently witnessed a spate \n     of senseless killings of innocent citizens caught in the \n     crossfire of shootings. A Justice Department crime \n     victimization survey found that while the city saw a decline \n     in the homicide rate between 1996 and 1997, the rate was the \n     highest among a dozen cities and more than double the second \n     highest city.\n       (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate funding \n     available to fight drug abuse in recent years, and the city \n     has not deployed its resources as effectively as possible. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded \n     drug treatment in the District compared to $29,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and \n     Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment slots, a \n     50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 1,100 people on \n     waiting lists.\n       (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of inmate \n     escapes from halfway houses. According to Department of \n     Corrections records, between October 21, 1998 and January 19, \n     1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates assigned to halfway houses \n     walked away. Nearly 280 of the 376 escapees were awaiting \n     trial including two charged with murder.\n       (4) The District of Columbia public schools system faces \n     serious challenges in correcting chronic problems, \n     particularly long-standing deficiencies in providing special \n     education services to the 1 in 10 District students needing \n     program benefits, including backlogged assessments, and \n     repeated failure to meet a compliance agreement on special \n     education reached with the Department of Education.\n       (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public services \n     from cleaning streets to waiting time at Department of Motor \n     Vehicles to a rat population estimated earlier this year to \n     exceed the human population have generated considerable \n     public frustration.\n       (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited millions \n     of dollars in Federal grants after Federal auditors \n     determined that several agencies exceeded grant restrictions \n     and in other instances, failed to spend funds before the \n     grants expired.\n       (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey \n     Foundation that measured the well-being of children reflected \n     that, with one exception, the District ranked worst in the \n     United States in every category from infant mortality to the \n     rate of teenage births to statistics chronicling child \n     poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year \n     2001 budget, the Congress will take into consideration \n     progress or lack of progress in addressing the following \n     issues:\n       (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, implementation of \n     community policing, the number of police officers on local \n     beats, and the closing down of open-air drug markets.\n       (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \n     treatment slots, the number of\n\n[[Page S13831]]\n\n     people served, the number of people on waiting lists, and the \n     effectiveness of treatment programs.\n       (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, \n     including the number of halfway house escapes and steps taken \n     to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house \n     residents to reduce the number of escapes.\n       (4) Education, including access to special education \n     services and student achievement.\n       (5) Improvement in basic city services, including rat \n     control and abatement.\n       (6) Application for and management of Federal grants.\n       (7) Indicators of child well-being.\n       Sec. 171. The Mayor, prior to using Federal Medicaid \n     payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals to serve a small \n     number of childless adults, should consider the \n     recommendations of the Health Care Development Commission \n     that has been appointed by the Council of the District of \n     Columbia to review this program, and consult and report to \n     Congress on the use of these funds.\n       Sec. 172. GAO Study of District of Columbia Criminal \n     Justice System. Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall--\n       (1) conduct a study of the law enforcement, court, prison, \n     probation, parole, and other components of the criminal \n     justice system of the District of Columbia, in order to \n     identify the components most in need of additional resources, \n     including financial, personnel, and management resources; and\n       (2) submit to Congress a report on the results of the study \n     under paragraph (1).\n       Sec. 173. Nothing in this Act bars the District of Columbia \n     Corporation Counsel from reviewing or commenting on briefs in \n     private lawsuits, or from consulting with officials of the \n     District government regarding such lawsuits.\n       Sec. 174. Wireless Communications. (a) In General.--Not \n     later than 7 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n     Director of the National Park Service, shall--\n       (1) implement the notice of decision approved by the \n     National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 1999, \n     including the provisions of the notice of decision concerning \n     the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates; and\n       (2) expend such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Antenna Applications.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the receipt \n     of an application, a Federal agency that receives an \n     application submitted after the enactment of this Act to \n     locate a wireless communications antenna on Federal property \n     in the District of Columbia or surrounding area over which \n     the Federal agency exercises control shall take final action \n     on the application, including action on the issuance of \n     right-of-way permits at market rates.\n       (2) Existing law.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect the applicability of existing laws \n     regarding--\n       (A) judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5, United \n     States Code (the Administrative Procedure Act), and the \n     Communications Act of 1934;\n       (B) the National Environmental Policy Act, the National \n     Historic Preservation Act and other applicable Federal \n     statutes; and\n       (C) the authority of a State or local government or \n     instrumentality thereof, including the District of Columbia, \n     in the placement, construction, and modification of personal \n     wireless service facilities.\n       Sec. 175. (a)(1) The first paragraph under the heading \n     ``Community Development Block Grants'' in title II of H.R. \n     2684 (Public Law 106-74) is amended by inserting after \n     ``National American Indian Housing Council,'' the following: \n     ``$4,000,000 shall be available as a grant for the Special \n     Olympics in Anchorage, Alaska to develop the Ben Boeke Arena \n     and Hilltop Ski Area,''; and\n       (2) The paragraph that includes the words ``Economic \n     Development Initiative (EDI)'' under the heading ``Community \n     Development Block Grants'' in title II of H.R. 2684 (Public \n     Law 106-74) is amended by striking ``$240,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``$243,500,000''.\n       (b) The statement of the managers of the committee of \n     conference accompanying H.R. 2684 is deemed to be amended \n     under the heading ``Community Development Block Grants'' to \n     include in the description of targeted economic development \n     initiatives the following:\n       ``--$1,000,000 for the New Jersey Community Development \n     Corporation for the construction of the New Jersey Community \n     Development Corporation's Transportation Opportunity Center;\n       ``--$750,000 for South Dakota State University in \n     Brookings, South Dakota for the development of a performing \n     arts center;\n       ``--$925,000 for the Florida Association of Counties for a \n     Rural Capacity Building Pilot Project in Tallahassee, \n     Florida;\n       ``--$500,000 for the Osceola County Agriculture Center for \n     construction of a new and expanded agriculture center in \n     Osceola County, Florida;\n       ``--$1,000,000 for the University of Syracuse in Syracuse, \n     New York for electrical infrastructure improvements.''; and \n     the current descriptions are amended as follows:\n       ``--$1,700,000 to the City of Miami, Florida for the \n     development of a Homeownership Zone to assist residents \n     displaced by the demolition of public housing in the Model \n     City area;'' is amended to read as follows:\n       ``--$1,700,000 to Miami-Dade County, Florida for an \n     economic development project at the Opa-locka Neighborhood \n     Center;'';\n       ``--$250,000 to the Arizona Science Center in Yuma, Arizona \n     for its after-school program for inner-city youth;'' is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``--$250,000 to the Arizona Science Center in Phoenix, \n     Arizona for its after-school program for inner-city youth;'';\n       ``--$200,000 to the Schuylkill County Fire Fighters \n     Association for a smoke-maze building on the grounds of the \n     firefighters facility in Morea, Pennsylvania;'' is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``--$200,000 to the Schuylkill County Fire Fighters \n     Association for a smoke-maze building and other facilities \n     and improvements on the grounds of the firefighters facility \n     in Morea, Pennsylvania;''.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     $2,000,000 made available pursuant to Public Law 105-276 for \n     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to redevelop the Sun Co./LTV Steel \n     Site in Hazelwood, Pennsylvania is available to the \n     Department of Economic Development in Allegheny County, \n     Pennsylvania for the development of a technology based \n     project in the county.\n       (d) Insert the following new sections at the end of the \n     administrative provisions in title II of H.R. 2684 (Public \n     Law 106-74):\n\n\n            ``FHA MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE CREDIT DEMONSTRATION\n\n       ``Sec. 226.

Mr. President, this week marks the fifth \nanniversary of the California Desert Protection Act, a bill I authored \nthat was signed into law on October 31, 1994. This Act marked a \nwatershed event for California and for the 2.8 million people who visit \nthis pristine national treasure each year. This was the most extensive \nland-protection bill in U.S. history and protected the largest parcel \nof land in the continental U.S.\n  The bill was unique in many ways. It designated national park and \nBureau of Land Management wilderness areas comprising more than 7.7 \nmillion acres, the highest category of federal protection. It also \ndesignated the Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park \nin areas that formerly fell under less protected ``national monument'' \nstatus and created the 1.6 million acre Mojave National Preserve.\n  At the time of its passage, the Desert Protection Act was the \ncenterpiece of a long and contentious battle among a variety of \ndifferent stakeholders. It faced enormous opposition from groups and \nindividuals concerned about private property rights, grazing permits, \nmining claims, and access for off-road vehicle use. The bill took \nnearly eight years to pass over objections from miners, property \nowners, hunters, ranchers and off-road enthusiasts, who thought the \nlegislation would restrict too much land and hurt business. I worked \nhard to craft a bill that protected private property rights and \nsafeguarded the region's job base while preserving a treasured \nresource--the California Desert.\n  I am proud to say that after 5 years there has not been a single \ninstance of a land transaction that did not involve a willing seller \nand willing buyer. Grazing has not been impeded and valid mining rights \nhave been upheld. The 25 million acres of California desert remain a \nplace of extraordinary beauty and diverse resources. There are soaring \nsand dunes, ninety mountain ranges, extinct volcanoes, streams, lakes, \nwildflowers, the world's largest Joshua Tree forest, waterfalls and \ncactus gardens.\n  The land also includes over 100,000 archeological sites, including \nthe only-known dinosaur tracks in California, believed to be more than \n100 million years old. More than 760 different wildlife species call \nthe rugged California desert home. The protected land has aided in the \nrecovery of the desert tortoise and has provided thousands of acres of \nneeded habitat for big horn sheep.\n  The Death Valley National Park consists of more than 3.3 million \nacres of spectacular desert scenery, interesting and rare desert \nwildlife, complex geology, undisturbed wilderness and dozens of \nhistorical and cultural interest sites. It contains the lowest point in \nthe Western hemisphere, the Death Valley badwater, which rests 282 feet \nbelow sea level. The Joshua Tree National Park comprises two deserts \nand vividly illustrates the contrast between high and low desert. Below \n3000 feet, the eastern half of the park is the land of the creosote \nbush, smoke trees and occotillo. The higher, cooler and slightly wetter \nWestern part is dominated by Joshua Trees.\n  But the crown jewel of the California Desert is the Mojave National \nPreserve whose geographical and wildlife diversity are practically \nunrivaled. The area contains eleven mountain ranges, four dry lakes, \ncinder cones, badlands, innumerable washes, mesas, buttes, lava tube \ncaves, alluvial fans and one of California's most complex sand dune \nsystems.\n\n  I would like to especially thank Mary Martin, the Mojave National \nPreserve Superintendent for her diligence and the commendable job she \nhas done balancing the diverse needs of the Preserve with those of all \nthe stakeholders who work and/or use the land.\n  The desert parks have attracted record numbers of tourists in recent \nyears from across the globe. Tourism has increased the visibility of \nCalifornia's natural resources, created jobs for desert residents and \nbrought additional income. In 1997, the three parks created more than \n6,000 jobs and over $22 million in tax revenue from tourist \nexpenditures.\n  The passage of the California Desert Protection Act has been one of \nmy proudest accomplishments in the Senate. But there is still more work \nto be done.\n  To encourage out nation's westward expansion, in 1864 Congress gave \nthe railroad industry every other section of land in a 50 mile swath in \nwhat is now the Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park. \nMost of this remaining checkerboard arrangement of land is owned by the \nCatellus Development Corporation.\n  Earlier this year David Myers, the Executive Director of the \nWildlands Conservancy, brokered a deal with Catellus to sell these \nlands at well below market value. Through David's hard work, The \nWildlands Conservancy raised $25.5 million in private funding and \ndonated land. The Catellus Corporation agreed to donate an additional \n$16.4 million in land.\n  Through the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund the U.S. would \nacquire 487,000 acres of protected land. This includes 150,000 acres of \nCongressionally designated Wilderness areas, 87,000 acres in the Mojave \nNational Preserve, 18,700 acres in Joshua Tree, land in Big Morongo, \nSan Gorgonio wilderness, and the Kelso Dunes.\n  This acquisition would formalize rights-of-way over 165 jeep trails \nand dirt access roads leading to 3.7 million acres of land used for \nhunting, hiking, sightseeing, camping and recreational vehicle use.\n  The land includes the biggest cactus gardens in the world at the \nBigelow Cholla Gardens.\n  The acquisition also includes one hundred miles of scenic lands and \nhistoric water stops along historic route 66 and would help to conserve \none of the single most intact portions of America's ``Mother Road'' \nwhich provided many Americans their first look at the Golden State and \nbecame the source of much of America's western migration folklore.\n  The purchase is supported by an overwhelming majority of constituents \nin the 40th Congressional District including Republicans and Democrats \nalike and a broad coalition of interest groups from the Sierra Club to \nthe National Rifle Association. This transaction would be one of the \nbiggest land acquisitions in California history and one of the most \nsubstantial gifts ever to the American people.\n  It is my hope that we can take advantage of this rare opportunity to \npurchase these valuable lands and remove any remaining impediments for \nthe millions of hikers, campers, and other recreationists who will \ncontinue to visit and enjoy this pristine area in the heart of \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13832-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13832-S13833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ASTEROID RESEARCH\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend a group of New \nMexicans who are achieving some phenomenal results. In fact, they're \ncurrently batting .500 and more. If they were baseball players they \nwould be acclaimed on every sports page.\n  But instead of baseball, this group has discovered half of the comets \nthat are currently visible through telescopes. One of their latest \ncomet discoveries may be bright enough to see with binoculars next \nyear. And it's probably safe to guess that the brightest of comets \nattracts an audience well in excess of those watching major league \nbaseball.\n  Instead of baseball bats, they are using a telescope at the north end \nof White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. This Lincoln Near-Earth \nAsteroid Research project is run by Lincoln Laboratory of the \nMassachusetts Institute of technology. A second telescope at the site \nstarted operations in the last week--that may boost their discoveries \nstill further.\n\n[[Page S13833]]\n\n  The project grew out of an Air Force study involving space \nsurveillance. Now space surveillance isn't a new subject, but in this \nproject they're using a new automated system with a highly sensitive \nelectronic camera. It's a great tool for discovering objects that move \nin the heavens, like comets and asteroids. The performance of their \nsystem exceeds any competitor by at least ten times. Today, both the \nAir Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA provide the funding \nfor this project.\n  Their asteroid batting average even exceeds their comet batting \naverage. Since the first telescope started operation in March 1998, the \nproject has accounted for about 70 percent of all the near-Earth \nasteroids that have ever been located. That's especially impressive \nsince astronomers have been searching for such objects for over 60 \nyears.\n  As they find these asteroids, they also project their future path \nthrough the heavens and explore any possibility for an impact with the \nEarth. In the course of their work, they've found four asteroids that \nmight possibly approach Earth--but so far, careful evaluations of their \nprobable future trajectories have shown that each of these objects \nshould miss us. So, while the dinosaurs may have become extinct after \nan asteroid impact, so far our coast looks clear.\n  The project team is headed by Dr. Grant Stokes, a 1977 graduate of \nLos Alamos High School and a New Mexico native. Dr. Eric Pearce directs \nthe team at White Sands. This team has truly revolutionized the art of \nfinding comets and asteroids. I want to commend Dr. Stokes and Dr. \nPearce along with their supporters at the Air Force and NASA. This \nlarge group of New Mexicans deserves the title of the world's best \ncomet and asteroid hunting team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13833-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13833-S13834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE CITY OF BOSTON'S CRUSADE AGAINST CANCER\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncommend the city of Boston's Crusade Against Cancer and I commend our \noutstanding Mayor, Thomas M. Menino, for his leadership on this \nexcellent program. Donald Gudaitis, the chief executive officer of the \nAmerican Cancer Society's New England Division, has called the Crusade \nAgainst Cancer, ``the most visionary public health initiative ever \nundertaken in any city around the prevention and early detection of \ncancer.''\n  Through innovative measures such as giving city employees time off \nfor cancer screenings, Boston's Crusade Against Cancer uses a small \npublic investment to create a large public health payoff. It may well \nserve as a model for communities throughout the nation.\n  Boston's program provides essential preventive care to the city's low \nincome and minority communities, who are hit disproportionately hard by \nthe ravages of cancer. Many members of these communities are neglected \nby HMOs and private insurers and might otherwise never receive a cancer \nscreening.\n  Nearly a quarter of the women using the program's mobile mammography \nvan were receiving a mammogram for the very first time. Since early \ndetection is a critical factor in the successful treatment of cancer, \nthese preventive screenings are literally a lifesaver for many \nBostonians. Boston's program has gained nationwide attention and was \ndescribed in a recent article in the New York Times. I believe the \narticle will be of great interest to all of us in Congress and I ask \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 2, 1999]\n\n             Boston Battles Cancer With a Citywide Mailing\n\n                          (By Carey Goldberg)\n\n       Boston, Nov. 2--Cities often undertake campaigns to fight \n     crime or litter.\n       This city is fighting what health officials call its No. 1 \n     killer: cancer.\n       Over the last few days, every household in Boston, in \n     theory, has been mailed a brochure describing how to prevent \n     cancer and to detect it early if it develop.\n       The quarter-million English-and-Spanish brochures, Boston's \n     largest public health mailing ever, are the flashiest element \n     of the city's ``crusade against cancer,'' but they are only \n     one of many.\n       Boston's municipal employees are allowed to take four hours \n     off each year for cancer screening--a rule that city \n     officials say was the only one of its kind until Springfield, \n     Mass, adopted a similar rule last week.\n       Over the last several months, about 1,600 chemotherapy \n     patients have been given free rides to and from their \n     sessions, thanks to hospitals and taxis participating in the \n     city's crusade.\n       Other cities and states run anti-cancer programs as does \n     the federal government. But overall, said Donald J. Gudaitis, \n     chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society's New \n     England division. ``This is the most visionary public health \n     initiative ever undertaken in any city around prevention and \n     early detection of cancer.''\n       Such a campaign may seem logical at a time when the death \n     rate from heart disease has been dropping and cancer, the \n     nation's No. 2 cause of death, kills more than half a million \n     Americans every year.\n       But Mr. Gudaitis attributed the anticancer campaign in \n     Boston to a particular asset: a personally interested mayor.\n       Mayor Thomas M. Menino's father died of prostate cancer, \n     and the mayor, who does not normally play up his personal \n     life, said in a telephone interview that he saw his father \n     ``go from a big brawny guy to 70 pounds.''\n       ``And you ask yourself, why?'' Mayor Menino added. ``I want \n     to try to help other people out.''\n       In particular, it seems, he wants to help the poor. Boston, \n     like many other cities, has found that cancer death rates are \n     especially high in poor and minority neighborhoods. Patchy \n     health care makes poor people less likely to have checkups \n     for cancer and thus more likely to die from it.\n       More than a year ago, Mayor Menino convened a panel of \n     medical experts and cancer survivors to help decide what to \n     do. The process, which led to the crusade against cancer, is \n     continuing, said John Rich, medical director of the Boston \n     Public Health Commission. But the panel established three \n     initial goals: that all Boston households, receive \n     information on cancer prevention, that all Bostonians receive \n     appropriate screenings and that all cancer patients have \n     transportation to and from treatment sessions.\n       Transportation may seem minor compared with the first two \n     goals but not to chemotherapy patients, said Maureen \n     Sullivan, vice president of the Massachusetts Bay region of \n     the American Cancer Society who is a cancer survivor. It \n     might not be bad getting to chemotherapy sessions, but, Ms. \n     Sullivan added, ``Let me tell you, coming home can be really \n     awful, and not only for you but for everyone else on that bus \n     with you.''\n       Boston has introduced other help on wheels, a mobile \n     mammography van that has been booked solid since it began six \n     months ago. Officials say the city is fighting cancer in \n     small ways as well--supplying sunscreen to its outdoor \n     workers, for example--and in bigger ones: Mayor Menino \n     supported a ban on smoking in Boston restaurants, despite \n     heavy opposition from restaurateurs. The program includes \n     television advertising and a new city agency, the Office of \n     Cancer Prevention.\n       The campaign costs little, Mr. Menino said, perhaps, \n     $100,000 for the mammography van, about $250,000 for the \n     brochures and nothing for the transportation and time off.\n       Asked why Boston is undertaking an anticancer campaign now, \n     when the disease has killed millions for decades, those \n     involved cited two factors: the accumulation of research \n     finding on cancer prevention and widespread disillusionment \n     with the prevention promise offered by health maintenance \n     organizations.\n       ``If we look at the actual synthesis and explosion, if you \n     will, of information on the relationship between life-style \n     factors and cancer in the last 20 years, it really has moved \n     beyond just smoking as a major cause,'' said Dr. Graham \n     Colditz, director of education at the Harvard Center for \n     Cancer Prevention, which is participating in the campaign.\n       Dr. Colditz said the center had determined that at least 50 \n     percent of cancer cases could be prevented through behavioral \n     changes alone. The screenings could also prevent deaths among \n     those whose cancer would be detected early, he said.\n       The brochure advises people to eat a healthy diet, to get \n     at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day, to keep \n     their weight down, to drink less alcohol, to avoid smoking, \n     to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and to protect \n     themselves from the sun.\n       None of that was news to Mary Caulfield, a 58-year-old \n     retired resident of the Dorchester section of Boston. But, \n     Ms. Caulfield said, ``I think a lot of newcomers, foreigners, \n     probably don't understand even things like immunizations.''\n       The Boston anticancer program is impressive, Sandra Mullin, \n     spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Health, said \n     upon hearing it described. New York does not give municipal \n     employees time off for screenings, Ms. Mullin said, though it \n     periodically includes reminders of the need for screenings in \n     employees' paychecks, and it has a program to encourage \n     exercise at lunch.\n       While New York has done no blanket mailing and is not as \n     involved in cancer screening, it does provide cancer \n     information through mobile health vans, Ms. Mullin said. The \n     city focuses some of its other anticancer efforts on \n     antismoking programs and on making sure that managed care \n     plans screen Medicaid patients for cancer.\n\n[[Page S13834]]\n\n       What the Boston campaign will try next remains under \n     discussion. Among some ideas mentioned: persuading private \n     employers to give employees four hours off for cancer \n     screening, making it easier for Bostonians to bicycle or job \n     to work and making programs that help smokers quit available \n     to anyone who wants them.\n       As for immediate results, Mayor Menino said that the four \n     hours off for screening had already led to the early \n     detection of some cancer and that nearly 5 percent of the \n     women who used the mammography van had found suspicious \n     lumps. Nearly one-fourth of those who used the van said the \n     mammogram was their first, the mayor added.\n       For the most part, the campaign is expected to yield only \n     gradual results. Certainly, the immediate effect of the \n     brochure mailing seemed a bit underwhelming: Of more than a \n     dozen people interviewed on the streets of Dorchester, most \n     said they had paid little if any attention to the brochure, \n     although some said they had set it aside to read later.\n       ``Sometimes I'm just too tired to read,'' said Esther \n     Ellis, 72, who nonetheless was having her annual mammogram at \n     a local health center. ``I just leave it to God. God respects \n     my body.''\n       Jose Navarro, a flea market vendor, said he did not recall \n     getting the brochure. But when he read it in Spanish on the \n     spot, he expressed surprise at what he learned.\n       ``Drinking?'' he exclaimed. ``I know it's bad for you, I \n     know it's bad for your liver, but I didn't know it causes \n     cancer.''\n       David Sheets, a 45-year-old friend of Mr. Navarro, said \n     that he had saved the brochure at his South End home to read \n     later but that the idea of cancer ``doesn't bother me yet.''\n       ``My mother died of it, my father died of it,'' Mr. Sheets \n     said. ``It doesn't faze me.''\n       He smokes and refuses to quit, he said. Then, referring to \n     cancer, he added, ``I just think that it won't happen to \n     me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13834-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE MT. BAKER PTA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to applaud \nthe members and volunteers of the Mt. Baker Parent-Teacher Association \nthat have successfully raised over $100,000 for its schools. Mt. Baker \nis a small, rural community just south of the Canadian border that \nlacks a sufficient tax-base to cover the costs of buying new technology \nfor its schools.\n  In an effort to raise funds to purchase up-to-date resources for \ntheir students, volunteers from the PTA opened a small restaurant with \ntheir own time and resources. To date, this venture has provided over \n$100,000 to improve education in Mt. Baker. For that reason, I am \npleased to present one of my Innovation in Education Awards to the Mt. \nBaker PTA.\n  In January of 1989, 20 parents took out a loan and purchased a run-\ndown restaurant booth at the Northwest Washington Fair Grounds. Parents \nand volunteers spent countless hours cleaning and preparing the \nrestaurant for its opening in March of 1989. For the past 10 years, \nvolunteers and parents have worked at hundreds of community events to \nfeed the fairground visitors, raising money that funded new research \nand learning equipment for math and science students, field trips \nacross western Washington, and countless other tools for learning that \nhave enhanced the education at all Mt. Baker schools.\n  The volunteers at the Mt. Baker PTA demonstrate that local educators \nand parents know what their students need to succeed and deserve the \nfreedom and flexibility in the Federal education funds to better \neducate their children.\n  The innovative thinking and hard work of the Mt. Baker community \nteaches its students of the importance of a good education and how a \ncommunity can work together to achieve a common goal. The Mt. Baker PTA \nis an example for all of us to follow. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in commending the people of this community for their hard work \nto improve the education for their children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13834-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13834-S13835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF LUIS ALBERTO ROBLES PADILLA, JR.\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. Luis Robles, who attends Stanford University, where \nI attended Law School, spoke to the crowd of over one hundred people \nwhich included Members of Congress, Hispanic Business Leaders, friends \nof the Hispanic College Fund and family members of the award \nrecipients.\n  Even though Louis is not from my home state of New Mexico, I feel \nthat it is important to recognize the dedication, hard work, and \ncommitment that this young man has undertaken in his academics and in \nhis life despite great adversity. The remarks that Luis made to those \nin attendance that night left the room in utter silence. His remarks, \nand those of the teacher who nominated him for the scholarship, show \nthat nothing in life is unattainable. This young man serves as an \nexample that if you believe in yourself, believe in hard work, and \nbelieve you can achieve your goals, you can do anything and be anyone \nyou want to be.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully ask that the attached statement which \nMr. Robles made to the Sixth Annual Scholarship Awards Dinner and that \nof his teacher, Mr. David Layton, be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The statement follows:\n\n\n                     remarks by Luis Alberto Robles\n\n  I remember the day well . . . a few weeks after weeks after \nThanksgiving in 1986. The gray Seattle morning smelled like drizzle as \nmy father, Luis, and my mother, Maria, escorted me along evergreen-\nlined 8th street, to the school bus stop for the very first time. The \nother children laughed and frolicked. But without knowing English, \nwithout knowing what they said, my parents and I only stared in wonder.\n  Next thing I know the enormous school bus is pulling away, with me on \nboard: frightened and alone. Hot tears streamed down my cheeks. The \nwindow was cold against my nose. My parents smiled worriedly, waved, \nand off I went . . . to Cherry Crest Elementary.\n  I had no idea what the future held.\n  I had no idea what graduation was, let alone college.\n  I had no idea that some day in the distant future I would standing \nhere before you tonight.\n  Good evening.\n  Buenas Tardes.\n  My name is Luis Alberto Robles Padilla, Jr. I am a sophomore majoring \nin Industrial engineering at Stanford University. I feel very \nprivileged to join you tonight, and am honored to be speaking on behalf \non this year's scholarship recipients.\n  On their and my behalf, I would like to offer a heartfelt thanks to \nthe Hispanic College Fund, the corporate sponsors, the Board of \nTrustees, and American Airlines.\n  I would also like to thank the Lockheed Martin Corporation, in \nparticular, for my scholarship. The scholarship is a tremendous help to \nmy family, and I am truly thankful.\n  I would also like to share a part of my story: personal experiences \nthat have shaped my life, ideas that have shaped what I believe, and \npeople that have made me into the person that I am today. I will begin \non December 17th, 1997, my 17th birthday:\n  ``Dr. Johnson. . . . Dr. Johnson. . . .'' As I wearily walked down \nthe artificially lit corridor, I realized someone was paging my \nfather's doctor. I turned and ran towards the intensive care unit that \nI had left only a few minutes ago, towards my terrified mother and \ntoward my father's labored breathing. The sterilized odor of Harrison \nMemorial Hospital overwhelmed me as I raced through a maze of white \nwalls to confront his death.\n  After bolting through heavy metal doors, I saw doctors and nurses \nrushing frantically around the room. I could only hear one sound. It \nfilled the air, was audible above all the commotion, and drowned out \nthe heavy pounding of my heart. The monotonous beep of the monitor \nmeant ``Pappy'' was gone forever.\n  While sitting next to him, a body drained of the warmth and energy I \nhad always known, I focused at the crimson drops that stained the \nyellow linoleum floor and the crisp white sheets; slowly remembering \nwhat a terrible ordeal the past six weeks of hospitalization had been. \nMy life had changed forever since the day I sped through traffic, with \nmy Dad shivering in the back seat next to my worried mother. I was \nscared to death without even knowing that the killer was Leukemia.\n  Although the chemotherapy proceeded well, it also gradually wore my \nfather away. The first side effects were a loss of appetite, \naccompanied by nausea and vomiting. His hair fell out next, and I could \ntell my father's courage was beginning to waver. A look of\n\n[[Page S13835]]\n\npain and anguish had replaced his usual smile, and with each passing \nday, he looked more like my grandfather. It all seemed like a bad \ndream, both frightful and surreal.\n  While packing his belongings, hours after he had passed away, I found \na note intended for me. It was in Father's handwriting; blurry \nscribbles because the medicine made his hands shake. I sat down and \ncried because it said in Spanish, ``ya es tiempo de luchar,'' which \nmeans, ``it is time to take up the struggle.''\n  The poem he wrote to me, titled ``Oda a mi Hijo,'' ``Ode to my Son'' \ngoes like this:\n\n     Quiero cantarte una cancion,\n     (I want to sing you a song)\n     Desde lo mas profundo de mi alma,\n     (From the deepest part of my soul)\n     Brisa suave, que refresca y calma,\n     (Soft breeze that refreshes and soothes)\n     Tu tierra fecunda que riega mi oracion.\n     (Your fertile soil that showers my prayer)\n\n     El agua se hizo luz y dio una planta,\n     (The water turned to light and created a plant)\n     La tierra hecha vida, dio on rosal con un boton,\n     (The soil transformed into life and bore a rose in full \n           blossom)\n     Carne de dos almas hecha con amor,\n     (Flesh from two souls, made with love)\n     Fue la suave brisa, que refresca y canta.\n     (It was the soft breeze that refreshes and sings)\n\n     Con el correr de los anos, pajaro se volvio,\n     (As the years passed, it transformed into a bird)\n     Dejar el nido quiere, hace el intento de volar,\n     (Yearning to leave the nest, it attempts to fly)\n     La brisa, el amor, el cielo derramo,\n     (The breeze, the love, the heavens overflowed)\n     El destino esta en tus manos, ya es tiempo de luchar.\n     (Destiny is in your hands, its time to take up the struggle)\n\n  I find it hard to understand Dad's absence, and that he left exactly \non my seventeenth birthday. But though I miss him everyday, I am \ngrateful for all the time we spent together and everything my father \ntaught me. Through my family's Mexican restaurant, he showed me what \nHispanic business leadership is: hard work, dedication, and most \nimportantly, helping others and the community.\n  My father pointed me in the right direction, and made me believe in \nmyself. There is good in this beautiful world, and life will always \nreceive my best effort. Rather than cause embarrassment, my heritage \nwill always instill pride within me, and I will succeed. I know he is \nproud of me.\n  Ultimately, by succeeding I hope to influence other Hispanics. When I \nlook at many of my Hispanic peers, I see them giving up on school, \ngiving up bright futures, and giving up their dreams. Their \nintellectual capacity has nothing to do with it, and the issue is \ncomplicated, yet they also do not have the support or the \nopportunities.\n  At this point, I would like to thank my parents for their unending \nlove, my family for their constant encouragement, and all of my friends \nfor their help and support. I would also like to thank Mr. Paul Torno, \nwho worked with me even after retiring. Special thanks to Mr. David \nLayton . . . . even though I lost my father, a great man and teacher, I \nam lucky to have found another great teacher, another great man. \nFinally, I thank my mother, an incredibly brave and strong woman. Most \nof all, however, I thank God all the blessings.\n  I and the other scholarship recipients, as well as countless other \nHispanics, are yearning to fly . . . trying to fly . . . learning to \nfly . . .\n  Once again, I would like to thank the Hispanic College Fund, and its \nsponsors.\n  We want to demonstrate that anything is possible by working hard and \nfollowing our dreams.\n  We want to see more Hispanics graduating from high school and \ncollege.\n  We want to have more Hispanics in business and government positions.\n  We want to truly thank all of you for helping us strive towards our \ngoals.\n  Thank you and good night.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 25, 1999.\n       To whom it may concern, Luis Robles has asked me to \n     recommend him for acceptance for your scholarship. Few tasks \n     will be as easy for me to do. I have known him as a student \n     for two years in both honors history and honors English \n     classes so I feel quite qualified to speak about his \n     application.\n       It is impossible for me to recommend Luis without telling \n     his story first. No other student in my 19 years of teaching \n     has accomplished more with such adversity. An only child of \n     immigrants from Mexico, Luis learned more than values from \n     his parents; he learned who he was, who he could become, and \n     what he could give back to his community. His father ran a \n     small restaurant on our island and hired family and friends \n     who needed work; but to keep dreams alive he insisted they go \n     to night school and paid their tuition if they maintained a \n     B. This pride and dignity wrapped in such strong humor are \n     his legacy. Tragically last year his father died of Leukemia \n     in his son's arms on his son's 17th birthday. As the only one \n     who spoke clear English, Luis sold the restaurant, managed \n     his mother's accounts, supported her till she finished her AA \n     degree, and found work at the local hospital.\n       His commute to Bainbridge is 60-80 minutes each way. But he \n     knew what he wanted--to be blunt we run one of the hardest \n     programs in the state. He has aced every honors or AP course \n     we offer. His maturity is beyond his years. He seeks out \n     criticism and he listens and grows with suggestions. \n     Specifically he has worked hard on his writing knowing that \n     here his voice needs to be clear and purposeful. In both \n     independent and group projects, Luis has had the discipline \n     and creativity to make the connections between ideas, events, \n     and more importantly to things in his own life. His work has \n     shown original thought and a true conviction to understand \n     the complications of individuals struggling to find \n     meaningful solutions to their problems. Luis embodies the \n     belief that this is his life, his chance to make a \n     difference, his chance to give back far more than he takes. \n     Make no mistake, he will take advantage of all you offer.\n       Luis has shared with my family the poetry his father wrote \n     and the poems he has now written back. It is his genuineness \n     that I wish to commend most. His 4.0 G.P.A. has been matched, \n     the high marks on the SAT equaled, but none have his vision.\n       It should be obvious how strongly I feel about Luis; his \n     heart separates him from the rest. If you have the chance to \n     talk with him, you will understand.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Layton,\n     Faculty, Honors Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13835-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING ANNE KANTEN\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today to say a few words \nabout a remarkable farm leader and humanitarian, Anne Kanten.\n  Anne has served for 18 years on the board of directors of the Farmers \nLegal Action Group (F.L.A.G.), a non-profit law firm based in St. Paul, \nMinnesota, and dedicated to helping family farmers obtain economic and \nsocial justice. I salute Anne Kanten for her enlightened guidance to \nF.L.A.G. during her years as a director and her years on the board. But \nfar more than that, I want to take this moment to acknowledge Anne \nKanten's lifetime of service to others.\n  Anne served as Minnesota's Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture and as \nChief Administrator of the Minnesota Farm Advocate Program during the \nyears of farm crisis in the 1980's. She was a founding member of the \nAmerican Agriculture Movement who, with her husband Chuck and son Kent, \nhelped plan and carry out the Washington, DC Tractorcade of 1979. In \naddition, Anne has been a long time spokesperson for stewardship of the \nland and its people through her various leadership roles in her church.\n  Her efforts to achieve justice for farm families continue to this \nday.\n  Anne Kanten grew up on an Iowa farm, the daughter of immigrants who \ncame to our country in pursuit of a better life. By her own admission, \nshe longed to escape the 1930's Depression of her rural childhood. \nAfter attending college and becoming a teacher, Anne became re-\nconnected to the land when she married Chuck Kanten, a young farmer \nfrom Milan, Minnesota. Anne and Chuck Kanten represent the best of \nAmerican Life. They raised a wonderful family on their farm home. They \nbelieve strongly in giving of themselves.\n  I consider myself honored and fortunate to count Anne Kanten as my \nfriend. I ask the Senate today to join me in recognizing Anne Kanten \nfor her years of service to the Farmers Legal Action Group and to farm \nfamilies everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13835-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13835-S13836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DELAWARE WELL REPRESENTED AT AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute four Delaware \ngolfers who continue to make the citizens of my State proud.\n  Last June, Margaret Butler, Mary Kaczorowski, Joyce Ruddick and Alice \nWooldridge played in and won the\n\n[[Page S13836]]\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Golf Championship at Maple Dale Country Club in \nDover, Delaware. They then advanced to the Mid-Atlantic Championship at \nThe Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia and won the Delaware State Title \nin Division 3. And on December 3rd and 4th, they will be representing \nDelaware and looking to continue their winning ways at the P.G.A. West \nin LaQuinta, California.\n  Having talked with members of this foursome on a few occasions, it is \nclear to me that these women take their golf quite seriously. Together, \nthey embody the spirit of competition and sportsmanship and are fine \nexamples of personal achievement and Delaware pride. But most \nimportantly, these women realize that their participation in this event \nhelps to raise essential funding for cancer research and programs. \nMillions of Americans suffer from cancer-related illnesses, and events \nlike these give us all hope for finding a cure.\n  While I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased in my viewpoint, I \nalso know a group of champions when I see them. I, among many, believe \nthat talent is often overrated and that character is the true \ndetermining factor for any success one has in life.\n  I have seen these women drive a golf ball and I can confidently say \nthat both talent and character reign supreme for this team. It is \ntherefore my pleasure to extend to them my deep expression of thanks \nfor having represented Delaware so well this year and, as they prepare \nfor their biggest challenge to date, to wish them continued success in \nthe National tournament.\n  We in Delaware are very proud of these four women, and we will be \nrooting for them!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13836-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN HONOR OF REVEREND MONSIGNOR ANDREW P. LANDI\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Reverend \nMonsignor Andrew P. Landi, a son of New York and internationally known \nhumanitarian, who was taken from us this past September. He was 92.\n  Monsignor Landi was the retired assistant executive director and of \nCatholic Relief Services in New York City from 1966 to 1979. Upon of \nhis retirement he was named assistant treasurer, a position he held \nuntil the time of his death. Monsignor devoted himself to the service \nof the poor and disposed throughout the world regardless of race, \ncreed, or nationality.\n  Catholic Relief Services was founded in 1943 by the Catholic Bishops \nof the United States to alleviate suffering by removing its causes and \npromoting social justice beyond our boarders. Their mission is to aid \nin the development of people by fostering charity and justice \nthroughout the world. Monsignor Landi's devotion to this mission was \nceaseless.\n  At a time when we are increasingly egocentric, we would do well to \nremember a man whose ministry to the disadvantaged was distinguished as \na no other for faithful and untiring service. I wish to highlight the \ncentral role he played as a petitioner for overseas relief activities \nto numerous Federal agencies and Congress. He met with nearly every \nPope since Pope Pius XII and counted Mother Teresa among his friends.\n  This champion of the downtrodden was sent to Rome in 1944 to minister \nto the victims of World War II. He spent the next two decades providing \nhaven to refuges of civil strife and natural disasters. He was named \nthe Regional Director of the Catholic Relief Services for Europe, the \nMiddle East, and North Africa in 1962.\n  Monsignor Landi began his vocation as a parish priest at Our Lady of \nthe Scapular and St. Stephen's Church in Manhattan in 1934. St. \nStephens was at one time the largest Catholic parish in New York City. \nIt is a special New York treasure as it contains several works by 19th \ncentury Italian Painter Constantino Brumidi who is best know for having \ndone much of the artwork on display in the United States Capitol.\n  In 1939, Monsignor Landi became the associate director of Catholic \nCharities in Brooklyn, NY. As I recently noted, Catholic Charities of \nthe Brooklyn-Queens Diocese is the largest Roman Catholic human \nservices agency in the nation. Perhaps on earth.\n  One of seven children orphaned after the death of their mother in \n1913, he focused his mission toward young people. His benevolence \ntoward the troubled youth of Brooklyn was exceptional.\n  During Monsignor Landi's 65 years in the priesthood he received \nnumerous honors from several governments and organizations. He was \nhonored by our own New York State Assembly which issued a citation on \nthe his 90th birthday in recognition his humanitarian efforts.\n  In closing I would like to express my deep gratitude to Monsignor \nLandi for his life long commitment to ending social injustice \nespecially toward children living in poverty. His distinguished \ndevotion to God and his fellow man is a model to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13836-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRAGEDY IN ARMENIA\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nsorrow at last week's tragedy in the Armenian National Parliament. \nPrime Minister Sarkissian, Speaker Demirchian, and six other \nlegislators were killed. While we may never know what motivated the \ngunmen to storm the building, we do know that a single act of terror \nwas directed against individuals who were attempting to build and \nstrengthen Armenia's democratic institutions. Armenia has made positive \nmovement toward widespread democracy and free markets, and the leaders \nwho lost their lives had played important roles in these reforms. As a \nresult, this tragedy is truly a great loss for the Armenian people. For \nthis reason, I have joined Senator Abraham in introducing a resolution \ncondemning the incident.\n  After months of progress on a range of issues, from the rule of law, \nto Nagorno-Karabakh, to fighting corruption, Armenia is faced with a \nhuge obstacle to overcome. Just this past week, Armenia held local \nelections nation-wide that were deemed free and fair by independent \nobservers. These elections were not without minor irregularities, but \nthe overall impact has been to reaffirm and further strengthen the \ncommitment of the Armenian people to an open election process.\n  On the complex issue of peace in Nagorno-Karabakh, significant \nprogress has been made recently. Bilateral meetings between President \nKocharian and President Aliyev have been frequent and intensive in \nresponse to our encouragement for greater results. Just hours before \nthe attack, Prime Minister Sarkissian had met with President Kocharian \nand Deputy Secretary of State Talbott to discuss the peace process. \nClearly, it will be difficult for Armenia to move forward without \nSarkissian's presence--difficult, but not impossible.\n  Given the tremendous amount of progress Armenia has made since \ndeclaring independence from the Soviet Union, I am confident that the \nArmenian people will move past this tragic event and continue to build \nupon their successes. But the key to doing so is ongoing support from \nthe United States. Together, our two countries have built strong ties, \nfocusing upon a prosperous, secure and democratic future. It is \ncritical that, in the midst of such overpowering grief, we renew our \nsupport for the people of Armenia and their leaders. As they continue \nto build upon the principles that the victims had worked to fulfill, \nthe people of Armenia should know that the United States supports their \nefforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending this message to \nthe Armenian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13836-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13836-S13837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. PERCY G. HARRIS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to Dr. Percy G. Harris, a distinguished Iowan from Cedar \nRapids who is retiring after forty years of practicing family medicine. \nHis biography is truly a great American story.\n  Dr. Harris was born into a poor family in Mississippi in 1927. He was \norphaned as a teenager and moved to Waterloo, Iowa to live with his \naunt. High school was a struggle for Percy Harris, but he finally \nreceived his diploma at the age of 19. After that, he was determined to \nmake something of his life, and set his sights on becoming a doctor. He \nwas admitted to medical school at Howard University in Washington, DC. \nHe paid his way by working as an elevator operator and janitor. After \nhe received his medical degree, Dr. Harris returned to Cedar Rapids, \nIowa to open a family practice.\n\n[[Page S13837]]\n\n  His practice grew and flourished over four decades. His patients \ncredit him with the old-fashioned virtue of patience and say he is \nalways willing to spend extra time caring for them. He believes in \ngiving back and is active in the community as a civil rights leader and \nas a volunteer athletic doctor for Jefferson High School.\n  Percy Harris's life is a list of firsts. He was the first African-\nAmerican to hold an internship at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids. \nHe served as Linn County, Iowa's first and only medical examiner. In \n1977, Governor Robert Ray appointed him to the Iowa Board of Regents \nwhere he served two terms as the Board's first African-American member.\n  Dr. Harris encountered adversity along the way, but he chose to view \nit as a challenge rather than an obstacle. In 1961, he and his wife, \nLileah, decided to build a home for their growing family. They set \ntheir sights on a piece of property in one of Cedar Rapids' all white \nneighborhoods. The neighbors were up in arms, but Percy and Lileah \nHarris persisted and eventually purchased the property in a dispute \nthat gained national attention. They built their family home on the \nproperty and raised 12 fine children, all of whom are now grown and \nsuccessful in their own right.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Harris is one in a long American tradition of \nmedical practitioners who put patients before profits, who lead by \nexample, and who dedicate themselves to the well-being of humankind, \nfrom their community to their nation. I congratulate him on his many \nachievements and wish him well in all future endeavors. I know wherever \nhe chooses to put his many talents, he will leave his mark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13837-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF TED WINTER'S 50TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

Friends and family will be \ngathering at the American Legion in Fulda, Minnesota, to honor this \nvery good and decent man.\n  It is very appropriate that this year his birthday falls so close to \nThanksgiving because as a Minnesotan I am very thankful that Ted so \nably represents the people of Southwestern Minnesota in the State \nLegislature; I am thankful that Ted continues to be a strong voice for \nthose struggling to maintain their family farms; I am thankful that Ted \nstruggles daily to ensure the vitality of our rural communities and \nthat he is committed to a vision of Minnesota that is rich and diverse.\n  In the last few years, Ted has been the driving force behind uniting \nMidwest State Legislators in calling for a change in federal farm \npolicy. He has been central in calling attention to the devastating \neffect the concentration of power in agriculture is having on family \nfarmers. Day in and day out, Ted spends time away from his own farm to \nwork with farm organizations and other farmers to come up with ways \nthat family farmers can survive to farm another day. He drives \nthroughout the state to make sure that any meeting discussing the \nfuture of Minnesota includes a discussion about the future of family \nfarms and rural communities.\n  I am pleased to be able to speak today to honor my friend, Ted \nWinter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13837-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING KAREN LEACH\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nindividual who has dedicated her life to the education of our young \npeople. Karen Leach of Johnston, Rhode Island, is retiring from the \nProvidence School Department after nearly thirty years of dedicated \nservice.\n  Since Karen graduated from Rhode Island College in 1969 with a \nBachelor's Degree in Elementary and Special Education, she has received \nMasters of Education Degrees in both Elementary Education and in \nAdministration for Elementary and Middle Schools. She has also \nfurthered her professional development by achieving certification in \nmany areas.\n  The capital of Rhode Island, Providence is at the heart of our \nstate's urban center and during her career, Karen has been assigned to \nseveral schools in the District. Karen began her long and accomplished \ncareer as a teacher and dedicated her efforts toward Special Education. \nDuring her tenure, the field of education has seen tremendous change--\nfrom curriculum, to technology, to teaching methods and to \nadministrative practices. Throughout nearly three decades of service, \nKaren has brought efficiency, expertise and professionalism to her many \nchallenging assignments.\n  In 1988, Karen was named Supervisor of Elementary/Pre-School \nEducation for the Providence School Department and in 1992, she became \nPrincipal of the Sackett Street Elementary School and the Reservoir \nAvenue Elementary School. Since the 1992-1993 school year, she has been \nPrincipal of the Sackett Street Elementary School and she is retiring \nfrom her present administration position as Interim Acting \nSuperintendent of Teaching and Learning.\n  Karen Leach is a person of great integrity, compassion and \ninitiative. She is accomplished and well respected for her many \ncontributions to the Providence School System. She has made a positive \nimpact on the quality of education, and in the lives of students, \nespecially those with special needs. Most recently, Karen's leadership \nas a Principal and as an Administrator has left a lasting mark on the \nCity of Providence.\n  So many young people have had their lives enriched by one person's \nefforts. Karen Leach's commitment and her tangible accomplishments \nclearly demonstrate that an investment in education is indeed an \ninvestment in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Karen \nLeach for her commitment to educational excellence and for her efforts \nto improve the overall quality of our education system.

Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the desk \nsubmitted by Senators Frist, Jeffords, and Kennedy. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2506.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, ten years ago, Congress created the \nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research to help us deal more \neffectively with critical national priorities in health care and \nresearch. I introduced the legislation with Senator Hatch, and it \npassed as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. It was \nbased on a precursor organization--the National Center for Health \nServices Research--that was created by President Lyndon Johnson. The \nAgency's focus is primarily on health services research and other \ncutting edge methods to improve clinical practice. In its first decade, \nthe Agency has proven its worth time and again by providing valuable \ninformation to Congress, health professionals, patients, businesses, \nand many others.\n  This reauthorization begins a new chapter for the Agency. New \nresponsibilities come with its new name, the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality. While the Agency's intramural and extramural \nresearch will remain focused on general outcomes research and \nassessments of the how well the nation is doing with respect to \ncoverage and provision of health care, there will also be increased \nactivity on research to monitor and improve the quality of care.\n  The Agency will serve an increasingly important role in the nation's \neffort to measure and improve the quality of health care, and to expand \naccess to health insurance and health care. Research supported by the \nAgency provides critical information about the use, cost and quality of \nhealth services. As the health care market evolves, these data are \nnecessary for informed decisions to help patients, providers, \nemployers, government administrators, and policymakers. While the \nAgency is not directly involved in making policy, its research and \nexpertise provide informed guidance to those who are. This legislation \nwill help the Agency maintain and expand its efforts to encourage \npublic-private partnerships at every level of the health care system.\n  The American people deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars \nare buying high-quality care. They want to know, as they are \nvoluntarily or involuntarily enrolled in managed care plans, that the \nquality of care they receive is improving, not declining. Employers \ndeserve to know that their investments in health benefits lead to \nhealthier employees. As a result of the Agency's work, more and more \nAmericans will be able to make the right decisions about their health \ncare.\n  The Agency also provides an important link between advances in \nmedical research and technology, and adoption of these practices by the \npublic and private sectors. The research conducted and supported by the \nAgency helps identify erroneous denials of treatment, and informs the \nnation about treatments that are the most effective or have the highest \nquality. While the Agency is not in the business of developing or \npromoting practice guidelines, its recommendations and research \nfindings lead to significant savings for patients, providers, health \nplans, and taxpayers, while simultaneously improving the quality of \ncare.\n  For example, if the Agency's recommendations were applied to even 20 \npercent of patients, the nation could save hundreds of millions of \ndollars annually--ranging from $8.5 million for enhanced prenatal care \nfor diabetic women to $130 million for therapies that prevent stroke. \nWe should do all we can to see that decision-making on health care is \nguided by the best available scientific information. The Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality will to help us achieve that goal.\n  The reauthorization of the Agency also provides an opportunity to \nexpand research on health care for those with special needs. Our \nsuccess in treating these patients is an important measure of the \noverall effectiveness of the nation's health care system. More needs to \nbe done to evaluate how well our system treats those who need the most, \nand often the most complex, services. Persons with disabilities are \noften underrepresented in health services research. Assessing how well \nour fragmented system cares for a person with mental retardation or \nspina bifida or parapalegia or a person nearing the end-of-life will \nenable us to assess where better care can lead to both a higher quality \nof life and significant savings.\n  Reliable information about medical technology is an essential \ncomponent of providing high quality health care to all Americans at a \nreasonable cost. It is especially important for Congress to be able to \ncompare and understand the effectiveness of different technologies. For \nthis reason, I was a strong supporter of the Congressional Office of \nTechnology Assessment, which evaluated technologies in a wide range of\n\n[[Page S13844]]\n\nscientific disciplines and provided a great deal of useful information \nto Congress before its funding was cut off in 1995. Fortunately, the \nAgency is fulfilling this essential role in the area of health care, \nand its mission is now more important than ever.\n  The ongoing biomedical revolution is bringing extraordinary benefits \nto our society. The next century may well be the century of life \nsciences. Every day, we hear about new medical procedures and \ntechnologies. To fulfill their promise, the quality and effectiveness \nof new procedures and technologies must be carefully evaluated. The \nAgency is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge, and to provide \nimportant information about the value and effectiveness of existing \nprocedures and therapies.\n  The assessment reports prepared by the Agency are based on sound \nscientific data. Expanding access to the Agency's findings is an \nimportant step toward improving the overall quality of health care for \nthe nation. We need to do all we can to see that the extraordinary \ndiscoveries being made in biomedical research are brought as quickly as \npossible to the bedside of the patient.\n  This reauthorization puts a new face on the Agency and refocuses and \nrefines its functions. Adequate funding for the Agency is essential, \nand I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committees and \nthe Administration to achieve these needed and wise investments in \nbetter health care for all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are witnessing today \nthe passage of legislation that is critical to improving the quality of \nhealth care in this country. The ``Healthcare Research and Quality Act \nof 1999,'' which I introduced on March 10, 1999, will significantly \nincrease our federal investment in health care research and science-\nbased evidence to improve the quality of patient care.\n  The health care system is a dramatically different system today than \na decade ago when the Congress established the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy and Research. The financing and delivery of health care has \nchanged as we have moved to more complex systems such as managed care. \nAt the same time, there has been an explosion of new medical \ninformation stemming from our biomedical research advances. As a \nresult, patients and providers face increased difficulty in tracking \nand understanding the latest scientific findings.\n  As we have seen in the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, \nissues regarding the quality and appropriate use of health care \nservices is a significant public policy concern. Thus, I felt it was \nimportant to include S. 580 in the Patients' Bill of Rights Act that \npassed the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on March \n18, 1999, and subsequently passed the Senate on July 15, 1999. As one \nof the conferees on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in an effort to improve the quality of \nhealth care delivered in this country by passing strong patient \nprotection legislation next year. However, as we have been working on \nthe legislation regarding AHCPR for quite some time--I introduced the \nfirst version of the bill, S. 2208, on June 23, 1998--I felt strongly \nthat we pass the legislation reauthorizing the agency this year.\n  S. 580 reauthorizes the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research \nfor fiscal years 2000-2005, renames the agency the ``Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality,'' and refocuses the agency's mission \nto become the focal point for supporting federal health care research \nand quality improvement activities.\n  The new Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will: promote \nquality by sharing information regarding medical advances; build \npublic-private partnerships to advance and share true quality measures; \nreport annually on the state of quality, and cost, of the nation's \nhealthcare; aggressively support improved information systems for \nhealth quality; support primary care research, and address issues of \naccess in underserved areas and among priority populations; facilitate \ninnovation in patient care with streamlined evaluation and assessment \nof new technologies; and coordinate quality improvement efforts of the \nfederal government to avoid disjointed, uncoordinated, or duplicative \nefforts.\n  AHCPR fills a vital federal role by investing in health services \nresearch to ensure we reap the full rewards of our investment in basic \nand biomedical research. AHCPR takes these medical advances and helps \nus understand how to best utilize these advances in daily clinical \npractice. The Agency has demonstrated their ability to close this gap \nbetween basic research and clinical practice.\n  I believe the Agency can truly make a difference in improving health \ncare quality in this country. The work of the Agency fills a crucial \nneed by translating advances in medicine into what works for me, as a \nphysician, in my daily practice. I think these answers will help us \naddress some of the critical issues raised in the patient protection or \nquality health care debate. I also believe the work of the Agency is \nessential for improving the long term stability of the Medicare program \nand improving the health care system in general by providing the tools \nwe need to assess and improve health care quality.\n  I would also like to point out that the legislation we are passing \ntoday builds upon the good work of our House companion bill, H.R. 2506, \nintroduced and passed by my colleagues Representatives Bilirakis, \nBliley, Dingell, and Brown. The bill we are considering today, S. 580, \nhas been modified to reflect agreement between the authorizing \ncommittees on the House and Senate passed versions of the bill. I will \nnot list all of the changes we have made, but I would like to highlight \na few.\n  First, I am pleased that our bill has an increased emphasis on \nresearch regarding the delivery of health care in inner city and rural \nareas and of health care issues for priority populations including low-\nincome groups, minority groups, women, children, the elderly, and \nindividuals with special health care needs including individuals with \ndisabilities and individuals who need chronic care or end-of-life \nhealth care. The legislation will ensure that individuals with special \nhealth care needs will be addressed throughout the research portfolio \nof the Agency.\n  A second provision included in the bill which I believe is extremely \nimportant for improving the health of our nation's children is the \nauthorization to provide support for payments to children's hospitals \nfor graduate medical education programs. The bill will provide funding \nto the 59 freestanding children's hospital across the country that do \nnot receive any GME funds today. These 59 hospitals represent over 20% \nof the total number of children's hospitals in the U.S. and they train \nnearly 30% of the nation's pediatricians, about 50% of all pediatric \nspecialists, and over 65% of all pediatric specialists. I believe this \nis a strong addition to our bill which will ensure the training of \npediatric physicians to improve the quality of health care for our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would not have come to fruition \nwithout the contributions of many individuals. I would like to take \nthis moment to express my gratitude to Senator Nickles and the entire \nHealth Care Quality Task Force for making this bill a legislative \npriority. I would also like to thank Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, \nand all the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \ncommittee who helped develop the legislation. The Administration and \nthe Agency have been enormously helpful in providing their technical \nexpertise as we rewrote the current statute, and I would especially \nlike to thank Dr. John Eisenberg and Larry Patton for their tremendous \ncontributions. Finally, I would like to thank my staff for their work \non the bill, Andrew Balas, Susan Ramthun, and Anne Phelps. I look \nforward to working with my House colleagues and President Clinton to \nwitness the enactment of S. 580 into law this year which will greatly \nimprove the quality of health care for all Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks an important landmark in our \nefforts to improve children's health. We are taking the first step \ntoward ensuring that the nation's children's hospitals have the support \nthey need to continue to train physicians to care for children.\n\n[[Page S13845]]\n\n  Less than one percent of the nation's hospitals are independent \nchildren's hospitals. Yet these hospitals train 30 percent of all \npediatricians. These freestanding children's hospitals also train more \nthan half of the country's pediatric specialists--the physicians who \ncare for children with cancer, asthma, diabetes and many other chronic \ndiseases and special needs.\n  In addition to their teaching responsibilities, they care for \nuninsured children, conduct pediatric research, and provide state-of-\nthe-art specialty care for children in all parts of the nation. The \nservices they provide and the activities they conduct are \nindispensable. When a child has a rare disease or complicated \ncondition, children's hospitals are the hospitals of choice.\n  In Massachusetts, Boston Children's Hospital provides excellent care \nand conducts needed pediatric research and training. It provides the \nhighest quality of care for sick or disabled children from \nMassachusetts, New England and the world. It is a national resource. \nThe primary care and specialist physicians it trains serve in countless \ncommunities in Massachusetts and throughout the country. Boston \nChildren's Hospital has been recognized as a world-class institution. \nResearchers at the hospital continue to offer new hope for children and \nadults, as they break new ground in battles to fight pediatric \ndiseases. For example, Dr. Judah Folkman has developed two powerful \nagents that show great promise in the war on cancer. These agents--\nangiostatin and endostatin--have been shown to shrink cancerous tumors \nin animals. Clinical trials are now underway to test the effectiveness \nof bladder tissue grown in a laboratory, and to treat high-risk heart \npatients with a tiny device that can close holes in the heart without \ninvasive surgery.\n  These advances are the result of the teaching hospital environment \nthat is the heart of the mission of Boston Children's Hospital. Senior \nclinicians and scientists work with new doctors in training. The \ninterns, residents and fellows who train at Boston Children's Hospital \nand other children's hospitals are the pediatricians, pediatric \nspecialists and pediatric researchers of tomorrow. The federal \ngovernment should invest in their training, just as we have invested in \nthe training of physicians who care for adults. The benefits to the \nnation are immeasurable.\n  In general, graduate medical education activities are supported \nthrough Medicare. However, because children's hospitals treat very few \nMedicare patients, they receive almost no federal support to train \nphysicians. In fact, they receive less than 1/200th per resident \ncompared to other teaching hospitals. The lack of federal support makes \nno sense. It unintentionally penalizes children's hospitals, and we \nneed to correct this problem as soon as possible.\n  The legislation accompanying the reauthorization of the Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research authorizes a new discretionary program \nto provide support for pediatric graduate medical education. It \nauthorizes the funding necessary to provide adequate support--$280 \nmillion in FY 2000 and $285 million in FY 2001. But this authorization \nis just a beginning. We need to continue to work together this year and \nnext year to ensure that adequate funds are appropriated for this \nimportant new program to succeed.\n  Adequate and stable funding for pediatric GME activities can best be \nachieved by a permanent mandatory program. The Senate Finance Committee \nhas agreed to hold a hearing on this important issue next year, and I \nhope action will quickly follow. Senator Bob Kerrey and I have \nintroduced legislation that will create a mandatory program. It has \nbroad bipartisan support in the Senate. Forty senators, evenly divided \namong Democrats and Republicans, favor this approach, and I am \nconfident that we will prevail in the end.\n  However, this year we have an opportunity to begin to address this \nimportant children's health issue. Today's authorization lays the \ngroundwork for a downpayment in the appropriations for FY2000. The \nPresident's budget proposed $40 million for pediatric graduate medical \neducation. The Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations \nconference bill includes $20 million for this program. Congress should \nfollow the President's lead and provide at least $40 million for next \nyear, while Congress pursues full funding through a long-term solution.\n  It is an honor to support Boston Children's Hospital and other \nchildren's hospitals across the country as they strive to meet the \nhealth needs of the nation's children. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in the House and Senate on this important issue in the \ncoming year.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment be agreed \nto, the bill be read a third time and passed as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The substitute amendment (No. 2506) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 580), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nedition of the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13845-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13845-S13861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               YOUTH DRUG AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Senator Frist has an amendment at the desk. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. Frist, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2507.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the United States Senate \nwill pass today, S. 976, the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services \nAct,'' which I introduced on May 6, 1999. This action follows the \noverwhelming endorsement of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, which passed this bill by a vote of 17 to 1 on July 28, \n1999.\n  S. 976 represents a comprehensive attempt to address the tragedy of \nincreasing drug use by our children. The 1998 National Household Survey \non Drug Abuse, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA) estimated that nearly 9.9 percent of \n12-17 year olds used drugs in the past month, which is dramatically \nhigher that the 1992 rate of 5.3 percent. An estimated 8.3 percent of \n12 to 17 year olds have used marijuana in the past month and nearly a \nquarter of our 8th graders and about half of all high school seniors \nhave tried marijuana.\n  Let us not forget about the drug of choice for our youth and \nadolescents, alcohol. Although the legal drinking age is 21 in all \nStates, SAMHSA reports that more than 50 percent of young adults age \neighteen to twenty are consuming alcohol and more than 25 percent \nreport having five or more drinks at one time during the past month.\n  There are many factors for this increase in youth substance abuse, \nbut the factor that I, as a father, am most concerned with is the \noverall decline of the disapproval of drug use and the decline of the \nperception of the risk of drug use among our youth.\n  To help address this problem, the ``Youth Drug'' bill reauthorizes \nand improves SAMHSA by placing a renewed focus on youth and adolescent \nsubstance abuse and mental health services, while providing greater \nflexibility for States and new accountability in the use of funds based \non performance.\n  SAMHSA, formerly known as the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health \nServices Administration (ADAMHA) was created in 1992 by the Public Law \n102-321, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. SAMHSA's purpose is to assist \nStates in addressing the importance of reducing the incidence of \nsubstance abuse and mental illness by supporting programs for \nprevention and treatment. SAMHSA provides funds to States for alcohol \nand drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, and \nmental health services through the Substance Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grants.\n  SAMHSA's block grants are a major portion of this nation's response \nto substance abuse and mental health service needs, accounting for 40 \npercent and 15 percent respectively of all substance abuse and \ncommunity mental health services funding in the States. In my own State \nof Tennessee, SAMHSA provides over 70 percent of overall funding for \nthe Tennessee Department of Health's Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nServices, which is headed by Dr. Stephanie Perry.\n  Last year Tennessee received over $25 million from the Substance \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to spend on treatment and \nprevention activities. With this funding the Tennessee Bureau of \nAlcohol and Drug\n\n[[Page S13856]]\n\nAbuse Services provides funding to community-based programs that offer \na wide range of services throughout the State. In all, the block grant \nfunds provided under this bill permits nearly 6,500 Tennesseans to \nreceive the substance abuse treatment they desperately need.\n  Today, we in part finish an effort in the Senate that began several \nyears ago to reform and improve our Nation's substance abuse and mental \nhealth services. While working on this effort, I have targeted six main \ngoals which I am pleased to report has been accomplished by this \nlegislation. These goals include: promoting State flexibility in block \ngrant and discretionary funding by eliminating or stripping back the \nnumerous outdated or unneeded requirements which Congress has mandated \non the States in their expenditure of Federal block grant and \ndiscretionary funds; ensuring accountability for the expenditure of \nFederal funds by beginning the process of moving away from the \ninefficiency of a system based on expenditure of funds to a performance \nbased system determined in consultation with the States and based upon \nStates' needs; developing and supporting youth and adolescent substance \nabuse prevention and treatment initiatives by including provisions to \nprovide substance abuse treatment services and early intervention \nsubstance abuse services for children and adolescents; developing and \nsupporting mental health initiatives that are designed to prevent and \nrespond to incidents of teen violence by authorizing provisions that \nwill assist local communities in developing ways to treat violent youth \nand minimize outbreaks of youth violence by forming partnerships among \nthe schools, law enforcement and mental health services; ensuring the \navailability of Federal funding for substance abuse or mental health \nemergencies by giving the Secretary the authority to use up to 3 \npercent of discretionary funding to respond to substance abuse or \nmental health emergencies, such as an outbreak of methamphetamine \nactivity, without having to go through the peer review process which \nadds countless weeks and months to the agency's ability to respond; and \nsupporting programs targeted for the homeless in treating mental health \nand substance abuse by reauthorizing programs which develop and expand \nmental health and substance abuse treatment services for homeless \nindividuals, including outreach, screening and treatment, habilitation \nand rehabilitation to homeless individuals suffering from substance \nabuse or mental illness.\n  In addition to meeting these six goals, the bill that the Senate \npassed today addresses several additional important substance abuse and \nmental health issues.\n  S. 976 addresses the very crucial issue of how to treat individuals \nwith a co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorder. There \nhas been considerable debate on how to treat these individuals, and I \nam pleased that the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug \nAbuse Directors and the National Association of State Mental Health \nProgram Directors reached a consensus on this issue. This agreement \nincludes language which acknowledges that both substance abuse and \nmental health block grant funds can be used to treat individuals with \nco-occurring disorders as long as the funds used can be tracked to show \nthat substance abuse dollars were used for substance abuse services and \nmental health dollars were used for mental health services.\n  Another very important issue that is addressed in S. 976 is the \nproper and safe use of restraints and seclusions in mental health \nfacilities. I would like to acknowledge the important work done on this \nissue by Senator Dodd, who drafted the provisions included in the bill. \nHe has been a true leader on this issue in the Senate and should be \ncommended for bringing this issue to our attention.\n  There are also provisions in S. 976 to address the inadequacy of \nsubstance abuse services for American Indians and Native Alaskans. The \nbill establishes a Commission on Indian and Native Alaskan Health Care \nthat shall carry out a comprehensive examination of the health concerns \nof Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations or tribal lands.\n  And last, but not least, the bill has an important provision called \n``charitable choice.'' This provision would permit religious \norganizations which provide substance abuse services to be eligible for \nFederal assistance either through the Substance Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Block Grant or discretionary grants through SAMHSA. \n``Charitable choice'' acknowledges that no one approach works for \neveryone who needs and wants substance abuse treatment and that faith-\nbased programs have strong records of successful rehabilitation. \nDespite this success, faith-based programs are currently not allowed to \nreceive to federal funds. The ``charitable choice'' provisions in this \nbill will not allow the Federal government to continue to discriminate \nagainst faith-based providers regarding substance abuse services. I \nwill not outline all the provisions of the amendment at this time, but \nwould instead like to point out that this provision is similar to the \ncharitable choice provisions that Senator Ashcroft offered to the \nWelfare Reform Act of 1996. I would like to thank the leadership of \nSenators Ashcroft and Abraham on this critical issue, and especially \nthank the hard work and dedication of Annie Billings of Senator \nAshcroft's staff.\n  I would like to thank all the Members of the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee and their staffs for their help on this \nbipartisan piece of legislation, especially Senator Kennedy and his \nstaff Dr. David Pollack, Debra DeBruin and David Nexon who have been \ninstrumental in helping to draft this legislation. I would also like to \nthank the contributions of the Chairman of the Committee, Senator \nJeffords, and his staff members Philo Hall and Sean Donohue, Senator \nDeWine and his staff member Karla Carpenter, Senator Gregg and his \nstaff Alan Gilbert and Shalla Ross, Senator Dodd and his staff Jeanne \nIreland and Jim Fenton, Senator Harkin and his staff Bryan Johnson, \nSenator Mikulski and her staff, Rhonda Richards, Senator Bingaman and \nhis staff Dr. Robert Mendoza, Senator Reed and his staff Rebecca Morley \nand Lisa German, and Senator Wellstone and his staff Ellen Gerrity and \nJohn Gilman. I would also like to thank my staff, Anne Phelps, the \nStaff Director of my Subcommittee on Public Health, and Dave Larson, my \nHealth Policy Analyst, for their efforts on this bill. I would also \nlike to thank Daphne Edwards of the Office of Legislative Counsel and \nJulia Christensen of the Congressional Budget Office for their \ncontributions. Finally, I would like to thank an individual who has \nworked tirelessly in assisting us in getting this process to where we \nare today, Joe Faha, the Director of Legislation and External Affairs \nfor SAMHSA.\n  Mr. President, the bill we passed today will ensure that Tennessee \nand other states will continue to receive critically needed Federal \nfunds for community based programs to help individuals with substance \nabuse and mental health disorders. The changes within this bill will \ndramatically increase State flexibility in the use of Federal funds and \nensure that each State is able to address its unique needs. The bill \nwill also provide a much needed focus on the troubling issue of the \nrecent increase in drug use by our youth and address how we can be \nhelpful to local communities in regard to the issue of children and \nviolence. I am pleased to see this bill pass the Senate and I look \nforward to its ultimate enactment into law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill is the result of a concerted \nand cooperative bipartisan effort. It is an important and timely piece \nof legislation that is long overdue, and I urge the Senate to support \nit.\n  Mental illness and substance abuse are national problems that need \ncomprehensive and compassionate attention. These conditions do not \nrespect party affiliation or race or age. They are equal opportunity \ndestroyers, but they don't have to destroy at all.\n  States and local communities provide some of the most critical and \nongoing services for persons who struggle with mental illness and \nsubstance abuse. This bill enables these dedicated providers to do an \neven better job with limited resources to accomplish their prevention \nand treatment goals.\n  Since we passed the original authorizing legislation for the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 1992, a \nnumber of major\n\n[[Page S13857]]\n\nclinical and service delivery issues have emerged which require \nlegislative attention. Now we have crafted a bill that accomplishes a \ngreat deal and that includes significant compromises on a number of key \nissues.\n  The bill addresses three important clinical issues that have emerged \nin recent years: the growing problem of co-occurring mental health and \nsubstance abuse disorders, the distressing and pervasive impact of \npsychological trauma especially on our younger citizens, and the \nimportant relationship between mental health or substance abuse and \nprimary care providers. It also places much greater emphasis on \npreventing and treating mental health and substance abuse problems in \nchildren and adolescents.\n  The provisions for children demonstrate the breadth and depth of this \nbill. It contains a children and violence initiative, centers of \nexcellence for psychological trauma, grants for persons who experience \nviolence-related stress, comprehensive substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment for children and adolescents, special attention for children \nof substance abusers, wrap-around services for youth offenders, and \nspecial training centers to increase the sensitivity and competency of \nstaff who work on these issues in the juvenile justice system.\n  The bill also addresses special problems that adults face. It \nmaintains and expands support for critical programs that serve the \nhomeless, extends its protection to persons who are served in \ncommunity-based facilities, limits the use of seclusion and restraints \nin psychiatric facilities, and addresses the special circumstances of \nNative Americans.\n  I am particularly pleased with the initiatives to meet the intense \nservice needs of persons with co-occurring mental health and substance \nabuse disorders. Often, they need innovative treatment approaches, \nincluding integrated mental health and addiction treatment facilities. \nOver the next two years, the Secretary will compile a report that \nestablishes the best practices for helping this very challenging but \ntreatable group.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary to provide additional funding for \nprojects on the increasingly important ties linking mental health or \nsubstance abuse and primary care. Family physicians and other primary \ncare providers see many patients with a wide range of psychiatric and \npsychological problems. Too often, however, they do not recognize the \nmental health problems of their patients. Even if they do, they are \noften ill-prepared to provide adequate treatment or counseling. We can \ndo much more to help primary care physicians do a better job of caring \nfor patients with serious mental illnesses. This bill seeks to do that.\n  The bill also accomplishes several important organizational goals. It \ngives States more flexibility in administering their grant funds, and \nremoves a number of bureaucratic obstacles to greater efficiency. In \nexchange for this easing of certain mandates, the States will enter \ninto a cooperative agreement with the Administration in developing \noutcomes-based accountability measures.\n  The bill also gives the SAMHSA Administrator greater authority in \nmanaging discretionary grant funds. It enables the Administrator to \nmake emergency grants to deal with immediate problems that cannot be \naddressed by the standard grant-making process.\n  In spite of the many excellent features in this bill, one provision \nis seriously flawed. The section that allows religious organizations to \ncompete for public funds for the provision of substance abuse services \nviolates the prohibition against certain forms of discrimination. I \nrecognize the valuable role that faith-based organizations can play in \nhelping to address a wide array of social problems. However, the recent \nproliferation of charitable choice provisions in federal social service \nprograms runs the risk of creating a religious litmus test for those \nwho provide these services, thus barring many trained, qualified \nprofessionals from providing services for faith-based organizations. We \nneed to do more to avoid that discrimination.\n  Our goal is to help many of those in communities across the country \nwho have received inadequate care in the past. The many excellent \nprovisions in this bill will help to ensure that these children and \nadults will finally receive the care they need and deserve--without \nstigma or shame, but with dignity and respect--and America will be a \nbetter nation because of it.\n  I commend my colleagues for this important action to reauthorize the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. I want to \nthank Senator Frist and his Republican colleagues and their staffs for \ntheir skillful work for this genuine bipartisan achievement. I commend \nSenator Dodd, who worked effectively on children's issues and the \nseclusion and restraint provision. Senator Harkin contributed his \nimportant initiative on methamphetamine and inhalant abuse, and Senator \nDurbin contributed his critical provision on residential treatment for \npregnant women and women who have given birth. Senators Bingaman, \nWellstone, and Reed effectively collaborated on a series of significant \nchild and adolescent provisions, and Senator Bingaman worked \neffectively on the needs of Native Americans. Senators Mikulski and \nMurray provided excellent counsel on many issues, especially the mental \nhealth and substance abuse treatment needs of women. I thank Joe Faha, \nSAMHSA's Director of Legislation, for his generous assistance \nthroughout the process, as well as Nelba Chavez, the Administrator of \nSAMHSA. I especially thank David Pollack, David Nexon and Debra DeBruin \non my staff, for their dedication and excellent work in bringing this \nbill to passage.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 976, Youth Drug and \nMental Health Services Act, and to express my appreciation for the \nleadership that Senator Frist has shown in moving this long-overdue \nlegislation forward. At a time when so many other worthy legislative \nefforts have been derailed by partisan politics, the unanimous support \nfor this measure in the Senate is particularly noteworthy.\n  Substance abuse and mental illness take a terrible toll on \nindividuals, families and on society at-large. Each year, approximately \n5.5 million Americans are disabled by severe mental illness and an \nestimated 4.1 million individuals are addicted to drugs, including 1.1 \nmillion of our children. In Connecticut alone, an estimated 130,000 \nadults suffer from severe mental illness and 224,000 are in need of \nsubstance abuse treatment. Among Connecticut's youth, an estimated \n23,000 have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder.\n  Given that so many of our Nation's most intransigent social ills--\npoverty, violence, child abuse, premature death, and homelessness--have \ntheir roots in untreated substance abuse and mental illness, it is \ncritical that we do all that we can to ensure that states, communities \nand families have the resources they need to combat these devastating \nconditions. This reauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Act (SAMHSA) represents an important step in expanding \nand improving early intervention, prevention, and treatment services. \nThrough S. 976, States are given the flexibility to develop innovative \nsystems of care for substance abuse and mental health, but will also be \nrequired to improve accountability by developing performance measures \nand enhancing their data collection efforts.\n  I am particularly pleased that this reauthorization contains \nlegislation that I introduced earlier this year, the Compassionate Care \nAct, which will address a critical issue that a Hartford Courant series \nbrought to national attention last year--the inappropriate use of \nseclusion and restraint within mental health care facilities. The 5-day \ninvestigative series documented more than 140 deaths directly \nattributable to abusive seclusion and restraint practices. An \nadditional investigation conducted by the General Accounting Office \ndetermined that 24 deaths of individuals with mental illnesses resulted \nfrom restraint or seclusion. However, both the Hartford Courant and the \nGAO report determined that these figures most likely represent just the \ntip of the iceberg of restraint and seclusion related deaths. In fact, \nthe Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated that as many as 100-150 \ndeaths each year may be caused by the inappropriate use of restraint \nand seclusion. This is a tragedy that must be stopped.\n  The Compassionate Care Act creates tough new limits on the use of \npotentially lethal restraints--whether physical or chemical in nature--\nsets rules\n\n[[Page S13858]]\n\nfor training mental health care workers; and increases the likelihood \nthat a wrongful death of a mental health patient will be investigated \nand prosecuted--not ignored. The legislation simply seeks to put an end \nto a shameful record of neglect and abuse of some our Nation's most \nvulnerable and least cared for individuals. Specifically, the \nCompassionate Care Act will ensure that physical restraints are no \nlonger used for discipline or for the convenience of mental health \nfacility staff by extending to the mental health population a standard \nthat has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the use of \nrestraints and seclusion in nursing homes. This legislation will ensure \nthat restraint and seclusion will only be used when a mentally ill \nindividual poses an imminent threat either to himself or others.\n\n  Further, this legislation will require that all restraint and \nseclusion related deaths be reported to an appropriate oversight agency \nas determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Presently, \nthere is no standard federal reporting requirement for deaths as result \nof seclusion or restraint. The simple reporting measure in this \nlegislation will greatly aid the federal government, as well as state \nand local oversight agencies, in tracking and investigating abusive \ntreatment practices. The Compassionate Care Act will also require \nmental health care facilities to maintain adequate staffing levels and \nprovide appropriate training for mental health care staff, who are \noften the least paid and least trained of all health care workers. \nThese safeguards will hopefully prevent further harm to individuals who \nmay be unable to protect themselves from abuse by those entrusted with \ntheir care. I thank Senator Frist for working closely with my office in \ncrafting this critically important part of SAMHSA's reauthorization.\n  I am also pleased that S. 976 incorporates legislation that I have \ncosponsored with Senator Jeffords, the Children of Substance Abusers \nAct (COSA). Children with substance abusing parents face serious health \nrisks, including congenital birth defects and psychological, emotional, \nand developmental problems. We also know that substance abuse plays a \nmajor role in child abuse and neglect. In fact, it is estimated that \nchildren whose parents abuse drugs and/or alcohol are three times more \nlikely to be abused and four times more likely to be neglected than \nchildren whose parents are not substance abusers. In an effort to \nlessen the terrible toll that substance abuse takes on children, COSA \nwill promote aggressive outreach, early intervention, prevention, and \ntreatment services to families struggling with addiction. In addition, \nCOSA will strengthen the systems which provide these services by \ntraining professionals serving children and families in recognizing and \naddressing substance abuse.\n  I am also grateful that Senator Frist agreed to include my Teen \nSubstance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999 within this reauthorization. Each \nyear, 400,000 teens and their families, including 7,000 in the state of \nConnecticut alone, will seek substance abuse treatment but find that it \nis either unavailable or unaffordable. At best only 20 percent of \nadolescents with severe alcohol and drug treatment problems who ask for \nhelp will receive any form of treatment. Without help, substance abuse \nputs young people's health at risk and exacerbates anti-social and \nviolent behaviors. This legislation will provide grants to give youth \nsubstance abusers access to effective, age-appropriate treatment. It \nwill also address the particular issues of youth involved with the \njuvenile justice system and those with mental health or other special \nneeds. In short, this legislation will go a long way toward ensuring \nthat no young person who seeks substance abuse treatment will be denied \nhelp.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Frist for working with me and \nSenator Gregg on the Strengthening Families through Community \nPartnerships program, which will promote healthy early childhood \ndevelopment by intervening with at-risk families with young children \nand their communities. This legislation will support demonstrations to \ntest the efficacy of deterring substance use and abuse and other high \nrisk behaviors through a comprehensive substance abuse prevention \nprogram that targets the child's family.\n  I do have reservations, however, on one aspect of this legislation. \nWhile I support the ability of faith-based organizations to provide \nsubstance abuse services, I am concerned about provisions in this \nlegislation that would allow religiously based facilities providing \nsubstance abuse services to hire only adherents to their own religion. \nThe ability of faith-based providers to participate in providing \nvaluable federally funded programs is a laudable goal. I firmly believe \nthat faith-based substance abuse services can offer critical help in \novercoming drug dependency. However, the ability of religiously based \nentities to provide federally funded programs within this legislation \nshould not be allowed to blur the line between church and state and to \nerode crucial anti-discrimination protections.\n  S. 976 represents a bipartisan commitment to reducing the devastating \nimpact of substance abuse and mental illness of our Nation's families. \nI want to again applaud Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nJeffords, and other members of the Health and Education committee and \ntheir staffs for their efforts in developing this legislation and urge \nthe House of Representatives to follow the Senate's lead by acting on \nthis bill expeditiously.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee for their efforts in crafting S. 976, the ``Youth \nDrug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which reauthorizes programs \nunder the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In \nparticular, I want to recognize the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPublic Health, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, for his \ntremendous leadership in drafting this legislation.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation contains the Charitable \nChoice provision--modeled after my Charitable Choice provision in the \n1996 welfare reform law--which will expand the opportunities for \nreligious organizations to provide substance abuse treatment services \nwith SAMHSA block grant funds. This provision is also very similar to \nlanguage contained in Senator Abraham's legislation, the ``Faith-Based \nDrug Treatment Enhancement Act.''\n  While government substance abuse programs have not succeeded very \nwell in helping people break free from addictions, faith-based drug \ntreatment programs have been transforming shattered lives for years by \naddressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values \nwhich change destructive behavior and attitudes.\n  What results have they achieved? We have heard countless stories of \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of these faith-based programs. Teen \nChallenge has shown that 86% of its graduates remain drug-free. These \nare individuals who finally broke free of addictions after being routed \nthrough a number of government drug treatment programs. The Bowery \nMission in New York City has had the most effective free-standing \nsubstance abuse shelter in the city-wide system. Bowery also serves its \nclients at approximately 42% of the cost of some other city-sponsored \nmen's substance abuse shelters. Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, \nMichigan, named for its former alcoholic founder, has an astounding 70 \npercent long-term success rate in its faith-based rehabilitation \nprogram. According to director Thomas Laymon, government programs leave \naddicts without ``spiritual support.'' Worse, addicts ``are not held \naccountable for addictions, and they have no incentive to change their \nbehavior.'' Meanwhile, Trotter Ministries provides guidance, a \nsupportive community, and integration into a life beyond drugs. San \nAntonio's Victory Fellowship, run by Pastor Freddie Garcia, has saved \nthousands of addicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The \nprogram offers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, \nand a chance to provide for themselves and their families. It has \nserved more than 13,000 people and has a success rate of over 80%.\n  USA Today cited a study from Georgetown University Medical Center \nregarding recovery from opiate addiction. The study found that 45% of \nthose who participated in a religious program were drug-free after one \nyear,\n\n[[Page S13859]]\n\nwhile only 5% of those who participated in a non-religious program \nremained drug-free after a year.\n  Why are faith-based organizations successful? Because they see those \nthey serve as people, not profiles. They come at this with a holistic \napproach. They address the moral and spiritual cause of the problems \nrather than simply dealing with the symptoms.\n  While some states may already collaborate with religious and \ncharitable organizations in the area of substance abuse programs, \nCharitable Choice is intended to expand the use of these partnerships \nby clarifying to government officials and religious organizations alike \nwhat the constitutional ground rules are for these partnerships. If we \nknow that faith-based substance abuse programs are successful in \nhelping people break destructive addictions, government should \nencourage their expanded use. That is precisely what this legislation \ndoes.\n  The Charitable Choice provision in this legislation makes clear that \nstates may direct SAMHSA block grant funds to religious organizations \nthrough contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to provide \nsubstance abuse treatment services to beneficiaries. The provision \nreflects our belief in Congress that government should exercise \nneutrality when inviting the participation of non-governmental \norganizations to be service providers by considering all \norganizations--even religious ones--on an equal basis, and by focusing \non whether the organization can provide the requested service, rather \nthan on the religious or non-religious character of the organization.\n\n  Unfortunately, in the past, many faith-based organizations have been \nafraid--often rightfully so--of accepting governmental funds in order \nto help the poor and downtrodden. They fear that participation in \ngovernment programs would not only require them to alter their \nbuildings, internal governance, and employment practices, but also make \nthem compromise the very religious character which motivates them to \nreach out to people in the first place.\n  Charitable Choice is intended to allay such fears and to prevent \ngovernment officials from misconstruing constitutional law by banning \nfaith-based organizations from the mix of private providers for fear of \nviolating the Establishment Clause. Even when religious organizations \nare permitted to participate, government officials have often gone \noverboard by requiring such organizations to sterilize buildings or \nproperty of religious character and to remove any sectarian connections \nfrom their programs. This discrimination can destroy the character of \nmany faith-based programs and diminish their effectiveness in helping \npeople climb from despair and dependence to dignity and independence.\n  Charitable Choice embodies existing U.S. Supreme Court case \nprecedents in an effort to clarify to government officials and \ncharitable organizations alike what is constitutionally permissible \nwhen involving religiously-affiliated institutions. Based upon these \nprecedents, the legislation provides specific protections for religious \norganizations when they provide services with government funds. For \nexample, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on \nthe basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based \norganization also retains its religious character and its control over \nthe definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious \nbeliefs.\n  Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization \nto alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, \nicons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious \norganizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their \nemployment decisions. I have been told by numerous faith-based entities \nand attorneys representing them that autonomy in employment decisions \nis crucial in maintaining an organization's mission and character.\n  Charitable Choice also states that funds going directly to religious \norganizations cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or \nproselytization. Government dollars are to be used for the secular \npurpose of the legislation: providing effective treatment for substance \nabuse problems.\n  The Charitable Choice provision also contains important and necessary \nprotections for beneficiaries of services, ensuring that they may not \nbe discriminated against on the basis of religion. Also, if a \nbeneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious provider, he \nhas the right to demand that the State provide him with services from \nan alternative provider.\n  Mr. President, the Charitable Choice provision is truly bipartisan in \nnature. Shortly after passage of the federal welfare law, Texas \nGovernor Bush signed an executive order directing ``all pertinent \nexecutive branch agencies to take all necessary steps to implement the \n`charitable choice' provision of the federal welfare law.'' And earlier \nthis year, Vice President Gore stated that Charitable Choice should be \nextended ``to other vital services where faith-based organizations can \nplay a role, such as drug treatment, homelessness, and youth \nviolence.'' The Vice President described why faith-based approaches \nhave shown special promise with challenges such as drug addiction. He \nsaid that overcoming these types of problems ``takes something more \nthan money or assistance--it requires an inner discipline and courage, \ndeep within the individual. I believe that faith in itself is sometimes \nessential to spark a personal transformation--and to keep that person \nfrom falling back into addiction, delinquency, or dependency.''\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that today we are responding to \nthe Vice President's call for expanding Charitable Choice to drug \ntreatment programs. We are ready to provide people with resources \nneeded to experience a personal transformation and break free from drug \nor alcohol addiction. Through the bipartisan effort of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we have legislation \nthat will provide greater opportunities to those in our society who are \nfighting to overcome substance abuse problems.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Frist, his staff, Chairman Jeffords, \nand the rest of the Committee for their fine work on this legislation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I would like to express my \ndisappointment about a provision that the Majority chose to include in \nthe Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, S.976. In Section 305 of \nthe Act, the ``Charitable Choice'' provision permits all religious \ninstitutions, including pervasively religious organizations, such as \nchurches and other houses of worship, to use taxpayer dollars to \nadvance their religious mission. Given the Supreme Court precedent, I \nbelieve this provision is Constitutionally suspect and be subject to \ngreater review when this bill goes to Conference with its House \ncounterpart.\n  Although charitable choice has already become law as a part of \nwelfare reform and the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG, portion of \nthe Human Services Reauthorization Act, efforts are being made to \nexpand this change to every program that receives federal financial \nassistance. The inclusion of charitable choice in this legislation is \nparticularly disturbing since, unlike its application to the \nintermittent services provided under Welfare Reform and CSBG, Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funds are used \nto provide substance abuse treatment which is ongoing, involves direct \ncounseling of beneficiaries and is often clinical in nature. In the \ncontext of these programs it would be difficult if not impossible to \nsegregate religious indoctrination from the social service.\n  I agree with the Majority that faith-based organizations have an \nimportant and necessary role to play in combating many of our nation's \nsocial ills, including youth violence, homelessness, and substance \nabuse. In fact, I have seen first-hand the impact that faith-based \norganizations such as Catholic Charities have on delivering certain \nservices to people in need in my own state. By enabling faith-based \norganizations to join in the battle against substance abuse, we add \nanother powerful tool in our ongoing efforts to help people move from \ndependence to independence.\n  However, although there are great benefits that come with allowing \nreligious organizations to provide social services with federal funds, \nthe Vice President recently reminded us that ``clear and strict \nsafeguards'' must exist to ensure that the dividing line\n\n[[Page S13860]]\n\nbetween church and state is not erased. Even the front runner for the \nRepublican Presidential nomination, Governor George W. Bush, \nacknowledged to the New York Times that these safeguards are necessary: \n``Bush said . . . that federal money would pay for services delivered \nby faith-based groups, not for the religious teachings espoused by the \ngroups.''\n  In my home state of Rhode Island there is a tradition of religious \ntolerance and respect for the boundaries of religion and government. \nIndeed, Roger Williams, who was banished from the Massachusetts Bay \nColony for his religious beliefs, founded Providence in 1636. The \ncolony served as a refuge where all could come to worship as their \nconscience dictated without interference from the state. \nUnderstandably, Rhode Islanders remain mindful of mixing religion with \nits political system.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned that without proper \nsafeguards, well-intentioned proposals to help religious organizations \naid needy populations, might actually harm the First Amendment's \nprinciple of separation of church and state. For example, the \ncharitable choice provision creates a disturbing new avenue for \nemployment discrimination and proselytization in programs funded by the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Under \ncurrent law, many religiously-affiliated nonprofit organizations \nalready provide government-funded social services without employment \ndiscrimination and without proselytization. However, the legislation \nbefore us extends title VII's religious exemption to cover the hiring \npractices of organizations participating in SAMHSA funded programs. As \nthe Majority's report language points out, even if the organization is \nsolely funded by SAMHSA, it may ``make employment decisions based upon \nreligious reasons.''\n\n  For example, a federally funded substance abuse treatment program run \nby a church could fire or refuse to hire an individual who has \nremarried without properly validating his or her second marriage in the \neyes of that church--even if he or she is a well-trained and successful \nsubstance abuse counselor.\n  This is not an entirely hypothetical example. In Little v. Wuerl, 929 \nF.2d 944 (3d Circ. 1991) the Court held that ``Congress intended the \nexplicit exemptions to title VII to enable religious organizations to \ncreate and maintain communities composed solely of individuals faithful \nto their doctrinal practices, whether or not every individual plays a \ndirect role in the organization's religious activities.'' The Court \nconcluded that ``the permission to employ persons `of a particular \nreligion' includes permission to employ only persons whose beliefs and \nconduct are consistent with the employer's religious precepts.'' This \nmay be acceptable when the religious organization is using its own \nmoney, but when it is using federal funds, with explicit prohibitions \nagainst proselytization, this kind of discrimination is a cause of \nconsiderable concern.\n  During markup, Senator Kennedy and I introduced an amendment that \nwould have addressed this issue by including important safeguards and \nprotections for beneficiaries and employees of SAMHSA funded programs.\n  The Reed-Kennedy amendment would have removed the bill's provision \nthat allows religious organizations to require that employees hired for \nSAMHSA funded programs must subscribe to the organization's religious \ntenets and teachings. Since section 305 prohibits religious \norganizations from proselytizing in conjunction with the dissemination \nof social services under SAMHSA programs, it is contradictory to permit \nreligious organizations to require that their employees subscribe to \nthe organization's tenets and teachings. Second, the amendment would \nhave eliminated the bill's provision that extends title VII's religious \nexemption to cover the hiring practices of organizations participating \nin SAMHSA funded programs.\n  Ultimately, the modest proposal would not have reduced the ability of \nreligious groups to hire co-religionists or more actively participate \nin SAMHSA funded programs. It merely would have eliminated the explicit \nability to discriminate in taxpayer funded employment and left to the \ncourts the decision of whether employees who work on, or are paid \nthrough, government grants or contracts are exempt from the prohibition \non religious employment discrimination. Unfortunately, the Majority \nchose to vote against including the important safeguards proposed in \nthe Reed-Kennedy amendment.\n  For the last 30 years, federal civil rights laws have expanded \nemployment opportunities and sought to counter discrimination in the \nworkplace. I recognize that we need the assistance of religious \norganizations in the battle against substance abuse, but without a far \nmore robust and informed debate must be far more circumspect of efforts \nto expand current exemptions to title VII.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should enlist the assistance of religious \norganizations without undermining constitutional principles and civil \nrights law. Accordingly, I am concerned that the charitable choice \nprovision, though laudable in concept, would have disturbing practical \nand constitutional consequences. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat letters expressing the view of the Unitarian Universalist \nAssociation of Congregations and the American Jewish Committee be \nprinted in the Record so my colleagues may become more aware of these \norganizations' views on this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of Government and\n\n\n                                        International Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate, 320 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I write on behalf of the American Jewish \n     Committee, the nation's oldest human relations organization \n     with more than 100,000 members and supporters, to urge you to \n     place a hold on S. 976, the Substance Abuse Mental Health \n     Reauthorization Act, which includes ``charitable choice'' \n     provisions that are both constitutionally flawed and bad \n     public policy.\n       The ``charitable choice'' provisions in S. 976 constitute \n     an unacceptable breach in the separation of church and state \n     that has played so crucial a role in ensuring the strength of \n     religion in America, and places a risk the quality of \n     healthcare services provided to individuals with chemical \n     abuse and dependency behavioral disorders.\n       To be sure, the history of social services in this country \n     began with religious institutions, and the partnership \n     between religiously affiliated institutions and government in \n     the provision of those services is a venerable one. Catholic \n     Charities, not to mention many Jewish agencies across this \n     land, have engaged in such partnerships for many years. Far \n     from objecting to that partnership, the American Jewish \n     Committee, in its 1990 Report on Sectarian Social Services \n     and Public Funding, termed the involvement of the religious \n     sector in publicly-funded social service provision as \n     ``desirable to the extent it is consistent with the \n     Establishment Clause. It creates options for those who wish \n     to receive the services, involves agencies and individuals \n     motivated to provide the services, and helps to avoid making \n     the government the sole provider of social benefits.''\n       What is new in the ``charitable choice'' arena is not the \n     notion of a partnership of faith-based organizations and \n     government. Rather the innovation of a ``charitable choice'' \n     as a structure that seeks to ignore binding constitutional \n     law, not to mention sound public policy, by permitting \n     pervasively religious institutions, such as churches and \n     other houses of worship, to receive taxpayer dollars for \n     programs that have not been made discrete and institutionally \n     separate. In so doing, and in failing to include other \n     appropriate church-state safeguards, ``charitable choice'' \n     opens the door to publicly funded programs in which \n     recipients of social services may be proselytized. \n     ``Charitable choice'' also creates a real possibility of \n     creating rifts among the various faith groups as they compete \n     for public funding and allows religious providers to engage \n     in religious discrimination against employers who are paid \n     with taxpayers dollars. (Although religious institutions are \n     permitted to hire co-religionists in the contest of private \n     religious activity, it is simply improper for taxpayer \n     dollars to be used to fund religious discrimination.)\n       There is yet another aspect of the ``charitable choice'' \n     initiative that is cause for concern. With government dollars \n     comes government oversight. But this kind of intrusion into \n     the affairs of religious organizations, at least in the case \n     of pervasively sectarian organizations, is exactly the type \n     of entangelememt of religious and state against which the \n     Constitution guards. Such intrusion can have no effect but to \n     undermine the distinctiveness, indeed the very mission, of \n     religious institutions.\n       In addition to the foregoing, we are greatly concerned by \n     the portion of S. 976's ``charitable choice'' provisions that \n     allow sectarian providers of treatment for chronic substance \n     abuse conditions, such as alcoholism, and\n\n[[Page S13861]]\n\n     drug addiction, to avoid clinically based certification and \n     licensure standards. This legislation should not be allowed \n     to go forward without necessary improvements to the bill to \n     provide essential church-state protections, and without \n     closer examination of the consequences of allowing sectarian \n     care providers to avoid compliance with applicable state \n     education, training and credentialing standards.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this very \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard T. Foltin,\n     Legislative Director and Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Unitarian Universalist\n\n\n                                 Association of Congregations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1999.\n\n\n Statement of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations \n      opposition to the ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of S. 976\n\n       The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations has \n     a long, proud record of support for both religious freedom \n     and the separation of church and state. Our General Assembly \n     has issued 10 resolutions since 1961 to this effect. It is \n     thus with little hesitation that we voice our strong \n     opposition to the ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of S. 976, \n     SAMHSA, the Youth, Drug, and Mental Health Services Act.\n       These and other similar Charitable Choice provisions \n     undermine the separation of church and state by (1) promoting \n     excessive entanglement between church and state; and (2) \n     privileging certain religions and religious institutions \n     above others.\n       It does this in the fellowing ways:\n       By channeling government money into ``pervasively \n     sectarian'' institutions. The Supreme Court has already \n     clearly ruled that the government cannot fund ``pervasively \n     sectarian'' institutions.\n       By fostering inappropriate competition among religious \n     groups for government money. With limited funding available \n     for any one service, governments will be required to decide \n     which religious institutions will receive funding and which \n     will not. This necessarily puts those governments in the \n     wholly un-Constitutional position of discriminating among \n     religious groups.\n       By allowing government-funded institutions to discriminate \n     in their employment on the basis of religion. This amounts to \n     federally-funded employment discrimination, thus violating \n     myriad employment and civil rights laws.\n       By subjecting service-recipients to government-sanctioned \n     proselytization and religious oppression. Individuals \n     receiving government services should not have ``religious \n     strings'' attached to those services.\n       By encouraging religious institutions to ``follow the \n     dollars'' when deciding what type of social services to \n     provide. As a result, it may encourage these organizations to \n     move away from their historic commitment to providing social \n     services designed to meet basic human needs. We believe that \n     religious groups are better suited to address these urgent \n     human needs than they are to deal with the more complex \n     mental and other health services that require trained \n     professionals. These services are best left to government \n     agencies or institutions closely regulated by governments.\n       We in the faith community speak often of ``right \n     relationship.'' We strive for ``right relationship'' in the \n     world on many levels, both personal (such as between \n     worshipper and God) and political (such as between church and \n     state). To the Unitarian Universalist Association of \n     Congregations, Charitable Choice legislation violates the \n     right relationship between church and state.\n       In our vision of ``right'' church-state relations, \n     ``pervasively sectarian'' institutions have the freedom to \n     provide whatever services they chose with their own financial \n     resources. ``Religiously affiliated'' institutions can accept \n     government funding to provide basic human needs services, so \n     long as they do so with no ``religious strings'' attached.\n       If mental and other health-related human needs are not \n     being met by government agencies, than those agencies should \n     adopt new strategies and approaches. Rather than throwing \n     money at religious groups--who are not situated to handle \n     such needs--adequate freedom and resources should be given to \n     the relevant government agencies so that they may innovate \n     and expand in the necessary ways.\n       Many Americans struggle with disease, drug addiction, \n     hunger, and poverty. Both religious groups and the government \n     have a responsibility to help those in need. Each is best \n     suited to provide a particular kind of service. Rather than \n     blurring the lines of responsibility, each should re-examine \n     how it can do better what it is better suited to do.\n       The information available now indicates that very few \n     religious institutions are pursuing funding under the \n     ``Charitable Choice'' provisions of the 1996 Welfare Reform \n     Law. Wisely, they are wary of the problems associated with \n     government funding of religious institutions. Congress should \n     take this as a clear sign that ``Charitable Choice'' is not \n     an appropriate answer to the problems of adequate service \n     provision.\n       Like others in the religious world, the Unitarian \n     Universalist Association of Congregations is fully committed \n     to helping those in need. We are concerned, however, that the \n     public policies relating to these issues are good ones--\n     appropriate and responsible--that fully respect both the \n     needs and rights of those people receiving services. For the \n     reasons stated above, we do not believe that ``Charitable \n     Choice'' provisions are appropriate or responsible policy.\n       The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations \n     opposes ``Charitable Choice'' and urges Congress to do the \n     same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rob Cavenaugh,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Res. 219\n\n       Whereas Walter Payton was a hero, a leader, and a role \n     model both on and off the field;\n       Whereas for 13 years, Walter Payton thrilled Chicago Bears' \n     fans as the National Football League's (NFL's) all-time \n     leading rusher--and as one of the greatest running backs ever \n     to play the game--culminating with his induction into the \n     Professional Football Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas after retiring from professional football in 1987, \n     Payton continued to touch the lives of both his fellow \n     Chicagoans and citizens of his native state of Mississippi, \n     as a businessman and a community leader;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was born in 1954 to Mrs. Alyne Payton \n     and the late Mr. Edward Payton, and his historic career began \n     as a star running back at Columbia High School in his native \n     hometown of Columbia, Mississippi, which he called ``a \n     child's paradise.'' He went on to choose Jackson State \n     University over 100 college offers, and to set nine\n\n[[Page S13868]]\n\n     university football records, eventually scoring more points \n     than any other football player in the history of the National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association;\n       Whereas the first choice in the 1975 NFL draft, Payton--or \n     ``Sweetness'' as he was known to his fans--became the NFL's \n     all-time leader in running and combined net yards and scored \n     110 touchdowns during his career with the Bears;\n       Whereas Walter Payton made the Pro Bowl nine times and was \n     named the league's Most Valuable Player twice, in 1977 and \n     1985;\n       Whereas in 1977, Payton rushed for a career-high 1,852 \n     yards and carried the Bears to the playoffs for the first \n     time since 1963;\n       Whereas Payton broke Jim Brown's long-standing record in \n     1984 to become the league's all-time leading rusher, and \n     finished his career with a record 16,726 total rushing yards;\n       Whereas in 1985-86, Walter Payton led the Bears to an \n     unforgettable 15-1 season and Super Bowl victory--the first \n     and only Super Bowl win in Bears' history;\n       Whereas Payton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of \n     Fame in 1993, and was selected this year as the Greatest All-\n     Time NFL Player by more than 200 players from the NFL Draft \n     Class of 1999;\n       Whereas Walter Payton matched his accomplishments on the \n     football field with his selfless actions off the field on \n     behalf of those in need. He excelled academically as well as \n     athletically, earning a degree in special education from \n     Jackson State University in just three and one half years, \n     and going on to undertake additional graduate study. Payton \n     worked throughout his adult life to improve the lives of \n     others through personal involvement with many charitable \n     organizations. He was particularly active in working with \n     children facing physical, mental, or economic challenges. In \n     1988, he established the Halas/Payton Foundation, which \n     continues his legacy of community involvement to help educate \n     Chicago's youth;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was a dedicated man of faith and \n     principle, who, as a life-long Baptist, was known for his \n     deep reverence for God; and, as a gracious and selfless \n     citizen, was a devoted father with sterling personal \n     integrity and a warm sense of humor. Walter Payton will \n     always be remembered as a true gentleman with a heart full of \n     genuine and active concern for others;\n       Whereas Walter Payton was truly an American hero in every \n     sense of the term;\n       Whereas the members of the Senate extend our deepest \n     sympathies to Walter Payton's family and the host of friends \n     that he had across the country; and\n       Whereas Walter Payton died tragically on November 1, 1999, \n     at age 45, but his legacy will live in our hearts and minds \n     forever: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) hereby recognizes and honors Walter Jerry Payton\n       (A) as one of the greatest football players of all time; \n     and\n       (B) for his many contributions to the Nation, especially to \n     children, throughout his lifetime; and\n       (2) extends its deepest condolences to Walter Payton's \n     wife, Connie; his two children, Jarrett and Brittney; his \n     mother, Alyne; his brother, Eddie; his sister, Pam; and other \n     members of his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/03/senate-section/article/S13868-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.
