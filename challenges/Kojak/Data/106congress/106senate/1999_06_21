Mr. President, 11 days ago, the American people were \nrelieved to hear that the air war against Yugoslavia was ending. \nYesterday, the air war was officially declared over.\n  In the end, I believe it was prayer and the Holy Spirit that brought \nenlightenment to our leaders that the death and destruction in Kosovo \nand Serbia must stop. Enough was enough.\n  I rise today to commend our men and women in uniform for their \nhonorable, valiant and courageous service over the last several months \nin the campaign to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\n  Conventional military wisdom has long held that a military victory \ncould\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\nnot be achieved without the deployment of troops on the ground. Indeed, \ntelevision pundits, newspaper editors and even some of my colleagues, \nadvocated the introduction of ground troops to Kosovo based on this \nwidely-held belief.\n  However, the incredible work of our pilots, logistics and support \nstaff during the bombing has proven the conventional wisdom wrong--it \nis possible to achieve limited military objectives on the ground using \nair power alone given the quality of the American soldier using our \ntechnical superiority.\n  When I traveled to Southeast Europe last month to learn more about \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization's campaign, I was struck by the \ncommitment and professionalism of our forces throughout the region. \nFaced with incredibly long working hours, the stress of a combat \nenvironment, isolation from family and loved ones and difficult living \nconditions, each soldier I spoke with strove to do their best in \nservice to their grateful nation. We can ask no more.\n  The American people, and Congress, should especially be proud of \nthese fine men and women in uniform.\n  We should also thank God that we have such soldiers as Chief Warrant \nOfficer David Gibbs, from Massillon, Ohio, and Chief Warrant Officer \nKevin Reichert of Wisconsin--two brave Apache helicopter pilots who \ngave their lives in service to their nation in the Kosovo conflict.\n  A few weeks ago, my wife Janet and I went to Arlington Cemetery to \npay our respects to the David Gibbs' family. I shared our appreciation \nfor the sacrifice that he made and that they will continue to make. I \nget upset when I hear our leaders say we did not have any combat \ncasualties--a euphemism to mean no soldier died in ``actual'' combat.\n  Tell that to David Gibbs' widow, Jean Gibbs. Or to their three \nchildren--Allison, Megan, or David. Or his mother, Dorothy. Their lives \nwill never be the same.\n  Since 1991, when I was Governor of Ohio, there have been 32 men and \nwomen from Ohio who have died serving their nation, not counting the 19 \nthat died in the Persian Gulf War.\n  Tell the families of those who did not die in combat that their loss \nis any less significant because their loved one didn't die in battle.\n  We must thank God that we have brave men and women who choose to \nserve our country, and we must never forget those soldiers who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for this nation and the ongoing sacrifice \nof the families.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I opposed the bombing from Day One. We \nshould have done all that we could to negotiate a diplomatic solution.\n  I was also violently opposed to sending in U.S. ground troops to \nKosovo based on my belief that it would instigate an all-out war in \nsoutheastern Europe with tremendous repercussions throughout the world.\n  Just in the limited actions of the air war, we have witnessed several \npotential crises, the ramifications of which will be with us for who \nknows how long--China, Russia.\n  But I believe we must congratulate President Clinton for sticking to \nhis guns and not letting others pressure him into getting the United \nStates involved in a ground war; he no doubt saved the lives of \nhundreds, or even thousands, of American soldiers.\n\n\n                              the bombing\n\n  Even though I was opposed to the bombing, I had confidence that the \nbombing campaign would ultimately bring Milosevic back to the table. I \njust wonder why it took us so long to read his signals.\n  Indeed, according to the June 6th edition of the New York Times, it \nwas reported that Milosevic was ready to make a deal as early as the \nbeginning of May. The Times said:\n\n       That it took another month may have been due less to his \n     unwillingness to make a deal than to the West's slowness to \n     grasp that he was serious. The signs were everywhere.\n\n  I have been concerned that very few people have fully grasped the \nrelevance of Serbian history and culture as it relates to this war.\n  As I have said on the floor previously, it is crucial to remember \nthat Kosovo is the cultural and historical heartland of the Serbian \npeople, and to the Serbs, it is a holy place. It is the scene of the \nmost important event in Serbian history--the battle of Kosovo in 1389 \nbetween the Turks and the Serbs.\n  History, pride and heritage are deeply-seeded in Serb culture. That's \nwhy it is significant that Milosevic started his rise to political \npower in Kosovo and probably the most important event in his political \ncareer was when he spoke to one million citizens on the 600th \nAnniversary of the Battle of Kosovo--at the very site of the battle!\n  Given the importance of Kosovo to Milosevic politically and to the \nSerbs historically, I knew that he would not sign the Rambouillet \nagreement. The agreement called for a referendum on the future of \nKosovo's independence after three years. Which, considering the \noverwhelming Albanian majority, would have guaranteed an independent \nKosovo.\n  I also knew that once we started the bombing, it would, \nunfortunately, fan nationalistic flames causing the Serbian people to \ngalvanize and rally around him. Prior to the war, I was privy to a \nGallup poll that showed some 70% of people wanted him out.\n\n\n                              rambouillet\n\n  In addition to the historical and political reasons for Milosevic not \nto sign, the agreement called for other items that no one has talked \nabout in any detail that would have had a tremendous impact on \nYugoslavia's sovereignty.\n  Here are a couple of the parts of that proposed agreement:\n\n       NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, \n     vessels, aircraft and equipment, free and unrestricted \n     passage and unimpeded access throughout the FRY including \n     associated airspace and waters. This shall include, but not \n     be limited to, the right of bivouac, maneuver, billet and \n     utilization of any areas or facilities as required for \n     support, training and operations.''\n\n  Summary.--NATO will have the ability to station troops and/or \nequipment anywhere through-out the FRY at its discretion. This would \ngive NATO the ability to take control of the country.\n\n       NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE), through its Implementation Mission, shall have \n     its own broadcast frequencies for radio and television \n     programming in Kosovo. The FRY shall provide all necessary \n     facilities, including frequencies for radio communications, \n     to all humanitarian organizations responsible for delivering \n     aid in Kosovo.\n\n  Summary.--At the discretion of NATO, OSCE and humanitarian groups, \nthe FRY loses control of its radio and television stations.\n  With a leader as worried about his political survival as much as \nMilosevic, it's understandable that he would reject an agreement with \nsuch provisions.\n  The White House and NATO political strategists should have \nanticipated that he would not sign, and should have prepared counter-\noptions based on actions that he might take.\n  I think it's quite interesting to point out that the day before the \nSenate vote to authorize the air campaign, my office was contacted by a \nstaff member of the National Security Council who, when asked if there \nwas a ``Plan B'' should the bombing campaign fail, assured my office \nthat Milosevic would come to the peace table within two weeks of the \nbombing campaign. The staff member said that Milosevic was about to be \nsubjected to such ``devastating'' punishment that he would come running \nback.\n  That was exactly the same impression that I got from Defense \nSecretary Cohen, National Security Advisor Berger, Secretary of State \nAlbright, and NATO General Clark--this guy is going to fold.\n  And what was Milosevic doing while this Security Council staff member \nand our other leaders were making these pronouncements? He was laying \nthe groundwork to start his policy of ethnic cleansing. Our \nintelligence community should have known that he was getting ready to \nmove into Kosovo at the first sight of NATO bombers.\n  We should have had a Plan B and a Plan C in case the ``sign or bomb'' \napproach didn't work.\n  Where was our intelligence? Why didn't they anticipate such a massive \noutpouring of refugees? Or more chilling, maybe our intelligence did \nhave the answer, and no one listened to them!\n  The whole impetus for the Rambouillet agreement was to prevent ethnic \ncleansing, to prevent murder and genocide, to prevent an escalation of \na\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nwider war, to prevent an outpouring of refugees, reduce the likelihood \nof xenophobia and to prevent regional destabilization.\n  Everything Rambouillet was supposed to prevent from happening, \nhappened because we misjudged Milosevic with our ``sign or bomb'' \ndiplomacy.\n  Now look at what we have.\n  Before the air war there were 45,000 refugees outside of Kosovo. Now \nthere are more than 850,000 refugees outside of Kosovo and probably \nmore than half a million more inside Kosovo.\n  We've had ethnic cleansing and we're now seeing mass graves.\n  It was as if the floodgates of death and destruction opened up once \nthe air war started.\n  Initial projections are that over ten thousand Kosovars died due to \nethnic cleansing; and another 1,200 civilians were killed in Serbia due \nto the bombing.\n  The infrastructure of Kosovo and Serbia is destroyed and the most \nvulnerable--women, children and the elderly--are in jeopardy.\n  In addition, Serb monasteries have been desecrated, religious icons \ndestroyed, and there are further reports that clergy members were \nkidnapped by men of the KLA.\n  Hopefully the KLA will be brought under control to prevent any \nfurther ethnic cleansing of people in Kosovo.\n  This war has been a humanitarian disaster.\n  As I just mentioned, we've destroyed the infrastructure in Kosovo and \nin Serbia--bridges, roads, industry, water purification and \nelectricity--and in Kosovo alone, the European Union estimates run at \nabout $30 billion to rebuild. In Serbia, estimates run anywhere from \n$50 billion to $150 billion.\n  One thing that no one talks about is the ecological disaster facing \nthe entire region. We've destroyed an oil and petrochemical refinery \ncomplex in Pancevo, which has sent benzo-pyrene into the atmosphere, \nthere are toxic substances released from oil and chemical plants along \nthe Danube River into the river.\n  We've bombed other chemical plants and oil refineries that have sent \ntoxic substances into the environment, which has caused acid rain to \nfall in southwestern Romania and has caused air contaminants to be \nregistered in Hungary.\n  In addition, it is believed that some of our tank-piercing shells \nused depleted uranium in order to penetrate the hulls of Serbian tanks. \nThe full effects of these shells are still unknown.\n  There have been reports of increased numbers of stillborn babies, \nbirth defects, childhood leukemia and other cancers in the children \nborn to soldiers who served in the Iraq war; where depleted uranium was \nused as well. In addition, depleted uranium is believed to contribute \nto Gulf War syndrome--a debilitating chronic sickness that a number of \nour Gulf War veterans suffer.\n  This war has also had a disastrous impact on the economies of \nSerbia's neighbors.\n  The Danube River flows through Belgrade on its way to the sea. The \nDanube starts in West Germany and flows through Austria, the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia (and Vojvodina), Romania and \nBulgaria.\n  The Danube is a major economic thoroughfare for these nations, but \nbecause of our bombing campaign, river traffic has been curtailed. And \nuntil we clean up the river and rebuild the bridges, the passage of \nships will be blocked and both truckers and shippers will find it \ndifficult to move their goods to market.\n  By our bombing, we have put a tourniquet on the economic lifeblood of \nmany nations in the region.\n  I've met with the Bulgarian President Stoyanov, Foreign Minister \nMihaylova and Ambassador Philip Dimitrov and I've spoken with several \nRomanian leaders--all have asked if they are going to be part of the \neconomic recovery plan for Southeast Europe.\n  They also want to know if the United States and NATO recognize that \nthe infrastructure damage in Serbia is directly impacting their \neconomic well being.\n  I don't believe too many people realize the economic ripple effect on \nSerbia's neighbors that the air war has caused. Tourism, a main \neconomic boost to the entire region at this time of year, has been \nseriously affected. The agriculture planting season in Yugoslavia has \nbeen disrupted which will likely result in food shortages and high \nprices in the coming months as the area struggles to feed everyone. As \nI said earlier, shipping goods is more hazardous and shippers must use \nmore circuitous routes to avoid conflict and destroyed infrastructure, \nwhich raises costs. The economic uncertainty because of the war (not to \nmention the destruction of plants and jobsites) has caused a tremendous \nincrease in unemployment in the region--which adds to the refugee \nproblem; as people go elsewhere looking for work. The diversion of \neconomic resources by Serbia's neighbors to address the problems raised \nby the war (e.g. refugees, environmental damage), particularly Albania \nand Macedonia. Last month I was with the Deputy Foreign Minister of \nMacedonia, Boris Traijkovski, who said this war had had a $400 million \n(and growing) impact on their economy.\n\n  We need to recognize and respond to this regional economic crisis.\n  We have also suffered a tremendous blow to our nation's image.\n  We've damaged our relations with the Russians. A recent public \nopinion poll in Russia indicated that 72% of the Russian people have an \nunfavorable view of the United States, whereas before the war it was at \n28%.\n  I can't help but wonder if the war would have been over sooner--or \naverted--had we worked with the United Nations and Russia from the \nbeginning and not asked them to come in as an afterthought.\n  And what about the Chinese? With the bombing of their embassy in \nBelgrade, we've harmed nearly 30 years of good relations with China and \ndestroyed the leg-up we had with them. We've had rioting in front of \nthe U.S. Embassy in China and we've had the humiliating image of our \nAmbassador in Beijing trapped inside.\n  We've lost prestige with a number of Europeans, who look upon this \nwar as a giant American bombing ``video game''--a sort of Star Wars--\ncomplete with a daily score card of target ``hits.''\n  There are reports of anti-Americanism happening throughout Europe.\n  Mr. President, I will be attending the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia in two \nweeks. I am curious to hear, first hand, what these parliamentarians \nthink about the United States, and how the people in their respective \nnations feel about the United States. I look forward to sharing my \nobservations with my colleagues upon my return.\n  Like Bosnia, this country will be in Kosovo as one diplomat has told \nme ``for as far as the eye can see,''and it will have a lasting impact \non our finances. It is being paid for right now with Social Security.\n  I believe the war over there has been a disaster--one of our worst \nforeign policy decisions of the century, and no amount of plastering \nover of the Clinton Administration can cover it up.\n  Let me be clear--we must get rid of Milosevic. He is a war criminal. \nAnd I am glad we are reportedly finally trying to help those in Serbia \nwho want democracy. I've been working with Serbs in diaspora for almost \ntwo years to find alternative leadership to Milosevic.\n  This group is still willing to help if given support from our State \nDepartment. There are Serbs from all over the world who want to help--\ndoctors, engineers, accountants, architects.\n  We need to encourage the Serbian people to pursue new leadership. We \nshould publicly applaud Serb Orthodox Patriarch Pavle, for calling for \nMilosevic's removal.\n  The Orthodox Church has been opposed to Milosevic from the beginning, \nand the Serbian Orthodox Church last week called for the ouster of \nMilosevic. The Holy Synod, the Church's highest body, said:\n\n       We demand that the Federal President and his government \n     resign in the interest and the salvation of the people, so \n     that new officials, acceptable at home and abroad, can take \n     responsibility for the people and their future as a National \n     Salvation Government.\n\n  I thoroughly believe that Milosevic should heed the call from the \nChurch and do what is right--he must put his country's needs and his \npeople's needs ahead of his own. He has put his nation through enough \ndeath, destruction and\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nshame. The time is now to step down and I echo the call for his \nresignation.\n  However, Mr. President, I am concerned that there seems to be a \nconsensus that very little will be done to respond to the needs in \nSerbia until Milosevic is gone. Mr. President, we must remember that \nthere are more than 500,000 refugees in Serbia and over 250,000 that \nwere ethnically cleansed from southern Croatia in 1995 and reports are \nthat they could have 50,000 more coming out of Kosovo.\n  And though I am somewhat comforted that the President and the \nEuropean Community have said they will respond to the humanitarian \nneeds, I am really interested in how they define ``humanitarian.''\n  I am certainly hopeful that humanitarian means things like repairing \nthe bridges and cleaning the Danube, so people can go to work and \nreceive necessary goods, bringing power back on-line, so people's \nessential needs can be met, or mending the basic infrastructure, to \nprovide clean water and sanitation. However, based on news reports from \nthis weekend, that does not seem to be the entire case; the West is \nonly considering food, medicine and basic humanitarian aid, including, \nhopefully, electricity.\n  Nevertheless, I believe we should listen to Russian Prime Minister \nSergei Stepashin who, according to the Washington Post, says the West \nis taking a short-sighted attitude on aid, which will foment resentment \namong the Serb people and make it hard to be a part of restoring \npeaceful relations in the region. Stepashin said, ``You must not \npenalize 10 million Serbs for the conduct of one man.''\n  We all know that part of our post-war objective in Yugoslavia is to \nget rid of Slobodan Milosevic. The best way to do that is to present an \nolive branch, not to him, but to the people of Serbia.\n  If we help the people, if we give them the humanitarian assistance \nthey need directly, we speed up the process to his ouster. However, if \nwe don't help, Milosevic will continue to keep his political hold by \nappealing to his constituents' worst instincts about NATO and the U.S.\n  In addition, our actions to help the Serbian people re-build will \nhave a ripple effect on the rest of the region, such as Bulgaria and \nRomania, which have a great need to revitalize their respective \neconomies.\n  We should support infrastructure programs that respond to the greater \neconomic vitality of the entire region no matter where they are \nlocated.\n  As the international community continues to examine its options and \nalternatives for the redevelopment of the region, they should consider \nremoving the outer wall of sanctions to allow the IMF and the World \nBank into Serbia to promote its long-term reconstruction, understanding \nthat the Serbian people will know that this cannot happen with \nMilosevic's vice-grip on all the institutions in the country.\n  There is a responsibility on the part of the countries of NATO to \nrecognize that the Balkan nations are European, and they must be \nbrought aggressively into the European fold.\n  The fact that the Europeans are taking on the lion's share of \nrebuilding the infrastructure and economy is the best guarantee that \nSoutheast Europe will join the European and world economies, and \npresents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make lasting and \nsignificant changes in that part of Europe.\n  For that challenge to become a reality, the people of Southeastern \nEurope, including the people of Slovenia and Croatia, must understand \nthat they all have a symbiotic relationship.\n  By working together, their economies will improve, their standard of \nliving will increase and the nationalism and ethnic cleansing that has \nplagued them for centuries will end.\n  I have often said that ``there is some good that blows in an ill \nwind,'' and I consider this war to be an ``ill wind.''\n  However, the good that is blowing is the opportunity for the United \nStates and NATO, to provide the impetus for a lasting peace to prevail \nthroughout Southeastern Europe.\n  We can provide the reconstruction assistance that righted the \neconomies of the rest of Europe after World War II and which has made \nthem economically prosperous and willing defenders of the rights of all \nmen and women.\n  We have had two world wars that have sprung from Europe in this \ncentury. We have a chance to guarantee that there will be no such wars \nin the 21st Century by helping restore Southeast Europe.

Mr. President, I will address the Senate this morning on \na subject which I believe needs attention in the Senate and also needs \naction by this body, and that issue is the legislation called the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is legislation which has been before the \nSenate for some 2 years. It is a rather simple bill. It is \nunderstandable. It is a rather commonsense bill. That is, we are, with \nthis legislation, going to give assurances to the American people when \nthey purchase insurance, that the medical profession, the doctors and \nthe patients themselves, are going to make decisions related to the \nhealth care which affects them, rather than the accountants or \ninsurance agents.\n  Basically, that is what this legislation is about. There are a number \nof guarantees and protections included in the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhich I have addressed on other occasions and which I, again, will \nmention this morning.\n  Every day we fail to take action on this legislation, we see what has \nhappened in this country over the last 2 years; the patients suffer, \nwhile our Republican leadership refuses to schedule this particular \nlegislation.\n\n  During the 2 years that we have been blocked, effectively, from a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, HMO abuses have caused some 33 million \npatients difficulty in getting specialty referrals, delayed needed \nmedical care for some 33 million patients, forced some 23 million \npatients to change their doctors, forced 14 million patients to change \nmedications, denied payments for emergency services to 11 million \npatients--those are patients who use the emergency room, who felt they \nhad a medical emergency but were denied the coverage from their HMO and \nhad to pay for it out of their own pocket--and caused unnecessary \nsuffering and financial loss and frustration for millions more.\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\n  Over these last days, as we did last year, we have pointed out not \nonly numbers but also in real terms what is happening to families all \nacross this country. For those supporting a Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhich is the legislation introduced by Senator Daschle, he has stated--\nand others who support it have stated--that we are ready, willing and \nable to enter into time agreements, but we want to have this measure \nscheduled. We ought to be able to permit the Senate to vote on these \nmeasures. They are enormously important, as we have been reminded in \nthe past days by my colleagues and others.\n  We spent 5 days on legislation protecting various computer companies \nin this country from the potential of a Y2K glitch. We believe that we \nwould not even need that amount of time to debate legislation that will \nprovide protections for families, for parents, for loved ones, for \nhusbands and wives, and particularly for children. We make the case--I \ndo today--that it is time for the Congress to act to protect the \npatients against the abuses of managed care.\n  Patients and doctors should make the medical decisions, not the \ninsurance company accountants. Too often, managed care is mismanaged \ncare. Members of the Senate know it. Doctors, nurses and other health \ncare professionals know it. The American people know it. It is time for \nthe Republican leadership to stop protecting the insurance company \nprofits and start protecting patients.\n  I point out that we have more than 200 organizations that support our \nlegislation. It isn't that we just want to advance some proposal that \nhas been assembled by the members of our party; there are those in the \nother party, including Dr. Ganske, a doctor who is a Republican, and \nothers who support our proposal. But more than 200 organizations \nrepresenting the medical profession--the nurses, the doctors, the \nconsumers, those who have studied this program--favor our proposal. \nThere isn't one--not one--we are still waiting to hear just one medical \nprofessional group that supports the Republican proposal.\n  We are prepared to debate. But the American people, and those who are \ninvolved in the health care delivery system, those who are involved in \nresearch, those who are involved in protecting children, those who are \ninvolved in protecting women, those who are involved in protecting the \ndisabled, those who are at the cutting edge in advancing research, \nunderstand the importance of this debate, this discussion, and votes \nhere in the Senate.\n  We think it is time that we get to the business of the families of \nthis country by moving ahead and starting to have this measure before \nus. We have reviewed the proposal made by the Republican leadership. We \nare now 2 weeks before the July break. We believe we can handle this \nlegislation prior to that period of time. We want this matter \nscheduled. We want to be able to move toward this debate.\n  I remember the comments that have been made in recent times by the \nRepublican leadership: Well, we need to have a certain number of \namendments. We can have two amendments, three amendments, four \namendments, but we are not going to permit this matter to be brought \nbefore the Senate unless we have a prior agreement for three or four \namendments.\n\n  That was last year, and we are again being denied the opportunity to \ndebate this legislation even though we had before the Senate, just a \nvery few weeks ago, the juvenile justice bill. There was no limitation \non the number of amendments at that time. We had many contested \namendments during that debate on the issue of gun control. We had a \nseries of amendments, but nonetheless we had action on that \nlegislation. We debated it, and then we brought that measure to a \nclose. We did it in the longstanding, 200-year tradition of the Senate. \nWe believe that on a matter which is of fundamental importance and \nsignificance to families that we ought to follow that procedure and \nthat we ought to move ahead on this legislation at this time.\n  During the past year and a half, the Republican leadership has \neffectively used every trick in the book to delay or deny action on \nthis issue. It is no secret what is going on. Stonewalling tactics have \nstalled consideration of this legislation for more than a year.\n  It was just over a year ago, on June 18, 1998 that Senator Lott \nproposed to bring up the bill on terms that made a mockery of the \nlegislative process. That proposal would have allowed the Senate to \nproceed to HMO reform but permitted the majority leader to pull the \nbill down at any time. The agreement also barred the Senate from \nconsidering any other health care legislation for the rest of the year.\n  Do we understand--do the American people understand what was being \nproposed for debate in the consideration of a Patients' Bill of Rights? \nThe majority leader said: Well, I'll bring it up, but I'll be able to \npull it down if I want. And if we bring it up, we have to have the \nassurance that no other legislation dealing with health care would be \npermitted on the floor of the Senate. That was the proposal a year ago. \nObviously, we were not willing to agree to that proposal because that \nwas completely in conflict with the public's interest for debate and \ndiscussion about these matters.\n  On June 23 of last year, 43 Democratic Members wrote to Senator Lott \nto urge that he allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We requested that the Senate address the issue before \nthe August recess. The response, on June 24 of last year, almost a year \nago, was that Senator Lott simply repeated his earlier unacceptable \noffer.\n  Then on June 25 a year ago, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement in \nwhich Senator Lott would bring up the Republican bill by July 6 so that \nSenate Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nthe Senate could offer relevant amendments to HMO reform.\n  The Democratic leader had indicated that every amendment would be \nrelevant to the proposal, that there would be only relevant amendments \nto the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yes, that was rejected as well.\n  The next day, on June 26, the majority leader offered a proposal, \nonce again, that allowed him to withdraw the legislation at any time \nand bar consideration of any other health care legislation. That was on \nJune 26. That is twice they did it almost a year ago, and we are no to \na debate.\n  It goes on.\n  On July 15, 1998, he made another offer. This time he proposed an \nagreement that allowed for no amendments. He would bring up his bill, \nwe could bring up ours, and that is it--all or nothing. The American \npeople would be denied votes on key issues, denied key protections, \ntoo.\n  On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leader offered \nvariations of the proposal.\n  I could go on--and will--but it is just an indication of how long and \nhow hard we have been trying to get this matter before the Senate in \norder to be able to try and vote on this.\n\n  Many Members of this body say: Well, we know it is not being called \nup because of various interests and interest groups. But let me just \nremind the Senate what has happened. See if they are somewhat troubled \nby it when we talk about interest and interest groups.\n  Not long ago, Mr. Gradison, who is the former head of the Health \nInsurance Association of America, was asked in an interview published \nin the Rocky Mountain News, to sum up the strategy of the special \ninterests that are committed to blocking meaningful reform on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Acording to the article, Mr. Gradison \nreplied, ``There's a lot to be said for `just say no.' ''\n  The author of the article goes on to report: At a strategy session \ncalled by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised \nRepublicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire \nduring the election campaign. Instead of participating in a productive \ndebate on how best to assure that all patients have the protections \ncurrently afforded only to those fortunate enough to be in the best \nplans, such as Members of the United States Congress and the Senate, \ninsurance companies and their allies in the business community have \nheeded the call of the Republican leadership. The leadership aide, \nacting on the behalf of Senator Lott, urged the industry in 1997 to get \noff their butts and get off their wallets and block reform. The \nRepublican leadership directed these special interest friends to write \nthe definitive paper\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\ntrashing all these bills, and they have responded accordingly, pouring \ntens of millions of dollars into paid advertising, ginned-up studies, \nand lobbying campaign coffers of those who are willing to stand in the \nway of the much-needed change. Over $100 million has been spent in \ndistortion and misrepresentation on this legislation, Mr. President. \nThe interesting thing is, even with $100 million spent, if you take the \nvarious studies and reviews out there, not just the case studies which \ncome to our offices every day, but any of the measurements that are \nbeing taken out there about people's concerns, you find that it really \nhasn't impacted families in this country. They know what is happening \nevery single day, and they know the kinds of protections they need. \nThey know the importance of this legislation.\n\n  What are we basically talking about in terms of these commonsense \nrights?\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These are the commonsense rights: The right to a \nspecialist, if you have a condition serious enough to require specialty \ncare--no parent should be told that his child, with a rare cancer, will \nbe treated by an HMO adult oncologist when the physician lacks the \nexpertise needed to save the child--the right to prescription medicines \nthat your doctor knows best that you need; the right to go to the \nnearest emergency room without financial penalty; the right to \nparticipate in clinical trials--that is so important with the whole \nrange of new breakthrough drugs--the right to continue care if you are \nin the middle of a course of treatment and your doctor is dropped from \na network or your employer changes insurance plans; the right to a \nspeedy and fair, truly independent appeal; and the right to hold your \nplan accountable in court. These protections and the others are simply \ncommon sense. We believe we ought to have an opportunity to debate \nthose and to offer those measures in the Senate.\n  I am very hopeful that we are going to be able to get this matter \nscheduled. It is a matter of enormous importance. We have seen reported \nout of our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee legislation \nthat has been favored by our Republican friends. Let's have that \nlegislation before the Senate, with the time and opportunity to cover \nthose matters, and let the Senate express its will. I am convinced that \nwe will act to protect the families of America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Senator Grams pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1247 and S. 1245 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, three years ago, the entire Nation \nwatched in horror and disbelief as an epidemic of church arsons gripped \nthe South. The wave of arsons was primarily directed at African-\nAmerican churches and it was a reminder of some of the darkest periods \nin our history--when African-Americans were the constant targets of \nviolence by cowardly racists. In response to this epidemic, Congress, \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support, passed the Church Arson \nPrevention Act. We recognized that all Americans--Democrats and \nRepublicans, men and women, whites and nonwhites, Jews, Catholics, \nProtestants, and Muslims--deserve to be free from these vicious hate \ncrimes.\n  Unfortunately, this kind of bigotry has raised its ugly head again, \nin the form of the despicable arson attacks on the synagogues in \nSacramento, California last Friday. Houses of worship have a special \nplace in our society, and when they are attacked, the devastation is \nfar-reaching. The B'nai Israel synagogue is the oldest synagogue west \nof the Mississippi River. In the charred remains of its library were \nover 5,000 books, some hundreds of years old and many out of print.\n  Since passage of the Church Arson Prevention Act in 1996, the FBI and \nATF have documented over 600 cases of church arson. With the passage of \nthat legislation, the Justice Department was given the tools it needs \nto apprehend and prosecute the individuals responsible for these \ndeplorable acts, and to deal with such hate crimes more effectively.\n  All of us look forward to swift action to bring those responsible for \nthese shameful attacks to justice. Although the parishioners at B'nai \nIsrael, Congregation Beth Shalom, and Knesset Israel Torah Center may \nhave lost the use of their synagogues for a time, their spirit and \nstrength in the face of their loss are an inspiration to the entire \ncountry.\n  Congress needs to bring the same vigorous bipartisan attention to \nother kinds of hate crimes.\n  Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our society than hate \ncrimes. These despicable acts injure the victim, the community, and the \nnation itself.\n  We have acted to deal with arson attacks on places of worships, and \nwe need to take similar action to deal with other hate crimes.\n  We need to give the federal government more effective tools to \ninvestigate and prosecute these contemptible acts. In March, many of us \njoined in introducing S. 622, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. \nThis bill has the support of the Department of Justice, constitutional \nscholars, law enforcement officials, and many organizations with a long \nand distinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes. The \ngoal of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act is to provide federal \ninvestigators and prosecutors the tools they need to fight these \nsenseless and violent acts.\n  Congress' silence on this basic issue has been deafening, and it is \nunacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't care--that somehow this \nfundamental issue is just a state and local problem. It isn't. It's a \nnational problem, and for too long, Congress has been AWOL. We must \nact, and we must act now, to make the federal government a full partner \nin the ongoing battle against hate crimes in all their ugly forms.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7292-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7292-S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MANAGED CARE PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we in the United States have become known \naround the world for providing what can only be called the gold \nstandards of health care. People come to the United States from all \nover the world to receive our high-quality health care. Yet I find that \ntoo many of my constituents are not receiving this world-renowned \nhealth care. Due to current practices in the managed care area, too \nmany HMOs are denying critically needed care to too many of their \nbeneficiaries.\n  For instance, in Detroit, I met with Donald Anderson, a quadriplegic \nwho is in a wheelchair. When he changed jobs, he also changed health \ncare providers. Donald told me that his new provider would not cover a \nrolling commode wheelchair for him after the wheel broke on the one he \nowned, even though his doctor classified the wheelchair as a medical \nnecessity. The HMO told him that the chair, which he uses to take \nshowers, is considered a luxury item. His physician intervened and \ntried to get Donald a rolling commode but was repeatedly denied.\n  In Detroit, I also met with Amaka Onumono, who had been recovering \nfrom injuries sustained when a man dumped hot grease on her and set \npart of her home on fire. She spoke about gaps in service because she \nneeded to get a referral from her primary care physician after every 12 \nvisits to her occupational therapist. ``Every time it comes time to \nmake an appointment, there is a hassle,'' her mother Denise Avery said.\n  In Lansing, I spoke with Dr. William Weil, a Michigan State \nUniversity pediatrician, who said that some families whose children \nhave chronic illnesses frequently have trouble getting HMOs to approve \npediatric subspecialists, especially if none is located in the \nimmediate community. ``In many HMOs, there is a tendency to use \nneurologists and orthopedists who specialize only in the care of \nadults,'' Dr. Weil told me.\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\n  In Midland, MI, I spoke with Dr. James Bicknell, head of the \nemergency room at Mid Michigan Medical Center. He told me that problems \nsometimes occur when managed care personnel, by telephone, tried to \nscreen people out of the emergency room. Dr. Bicknell said that \n``managed care companies should be held accountable if patients are \nharmed because companies deny care.''\n  Stories such as these necessitate reforming the managed care area, \nwhich is why passage of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights is so \ncrucial. Let's take the previous examples and apply the Patients' Bill \nof Rights--a strong one--to see what would have happened to these \npeople had that legislation been enacted.\n  Donald Anderson would have received a rolling commode, since his \ndoctor determined it was medically necessary. A strong Patients' Bill \nof Rights allows the physician, not the insurance company, to decide \nwhat prescriptions and equipment are medically necessary.\n  Amaka Onumono, the burn victim, would not have had to get a new \nreferral every time she needed to see a specialist under a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Our bill would allow the patient with a \nchronic health problem to have a standing referral to see such a \nspecialist.\n  The patients of Dr. William Weil, the MSU pediatrician, would not \nhave been denied access to pediatric specialists. The strong Patients' \nBill of Rights specifically maintains that an individual should have \naccess to a specialist, including, in the case of a child, the \nappropriate pediatric expertise.\n\n  In the case of Dr. James Bicknell, our Patients' Bill of Rights \nmandates that all patients receive emergency treatment if a prudent \nlayperson considers the patient's condition to be ``an emergency \nmedical condition.'' So our health care programs, our strong Patients' \nBill of Rights, would hold health plans accountable for the decisions \nthey make.\n  I have heard similar stories all over my home State of Michigan. \nWhile most HMOs do a good job of providing quality health care while \nmanaging costs, too many put money before good medicine. A good, \nstrong, national Patients' Bill of Rights would establish a Federal \nframework that would provide very high quality assurance for patients \nall over the country.\n  There is overwhelming support in the public for managed care reform. \nThat would include, necessarily, the following patient protections:\n  First, ensure that treatment decisions are made by a patient's \ndoctor, not a bureaucrat at an insurance company.\n  Second, hold managed care plans accountable when their decisions to \nwithhold or limit care injure patients.\n  Third, ensure that patients undergoing treatment can continue to see \nthe same health care provider if their provider leaves the plan or \ntheir employer changes plans.\n  Fourth, allow patients to see an outside specialist at no additional \ncost whenever the specialist in their plan can't meet their needs.\n  Fifth, require that insurance companies pay for emergency services if \na reasonable person would consider the situation to be an emergency.\n  Sixth, promote access to clinical trials that may save time.\n  The idea of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights is not a radical \nnotion. Doctors, for instance, are strongly in favor of this. Doctors \nwho receive years of training and specialization are too often now \nbeing told by managed care companies they cannot provide the care that \nthey deem to be appropriate. When doctors are no longer making the \ndecisions they were trained to make, something is wrong.\n  What is wrong is that too many HMOs are not providing the services \nwhich the American public has a right to expect. The way to right this \nis to adopt a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope the Senate will \ntake this real-life issue up promptly, resolve it, and adopt a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

A week ago yesterday, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \nand I took the opportunity to travel about 5 miles from Skopje, \nMacedonia, to a scrub pine-covered hill that was overlooking the Skopje \nAirport and the valley that leads to Kosovo.\n  On the way, we saw the U.S. troops, primarily the Army, and then the \nBritish, Germans, and the French, all part of the NATO command we now \ncall KFOR, making the preparations for ground entry into Kosovo.\n  Beyond those encampments, the dusty road led to some high ground. As \nwe topped the hill, about 100 yards into the scrub pine were the \nmembers of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Force led by Col. Kenneth \nGlueck and his XO Lt. Col. Bob Taylor.\n  Some 1,900 marines and 186 vehicles were deploying into Kosovo. Just \na few days earlier, these men and women were aboard ship in an Italian \nport as members of the Marine Expeditionary Unit. Despite all of the \ndelay in regard to the bureaucratic problems--road and transportation \nsnafus and unfriendly but rather benign protests by some demonstrators \nin Greece--the marines were deployed and the command post was up and \nrunning when the advance units were reporting in.\n  With great respect for our allies, while their units were conducting \nmaintenance and they were relaxing prior to moving out, the marines had \nalready conducted 2 days of training.\n  In recent weeks, there has been much discussion and criticism about \nthe use of ground troops in the Balkans. The point has always been made \nthat, simply given the opposition by NATO countries and the \nadministration to the use of ground troops and the lack of contingency \nplanning, it would take months to put together any contingency plans, \nthe necessary unified command and control, supply lines and battle \nplans--it would take months.\n  No need to worry. When the order was given, your Navy-Marine Corps \nteam, a true force in readiness, was there. They were deployed in \ndays--not weeks or months.\n  I asked Col. Glueck and Lt. Col. Taylor why the marines chose the \nhigh ground miles away from the U.S. and allied forces. He responded:\n\n       Well, sir, we arrived at 2300, set up our command post and \n     staging base, secured the area, and were ready to go by \n     morning. We just didn't want to lose our edge.\n\n  And they haven't. Today those marines are keeping a difficult peace. \nThey are serving as protectors, as police, as judge, as jury, as \npeacekeepers, and as possible targets. Along with the 82nd Airborne, \nthey are doing an outstanding job. They were doing their best in the \nBalkan briar patch.\n  Senator Campbell and I had the privilege of visiting with individual \nmarines and found their dedication and morale was second to none. It \nwas a real ``battery charger'' for me. As a result, we both stood \ntaller that day.\n  In a day and age when our military is stressed and strained and \nhollow in parts, with recruiting and retention reaching alarming \nlevels--so serious, by the way, that the President had to mandate a \nstop loss order, meaning those on active duty who are scheduled to \nleave active duty cannot--and with serious problems all throughout our \nmilitary, asking a military that has been cut by one-third to do more \nin 93 nations around the world, not to mention the problems in health \ncare, in the quality of life, personnel tempo and operations tempo, \nreadiness, modernization and procurement, mission quality, and all the \nrest, how on Earth can the U.S. Marine Corps meet its recruiting and \nretention goals and perform so well in the field?\n  I will tell you how. It is called leadership, and it is called \nstandards. Those standards, those values, are set by the Commandant of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps: Honor, courage, and commitment. They have not \nchanged, and they will not change.\n  Let me state why, with the following quote:\n       To Marines, Honor, Courage and Commitment are not simply \n     words or a bumper sticker slogan. They reflect our deepest \n     convictions and dramatically shape everything that we do. We \n     imbue Marines with our core values from their first moments \n     in the Corps because we know that Marines, not weapons, win \n     battles.\n       As an institution, we have had to fight hard to maintain \n     our standards. To some, they may seem old-fashioned, out of \n     step with society, or perhaps even extremist, but we know \n     that our high standards are the lifeblood of the Corps, so we \n     have held the line!\n       In this regard, what individual Marines are doing everyday \n     counts far more than anything that is done in Washington. The \n     standards of our Corps are not simply maintained\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\n     by generals, colonels, and sergeants major, but, far more \n     importantly, by leaders throughout the Corps, at every level. \n     The Marine conviction that Semper Fidelis is a way of life, \n     not just a motto, speaks powerfully and unites us.\n\n  In typical fashion, the Marine who spoke those words, gave credit to \nall Marines for the accomplishments achieved by the Marine Corps these \npast few years while at the same time providing the leadership that \nmade those accomplishments possible. I am speaking of the 31st \nCommandant of the Marine Corps who is retiring after four years of \noutstanding service, General Charles C. Krukak, a Marine's Marine.\n  It is both an honor and a personal privilege to join Majority Leader \nLott, Senator Burns of Montana, and other senators as we pay tribute \nand say thanks and well done to Chuck Krulak.\n  My colleagues have already spoken to General Krulak's outstanding \nrecord, his personal sacrifice, bravery, combat record, \naccomplishments. A modest, self effacing man, the last thing Chuck \nKrulak would want is personal tribute, no matter how well deserved. \nSimply put, the biography of achievement of one Charles C. Krulak is \nsynonymous with honor, courage, and commitment.\n  A few personal observations however, for the Record. The latest buzz \nword in military tactics is called ``asymmetrical warfare''.\n  Quoting from retired army colonel Ralph Peters, the provocative \nauthor of the book, ``Fighting for the Future, Will America Triumph'':\n\n       Around the world, American soldiers, American interests and \n     American citizens face violent men who do not play by the \n     time-honored rules of warfare. These new enemies are \n     warlords, terrorists, charismatic demagogues, international \n     criminals--and the militaries of rogue states. Driven by \n     hatred, greed, and rage, the weapons they use range from \n     knives and bombs to computers and weapons of mass \n     destruction. They fight in urban landscapes and information \n     jungles--not on the neatly contained battlefields of \n     yesterday.\n\n  Simply put, Mr. President, as Kosovo will prove--in my personal \nopinion--all too often the United States is fighting today's wars with \nyesterday's tactics.\n  The service chief who has seen this emerging threat with foresight, \nclarity, and resolve has been General Krulak. A student of history and \nmilitary tactics and strategy, a veteran of a limited, political war of \ngradualism where specific mission was difficult to define, Chuck Krulak \nhas literally shaped the U.S. Marine Corps to meet these future \nchallenges. In this regard, the Commandant has provided members of the \nArmed Service Committees and those within our military schools and \nthink tanks valuable insight and leadership. His 45 minute \npresentation, starting with the mistakes the Romans made in 9 AD and \nending with modern day threats should be required reading for all who \ncare about out national security and individual freedom.\n  General Krulak has also enabled the Marine Corps to be on the cutting \nedge of consequence management regarding weapons of mass destruction--\nespecially in regard to the very real dangers of biological \ncontamination whether the situation be on the battlefield or resulting \nfrom a terrorist attack.\n  Majority Leader Lott stressed in his remarks how much he valued \nGeneral Krulak's candor and honesty. In my own case, coming from the \nHouse to the Senate, my tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhas been synonymous with General Krulak's service as Commandant of the \nMarine Corps.\n  Throughout this time, despite budget restrictions, difficult policy \ndebates and quite frankly a time when the administration and the \nCongress have asked our military to do more with less, the one thing \nChuck Krulak provided our committee and our Marines was honesty. No \nhedging, no fence straddling, no saluting one way and hunkering down in \nthe weeds when the going got tough the other. No Sir! General Krulak \ntold it just exactly like it is. The Congress, the President, our \ncountry and especially our Marines are owed that. And, we owe Chuck \nKrulak as we work to restore and strengthen our nation's fighting \nforces.\n  My father, Wes Roberts, was privileged to serve in the Marine Corps \nand saw action on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. As it turned out, one of men he \nhas honored to know on a personal basis was the historic and legendary \nCommandant of that time, ``Lem'' Shepherd.\n  When I joined the Corps and was a ``shave-tail'' lieutenant serving \nin the Marine Education Center in Quantico, it was my good fortune to \nserve with General Oscar Peatross, the hero of the Makin Island Raid \nand then Lt. Col. and later Commandant Robert ``Bob'' Barrow as the \nMarines published what I believe to be the first modern-day anti-\nguerrilla warfare manual in 1959.\n  The commanding general at Marine Corp Schools and the driving force \nbehind the change in tactics and strategy within the Corps at that time \nwas General Victor ``Brute'' Krulak, our current Commandant's father.\n  I am always amazed and humbled at the good fortune that life can \nbring us. I can assure you that, never in my wildest dreams could I \nhave imagined I would have the privilege of serving in this body as a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee and having the honor of \nworking with our Commandant, the son of the man I served under some 40 \nyears ago--and on the very same challenges.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two speeches by General Krulak, his \n``Farewell to the Corp'' within the Marine Corps Gazette, and remarks \nhe made for the Pepperdine University Convocation Series last October, \nprinted in the the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Marine Corps Gazette, June 1999]\n\n                        A Farewell To the Corps\n\n                      (By Gen. Charles C. Krulak)\n\n       From my earliest days, I was always awed by the character \n     of the Marine Corps, by the passion and love that inspired \n     the sacrifices of Marines like my father and his friends. As \n     a young boy, I admired the warriors and thinkers who joined \n     our family for a meal or a visit . . . Marines like ``Howlin' \n     Mad'' Smith, Lemuel C. Shepherd, Gerald C. Thomas, and Keith \n     B. McCutcheon. I wondered about the source of their pride, \n     their selflessness, and their sense of purpose. Now, at the \n     twilight of my career, I understand those Marines. I know \n     that they were driven by love for the institution to which \n     they had dedicated their lives and by the awesome \n     responsibility they felt to the Marines who shared their \n     devotion and sacrifice. Today, that same motivation burns \n     deep within the heart of each of us. The ethos of our Corps, \n     purchased so dearly by these heroes of old, reaches into our \n     souls and challenges us to strive tirelessly for excellence \n     in all that we do. It profoundly influences the actions of \n     every Marine who has ever stood on the yellow footprints at \n     our recruit depots or taken the oath as an officer of \n     Marines.\n       The ethos of our Corps is that of the warrior. It is \n     defined by two simple qualities . . . our two touchstones. \n     The first is our Touchstone of Valor. When we are summoned to \n     battle, we don our helmets and flak jackets; we march to the \n     sound of the guns; we fight and we win--guaranteed. The \n     second is our Touchstone of Values. We hold ourselves and our \n     institution to the highest standards . . . to our core values \n     of Honor, Courage, and Commitment. These two touchstones are \n     inextricably and forever linked. They form the bedrock of our \n     success and, indeed, of our very existence.\n       Our Touchstone of Valor is the honor roll of our Corps' \n     history. Bladensburg, Bull Run, Cuzco Well, Belleau Wood, \n     Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Inchon, the Chosin Reservoir, \n     Hue City, Kuwait . . . the blood and sacrifice of Marines in \n     these battles, and countless others, have been commemorated \n     in gilded script and etched forever on the black granite base \n     of the Marine Corps War Memorial. The names of these places \n     now serve as constant reminders of our sacred responsibility \n     to our Nation and to those whose sacrifices have earned the \n     Marine Corps a place among the most honored of military \n     organizations. The memory of the Marines who fought in these \n     battles lives in us and in the core values of our precious \n     Corps.\n       To Marines, Honor, Courage, and Commitment are not simply \n     words or a bumper stocker slogan. They reflect our deepest \n     convictions and dramatically shape everything that we do. \n     They are central to our efforts to ``Make Marines,'' men and \n     women of character who can be entrusted to safeguard our \n     Nation and its ideals in the most demanding of environments. \n     We imbue Marines with our core values from their first \n     moments in our Corps because we know that Marines, not \n     weapons, win battles. We also know that success on the \n     battlefield and the support of the citizens whose interests \n     we represent depend on our ability to make moral and ethical \n     decisions under the extreme stress of combat and in the \n     conduct of our daily lives.\n       As an institution, we have had to fight hard to maintain \n     our standards, To some, they may seem old-fashioned, out-of-\n     step with society, or perhaps even ``extremist,'' but we know \n     that our high standards are the\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n     lifeblood of the Corps, so we have held the line! In this \n     regard, what individual Marines are doing every day counts \n     far more than anything that is done in Washington. The \n     standards of our Corps are not simply maintained by generals, \n     colonels, and sergeants major, but, far more importantly, \n     by leaders throughout the Corps, at every level. The \n     Marine conviction that Semper Fidelis is a way of life, \n     not just a motto, speaks powerfully to the citizens whom \n     we serve. It also unites us with our fellow Marines, past \n     and present--inspiring us to push harder, to reach \n     further, and to reject the very notion of failure or \n     compromise.\n       Sustained and strengthened by the ethos of our Corps, you \n     have accomplished a great deal during the past 4 years. I \n     have been humbled to be part of your achievements and witness \n     to your selfless devotion. Time and again, Marines \n     distinguished themselves in contingencies around the world, \n     across the spectrum of conflict. Marines from across the \n     Total Force were the first to fight, the first to help, and \n     the first to show America's flag--consistently demonstrating \n     our resolve and readiness to win when called to action. With \n     the involvement of the Fleet Marine Force and input from the \n     entire Corps, the Warfighting Laboratory has looked hard at \n     the 21st century strategic environment. Marines ``stole a \n     march'' on change by testing new concepts and emerging \n     technologies, exploring new tools for developing leaders and \n     decisionmakers, and experimenting in the ``Three Block War.'' \n     Our recruiters, drill instructors, and small unit leaders \n     have implemented the Transformation Process and are \n     recruiting, refining, and developing the ``Strategic \n     Corporals'' for tomorrow's conflicts. Led by Marines at the \n     Combat Development Command, we have deepened our \n     understanding of operational maneuver from the sea (OMFTS), \n     its enabling concepts and technologies, as well as its many \n     challenges. The men and women serving in the many thankless \n     billets at Headquarters Marine Corps and in the joint arena \n     have developed and articulated our requirements for the \n     future and have secured the resources to translate OMFTS into \n     a reality. Our supporting establishment, at every post and \n     station, has epitomized selflessness and dedication while \n     providing for our readiness requirements. All these things \n     are important--and they are the accomplishments of every \n     Marine. None of them, however, are as significant as \n     maintaining our hands on the twin touchstones of our Corps.\n       The words of my father rings as true today as when he first \n     wrote them over 50 years ago:\n       We exist today--we flourish today--not because of what we \n     know we are, or what we know we can do, but because of what \n     the grassroots of our country believes we are and believes we \n     can do . . . The American people believe that Marines are \n     downright good for the country; that the Marines are masters \n     of a form of unfailing alchemy which converts unoriented \n     youths into proud, self-reliant stable citizens--citizens \n     into whose hands the nation's affairs may safely be \n     entrusted. . . And, likewise, should the people ever lose \n     that conviction--as a result of our failure to meet their \n     high--almost spiritual--standards, the Marine Corps will \n     quickly disappear.\n       May God bless each and every one of you and may God bless \n     our Corps!.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [Remarks for Pepperdine University Convocation Series, October 14, \n                                 1998]\n\n                         Comments on Character\n\n        By Gen. Charles C. Krulak Commandant of the Marine Corps\n\n       I am happy to be here this morning--to have an opportunity \n     to talk to the leaders and thinkers of tomorrow and, more \n     importantly, the day after tomorrow.\n       I considered a few different topics to talk to you about \n     this morning: The importance of my Christian faith in guiding \n     my personal and professional life, the Marine Corps' \n     intensive efforts to develop values in our newest Marines, or \n     even my thoughts about our Nation's role in humanitarian \n     missions around the globe . . . I will do that if you would \n     like--but during the Q\n       There is another topic that I would like to talk about \n     today--one that is critical to each of us, our Nation, and \n     our world--as we move toward the 21st Century . . . A topic \n     that rarely gets talked about in forums such as this, which \n     makes it all the more important to discuss. It serves as the \n     foundation for all that we are, all that we do, and all that \n     we will be . . . I will talk about the importance of \n     character.\n       I can tell you from personal experience that combat is the \n     most traumatic human event. It strips away an individual's \n     veneer, exposing his true character. If a character flaw \n     exists, it will appear in combat--guaranteed.\n       This morning, I will tell the story of an American whose \n     true character was tested and exposed in the crucible of war. \n     I will then draw some conclusions that are applicable to how \n     the rest of us should live our lives . . . lives where combat \n     will hopefully never play a role. He was a 19 year old \n     Marine-about the same age as most of you in the audience this \n     morning. His name was LCPL Grable. He was a man of courage . \n     . . a man of character . . . and this is his story . . . \n     Vietnam . . . It was 0600, the third of June, 1966. I was in \n     command of ``G'' Company, Second Battalion, First Marine \n     Regiment. I was a First Lieutenant at the time, and had been \n     given this command because the previous commander had been \n     killed about one week earlier. My company had been given a \n     simple mission that began with a helicopter assault. We would \n     land in a * * *\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     of lesser character. Moral cowards never win in war--moral \n     cowards never win in life. They might believe that they are \n     winning a few battles here and there, but their victories are \n     never sweet, they never stand the test of time, and they \n     never serve to inspire others. In fact, each and every one of \n     a moral coward's ``supposed victories'' ultimately leads them \n     to failure.\n       Those who have the courage to face up to ethical challenges \n     in their daily lives will find that same courage can be drawn \n     upon in times of great stress, in times of great controversy, \n     in times of the never ending battle between good and evil . . \n     .\n       All around our society you see immoral behavior . . . \n     lying, cheating, stealing, drug and alcohol abuse, prejudice, \n     and a lack of respect for human dignity and the law. In the \n     not too distant future, each of you is going to be confronted \n     with situations where you will have to deal straight-up with \n     issues such as these. The question is, what will you do when \n     you are? What action will you take? You will know what to \n     do--the challenge is--will you DO what you know is right? It \n     takes moral courage to hold your ideals above yourself. It is \n     the DEFINING aspect . . . When the test of your character and \n     moral courage comes--regardless of the noise and confusion \n     around you--there will be a moment of inner silence in which \n     you must decide what to do. Your character will be defined by \n     your decision and it is yours and yours alone to make. I am \n     confident you will each make the right one. When that moment \n     of silence comes and you are wrestling with your decision, \n     consider this poem:\n\n\n                         the eagle and the wolf\n\n     There is a great battle\n     that rages inside me.\n\n     One side is a soaring eagle\n     Everything the eagle stands for\n     is good and true and beautiful.\n\n     It soars above the clouds.\n     Even though it dips down into the valleys,\n     it lays its eggs on the mountain tops.\n\n     The other side of me is a howling wolf.\n     And that raging, howling wolf\n     represents the worst that is in me.\n\n     He eats upon my downfalls and\n     justifies himself by his presence\n     in the pact.\n\n     Who wins this great battle? . . .\n     The one I feed.\n\n       May God bless you and Semper Fidelis!\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in those remarks, Chuck Krulak talked \nabout character and individual responsibility as it applies to today's \nAmerica and all of the obligations and challenges that we face today. \nCharacter; character--as usual, General Charles C. Krulak simply told \nthe truth. We will be a better nation if we but heed his advice.\n  Semper Fidelis Commandant Krulak and thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7295-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1233, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1233) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff members and intern be granted \nfloor privilege during consideration of this bill and any votes that \nmay occur in relation thereto: Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, \nHunt Shipman, Les Spivey and Buddy Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's \nconsideration, S. 1233, the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nand Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. This \nbill provides fiscal year 2000 funding for all programs and activities \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The \nForest Service is not included. It is funded in the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for \nfiscal year 2000 of $60.7 billion. This is $6.2 billion more than the \nfiscal year 1999 enacted level and $1.2 billion less than the \nPresident's fiscal year 2000 budget request.\n  Changes in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall \nincrease from the fiscal year 1999 enacted level primarily due to a \n$5.9 billion estimated increase in the required payment to reimburse \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. In fact, I \npoint out that just over three-quarters of the total $60.7 billion \nrecommended by this bill is for mandatory appropriations, over which \nthe Appropriations Committee has no effective control.\n  The spending levels for these programs are governed by authorizing \nstatutes. The mandatory programs funded by the bill include not only \nthe payment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net \nrealized losses which I just mentioned, but the food stamp and child \nnutrition programs, and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Less \nthan one-fourth of the total funding recommended by this bill is for \ndiscretionary programs and activities.\n  Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior \nyear spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary \nspending of $13.983 billion in budget authority and $14.254 billion in \noutlays for fiscal year 2000. These amounts are consistent with the \nsubcommittee's discretionary spending allocations.\n  I will take a few minutes to summarize the bill's major funding \nrecommendations. For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, \nappropriations of $638 million are recommended, $21 million more than \nthe fiscal year 1999 level. For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService, $445 million is recommended, $11 million more than the 1999 \nlevel. Appropriations of USDA headquarters operations and for other \nagriculture marketing and regulatory programs are approximately the \nsame as the 1999 appropriations levels, with the exception of a $7 \nmillion increase in the mandatory USDA rental payment to the General \nServices Administration, a $7 million reduction in funding for the \ncensus of agriculture, and increased funding for programs and \nactivities included in the President's food safety initiative.\n  For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $3.1 billion \ntotal loan program level, $798 million more than the fiscal year 1999 \nlevel, excluding additional loans funded through fiscal 1999 emergency \nappropriations. The amount recommended includes $559 million for farm \nownership loans and $2.4 billion for farm operating loans.\n  Total appropriations of $795 million are recommended for salaries and \nexpenses of the Farm Service Agency. This is $80 million more than the \n1999 level and the same as the President's budget request.\n  For agriculture research, education, and extension activities, the \nbill provides total appropriations of $1.8 billion. Included in this \namount is a reduction from fiscal year 1999 of $3.4 million for \nAgricultural Research Service, ARS, buildings and facilities, a $24 \nmillion increase for research activities of the ARS; and a $12 million \nincrease in total funding for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service.\n  For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $807 million is \nprovided, $15 million more than the 1999 level. This includes $656 \nmillion for conservation operations, $99 million for watershed and \nflood prevention operations, and $35 million for the resource \nconservation and development program.\n  USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service is funded at a level of $140 \nmillion. In addition, a total program level of $946 million is \nrecommended for the Public Law 480 program, including $159 million for \nTitle I and $787 million for Title II of the program. These amounts, \ntogether with projected carryover balances, will, at minimum, be \nsufficient to maintain the fiscal year 1999 funded P.L. 480 Titles I \nand II levels of $220 million and $837 million, respectively, in fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  The bill also provides a total program level of $2.2 billion for \nrural economic and community development programs. Included in this \namount is $718 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $55 \nmillion for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and a total of $1.6 \nbillion program level for rural electric and telecommunications loans.\n  In addition, the bill devotes additional resources to those programs \nwhich provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income \nindividuals and families living in rural America.\n  Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total \n$4.6 billion, a $343 million increase from the fiscal year 1999 level. \nIncluded in this amount is $4.3 billion in section 502 low-income \nhousing direct and guaranteed loans and $114 million in section 515 \nrental housing loans.\n  In addition, $640 million is included for rental assistance program. \nThis is the $200 million more than the budget request and $57 million \nmore than the 1999 appropriations level.\n  Over 58 percent of the bill's total funding, $36 billion, is provided \nfor USDA's domestic food assistance programs. This includes $9.6 \nbillion for child nutrition programs, including $13 million for the \nnewly-authorized school breakfast pilot projects and evaluation; $4 \nbillion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \nInfants, and Children, WIC; $131 million for the commodity assistance \nprogram; and $21.6 billion for the food stamp program. The bill also \nprovides first-time funding of $3 billion for Bill Emerson and Mickey \nLeland Hunger Fellowships through the Congressional Hunger Center.\n  For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee \nprovides total appropriations of $1.1 billion. Included in this amount \nis $61 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and $1 \nbillion for the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.\n  Total appropriations recommended for salaries and expenses of the FDA \nare $65 million more than the 1999 level, and reflect the full increase \nrequested in the budget for FDA rental payments to the General Services \nAdministration, an additional $25 million for FDA food safety \ninitiatives, and an increase of $28 million for premarket application \nreview.\n  In addition, the bill makes available $145 million in Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act collections, $13 million more than the fiscal year \n1999 level.\n  The increase provided for premarket application review is the full \namount requested by the President for these activities through a \ncombination of direct appropriations and collections from proposed new \nuser fees. By FDA's own admission, new blood products, animal and \ngeneric drugs, medical devices, and food additives all suffer from \nlengthy review time, far short of meeting the statutory performance \nrequirements. This increase is essential to enable FDA to perform its \ncore statutory mission of reviewing drugs, foods, medical devices and \nproducts within statutory time frames and to ensure patients' speedy \naccess to new products and the latest technology.\n  I point out to my colleagues that the discretionary budget authority \nallocation for this bill is nearly the same as the CBO baseline level, \nor a ``freeze'' at the 1999 enacted appropriations level. To provide \nthe selected increases I just cited and to maintain funding for \nessential farm, housing, and rural development programs, several \nmandatory funding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest \nlimitations are imposed on Food Stamp program commodity purchases, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, and on new acreage \nenrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program. Funding for the Initiative \nfor Future Agriculture and Food Systems is limited to $50 million, and \nrestrictions are imposed on fiscal year 2000 funding for the \nConservation Farm Option Program and the Fund for Rural America.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that although the total \ndiscretionary spending recommended by this bill is approximately $190 \nmillion in budget\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\nauthority below the President's request level, the President's proposed \nbudget relies on additional revenues and savings to accommodate much \nhigher levels of discretionary spending. The President's budget \nproposes to generate a net total of $532 million in collections from \nnew user fees proposals; to make an additional $180 million available \nby double-counting savings used to offset 1999 appropriations; to shift \nthe Foreign Market Development Cooperator program from the \ndiscretionary to the mandatory side of the ledger, saving $28 million; \nto defer until fiscal year 2001 a portion of the funds needed to meet \nrental assistance requirements, saving $200 million; and to redirect \nfunds from ongoing projects and Congressional initiatives to pay for \nPresidential initiatives.\n  We do not propose savings from scorekeeping tactics, or have the \nluxury of being able to rely on revenues and savings from legislative \nproposals that have not been acted on by the Congress or signed into \nlaw. Consequently, within the discretionary spending limitations \nestablished for this bill, we have not been able to afford many of the \ndiscretionary spending increases and new initiatives proposed by the \nadministration.\n  I am going to highlight what I think to be some of the important \nprovisions of this bill and discuss how the subcommittee reached its \ndecisions as to the priorities we felt were important enough to include \nfor increases in spending and how we generally approached developing \nthis legislation.\n  As the occupant of the Chair may well remember, we decided this year \nto conduct our hearings based on subject matter categories. We defined \nfood safety as one of the highest priority interests in the country \ntoday, and one of the most challenging issues.\n  After hearing the Secretary of Agriculture present the overall budget \nrequest for the Department of Agriculture this year, we then began \nconcentrating on the issue areas we thought to be considered high \npriority areas of interest. Food safety was the first one we \nconsidered, with witnesses being the highest ranking officials in the \nadministration with responsibilities over those areas of the \nPresident's budget. Testifying were the Commissioner of the Food and \nDrug Administration, for example; the Director of the Food Safety and \nInspection Service and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta was \nrepresented at this hearing as well. Based on our findings and the \ninformation we were able to obtain, this committee has recommended \nincreases for funding of programs and activities that come under this \ngeneral issue area.\n  We also want to point out that it was clear to us, because of the \nprograms and activities and hard work in the past, we are able to enjoy \nthe safest food supply in the world, the most abundant food supply, the \nmost affordable food supply. The fact of the matter is, Americans ought \nto feel very confident and comfortable with the inspection programs, \nwith the recent initiatives that have been developed to make them \nbetter, more effective, and the funding levels that are contained in \nthis legislation to help assure that we continue to improve upon the \nrecord of the past.\n  There have been problems, and we are frightened when we hear about \ncontaminated food products. We think more needs to be done in terms of \neducating the public in the handling of food and in the preparation of \nfoodstuffs.\n  At the same time, there are some responsibilities that peculiarly \nbelong in the hands of the Federal Government. Our challenge is to make \nsure those programs are being administered in the way they should be, \nin the way Congress provided the authority for them to be administered, \nand that they are using the funds effectively.\n  I believe we can be confident in the expression of support we have \nfor the food safety initiative. We have added funds for that and in \nother ways we think we have strengthened the activities of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and others \nas they relate to food safety.\n  I am also happy to report that we were able to recommend funding for \nimportant nutrition programs. People may not realize it, but almost 60 \npercent of the funding in this bill is allocated to food and nutrition \nprograms. Of the total amount of $60.7 billion, almost 60 percent of it \nwill be spent in the year 2000 to help provide food that is needed by \nthose who cannot afford to adequately meet their own needs and the \nneeds of their families, and for other programs, like the School Lunch \nProgram which we know is tied directly to child health and learning and \nschool performance.\n  There are other programs, as well, for those who are out of work and \ndisabled. The Food Stamp Program is one of the best known and also is \nfunded at a high level, although the trend has been going down. That is \nan indication of the strength of the economy and the fact that when we \ndo have a good economic growth program and jobs are being provided, \nless money is needed for the Food Stamp Program. That is one reason we \nwere able to hold down the increase in the mandatory programs, because \nthere is a reduction of about $1 billion in the expected cost of the \nFood Stamp Program for next year as compared to last year. That is good \nnews.\n\n  We are increasing the funds for the WIC Program, the Special \nSupplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children. This is \nthe special program that deals with those women who are pregnant, and \nyoung children who need special assistance. We are increasing the funds \nso that those needs will be met as a result of the spending in this \nbill.\n  There was a pilot program authorized last year by the agriculture \ncommittees that have legislative jurisdiction over these programs for a \nschool breakfast program. This will be a demonstration program that \nwould provide free breakfasts to all children in a school to find out \nwhat effect that would have, whether the need is there, whether the \ndemand is there. We provided funds to start up and evaluate a pilot \nbreakfast program in this legislation.\n  We have added funds for a fellowship program for the Congressional \nHunger Center. These fellowships will be named for Bill Emerson, a \nformer Congressman from Missouri, and Mickey Leland, former Congressman \nfrom Texas, both of whom have been instrumental in their careers when \nthey served in the Congress on hunger issues and in dealing with \nproblems of those who do not have enough to eat.\n  We are hopeful the entire nutrition area will meet with favor in the \nSenate because of the way we analyzed and went about trying to identify \nthe priority needs, looking at the available funding and trying to \nmatch those in a reasonable and thoughtful way in the bill, and I think \nwe have done that.\n  Research is an area a lot of people do not think about too much \nunless they are involved in it or benefit directly from it. But it is a \npart of this Department's activities where we have recommended \nadditional spending, additional spending compared with last year and, \nin many cases, additional spending as compared with the President's \nbudget request.\n  We think these are wise investments in making sure we identify the \nemerging technologies that can benefit production agriculture, farmers \nwho are out there trying to deal with the big problem of prospective \nlow income because of low commodity prices.\n  One way you can make that up or help deal with that challenge is to \nimprove yields of crops, to develop ways to operate a farm more \nefficiently, to cut down the costs of the so-called inputs into \nproduction agriculture, the costs of pesticides, herbicides, \nfertilizer, and other variable costs of production.\n  One way to get at this is develop new techniques. Biotechnology is \none example. Seed genetics is another. Private industry is contributing \nan enormous amount of research and development in these areas, but the \nFederal Government has a role to play, too.\n  In many cases, what the Federal Government starts in the way of \nresearch in some of these areas is carried on by others in the private \nsector. Colleges and universities have laboratories and students and \nscientists involved in many of these research projects. So across the \ncountry, we see very important work being done in agriculture-related \nresearch that will help farmers achieve profits in agriculture in the \nfuture and help make our food supply safer, help make production \nagriculture more compatible with the environment through more effective \npesticides, and other inputs in production\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\nagriculture that are very costly to the farmer but also contain some \ninherent environmental risk as well and have to be closely \nmonitored. So I think agriculture research, particularly ARS research \nactivities, as they are increased in this bill, are justified because \nof the end results that we think will flow from these activities.\n\n  Another area that we emphasized in this legislation is conservation, \nnot just protecting our land and water resources from erosion or \ncontamination but also using incentives in this legislation to \nencourage farmers to manage their lands, to enhance wildlife habitat, \nand to be more sensitive to the needs of those who enjoy the outdoors \nfor hiking along the beautiful rivers and streams we have in our \ncountry. All of these are very important national assets.\n  So this legislation funds programs that are designed to achieve the \ngoal of protecting our environment, protecting our land from erosion, \nprotecting our water from contamination.\n  One example of a fairly new program that farmers are beginning to \nappreciate more and more is the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. \nFunds are made available directly through the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to encourage farmers who participate in and who want to be \ninvolved in this program with new techniques in ways of improving \nwildlife habitat on their land, devoting certain acreage to wildlife \nplantings or conservation techniques. We are finding that is a very \nimportant new program.\n  We are also providing more funds for wetlands conservation program \nactivity than ever before in this bill. The Conservation Reserve \nProgram is another important program. It has led to a lot of tree \nplanting, a lot of conservation practices, idling acres that had been \nin production agriculture that probably should not have been in \nproduction agriculture from the beginning and defined by those at the \nDepartment of Agriculture, who have responsibilities for soil \nconservation programs, as erodible, highly erodible lands. So we have \nprovided the continuation of funding for that program as well.\n  So this is an effort to establish priorities and to see that within \nthe limitations that we have for discretionary spending, that we target \nthe funds where we think they are very definitely needed. We think this \nis one of those areas.\n  Let me just say something about farm income support. We had an entire \nhearing looking at the prospects for farm income. The chief economist \nat the Department was there. Other high-ranking officials of the \nDepartment of Agriculture came and testified as well. We learned what a \nlot of people already know who watch this situation very closely; that \nfarm income is going to be down, net farm income, by over $3 billion in \nthis next crop year, which has already begun.\n  You compare that with last year's level of income which was \nsubstantially lower than the year before, that triggered a $6 billion \ndisaster assistance program, and you understand how serious the income \nsituation is for those involved in farming in America today.\n  We talked about what could be done, what programs are in place that \nwe could fund or continue or improve that would improve the likelihood \nthat farmers could achieve a better result than projected.\n  Some things came to mind: Doing a better job in the promotion of \nAmerican agriculture products overseas, trying to make sure that our \ntrade relations are good, getting the Government more actively involved \nin taking up for farmers in the sale of what they produced in overseas \nmarkets.\n  If they are denied access to a market or if American commodities are \nbeing discriminated against in some way, the Government has an \nobligation to get actively involved and not just say: farmers, sorry; \nexporters, sorry. You are on your own. This is a business country, and \nfree enterprise means that you have to get out there and do this on \nyour own.\n  We do not agree with that hands-off attitude in this committee. We \nare funding programs that will help ensure that farmers get a better \nchance of selling what they produce in overseas markets.\n\n  Breaking down barriers to trade, sometimes Congress does itself in on \nthis issue. I hear that we are considering taking up a bill to put \nimports on steel. Somebody may say: Who cares? What does that have to \ndo with farming? If you do something like that, immediately you reap \nthe whirlwind, because those that you put a quota on, who are trying to \nsell you something, put a quota on you. And what do we sell most of? We \nhave a surplus of trade in agriculture commodities.\n  We have a deficit in trade on most other things. We have an overall \ntrade deficit. Agriculture is one of the few sectors of our economy \nwith a positive trade balance. But we are going to undo that if we are \nnot careful as we take on some of these issues that may sound good for \nthe moment or please some organized labor union. We are going to find \nout that is not very smart. I hope the Senate will be careful as it \napproaches issues like that.\n  But one thing we are doing, legislation reported by the Agriculture \nCommittee, which I hope the Senate will pass, which does something \nabout rationalizing the attitudes of how to use sanctions and imposing \nsanctions on trade when we are mad at some country because they do not \nbehave in a way that we think they ought to.\n  In the past, we have seen administrations--including this one; \nothers, too--impose sanctions to try to punish that country. What \nhappens is we end up punishing our farmers because we cannot export our \nagriculture commodities.\n  We are exempting, as the Senate has recently acted on, food in trade \nrelations. We know that food should not be used as a weapon. We are \nlearning that. There are a few clear examples where we are going to \ncontinue to do it, I suppose--Cuba, some other countries that are in \nthat category--but generally speaking, we are changing the policy so \nthat farmers will not have to pay the price and bear the brunt of \nAmerican foreign policy by giving up trading opportunities and the \nopportunity to export and sell farm commodities in the international \nmarket. But nonetheless, there are going to be problems, even though we \nare trying to do the right thing on trade sanctions reform, on fair and \nreciprocal trade relations.\n  Tax reform is another jurisdictional committee responsibility, but we \nare seeing progress being made there. Interest rates are a big factor \nbecause that is a major input into the costs of production agriculture \nin some areas of the country, particularly in the South. We are hopeful \nthat the interest rates can remain low and will not be increased. That \ncan be a very serious detriment to the effort to try to improve farm \nincome.\n  There are some in our committee who wanted to attach to this bill a \n$6.5 billion amendment for disaster assistance. It was offered in our \ncommittee, but I made a motion to table the amendment. That motion \ncarried. Then in the full committee, while it was mentioned as a \npossibility for debate in the full committee, it was not offered in the \nfull committee. But we have been told there will be an amendment \noffered to add $6.5 billion or thereabouts to this bill for disaster \nassistance for farmers.\n  I do not think there is any question that farmers are in trouble this \nyear because of low commodity prices, and other factors, some of which \nI have mentioned. We do not know what the weather situation is going to \nbe. This is the beginning of the crop year.\n  To try to anticipate right now what the situation is going to be at \nharvest time and at the time when most farmers may be selling their \ncrops, we know that it is likely that income is going to be down. So \nwhat we hope we will see is an administration that remains very much \ninvolved in monitoring the situation that confronts production \nagriculture and submit to the Congress a request for additional funding \nfor disaster assistance as may be needed based on the \ncircumstances. Senators will remember that this month the Department of \nAgriculture is just now getting around to sending to a lot of farmers \nbenefit checks that were approved last October in the disaster bill \nwhich was passed by Congress in the total amount of about $6 billion. \nSome $2.4 billion of that amount was for weather-related disasters, \nmultiyear disasters.\n\n  Arguably, the administration had a difficult time determining \neligibility, settling on the regulations to implement the program. It \nwas a big job;\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nthere is no question about that. But it took a long time.\n  We responded, when we were requested to provide additional funding \nfor staffing to process the applications from farmers who wanted to \napply for benefits under that program. We provided in the initial bill \nabout $40 million for that purpose for additional funds for the Farm \nService Agency offices. Then later this year we were asked to provide \nmore. We responded and provided more. As a matter of fact, in the \nsupplemental that was passed in May, there was about $575 million of \nadditional funding approved for the Department of Agriculture, a good \nbit of which was related to the continuing disaster program and the \nadministration of that program that was identified last year by \nCongress and the administration.\n  One thing that stands out in my memory about this disaster assistance \nissue is that this bill last year, when we were on the floor presenting \nit to the Senate, had included an issue relating to disaster \nassistance. What the Senate did was try to listen to other Senators. We \nwere here on the floor discussing alternatives for responding to the \ndisaster. We ended up, in the course of handling this bill, developing \na disaster assistance program of $4 billion for America's farmers for \nemergency disaster assistance. Guess what happened. The President \nvetoed the bill.\n  I am going to read you what the President said in his veto message to \nthe Congress after vetoing the agriculture appropriations bill last \nyear:\n\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 4101, the \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. I am vetoing \n     this bill because it fails to address adequately the crisis \n     now gripping our Nation's farm community.\n\n  Then, after four paragraphs or so, the President says this:\n\n       I am extremely disappointed that the Congress has reacted \n     to this agriculture emergency situation by sending me a bill \n     that fails to provide an adequate safety net for our farmers. \n     I have repeatedly stated that I would veto any emergency farm \n     assistance bill if it did not adequately address our farmers' \n     immediate needs, and this bill does not do enough.\n\n  Then at the end of the message:\n\n       Therefore, as I return this bill, I again call on the \n     Congress to send me a comprehensive plan before this session \n     ends that adequately responds to the very real needs of our \n     farmers at this difficult time. William J. Clinton, the White \n     House, October 7, 1998.\n\n  That wasn't very long ago. Well, what happened next was, we \nreconsidered the agriculture appropriations bill in the Congress. The \nHouse and Senate conferees got back together with representatives of \nthe administration. This was a bipartisan effort to try to reach some \nagreement as to what would be an adequate amount of disaster \nassistance. We had tried to get the administration involved early in \nthe process, and we didn't have any luck. There was no active \ninvolvement in providing information, any guidance as to what the \nPresident's views were. There were differences of opinion all over \nCapitol Hill as to what should be done. Then we passed a $6 billion \ndisaster assistance package in the Omnibus Appropriations Act at the \nend of last year's Congress. That was signed by the President.\n  Now we are just getting all of those benefits delivered to the \nfarmers. This is June, and it was June when the last checks \nwere supposed to be going out from that October disaster assistance \nbill last year.\n\n  What I have suggested we do, rather than doing what we did last year, \nwhich provoked a veto--Congress acted first. We went forward and tried \nto develop a sensitive and, we thought, thoughtful response. The \nPresident gave us the back of his hand, in my view, with an effort to \nwin political points with a distressed agriculture community, and said: \nCongress was not generous enough, but I will be more generous. I will \ninsist that they spend more.\n  Well, we are not going to fall for that again. I am not going to \nrecommend to this Senate that we pick a number and try to satisfy the \nPresident and guess at what the weather situation is going to be \nthroughout the country, what the yields are going to be in all the \ndifferent commodities, who is going to have the big problems, the \nserious problems, and who may be able to weather it without disaster \nassistance this year.\n  I have been joined in an effort by 21 other Senators. This letter was \nsent to the President on June 15, which is the day we proceeded with \nthe markup on this bill. I will read it into the Record:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: American farmers are currently facing \n     one of the most severe economic situations in recent history. \n     Last year, rising world commodity supplies, coupled with \n     weakening international demand for U.S. agricultural \n     products, greatly reduced farm prices and the value of U.S. \n     farm exports. Congress responded by providing emergency farm \n     assistance totaling $5.9 billion.\n       Many farmers who struggled with cash flow problems in 1998 \n     will likely see their problems worsen in 1999. It is \n     projected that net cash farm income will decline by $3.6 \n     billion this year. Also, according to USDA, 1998 net farm \n     income for wheat, corn, soybeans, upland cotton, and rice \n     crops was 17 percent below the previous 5-year average. For \n     1999 crops, current projections indicate that income will be \n     27 percent below the previous 5-year average.\n       We are writing to invite your personal attention to the \n     statement of managers language accompanying the recent \n     emergency supplemental appropriations bill that calls upon \n     the Administration to monitor the agriculture situation \n     closely and submit a request to the Congress for any \n     additional funds needed to address this potential farm \n     crisis.\n\n  The letter was signed by this Senator and 21 other Senators.\n  We have not had a response, and I did not expect one by now from the \nPresident. But the point of this is to involve the White House in the \nprocess up front, at the outset, rather than presume to be able to \nwrite a disaster assistance package at this point in this crop year \nthat would anticipate everything that is going to happen that would \naffect production agriculture in this crop year.\n  It is just impossible. I didn't think we had a member of our \nsubcommittee smart enough to do that. I am not sure there is a Senator \nserving today smart enough to do that. There is nothing wrong with \nworking, though, with the administration to prepare and to think about \nthe options.\n  That is a good idea. Farm groups have met with the President. We have \ninvited representatives of farm organizations to meet with Senators. I \nam sure that has been happening on the House side, too. We have had \nhearings in our Agriculture Committee with representatives of producers \nand other associations who are familiar with this situation. And the \noutlook is not good. It is serious.\n  I want to be sure that everybody understands we are aware of the \nproblem. We want to be actively involved in helping to deal with it in \na fair and thoughtful way. We also recognize the limitations we have \nunder the Budget Act that was passed and signed by the President under \nthe budget resolution adopted by the Congress. So this subcommittee \nisn't going to presume to do anything that violates the provisions of \nthose legislative enactments. But we are prepared to work in a \ncooperative way with all concerned to reach a just and fair solution \nand a response that is sensitive to the problems as they exist in \nagriculture.\n  So I invite Senators to review this legislation. I am hopeful it will \nmeet with the approval of the Senate, and that we can proceed with \nconsidering any suggestions that Senators have for changes in the bill.\n  The programs and activities included in this bill are, for the most \npart, funded at or near the 1999 levels. There are some increases \nrecommended. These include $80 million to meet the President's \nrequested level for salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency, \nwhich administers the farm programs; $53 million for agricultural \nresearch; $15 billion for conservation operations; $21 million for the \nFood Safety and Inspection Service; $114 million for the WIC Program, \nto maintain an average monthly program participation level of $7.4 \nmillion in fiscal year 2000; and $65 million for food safety and \npremarket application review activities of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Food safety, as I pointed out, continues to be a high priority of \nthis committee. The bill provides the funds necessary to ensure that \nAmerican consumers continue to have the safest food supply in the \nworld. Not only does the bill provide increased funds required for meat \nand poultry inspection activities for the Food Safety and Inspection \nService, it provides total\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nfunding of $321 million, which is a $46 million increase from the 1999 \nlevel, for Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration \nprograms and activities included in the President's food safety \ninitiative.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, as well as all of \nthe other members of the subcommittee for their support and cooperation \nin putting this bill together. I believe the bill represents a balanced \nand responsible set of funding recommendations within the limited \nresources available to the subcommittee. I hope the Senate will support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter I \nread and addressed to the President be printed in the Record, with the \nsignatures of all Senators who signed it.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1999.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: American farmers are currently facing \n     one of the most severe economic situations in recent history. \n     Last year, rising world commodity supplies, coupled with \n     weakening international demand for U.S. agricultural \n     products, greatly reduced farm prices and the value of U.S. \n     farm exports.

Enzi, Peter Fitzgerald, Sam Brownback, Chuck \n           Hagel.\n\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am very glad to join my friend from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, in bringing to the floor S. 1233, the \nfiscal year 2000 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development \nand Related Agencies. I am grateful to Senator Cochran, the Chairman of \nthe subcommittee, for his gracious approach to crafting this bill and \nfor the fair and reasonable manner in which the interests of all \nSenators have been given consideration.\n  Senator Cochran has outlined the general spending levels for items \nincluded in this bill. I would like to emphasize to all Senators the \nimportance of the programs funded by this bill, and the need to ensure \nits passage. This bill provides funding for programs vital for our \nnation's continued leadership in agricultural production through \nresearch, implementation of farming practices, and marketing. This bill \nalso includes funding to protect the environment, to restore economic \nprosperity to rural America, and to improve the standard of living \nthere. This bill provides funds to help feed the most vulnerable of our \npopulations at home and abroad, and this bill helps American farmers \nmaintain a strong presence in foreign markets while, at the same time, \ncombating the destructive consequences of unfair foreign trade. Also, \nthis bill provides funds important to protect the public health of this \nnation in the areas of food safety, medical drugs and devices, and \noversight of our blood supply.\n  There will likely be some Senators who will question whether the \nlevels of spending in this bill are adequate. When our subcommittee \nreceived its initial allocation for discretionary spending, I had grave \nconcerns that we would not be able to craft a bill that I could \nsupport. I was prepared to vote against the allocations at that time, \nbut Chairman Stevens persuaded me that we needed to move forward in \norder for the full Senate to see what effect the discretionary caps \nwill have on ongoing programs in fiscal year 2000. Fortunately, since \nthen our subcommittee did receive an increase in the allocation, and I \nsupported reporting this bill at both the subcommittee and full \ncommittee levels.\n  I have received a communication from the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget regarding this bill. While that letter describes \ncertain programs for which the Administration would like to see \nincreased funding, there is nothing in the letter to indicate that the \nPresident would not approve this bill if sent to the White House in its \npresent form. Likewise, I have letters from Secretary Glickman that \nmakes appeals for increased funding in some areas, and at the \nappropriate time, I will ask unanimous consent that these letters be \nentered into the Record.\n  The Senate Report to accompany this bill begins with the following \nstatement, ``Given the budgetary constraints that the Committee faces, \nthe bill as reported provides the proper amount of emphasis on \nagricultural and rural development programs, and on other programs and \nactivities funded by the bill.'' I believe this statement to be true. \nSenator Cochran has done an outstanding job in crafting a bill that is \nfair, and goes far in meeting the expectations of all Senators, and in \nview of the foregoing statement, I join Senator Cochran in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Still, we should all give pause to consider the first four words of \nthe statement I quoted above, ``Given the budgetary constraints'' and \nthe implication of those words for the work that this Congress must \ncomplete before September 30th. In terms of the bill before us today, \neach Senator will have to consider for his or her self whether the \n``budgetary constraints'' have weakened the programs in this bill \nbeyond the point they can allow. Over the past several years, we have \nseen programs at USDA, FDA, and the other agencies funded by this bill, \nsuffer a slow strangulation that is affecting programs and services to \nthe American people and the ability of the agencies to carry them out.\n  I do support my chairman, Senator Cochran, in urging the passage of \nthis bill, but I seriously hope that we have all come to the \nrealization that continued reductions in these programs must come to a \nhalt. It is for the full Senate to decide whether we have already gone \ntoo far.\n  Mr. President, during committee debate on this bill, an amendment was \ndiscussed, though never offered, that involved dairy pricing issues. \nThat amendment would have extended the life of the Northeast dairy \ncompact and created new compacts in other regions. In committee, I was \nwilling to delay the agriculture spending bill indefinitely to avoid \ninclusion of such an amendment. It concerns complex issues in the \njurisdiction of the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees--issues that \nhave no place on a funding bill. Also, if passed, the amendment would \ndo unacceptable damage to the dairy industry in the State of Wisconsin \nand all around the Upper Midwest. And finally, it would put in place \npermanently and nationally an unprecedented policy of regional \nprotectionism.\n  For these reasons, I, and many of my colleagues, oppose such an \namendment adamantly and will do everything within our rights to keep it \noff of this bill. To that end, I regret to inform my colleagues, I will \nnot be able to clear any amendments, no matter how uncontroversial, or \nagree to any manager's package, until it is clear no destructive dairy \namendment will be offered or included in this bill.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget and letters from the Secretary of Agriculture regarding this \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Herbert Kohl,\n     Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related \n         Agencies Appropriations, Committee on Appropriations, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on the Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the \n     Senate Subcommittee. Since the Administration has not had an \n     opportunity to review the Subcommittee's bill and report \n     language, our comments are based on preliminary information. \n     As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your \n     consideration of the Administration's views would be \n     appreciated.\n       The allocation of discretionary resources available to the \n     Senate under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply \n     inadequate to make the necessary investments that our \n     citizens need and expect. The President's FY 2000 Budget \n     proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet such \n     needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by \n     making savings proposals in mandatory and other programs \n     available to help finance this spending. Congress has \n     approved, and the President has signed into law, nearly $29 \n     billion of such offsets in appropriations legislation since \n     1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such \n     proposals.\n       The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee \n     to accommodate certain of the President's priorities within \n     the 302(b) allocation. However, the Subcommittee bill is over \n     $500 million, or four percent, below the program level \n     requested by the President. The FY 2000 Budget would increase \n     spending within the discretionary caps for agriculture and \n     other programs in the bill by 3.6 percent over comparable FY \n     1999 spending. We urge the Committee to consider the over \n     $600 million in user fees proposed in the Budget in order to \n     fund high-priority programs. Given the current period of \n     financial stress in the agricultural sector, now is not the \n     time to reduce assistance to farmers, ranchers, and rural \n     residents.\n       Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the \n     Subcommittee bill. We look forward to working with you to \n     resolve these concerns as the bill moves forward.\n\n\n                      food and drug administration\n\n       While the Administration is pleased that the Subcommittee \n     has reportedly provided an increase over the FY 1999 enacted \n     level for the FDA, we are disappointed that the Subcommittee \n     has apparently not funded the full request for the FDA, \n     including important youth tobacco prevention activities and \n     the proposed seafood inspection program transfer.\n       The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee's \n     apparent reduction of $40 million from the President's \n     request for non-foods/tobacco FDA activities would jeopardize \n     the FDA's ability to improve the public health infrastructure \n     through enhanced product safety assurance and injury \n     reporting systems.\n       The Administration is committed to Youth Tobacco Prevention \n     activities and urges the Committee to provide the requested \n     increase of $34 million for these programs. Every day, three \n     thousand young people become regular smokers. Reducing young \n     people's tobacco use would improve public health for \n     generations to come. This is particularly important in light \n     of the recent decision of the conferees on the FY 1999 \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to permit States to \n     retain the entire amount secured from tobacco companies \n     without any commitment whatsoever from the States that those \n     funds be used to reduce youth smoking. To help discourage \n     youth smoking, we urge the Congress to consider the \n     Administration proposal to increase tobacco taxes.\n\n\n                         food safety initiative\n\n       The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's support \n     for the President's Food Safety Initiative through increases \n     above the enacted and House bill levels provided to USDA and \n     FDA. Nonetheless, we are concerned that the Committee has \n     reportedly provided only $46 million of the $62 million \n     increase over FY 1999 levels requested in this bill for the \n     Initiative. American consumers enjoy the world's safest food \n     supply, but still too many Americans get sick, and in some \n     cases die, from preventable food-borne diseases. The \n     President's requested increase would provide critical \n     resources to expand USDA's and FDA's food safety research and \n     risk assessment capabilities. We strongly urge the Committee \n     to provide full funding at the requested levels for these \n     activities and consider the Administration's proposal to \n     charge user fees for Federal meat and poultry inspection \n     services in support of a safe food supply.\n\n\n                  women, infants, and children program\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the $33 million \n     increase for WIC over the House level. The Committee mark \n     should sustain a participation level of 7.4 million in FY \n     2000. We remain concerned, however, that this is still \n     insufficient to support the proposed average monthly \n     participation level of 7.5 million, thereby not achieving our \n     longstanding 7.5 million goal.\n\n\n                  food and nutrition service research\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to any provision of the \n     Committee bill that would prohibit the use of Food and \n     Nutrition Service (FNS) funds for research and evaluations on \n     nutrition programs. To address program integrity and \n     performance issues properly, it is crucial that research on \n     nutrition programs also occur in the context of the programs' \n     administration. We urge the Committee to provide funding for \n     these activities within FNS.\n\n\n                      common computing environment\n\n       The Administration is very concerned by the Subcommittee's \n     decision not to fund the Common Computing Environment, either \n     directly through the Support Service Bureau as requested in \n     the President's Budget or by providing additional funds in \n     the county-office agency salaries and expense accounts. Some \n     in Congress have criticized USDA this year for delays in \n     providing the crop-loss assistance funds to farmers that were \n     provided in P.L. 105-277, the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated \n     and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, and for long \n     waiting periods some farmers and rural residents have faced \n     in receiving other assistance through USDA county offices. \n     Yet this bill would not provide the funds needed to address \n     the very problems that contributed to the delays. At a time \n     when the farm community is under financial stress and the \n     demand for farm credit and other programs is high, the need \n     for timely and efficient service to producers and rural \n     residents has never been greater. Without the proposed $74 \n     million in funding, it will not be possible to modernize the \n     technology in USDA's local field offices, create ``one-stop \n     shopping'' for rural customers, and promptly deliver the \n     programs that Congress enacts with available staffing levels.\n\n\n                conservation and environmental programs\n\n       The Subcommittee bill appears to cut spending on key USDA \n     conservation programs by at least $140 million from the \n     President's request. The $26 million reduction in the \n     Environmental Quality Incentives program (EQIP) would mean \n     13,000 farmers and ranchers not receiving needed financial \n     and technical assistance to stop soil erosion, improve waste \n     treatment in animal feeding operations, and implement other \n     voluntary conservation measures critical to protecting our \n     natural resources. To further advance this important work, \n     including addressing the significant backlog of farmers' \n     requests for aid, the Administration requested a $100 million \n     increase in the EQIP program as part of its Clean Water \n     Action Plan. The combination of the EQIP reduction and the \n     Subcommittee's failure to fund the requested additional funds \n     for technical assistance to animal feeding operations could \n     damage livestock owners' progress toward ensuring that their \n     operations are environmentally sound and community-friendly.\n       Other valuable environmental programs would be severely \n     underfunded by the Subcommittee bill, and we urge the \n     Committee to restore funding for them. The Subcommittee \n     failed to fund the $50 million discretionary portion of the \n     Administration's request for the Farmland Protection Program, \n     which is part of the Administration's Lands Legacy \n     Initiative. America's farmers need these funds to help them \n     stay on their land, through easements that permanently \n     protect 80,000 acres of prime farmland from development. We \n     urge the Committee to provide the $50 million in \n     discretionary funds requested for the program and redirects \n     its savings from the Conservation Farm Option to this \n     program, as well as to the Wildlife Habitat Incentives \n     Program to assist over 3,000 farmers in protecting and \n     restoring wildlife habitat. In addition, the Subcommittee has \n     not provided the $12 million requested in the Conservation \n     Operations account to assess soil management's effects on \n     carbon sequestration, and $5 million for USDA's initiative to \n     help communities make use of geospatial data to make more \n     informed land use decisions and promote smart growth. The \n     Administration recommends funds be redirected to these high-\n     priority activities, such as by eliminating the Forestry \n     Incentives Program as requested and as included in the House \n     bill.\n\n\n              outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers\n\n       The Subcommittee bill does not provide the requested $7 \n     million increase for the Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged \n     Farmers program. This program has proven effective in \n     mitigating the decline in the number of minority farmers by \n     increasing their participation in agricultural programs, \n     assisting them in marketing and production, and improving the \n     profitability of their farming operations. USDA loan default \n     rates have also improved in areas where this program \n     operates. The requested increase is needed to expand this \n     program beyond the limited areas in which it now operates, to \n     further these farmers' equal access and their opportunity for \n     success, and to continue USDA's work to improve its civil \n     rights performance.\n\n\n                                research\n\n       The Subcommittee bill would fund USDA's National Research \n     Initiative at $81 million below the request of $200 million, \n     while providing funding for a large number of unrequested, \n     earmarked research grants. We urge the Committee to increase \n     the funding for competitive research grants and reduce \n     earmarks for lower-priority programs.\n\n\n                           rural development\n\n       The Administration appreciates the support in the \n     Subcommittee bill for priority USDA rural development \n     programs, such as water and wastewater loans and grants,\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\n     Business and Industry guaranteed loans, and rental assistance \n     for very-low income rural residents. The Administration is \n     concerned, however, that the Subcommittee bill's funding for \n     Rural Development salaries and expenses would jeopardize \n     effective implementation of these programs. The $25 million, \n     or five percent, reduction from the requested salaries and \n     expenses funding could require USDA to eliminate over 400, or \n     six percent, of its staff through a Reduction-In-Force. We \n     urge the Committee to provide the requested level of funding \n     to ensure an adequate delivery system for these vital \n     programs for rural America.\n       We look forward to working with the Committee to address \n     our mutual concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Department of Agriculture,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Herbert H. Kohl,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \n         Development, and Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Herb: The Department of Agriculture's (USDA) outreach \n     program to small, limited-resource, and minority farmers and \n     ranchers--known as the 2501 program--is critically important \n     to USDA's efforts to help these farmers weather the crisis \n     spreading across the farm country and to further the \n     accomplishments of the Department's civil rights agenda. \n     Unless this program is funded at the fully authorized level \n     for next fiscal year, as the Administration requested in its \n     budget, both of these objectives will suffer, as will, more \n     importantly, the thousands of farmers who benefit from the \n     2501 program. Congress has been extremely helpful in the past \n     with requests I have made with respect to my civil rights \n     initiative, and I hope you will once again respond positively \n     by working to see that next year's appropriations bill \n     includes the full $10 million I have requested.\n       Over the next year, USDA's estimates project crop prices, \n     and thus farm income, at about the current levels, levels \n     that have this year alone pushed demand for our credit \n     programs up some 65 percent over last year's requests. The \n     need for operating and refinancing credit has been especially \n     acute among limited resource farmers, and USDA has \n     aggressively sought to meet their requests. A crucial \n     component of responding to them has been more than just the \n     farm loans, it has been the technical assistance we have been \n     able to underwrite through the 2501 program whereby \n     cooperating institutions and groups have helped these farmers \n     assemble their financial projections and operating plans so \n     they could successfully apply for loans. If these groups \n     cannot continue to provide this assistance, as well as the \n     work they do making sure farmers know about our programs and \n     other sources of assistance, because the 2501 program is not \n     adequately funded, I fear that the decline in limited-\n     resource and minority farmers, in particular, will accelerate \n     and we will come ever closer to removing from American \n     agriculture a viable, capable segment of farmers who have \n     contributed richly to our rural and agrarian culture.\n       Last year, Congress took the nearly unprecedented step of \n     waiving the statute of limitations, opening the way for USDA \n     to settle the oldest civil rights cases filed against it for \n     alleged discrimination in USDA's lending programs, and a few \n     weeks ago, the federal court approved the consent decree the \n     Department reached to settle the class action discrimination \n     case brought against it for the same reason. Much needs to be \n     done, however, both in bringing these accomplishments to \n     fruition and all the other work I have launched across the \n     board to improve USDA's civil rights performance. The 2501 \n     program is vitally important to our strategy; it reaches the \n     farmers and ranchers too long neglected by the Department and \n     the ones whose complaints we have pledged and are obligated \n     to correcting. Without adequate resources, our reach will be \n     limited and the potential that I believe we have begun to see \n     will not be fully realized.\n       I appreciate fully the constraints within which the \n     Congress is working in assembling the fiscal year 2000 \n     appropriations bill, and I will no doubt be back in touch \n     with you through this process on this and other priorities; \n     but in view of the critical importance of this program and \n     the regrettable fact that the Subcommittee on Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of \n     Representatives, chose not to fund fully the Administration's \n     request, I decided I needed to point out to you the special \n     importance of this program and its high personal priority \n     with me. I hope you will give it and the Administration's \n     budget request positive consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Department of Agriculture,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Herbert Kohl,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \n         Development, and Related Agencies,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Herb: Now that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations \n     hearings are over, I want to thank you and your entire \n     subcommittee for your attention and courtesy to the \n     Department of Agriculture's (USDA) witnesses. I know you face \n     difficult decisions writing an appropriations bill responsive \n     to the needs of those who benefit from USDA programs, so I \n     want you to know also that we are ready to work with you \n     through the process of developing a bill that addresses your \n     priorities as well as the Department's.\n       USDA needs to modernize our county-based delivery system, \n     especially now so we can help farmers through these very \n     difficult times we are facing with reduced staff levels in \n     our local offices. This means we must continue our efforts to \n     carry out our Service Center Initiative (SCI), including the \n     installation of the Common Computing Environment (CCE). In \n     this respect, I want to direct your attention to our proposal \n     to spend $74 million under the new Support Services Bureau \n     (SSB) account to finance continued progress on the \n     modernization effort.\n       The Department could not provide detailed testimony on the \n     SSB for the simple reason that the SSB is not yet \n     operational. As indicated in the budget, the bureau will be \n     operational by October 1, 1999. It will consolidate \n     administrative management support activities for the Farm \n     Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and \n     Rural Development. One of its responsibilities will be to \n     continue to install and support the CCE. The $74 million \n     requested in the budget will finance continued business \n     process reengineering, data acquisition, and the necessary \n     hardware and software to move this effort forward.\n       This request is an extremely high priority. Implementation \n     of the SCI will improve customer service by providing \n     collocated agencies the ability to share information and \n     deliver services in a modern business manner. The problems we \n     are having providing timely assistance to our hard pressed \n     farmers in the current farm crisis best illustrates the need \n     for infrastructure and program delivery modernization. The \n     service center agencies' stove pipe technology systems and \n     program processes present real barriers to delivering \n     services in a modern way and optimizing the use of county-\n     level staff. For example, I am convinced that had this \n     initiative been complete we could have implemented the \n     disaster assistance programs from the FY 99 Omnibus \n     Appropriations bill much more quickly than we are doing.\n       As implementation proceeds, the SCI will streamline and \n     integrate services, reduce paperwork, and provide technology \n     so our customers can do business with us differently \n     including the use of the Internet. Since 1993, USDA has \n     significantly reduced staffing levels as a result of \n     reorganization and budget constraints. This investment in our \n     technology infrastructure and integrating business processes \n     is essential to maintaining and improving service to the \n     customers of our rural and county-based agencies.\n       The common computing environment is also critical to the \n     SSB. The effective consolidation of three separate and \n     largely redundant administrative systems into one, \n     nationwide, SSB is dependent on the timely deployment of \n     reengineered administrative systems and a modern technology \n     infrastructure.\n       I want to assure you that the technology our budget request \n     will finance is based on identified business needs. It \n     complies with USDA's overall information technology \n     architecture, and meets the Office of Management and Budget's \n     criteria for such investments.\n       The CCE will replace the existing stove piped agency \n     systems with a single, modern and flexible shared information \n     system built around servers and personal work stations. This \n     technology can be adapted to meet any changes brought about \n     by business process reengineering or by any future decisions \n     affecting the size of the agencies. If the budget request is \n     approved, including the funding mechanism proposed for the \n     SSB, we will establish clear accountability for this effort \n     in the Support Service Bureau with strong oversight from our \n     Chief Information Officer.\n       I am enclosing a briefing paper on the subject, and will \n     provide you any further information you need.\n       I am sending an identical letter to Congressman Skeen, \n     Congresswoman Kaptur, and Senator Cochran.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n       Enclosure.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the communications from the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Secretary of Agriculture make the case \nfor the need to provide additional resources for this bill. I am also \naware that funding constraints have prevented the bill from including \nlevels of spending for programs important to Senators. In support of, \nand in addition to, the comments provided by OMB and USDA, I would like \nto offer the following observations.\n  While this bill provides a substantial increase for the President's \nFood Safety Initiative, it does not meet the fully recommended level \nsubmitted by the President. Perhaps the greatest single responsibility \nof this subcommittee is to protect public health. That responsibility \nis carried out primarily through\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\noversight of the blood supply, the approval of medical drugs and \ndevices and, most certainly, the food supply.\n  Many of the procedures for protecting our food supply are now in \ntransition, moving toward a HACCP system that provides a new set of \nchecks and balances in the production, processing, manufacturing, and \ndistribution of food. In addition, we are learning through research new \ntechniques to help enhance the safety of the food we eat. It is \nunfortunate we are unable to find the resources within our ``budgetary \nconstraints'' to provide the fully requested increase. We should, at \nleast, provide the fully recommended level for inspections of meat and \npoultry provided for the Food Safety Inspection Service.\n  One of the most popular programs funded in this bill is the Women, \nInfants, and Children (WIC) program. Again, this bill provides a \nsignificant increase for this program and I am very happy to report \nthat the level appropriated, more than $4.038 billion, is determined to \nbe adequate to support an average program participation level of 4.7 \nmillion people, which is likely to be an increase above the FY 1999 \nparticipation average. However, we know that this program is not only \npopular, it works. It works in protecting people who are nutritionally \nat risk, and it works to protect the American taxpayer by lowering \nfuture health care costs. The President's budget would have allowed for \nthe program to grow to the fully targeted participation level of 7.5 \nmillion women, infants, and children and this Congress should be \nproviding the resources to make that happen.\n  In addition, this bill should be providing higher levels for WIC \nFarmers Market Program, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, the Nutrition, Education and Training Program, for the \nCommodity Assistance and Food Donation Programs and for the \nSecretary's Food Recovery and Gleaning initiative. Also, this bill \nshould restore full levels for the studies and evaluations activities \nof the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). It is curious that while Food \nStamp rolls are dropping, we are seeing increased demand for food \nassistance at shelters, through charitable organizations, and through \nthe various food donation programs. We need to understand this \nphenomena better and to do so, the agency in charge of these programs \nshould be given the tools to research and evaluate what is happening. \nAt the very least, a reasonable level of funds should be provided to \nFNS to conduction studies and evaluations of activities directly \nrelated to nutrition.\n\n  Agriculture has always been, and continues to be, the backbone of the \nAmerican economy and society. The history of this nation is firmly \ngrounded in the development of agriculture beginning with the earliest \nsettlers who learned farming techniques, such as fertilization, from \nNative Americans. The first Thanksgiving was, among other things, a \ncelebration of agriculture.\n  As the growth of America continued, agriculture was a driving force \neconomically, socially, and politically. Thomas Jefferson, whose \nphilosophy in so many ways personifies the national spirit, centered \nmuch of his political and governmental engineering around the role of \nthe farmer. In time, farming in this nation followed the lines of \nwestward expansion and filled the vast spaces of our interior with \ncontinuing advances in production and further development of democratic \nprinciples. When the United States entered the stage of world power, \nespecially during our two world wars and since, the American farmer \ncontinued to provide the basic necessities to keep our armed forces fed \nand our populations safe.\n  In so many ways, food security is an integral part of national \nsecurity. We all are aware of the hard times now facing farmers and the \nrural economy. Yet, without agriculture, and the economy that supports \nit, food shortages and disruptions would lead to urban panic and riots. \nNo region of the nation would be safe and our entire national security \nwould be at risk. In spite of these facts, we struggle to find the \nresources to protect agriculture. Can any Senator imagine how absurd it \nwould sound to stand here on the floor of the Senate and announce that \nwe simply can't afford national security? To a degree, that is what we \nare saying when we announce that we can't afford to help our farmers.\n  Does this bill fully fund the request for agricultural research, no \nit does not. Neither does it provide funding for initiatives to help \nfarmers overcome today's economic troubles through outreach to socially \ndisadvantaged farmers, small farmers, or to help USDA agencies protect \nagainst unwarranted market concentration. This bill does not provide \nadditional levels to help establish and hold on to foreign markets \nthrough export programs such as PL 480 which combines humanitarian \nassistance with overseas market development.\n  I am also disappointed that our allocation has prevented us from \nmaking the gains we should in the area of conservation and \nenvironmental protection. In order to achieve savings, this bill has \nhad to impose limitations on the Wetlands Reserve Program, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Conservation Farm \nOption program. It also fails to fully fund many of the other \nconservation initiatives recommended by the President.\n  In addition, if resources were available, we could provide additional \nfunds to help the environment, and the farmer, through the development \nof better methods for overcoming pesticide related problems. In the \nnear future, the fumigant methyl bromide is going to be removed from \nthe market and unless a viable alternative is developed, production of \nvarious commodities will fall sharply, much to the dismay of farmers \nand consumers who have come to take the availability of these food \nitems for granted. Also, this bill does not provide adequate levels for \nIntegrated Pest Management and for program increases requested for \nimplementation of the Food Quality Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, there are many other items I could describe and I do \nnot, in any way, want to detract from the fine work of my colleague, \nSenator Cochran. As I stated earlier, my friend from Mississippi has \ndone an outstanding job in crafting this bill with the resources he was \ngiven, and I support him and this bill. I simply feel it is my \nresponsibility to remind my colleagues that everything is not \nnecessarily fine simply because things are not getting a whole lot \nworse.\n  I don't know if this subcommittee will receive any additional \nresources between now and when this bill goes to conference with the \nHouse. We can't count on that happening and we must realize that what \nwe approve here may be all that is finally included in the \nappropriations for these programs in fiscal year 2000. As we proceed \nwith this bill on the floor, it is important that we all work together \nfor what is best for all farmers and for all areas of rural America, \nand for all Americans.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Thurmond, I ask unanimous consent the privilege of the \nfloor be granted to Ernie Coggins, a legislative fellow, during the \npendency of S. 1233.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we are \nhopeful we can take up amendments that Senators may have on this \nlegislation. We will have between now and about 5:30 available for that \npurpose. The leader had announced when the Senate recessed last week \nthat a vote was anticipated at or about 5:30 today. It could be that a \nvote on an amendment to the bill will occur at about 5:30 today.\n  If Senators would like to offer an amendment and get a vote, this is \nan opportunity to do that--debate the amendment, explain the amendment; \nthe managers are available here to consider any suggested changes in \nthe bill. We invite Senators to come to the floor and offer their \namendments or make statements on the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1233, the fiscal year 2000 agriculture appropriations bill. I commend \nSenator Cochran\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\nand Senator Kohl for bringing forward what I believe is a solid bill to \nfund our most important programs in agriculture and provide continued \nbenefits to rural America. This has been no easy task. With the tight \nbudget caps that are in place, preparing this bill was a very difficult \ntask, and I applaud the Senator for his hard work in this area.\n  Let me just say a word about the Senator from Mississippi in this \nregard. There is a routine procedure in this body and that is to thank \nthe hard-working chairmen of our Senate committees, and, of course, \ntheir ranking members, for their hard work in bringing important \nlegislation to the floor. That practice is certainly appropriate in \nregard to the Senators who have worked to bring this bill to our \nconsideration, including the chairman, as I have indicated, and the \ndistinguished ranking member from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. But I would \nlike to offer three cheers and a ``well done'' to Senator Cochran.\n  If there is a Senator who I think everyone would agree is the epitome \nof a Southern gentleman and a Senator who goes about his work with \ndignity and decorum and truly still gets things done, that Senator is \nSenator Cochran. Here we are in the midst of all sorts of problems and \nchallenges in agriculture today, unprecedented situations, really, what \nwith the world depression that is still hindering our markets, unfair \ntrading practices by our competitors, record world production that has \ncaused market declines in virtually every commodity, trade policy that \nis hampered by all sorts of challenges, the need for sanctions reform, \ncrop insurance reform, and tax policy changes and reform. The list goes \non, as has been mentioned by the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, including the need for emergency assistance under the \ncurrent farm bill. We are going to be debating all this and the answers \nindividual Senators will bring to this debate and to this legislation. \nBut through it all we will have the steady hand of Senator Cochran and \nhis calm and reasoned and experienced leadership. I thank the Senator \nfor the job he has done for our farmers and ranchers, the men and women \nof rural America who work so hard to feed our Nation and a troubled and \nhungry world.\n  Chairman Cochran has presented a bill that really freezes the \ndiscretionary spending at the fiscal 1999 level, while still managing \nto provide increased funding in several areas, including agriculture \nresearch, the staffing for the farm service agencies, and the Food \nSafety Inspection Service. I mention the freeze in particular because \nwhat we would like to do, as we consider the 13 major appropriations \nbills, as we are going through that process, is stick to the budget as \nbest as we possibly can. Obviously, if we do that, interest rates will \nremain low. Hopefully, we will control inflation, because interest \nrates are of tremendous importance to the farmer and rancher, and, for \nthat matter, every business person in America.\n  Investing in agriculture research, as Senator Cochran and Senator \nKohl have done, is perhaps one of the most important investments we can \nmake as a nation. Today our farmers and ranchers actually produce more \nfood to feed more people on less land--on less land--than ever \nbefore. That is a modern day miracle, and it is a miracle in no short \npart because of agriculture research.\n\n  Ag research has played a major role in increasing the productivity of \nour Nation's farms in the past century. The projections indicate that \nas the world's population continues to grow in the next 50 years, the \nworld understandably will have to dramatically increase its agriculture \nproduction and its food output. The United States will be the leader in \nthis quest to feed, as I have indicated before, a troubled and hungry \nworld with a growing population, but we are not going to be successful \nwithout this continued commitment to agriculture research funding. The \nSenators have done that in regard to their subcommittee work, and it is \nnow before the Senate for our consideration.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran for his efforts to increase funding for \nthe Farm Service Agency staff. I know any increased funding for any \nGovernment program or Government agency staff is not very popular in \nWashington. I have often had my own concerns with such increases. I \nassure my colleagues that this increased funding is desperately needed.\n  Many county farm service agencies--that is the old ASCS--have been \nswamped by the number of loan deficiency payment and USDA lending \nrequests they have had to address. As a matter of fact, when we \nconsidered the farm bill of 1996, I do not think any of us would have \nimagined the vulnerability of the Farm Service Agency or the demands on \nthe Farm Service Agency as a result of the LDP payments that came into \nplay. Despite the best efforts of our county offices to serve our \nproducers in a timely and efficient manner, the staffing necessary to \naccomplish this goal simply has not been up to the level needed to \nprovide the quality of service that our producers expect.\n  I also thank the chairman and the ranking member for increases in the \nFSIS budget. That is an acronym which stands for the Food Safety and \nInspection Service. A safe food supply is essential, and our consumers \ndemand it. As my colleagues know, my State of Kansas is one of the \nlargest beef producers in the world, with a large number of packing \noperations as well. With a continued shortage of inspectors in the \nTopeka district, I am concerned, and I hope and expect the Secretary of \nAgriculture to address these deficiencies--I know he will--through this \nincreased funding. I also ask him to contact the Congress and inform us \nof any continued shortfalls that may be occurring.\n  Before I close, I want to address what I know is also a very critical \nconcern of many of my colleagues, and that is the tough times we are \nexperiencing throughout rural America. Every farm organization, every \ncommodity group, every producer one visits with obviously tells the \nsame story. I thank Senator Cochran for making it very clear we are \ngoing to work with the President and we are going to work in a \nbipartisan fashion--we have already had several meetings since the \nfirst of the year--to try to address this.\n  When the President does inform the Congress, along with the help of \nSecretary Glickman and others, on what kind of an additional package is \nnecessary and some of the specifics as the crops are harvested, we will \nbe more than willing to take a hard look at this need as harvest season \nmoves along. We did last year. The process, as the Senator has pointed \nout, was a little backward in regard to how we approached that. Let's \ndo the right thing in regard to the President making his \nrecommendation and working with us and we will work with him.\n\n  I agree with Senator Cochran; prior to the President's request, we \ncan do a lot of talking about it, and we have for the last several \nyears, but I believe that would be premature. Secretary of Agriculture \nDan Glickman, my good friend and colleague from Kansas, was quoted in \nthe press last week as saying it would be preferable to go in that \ndirection and it was too early to determine the size of any package \nthat may be needed.\n  In the meantime, I am committed, as a member of the authorizing \ncommittee, the Senate Agriculture Committee, to pursuing the long-term \ngoals needed to ensure the long-term financial viability of our farmers \nand ranchers. Senator Cochran and others have talked at length in this \nChamber about these, about the crucial needs--expanded export markets, \nsanctions reform, embargo policies, tax reform, regulatory relief, crop \ninsurance reform--all of the things we talked about, by the way, when \nwe were trying to put together the 1996 farm bill.\n  There was a list. There was a ledger, as a matter of fact. In those \ndays, I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee as we put that together. We said: Look, if we go \nto a more market-oriented farm policy--we all wanted that and we wanted \nproducer flexibility to meet the producer's individual needs, to \nrestore the decisionmaking back to the farm level as opposed to \nWashington--we can do that but only in a component package of other \nthings we need to do.\n  Quite frankly, I must tell my colleagues that we, and I am using the \neditorial we--Democrats, Republicans, the administration, the Senate \nand the House--we have not done that. We have not gone down that list \nthat I and others put on the ledger. There is no pride\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nof authorship here. We need to do it now. Had we done it then and 2 \nyears ago, I do not think the situation would be nearly as grave \nthroughout our rural areas. Let's get cracking on these challenges, as \nwell as meeting the crucial spending needs or the appropriation needs \nin regard to U.S. agriculture.\n  I mentioned expanded export markets, sanctions reform, tax reform, \nregulatory relief--all of that. We need to pass this legislation and \nmove to a very quick conference with the House. The programs funded in \nthis legislation are too important to be delayed. We need action on \nthem.\n  I commend, again, Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl for their fine \nefforts on this legislation under very difficult funding circumstances. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nto quick passage and then working with my colleagues on the other \npolicy changes I have mentioned, and, yes, I know at the end of \nharvest, we will work with the President, we will work with everybody \non that side of the aisle to put together a reasonable program of \nrelief because we have yet to see the relief in our markets. This has \nbeen going on now for 2 years.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl for their efforts. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am genuinely flattered by the kind and \ngenerous comments of my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts. As others know, he served with distinction as chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee in the other body. He led the passage of farm \nlegislation in that body, and he has been a very effective spokesman \nfor the farmers and ranchers of the entire country, not just of his \nhome State of Kansas. We benefit from his advice and counsel. I \nappreciate his personal friendship as well and taking time to talk \nabout this legislation and point out what we are trying to accomplish \nby funding the programs in this bill. I appreciate his remarks very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague, Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota, I will be very brief. I did not come to the Chamber with \nprepared remarks, but I do want to pick up on the closing remarks my \ncolleague from Kansas was making; by the way, a Senator who has lived \nand breathed agriculture for many years and whose expertise I certainly \nrespect.\n  I think the appropriations bill raises a lot of questions that we \nbetter answer and we better answer soon. I do not really think we can \nhave a discussion about agriculture--the Senator from Kansas at the \nvery end said: Listen, as I speak today, I am mindful of the economic \npain out there in the countryside.\n  We are experiencing an economic convulsion in agriculture. Frankly, I \ndo not think there is any way to talk about what is happening in the \ncountryside without talking about this Freedom to Farm, what I have \nalways called the ``freedom to fail'' bill.\n  In my State of Minnesota, the Minnesota Star Tribune--which is the \nlargest newspaper in our State, which editorialized very strongly in \nfavor of this bill not that long ago--had an editorial saying, listen, \nwe need to revisit this.\n  Clearly, we do not have any safety net any longer. Clearly, we do not \nhave a way that farmers--family farmers, family farmers, family \nfarmers; we need to say that three or four times --have any leverage in \nthe marketplace to get a decent price.\n  I think one of the really bitter ironies of what is going on is we \nare spending--this was supposed to be the market--$25, $30 billion of \nbailout money--and actually I am all for getting the credit to farmers \nso they can live to farm another day, but most of the farmers in \nMinnesota basically say, thank you, but, in fact, they are going to \nneed even more to be able to keep on going.\n  But what they also say is: Senator Wellstone, what's even more \nimportant to me is, where will we be 5 years from now? Where will our \nkids be 5 years from now? I am just telling you that I know on our \nside, the Democrats, we are going to be out here--and I am hoping with \na lot of Republicans as well--with a whole package of proposals.\n  Time is not neutral. We cannot wait around. Time is not neutral at \nall for these farmers. The projections for the number of farms we have \nlost in Minnesota and we will lose on our present course are \ndevastating. We have to change that course.\n  I think maybe we need more of a reality check. We can talk about the \nfact that we all care about agriculture, and we have this bill, and we \nare spending this much money, and all the rest, but this isn't business \nas usual. We are talking about a crisis, all spelled out in capital \nletters. We have to take some action. If we do not take some action, \nthen I think this will be kind of the last stage of just losing the \nfamily farm structure in agriculture.\n  By the way, when I am talking about family farms, I am talking less \nabout the size of the farm, though I do think there are clearly some \nlimits, as far as I am concerned, when we talk about any kind of \nsubsidy or support. I am talking about the pattern of the \ndecisionmaking; I am talking about entrepreneurship; I am talking about \nthe family farm as in the people who work the land, live on the land, \nthat they make the decisions. That is what I am talking about.\n  So I just want to make it really clear, whether or not you take the \ncap off the loan rate, whether or not you figure out a way to have corn \nand wheat in the same kind of ratio in relation to the price that we \nnow have for soybeans--a lot of farmers in Minnesota are planting \nsoybeans, soybeans, soybeans. This whole Freedom to Farm bill is a \nnightmare. The sooner people here are going to be willing to face up to \nit, the better.\n  As I said before--I will say it again--it was a great bill for \nCargill. It was a great bill for the big grain companies. And it is a \nliving nightmare for family farmers. They cannot cash flow on the price \nthey receive. If we do not talk about price, price, price, then, \nfrankly, we are not going to enable people to make it. So that is my \nfirst point.\n  My second point, speaking just for Senator Kohl, who stepped off the \nfloor briefly--and I include myself in his camp; I know Senator \nFeingold has the same belief--one of the reasons we are on the floor is \nbecause we are not going to see any extension of the dairy compact. \nThose of us from the Midwest are not going to let that happen. If there \nis one thing I do agree with, it is the adage that all politics is \nlocal. We are here to fight for people in our States. We are not going \nto let dairy farmers in our States come out on the short end of the \nstick. So just to be crystal clear about that, that is just not going \nto happen.\n  My third point--and I will have two others, I say to Senator Dorgan; \nthe third and fourth point I can do in 2 or 3 minutes--is that we have \na good piece of legislation which ought to be slam dunked. It ought to \nbe slam dunked. There ought to be 100 votes for it. The sooner we get \nto it, the better--price disclosure. You have this situation where it \nis not just the grain farmers; it is not just the dairy farmers; it is \nour livestock producers as well.\n  I have said it many times, but it is worth saying again on the floor \nof the Senate. You have this bitter irony of our hog producers facing \nextinction, our pork producers facing extinction, and the packers are \nin hog heaven. They are making record profits. We want to know what is \ngoing on.\n  So at the very minimum, our family farmers who are not vertically \nintegrated, our family farmers who do not represent the conglomerates \nthat have so effectively muscled their way to the dinner table, \nexercising their power over so much of the food industry, want to know \nexactly what people are being paid for their product. We think that \nought to be public information. We think our family farmers have a \nright to know that. I just will say that this ought to be slam dunked. \nThere ought to be 100 votes for it; the sooner the better. What are we \nwaiting for?\n  I could go on and on, and later on, when it is appropriate, I will \nbring out any number of different studies, with a lot of data, because \nI think it is really worth talking about. In some ways I almost find \nthis ironic. I think maybe I am going to pick up on an argument that \nsome of my Republican colleagues like to make about the problem of just \nthrowing money at a problem. With all\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\ndue respect, if we do not change this structure of agriculture, a lot \nof the family farmers in the Midwest, South, all the family farmers who \nare left in the country, are just not going to make it. They are not \ngoing to make it.\n  Everywhere you look, in all sectors of the food industry, whether it \nbe the input side or the output side--from whom the farmers buy, to \nwhom they sell--you are lucky if you have four firms that dominate only \n50 percent of the market. Quite often it is more than 50 percent of the \nmarket. It isn't even an oligopoly. It isn't even four firms dominating \n50 percent of the market. It is a monopoly structure. Whether it be the \npackers, the stockyards, the USDA, or the Justice Department, we need \nantitrust action. We need antitrust action. We need to put some free \nenterprise back into the food industry.\n  Give the family farmers in Minnesota a level playing field, give them \na fair shake, and they can compete against anybody. But right now what \nyou have is a situation where these conglomerates have muscled their \nway to the dinner table and exercised their raw political power over \nfamily farmers, over consumers, over taxpayers, and we need antitrust \naction.\n  That means we have to take on big economic interests. That means we \nhave to take on some of the largest contributors on the floor of the \nSenate. My colleague, Senator Feingold, said the other day he was going \nto start calling a kind of rollcall of big contributors as we go to \ndifferent bills. On agriculture I probably ought to come out here and \njust go over the list of contributions. It is not for a particular \nSenator but the Senate.\n  All of us need to change the system of contributions that come from \nthese packers, that come from these big agribusinesses, that come from \nthose corporate giants, because, frankly, we seem to be afraid to take \nthem on. But if we are not willing to take them on and we are not \nwilling to have antitrust action for real competition, our family \nfarmers cannot make it.\n  So I just say that now is the time. We have legislators coming in to \nWashington, DC tonight. Many of them travel out here with their own \nincome. They do not have a lot of income. Many of them are farmers from \nState legislatures. Many of them work with really good grass-roots \norganizations.\n  This isn't business as usual. So sometime, whether it be on this \nbill, whether it be within the next month, whether it be in the fall, \nthis Senate has to take some action that makes a real difference to \nfamily farmers so they have some kind of future. One of the first \nthings we have to do is be honest, just declare that the Freedom to \nFarm bill has been a ``freedom to fail'' bill. We need to change this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few opening comments as a member of \nthe subcommittee. The Appropriations Committee is an interesting and a \nvery productive committee. I am a member of the subcommittee that is \nchaired by Senator Cochran from Mississippi and whose ranking member is \nSenator Kohl from Wisconsin. I commend them for the job they do. It is \nnot an easy job.\n  We have the classic problem of economizing. The definition by an \neconomist of that is trying to fulfill unlimited wants with limited \nresources. That is not a very easy thing to do.\n  As I start, let me again compliment the work of Senator Cochran and \nSenator Kohl.\n  I will talk also about some of the challenges that we face that are \nnot in any way addressed by this legislation. The legislation funds a \nrange of issues with respect to the Department of Agriculture and \nagricultural programs. We need to do better in some of those areas.\n  I specifically mention the human nutrition study programs that exist \nin USDA. The administration had proposed a very substantial investment \nin those programs. We have not been able to meet that. I hope we can, \nbecause the work that goes on in those human nutrition labs is very \nimportant work in the nutrition area.\n  There are a number of other areas where we need to do better in \nresearch and agricultural-related areas, but I want to talk a bit about \nthe crisis that faces our family farmers. We are going to have a \nDemocratic Policy Committee hearing on Wednesday morning here in the \nCapitol from 9:30 to 11:30 on this subject: the farm crisis. We have a \nvery serious problem on America's family farms. Frankly, we need to \naddress it. I hope we can do that in a bipartisan manner.\n  This weekend I was in North Dakota. I drove to Finely, ND, for an \nevent in the American Legion hall in Finely that had to do with a rural \nempowerment zone. Once again, in Finely, ND, as I would have found in \nevery part of North Dakota, family farmers told me that they are not \ngoing to be able to make it much longer unless something changes. You \ncannot plant seeds in our ground, then tend those seeds, fertilize, \nspray for pests, hope they grow, hope it doesn't hail, hope the plants \ndevelop, hope it doesn't rain too much but rains enough, hope against \ncrop disease and then, at the end, finally harvest that grain and take \nit to the elevator, only to discover that the elevator or the grain \ntrader is willing to pay you a $1, $1.50 or $2 a bushel less than what \nit cost to produce the grain. That is not a formula for success. That \nis a formula for failure. Most family farmers know they will not last \nlong with that kind of a formula.\n  Will Rogers once said: When there is no place left to spit, you \neither have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. \nWell, there is no place left to spit. That is not a delicate way to say \nit, but there is no place left to spit on these issues. The current \nfarm program is not providing price supports that are able to help \nfamily farmers continue in operation during a time of collapsed prices. \nIt just isn't. We had to do an emergency piece last year, and we did \nthat in the appropriations process. I commend all of those who were \ninvolved in it, including the Senator from Mississippi. My colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Conrad, myself and many others worked to \nmake sure that we did an emergency piece that provided some income \nsupport for families during collapsed prices. But the prices are still \ncollapsed. We will not have many family farmers left unless we provide \nsome mechanism of supporting prices here in the Congress.\n  Is it our job? No, it would be better if we could get the price in \nthe marketplace. But that is not happening. The price in the \nmarketplace is dismal. Farmers are told that their hogs aren't worth \nmuch and their cattle are not worth much. The grain isn't worth much \ntoo.\n  There was a time when you could speak on the Senate floor when the \nfarmer was hauling a hog to market and getting 10 cents a pound. In \nfact, that farmer could go to the grocery store in that small town and \ndiscover that it would cost him three times as much to buy a relatively \nsmall ham than he was able to get for the whole hog.\n  Now, there is something wrong with that. When prices collapse, if we \nwant family farmers left in our country's future, then we have to do \nsomething about it.\n  My colleague from Minnesota talked about the need to reform the \nsystem. I was not able today to hear my colleague from Mississippi or \nmy colleague from Wisconsin as they opened this discussion, but I know \nthat they are well aware of the farm crisis. I will hold up a couple \ncharts, if I might.\n  This chart shows the number of farm youth, down 82 percent since \n1970, fairly steadily. We are ending up without any young people left \nin rural America.\n  This chart shows the last year for which we have net income data. It \nshows the change in net income, 1996 and 1997. We do not have the next \n2 years. North Dakota lost 90 percent of its net income; Minnesota, 42 \npercent. These are net income losses. It would be interesting to know, \nI wonder how any wage earner would handle it if 90 percent of their \nincome were gone. I wonder what Wall Street would do if they discovered \nthat some industry of theirs had suffered a 90-percent loss. Think that \nwould crash, that industry? You bet your life, in a moment.\n  But on the family farm, in 1 year a change in net income, down 38 \npercent in Nebraska, 28 percent in South Dakota, 90 percent in North \nDakota, these figures change from year to year and State to State. The \nfact is, we have seen a dramatic change in net income in a negative way \nin my State and others. It results from a collapse in prices.\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\n  Now, there are people who say that is because EEP wasn't used. It is \nbecause of this or that other thing, 100 different reasons. The fact \nis, it is price. You can come up, I suppose, with your own notions of \nhow to increase price in the marketplace, but I think we have a failure \nhere.\n  The failure is that we have a farm program that says: Let us not care \nabout supporting prices. Whatever the price in the marketplace place \nis, if it is 10 cents for hogs or if it is $2.50 for wheat, that is \njust tough luck. That is the way the market is. So let's have farmers \nget whatever they get from the marketplace.\n  The problem with that is, we won't have many family farmers left, if \nthat is the attitude we take, because the marketplace doesn't work for \nagriculture. There is no free market for agriculture. Everybody knows \nit. Anybody that comes out here and preaches about a free market for \nagriculture is preaching a sermon that is not worth listening to.\n  Now, my colleague from Minnesota talked about the issue of \nmonopolies. I want to talk about that just for a moment. I want to show \na cartoon that appeared in the newspaper in Lincoln, NE, the Lincoln \nJournal Star. The cartoon shows something that I have previously spoken \nabout on the floor of the Senate. The cartoon says: If the grain to \nmake this costs pennies--talking about grocery cereal--and I have to \npay $3.95, who gets all the rest? And here is a picture of a farmer \ngiving up.\n  It is interesting that at a time when prices have collapsed for \ngrain, cereal manufacturers have announced that they will increase the \nprice of their cereal. I found it interesting that when grain prices \nincreased a few years ago, wheat went to $5.50 a bushel, the cereal \nmanufacturers were complaining that they had to increase cereal prices \nbecause grain prices were strengthening. So grain prices collapse, drop \nin half. What happens to cereal prices? They go up. What is wrong with \nthat picture? It seems to me you would fail third grade math with that \nkind of calculation.\n  The point that the Senator from Minnesota made is an accurate point. \nIn every direction the farmer looks, the farmer faces either a monopoly \nor a near monopoly. Let's say the farmer raises grain and wants to have \nit transported. So the farmer takes it to the railroad and the railroad \noperator says: We will transport that grain for you. And they tell the \nfarmer exactly what it will cost. If the farmer doesn't like it, it is \ntough luck.\n  In our State, our State Public Service Commission says the railroads \novercharge North Dakota, principally farmers but all businesses. They \novercharge North Dakota farmers $100 million a year. How can they do \nthat? No competition. We do not have three railroads vying for that \nbusiness. When you have near monopoly or a monopoly, they charge what \nthey want. So when the farmer goes to the grain trade and decides to \nsell their grain, what do they find? Only a few companies control most \nof the grain trade.\n  Two of those companies now want to get married. Continental and \nCarghill decided they like each other so much they don't want to \ncompete anymore. They want to get together. So now they have this \nmerger proposal, meaning more concentration. Does that make sense for \nfarmers? To me, it doesn't. I do not think they ought to be allowed to \nmerge.\n  Then when the farmers decide that they want to sell their fat \nsteers--they had some calves and they raised some fat steers and \nheifers--they take them to market. Eighty-seven percent of the fat \nsteer market slaughter in this country is controlled by three \ncompanies, three. So they tell the farmers and ranchers: Here is what \nwe are going to pay you.\n  They say it is a free market. Of course, it is not free. So let's \nassume that the grain trade wasn't throttled at the neck of the bottle \nby a concentration of large corporations, and instead you had a free \nmarket.\n  Is it a free market for our producers, who raise a steer or heifer or \ncow and want to sell the beef to Japan, are faced with a 50-percent \ntariff because of a beef agreement with Japan, which does come down a \nlittle year by year, but snaps back up if you get more beef in? \nCurrently, as I understand it, the tariff on beef going into Japan is \n45 percent. Is that fair? I don't think so.\n  Or China sends us all their shoes and trousers and shirts and \ntrinkets, and they have a $50 billion to $60 billion trade surplus with \nus, or we a deficit with them, and they say: When we want wheat, we \nwant to buy it elsewhere; plus we want to keep part of your wheat out, \nand we don't want your hogs at all. Is that fair trade? Does a farmer \nhave a right to complain about that? I think so. In every single \ndirection, farmers have a right to say it is not a free market.\n  Let me mention trade. Our family farmers--despite having mentioned \nsome trade with Japan and China, our family farmers are furious about \nour trade situation with Canada. We passed this NAFTA bill here in the \nCongress. I didn't vote for it, but everybody who voted for it, I \nguess, felt that the people who sold it said we were going to get some \n300,000 new jobs in America with this NAFTA.\n  NAFTA turned a trade surplus with Mexico into a trade deficit very \nquickly and doubled the trade deficit we have with Canada. Now the \nfancy economists who decided they wanted to make money putting out \nstudies telling us how wonderful NAFTA was going to be are saying: \nMaybe we were wrong. When you pass an agreement that creates huge \ndeficits, lose jobs instead of gaining jobs, you are wrong.\n  But take a look at the trade back and forth across the border. What \nyou will find with Canada is, we have massive quantities of Canadian \ngrain coming in and undercutting our American farmers, and you can't \nget much American grain into Canada. I have been to the border there. I \nwas riding in an orange truck trying to get durum wheat into Canada. I \ncould not do it. But I saw Canadian trucks hauling Canadian wheat \nsouth. Is that fair trade? I don't think so.\n  That is what farmers face, unequal treatment. If you wipe all that \naway and just have farmers trade in the open market, free trade or fair \ntrade, then when the farmer competes against the European grain or \nlivestock producer in an international marketplace, how do you get \naround the fact that the Europeans subsidize their grain sales 10 times \nour subsidy--10 times? We say to our farmers, well, that is fair; it \nwould be like a competition, let's give the other team a huge head \nstart and then say it is a fair competition.\n  I don't know what people are thinking about. It is not fair. It \ndoesn't make any sense. Our farmers in this country have a right to be \nvery upset, because I don't think they have been supported very well by \nour range of policies, our agricultural and trade policies. They have \nnot been fair and consistent.\n  On the United States-Canada free trade agreement, I was in Montreal \nwhen Clayton Yeutter was negotiating with Canada. I will tell you what \nhappened with Canada. The U.S. agricultural interests got traded away--\nflat out traded away. This country got something for it. I wasn't in \nthe room, but I guess we got access to 20-some million people for the \nfinancial services industry, and so this country got something for it. \nBut farmers got traded way. So at the end of the time, we got an \nagreement that weakened section 22, all of our trade remedies, and then \nwe got a piece of paper from Clayton Yeutter, the Trade Ambassador. I \ncould read it, but generally the paper said we have essentially a \nspirit between us that, following the agreement, there will not be a \nsubstantial increase in grain flowing across the border one way or the \nother. That wasn't worth the paper it was written on. It was a \nguarantee.\n\n  I was on the Ways and Means Committee; that is where this had to \noriginate--the passing of the language on the agreement--and we got \nfrom the Trade Ambassador a guarantee that was worthless. We \nimmediately began to see a massive quantity of grain coming into our \ncountry in a manner, in my judgment, that clearly violates our trade \nlaws--dumping below the cost of acquisition.\n  Now, I know some of this is probably confusing and difficult. But I \nwant to illustrate this point. The U.S. farmers said: Wait a second, \nthis is not fair; we were told by our Trade Ambassador's office this \nwasn't going to happen. We have it in writing, we have a guarantee; \nthis isn't fair. So action was taken against the Canadians to try to \nstop it.\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\n  Do you know what we discovered in that action? A side deal had been \nmade between the Trade Ambassador's office and the Canadians that was \nnever disclosed to Congress, never a part of debate. It gave to the \nCanadians, in selling into the American marketplace the ability to go \nbelow acquisition cost, the Canadians will not have to include their \nfinal grip payment--it is called a grip payment--to their farmers.\n  So what they did was set aside part of the cost of the acquisition of \nthat grain and said that will not be considered. By definition, the \nformula says they can sell at below cost in this marketplace and they \nwill not be in violation, because there was a separate side deal \nbetween our Trade Ambassador and the Canadians, in effect, selling out \nthe interests of our farmers.\n  Do farmers have a right to be upset about that? Do they have a right \nto be concerned about policymakers who don't support our farmers' \ninterests? You bet your life they do. Now, we have to decide in this \nCongress whether we are going to be willing to rebuild and invest and \nstrengthen family farms.\n  Let me make this point. I am not at all bashful about coming to the \nfloor and saying we need this help. We were just in a conference \ncommittee--I was part of it--in which the President said: We need some \nadditional money for Kosovo. We need money for Kosovo. So Congress \nsaid: Well, how much do you need? The President said: Well, we need $16 \nbillion. Congress said: No, you don't need that, you need more than \nthat. So Congress added $6 billion to the President's request, saying: \nWe don't think you have asked for enough money. If it is for defense, \nwe don't think you have asked for enough money. There are those who \nsaid that the sky is the limit for defense. They said: The President \ndidn't ask for enough, and we want to add $6 billion more.\n  I say to them, what about the issue of family farming in this \ncountry? What about the issue of agriculture? That is here at home. \nThose are our interests. That is not Kosovo. That is not bridges. That \nis not investment in weapons. That is here in this country. What about \nthat? Is that not a priority? Are we not willing to decide that we will \nprovide that resource?\n  Some say, well, the President should ask for it. Yes, he should, but \nthe President didn't ask for the extra $6 billion Congress put in the \nemergency bill for defense. So apparently you have two standards. The \nPresident doesn't have to ask for the extra $6 billion for defense, but \nhe must for agriculture. Well, those who say the President needs to be \ninvolved and ask for it, they are right. Let's have him do that. I want \nhim to be engaged here with a request, and I think he will be.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In listening to the Senator's very eloquent remarks, the \nSenator from North Dakota really does understand the depth of the \nproblems in agriculture. He has been one of our great leaders in \nfighting for family farms and our rural communities, in making \nstatements and comments about the lack of free trade and the other \neconomic conditions that are working against the farmer.\n  What I really wanted to ask the Senator is, What role do the \nincreasing sorts of conglomerates, vertical integration, the fact that \nwe are getting fewer and fewer hog farms, for example, that we are \nexperiencing in Iowa and other places, smaller and smaller numbers of \nmeatpackers and slaughterers in this country--when you look at the \nincreasing concentration, what, I might ask, is this doing, and what \neffect does this increasing concentration have in reducing the price \nthat the farmer gets?\n  In other words, we saw the cartoon about the person in the grocery \nstore saying, ``It only pays pennies. Who gets the rest?'' I ask the \nSenator from North Dakota again, what is the effect on the farmer?--in \nother words, what the farmer is getting from the consumer's dollar, \nbecause in the past you had a lot of competitors out there competing \nagainst one another to take the raw product and get it to market. Now \nyou have just a few. You have a very narrow funnel now. It has been my \nopinion and observation, based upon a lot of economic data, that this \nsmall funnel now they have to go to, the few meatpackers and \nprocessors, vertical integration, basically that is where the consumer \ndollars stops, and it is not getting back to the farmer.\n\n  The Senator has been very eloquent on this issue of the increasing \nconcentration and what that means for family farming; does the Senator \nshare that feeling?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The share the farmer gets from the food dollar has \ndiminished about 20 percent.\n  All the other interests that touch what the farmers produce make a \nlot of money, and many of them are making record profits right now. The \nfarmer raises the grain; buys the tractor, plows the ground in the \nspring, tends the land; and takes all the risk. They harvest it and \nwork hard.\n  Family farmers don't make much money. Now they are losing a lot of \nmoney. Even in the best of years they don't make that much money, \ntaking into account all the unforeseen risks. They put the product on a \nrailcar to market; it goes to a cereal manufacturing plant. The rail \ncar company makes money and the railroad companies are making record \nprofits. The grain trade makes profits. The grain goes to a cereal \nplant and they take that wheat and inject it with some air. Now it \nbecomes puffed wheat. They package it in a bright colored, big box, \nwith cellophane wrapping that can't be opened in the morning and they \nsend it to a grocery store.\n  Farmers, last year, lost their shirt on the very same wheat that was \npuffed up by air and produced by the cereal manufacturers. The farmers \nlost their shirt; the cereal manufacturers make record profits.\n  Something is wrong. Those who haul it, those who trade it--every step \nalong the way the big economic interests are making big profits. It is \nthe folks who grow it that are told: No, somehow you don't matter.\n  On this Earth, every single month, we add another New York City in \npopulation; every single month we add another New York. Yet, the farmer \nis told by the grain trade--when the farmer loads the truck and takes \nit to the elevator--that this grain isn't worth very much; this food \nisn't worth very much.\n  We are told half a billion people go to bed every night with an ache \nin their belly and it hurts to be hungry. Most of them are kids. Half a \nbillion go to bed every night with an ache in their belly because they \nare hungry. Far more people are malnourished than that. And we are \nadding a New Yorker to the City every month, yet we have farmers in \nIowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Mississippi, and Wisconsin going broke \nbecause they are told--after all of their work, all of their risk, all \nof their dreams--that the grain they produce doesn't have value. They \nload the truck, go to the elevator, and get the message. The message \nis, food doesn't have much value.\n  Within recent months, we had people come to Capitol Hill to testify \nabout the famine in the Sudan. We had testimony by people talking about \nold women climbing trees to gather leaves to eat because there is \nnothing to eat, and our farmers are told: Your food has no value.\n  If we get past the question of, does food have value, there is a \nlarger question. Who farms in this country, and does it matter? Family \nfarmers are more than just planters. It is the family farm around my \nhometown of Regent, ND, that provides the blood vessels which make that \nsmall community live. It is the family farmer who helps build the \nchurch. It is the family farmer who helps keep the main street open. It \nis the family farmer who helps create a rural lifestyle. This is more \nthan just a question of, does food have value; it is, who is going to \nfarm in our country?\n  Some say: Let the corporations farm. They are fine; they can farm \nAmerica from California to Maine. That is true. And we will have no \npopulation left in the middle part of our country.\n  This map demonstrates what is happening in the middle part of our \ncountry. The red represents the counties that have lost more than 15 \npercent of their population. You can see what is happening. In the \nmiddle part of America, we are depopulating a significant part of our \ncountry. People are leaving, not coming.\n\n  I was in two different counties on Saturday in North Dakota. One \ncounty lost 60 percent of its population, and one of them had lost 50 \npercent of its population in the last 25 years.\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\n  Picture trying to do business in a small town, in an area that has \nlost 60 percent of its population. That is trying to do business in a \ndepression.\n  It matters who farms--not just what is the return, what is the price \nof grain, but that we do we have a system that encourages family \nfarming. Is the family, as an economic unit, something that has merit \nand value? Some say, let the market decide that. The market is not an \nallocator of all goods and services in a fair way at all times. There \nare times when we have to be a referee in the marketplace.\n  That is why we have had a farm program. If we hadn't had a farm \nprogram, we probably wouldn't have any family farmers now. When prices \ncollapse and you have the valley, the only way family farmers get \nacross the valley is by building a bridge called price support. Three \nor 4 years ago we were told: That is old fashioned; blow up the bridge. \nSo Congress did--I didn't vote for that. It was called the Freedom to \nFarm bill. We blew up the bridge and pulled the rug from the family \nfarmers. Let them go to the market. Whatever the grain trade says is \nthe price, that is the market price.\n  We found out that is absurd. That doesn't work. China, Japan, Canada, \nMexico, and Europe are engaged in the kind of trade practices that \nrestrict our products, there are sanctions against food--some of which \nhave, fortunately, been revoked--the farmer finds it can't sell into \ncertain markets, it is locked out of about 11 percent of the \ninternational wheat market.\n  In my judgment, sanctions should almost never be put on. Hubert \nHumphrey used to say, send them anything they can't shoot back. It \ncertainly makes sense to be able to send food to people who are hungry \nin the world. That has nothing to do with foreign policy or with guns.\n  When there is a sanction, certainly farmers should have been paid. \nWhy should farmers bear the cost of this country's national security \nissues? We have had the sanctions, have had a range of other trade \nissues and farmers have always been the victims.\n  There is a way, it seems to me, for Congress, with both Republicans \nand Democrats to decide jointly that family farmers ought not continue \nto be victims in this country on trade policy or agricultural policy or \npolicies dealing with market concentration. We need to do much better \nthan that. Frankly, in recent years, I think we have let the farmers \ndown.\n  This bill is an appropriations bill. There is much in it that is \nimportant. I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, your work and the work \nof Senator Cochran is very important work, as is the work of both \nstaffs on the subcommittee. I was pleased for the first time this year \nto be able to join the subcommittee. It is an important subcommittee \nthat makes critical investments in a wide range of agricultural issues.\n  At the end of the day, when all of this is clear, we must do \nsomething about prices for family farmers. If we don't do that, all of \nthis other investment is not going to be very productive for our \ncountry. We must do something to address the question of price \ncollapse.\n  We offered an amendment in the emergency supplemental bill a couple \nof months ago. Senator Harkin and I offered that amendment. I recall, I \nthink, it was midnight or so when Senator Harkin was recognized to \noffer it. He spoke, I spoke, and several others spoke. Then we had a \nvote. We made the points, I and Senator Harkin, about the difficult \ntime in agriculture, the real crisis that exists at this point. The \nvote, I believe, was probably a vote on tabling or a vote up or down. \nWe lost on a 14-14 tie vote, and that was only with the Senate \nconferees.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa is going to offer an amendment, and I \ncertainly intend to join him during this appropriations process, to \nhave a discussion about that amendment, about an emergency farm bill \nthat puts some resources into rural America to try to respond to this \nfarm crisis.\n  I am not now going to speak at much greater length on the amendment. \nI have more things to say, and I will say them at a more appropriate \ntime. My expectation is this legislation will be on the floor for some \nwhile. I do want to speak at greater length about some of these farm \nissues, and my colleague from Iowa and others have a fair amount to say \nas well about these issues.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to raise a problem relating to \npharmacy compounding and a proposed Memorandum of Understanding from \nthe Food and Drug Administration with state boards of pharmacy relating \nto compounding.\n  Pharmacy compounding is a part of the practice of pharmacy that \ninvolves specially-tailoring a prescription drug product for a specific \npatient's needs. A good example is when a pharmacist takes a pill \nprescribed for an infant--but which that infant can't swallow--and \ngrinds it up and mixes it into a sweet syrup that the baby is happy to \ntake.\n  Pharmacy compounding has been part of what pharmacists do for \ncenturies, and it is important to preserve their ability to do this \nwithout huge regulatory hassles. Pharmacy compounding is important for \nmany patients who need specially-designed drugs because no \ncommercially-available product meets their specific needs. Interfering \nwith compounding will only hurt these patients by making it more \ndifficult to get--or even denying them--the specific pharmaceutical \nproducts they need.\n  But the Food and Drug Administration is now threatening to create \nproblems for many pharmacists who do a lot of pharmacy compounding--\nwhich means problems for the customers they serve. The FDA has proposed \na joint regulatory setup with states that calls on state Boards of \nPharmacy to investigate pharmacists if more than 20 percent of the \ntotal prescriptions they distribute are compounded products sold out-\nof-state.\n  This proposal is supposed to guard against a handful of bad actors \nwho are mass-producing drugs but are trying to avoid FDA regulation by \nsaying they are actually involved in pharmacy compounding. The problem \nis that this proposed solution will also interfere with honest \npharmacies and pharmacists who are legitimately engaged in pharmacy \ncompounding.\n  Two types of pharmacists who are particularly at-risk of being \nhassled by this rule are pharmacies that are located in multi-state \nareas and pharmacists who specialize almost exclusively in pharmacy \ncompounding and who are well-known for their specialty either nation-\nwide or region-wide.\n  Under the regulatory setup the FDA has proposed, these pharmacies are \nvulnerable to automatic state investigations or other regulatory \nactions, even if there is no evidence that they are doing anything but \nlegitimate pharmacy compounding.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my colleague from Missouri for raising this \nissue. For patients who have very specific pharmaceutical needs, \npharmacy compounding is clearly extremely important, and I don't \nbelieve the federal government should be creating unnecessary hassles \nor problems for pharmacists who are legitimately serving these patients \nneeds.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman for that comment, and would like to \nbring up one specific example of the unnecessary problems this proposal \ncreates.\n  Last week, I spoke to a woman from Kansas City, Missouri, who runs \ntwo separate pharmacies. One is a typical drug-store type pharmacy \nwhere you can go in to fill prescription drugs that came straight from \nthe manufacturer. Her other pharmacy--which is legally separate--is \nexclusively involved in pharmacy compounding. The only thing this \npharmacy does is specially-tailor prescription products for people in \nthe Kansas City area.\n  The problem is that easily over 20 percent of her compounding \ncustomers are from across the state line in Kansas City, Kansas. She \nalso suspects that many of these Kansas customers--although she's not \nsure exactly how many--live more than 50 miles away from her pharmacy, \nmeaning she might not fit in the protections the FDA tried to include \nfor pharmacies that are selling to out-of-state customers locally.\n  Because this pharmacy in Kansas City doesn't meet the somewhat \narbitrary FDA guidelines, this woman could automatically be subject to \nan investigation by the state Board of Pharmacy, even though all of her \npharmacy compounding is done legitimately for specific patients.\n  I just don't believe the FDA has done a good job writing these \nguidelines.\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\nThere must be a more sophisticated way to approach this problem that \nwon't threaten legitimate pharmacies with unnecessary regulatory \nhassles. I believe Congress needs to take a stand on this issue to \nforce FDA to reconsider their proposal.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his thoughts, and pledge to work \nwith him and others during deliberations of the conference committee on \nthis bill to address this problem.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 702\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Public Health Services Act, the Employee \n Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \n  of 1986 to protect consumers in managed care plans and other health \n                               coverage)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am asked to send an amendment to the \ndesk for Senator Daschle. I do so at this point and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for Mr. \n     Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 702.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I object.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.

I send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 703 to amendment No. 702.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 703) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I find our Democratic colleagues have put \nthe Senate in an unfortunate position by offering this bill at this \ntime. The pending bill is the agriculture appropriations bill, \ncertainly a very important appropriations bill. I think you could \nprobably argue they all are. But even more so than usual, the \nagriculture appropriations bill this year is very significant because \nwe are still dealing with an agriculture economy that has been shaken \nby prices and by the loss of some markets around the world. We need to \nmove this bill forward.\n  American farmers are in dire need of many of the provisions in this \nbill that has been developed in a bipartisan way, with Chairman Cochran \nleading the way. These farmers rely on the legislation and \nappropriations every year. For some reason, the Democrats have decided \nto ignore the needs of the American farmer and instead turn this bill \ninto the health care reform bill.\n  I have in the past, and as recently as last Friday, offered our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle an opportunity to debate this \nissue in the form of a separate bill under a time agreement. However, \nthey have always indicated a request for dozens and dozens of \namendments. In fact, the latest discussion, sort of indirectly, but the \nlatest number would call for a minimum of 40 amendments.\n  Now, I thought they had a bill that basically represented the \nposition they wanted to take on the Patients' Bill of Rights, as \ndeveloped by Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle. We have our approach, \nwhich is quite different, developed by Senator Nickles, the Senator in \nthe Chair, Ms. Collins, Senator Frist, who certainly is one who could \nbe very helpful in devising health-related legislation. So we have our \ntwo alternative bills, which I thought we could get a direct vote on \nand have some reasonable number of amendments and then go on to a final \nconclusion.\n  However, it seems to me that colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are interested in having an issue rather than bringing this \nPatients' Bill of Rights issue to a conclusion.\n  I think clearly there are some things we need to do in this area. I \nassume there are some areas of agreement. There are some fundamental \ndisagreements. For instance, I believe very strongly, in dealing with \npatients' rights and needs, where there is a dispute, there should be a \nprocess for resolving that dispute within a managed care organization \nor through an expedited outside procedure to get a result and not just \nlook for more opportunities to file more lawsuits.\n  However, I will continue, as I did last year, to work with the \nDemocratic leader to propound a time agreement which will allow for \nvotes on these important issues, the two approaches, as well as a \nreasonable number of amendments.\n  In the meantime, I call for regular order with respect to the State \nDepartment authorization bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7310-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7310-S7312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nmodification of the pending Sarbanes amendment, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the amendment at 5:30 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe we will be waiting for the \nmanagers of the State Department authorization bill to come back to the \nfloor. We had a time agreement on the State Department authorization, \nand we had hoped to complete that bill last Friday, but for a variety \nof reasons we weren't able to do so. We did get a list of amendments. I \nbelieve we have some pretty tight time agreements on those amendments.\n  We need to move forward with getting to a conclusion early this week \non final passage of the State Department authorization. That will be \nhelpful in dealing with other issues pending before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, including possibly some nominations that have been \npending there, because of the very serious nature and the need to get \nthe State Department reauthorization done. So we will go back to that \nand the managers will be coming to the floor shortly, I am sure, and \nthen we will have a vote, as agreed to, at 5:30 this afternoon on the \npending Sarbanes amendment. With that, I am glad to yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is my understanding, therefore, with \nthe majority leader's action, we have effectively moved off discussion \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights, which we had before us for a very \nbrief period of time this afternoon, and that is the result of the \nmajority leader's action.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct, but it is temporary. We basically now are \ndealing with three different issues--the\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\nState Department authorization, which began last Friday, the \nagriculture appropriations bill, and the managers of that \nappropriations bill were able to get, I believe, a couple hours of time \non that, and now the Patients' Bill of Rights issue. We will go back to \nthe State Department authorization and, hopefully, we can complete \nthat, and then all of the interested Senators who would like to be \nheard in a reasonable period of time on the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwe will work that out for tomorrow. Senators Nickles, Collins, Frist, \nSantorum, and others will probably want to be heard on that, and I know \na number of Senators on your side. We want to work with Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Daschle to see how we set that up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I thank the leader. He is giving the assurance \nthat there is a possibility, hopefully, or an inevitability, that we \nwill consider this legislation. There ought to be negotiations between \nthe leaders. But would it be fair to say that it is the intention of \nthe leadership at this time that we would have an opportunity to debate \nthe Republican proposal and the Democratic proposal on the Patients' \nBill of Rights?\n  Mr. LOTT. I intend to do that, but I have to say, within reason. That \nwould be in the eye of the beholder. I know there are Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who want to speak about this issue and want to talk \nabout the alternative proposals. We will line up a time to do that. I \ncan't say right now, without talking to the managers of the two other \nbills and with Senator Daschle, exactly when that will be or how long \nit will be. We will work that out this afternoon or tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for at least the assurance that some \nprogress will be made. There is at least a very strong sense among many \nof those most concerned about this legislation that this is a priority \nfor families in this country, and that we have dealt with other \nlegislation, such as the juvenile justice bill. We worked that process \nthrough without limitations and restrictions, in a responsible way. It \nis certainly the intention of Senator Daschle, and others who are \ncosponsoring this legislation, to do it in a likewise manner. There is \nthe determination that we will have an opportunity to do so, and we \nwill do that. We want to be able to work that out. I know the leader \ndoes. I know that is the way it should be worked out. I am hopeful we \nwill have an opportunity to address this in the Senate.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Regarding the juvenile justice bill, you will recall I made \na commitment we would bring that up and debate and amendments would not \nbe shut off. But it was with some assurances that we would finish it by \nThursday night of the week it came up--I think on Monday. As a matter \nof fact, it was the following week before we were able to finish it. \nThat is why I think we need to get some clear understanding of exactly \nwhat time would be involved and when the votes would occur. I will make \nsure we get that clarified before we go forward.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask a question about the characterization \nthat the Senator made with respect to the action that was taken to send \nthe amendment to the desk. It is not an amendment of the agricultural \ninterests here. I know the offering of the amendment--I sent the \namendment at the request of Senator Daschle. I know that was not a \nsurprise. Senator Daschle announced last Thursday it was going to \nhappen if there was not some sort of understanding reached with the \nmajority leader.\n  I wanted to say this. The underlying bill is very important, the \nagriculture appropriations bill. It does not, however, contain the \nemergency response to the farm crisis that we must add to it at some \npoint here. I hope we will do it in a bipartisan way. But the interest \nthat Senator Daschle has in trying to move forward with debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights doesn't in any way diminish the interest and \nimportance of the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I may respond. Frankly, I was surprised \nthat this Patients' Bill of Rights amendment was offered to this bill. \nAll that had been indicated was that it would be offered this week if \nsome agreement was not worked out.\n  First of all, I want to make it clear that I am willing and very \nanxious to make a reasonable agreement. No. 2, this is not the only \nbill that was going to be up this week. There would have been--or there \nwill be other opportunities. That is what surprised me, the fact that \nthe agriculture appropriations bill was the bill to which the Patients' \nBill of Rights issue was added. That was a surprise because I thought \nthere would be a real strong feeling that we should move forward on the \nagriculture appropriations bill without it being delayed or deferred or \nimpacted by other issues. That does not diminish at all the importance \nof patients' rights, but I thought there would have been another bill \nor another way that it could have been offered. So I, frankly, was \nsurprised--I am not saying it was sort of a surprise attack; I don't \nmean that at all. I am just surprised the decision was made to offer it \nto the agriculture appropriations bill when we could have offered it or \nit could have been offered by others on other bills this week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One additional question. I will not belabor the point, \nexcept I was with Senator Daschle, along with my colleagues, last \nThursday. He made it clear to everybody here in the Capitol what his \nintention was for this week. There would not have been a need to submit \nthis amendment today on any bill had there been an agreement last week.\n  But let me also say when we get to the agriculture appropriations \nbill, at some point there is going to be lengthy debate about the \nemergency response that we need to do with respect to this farm crisis.\n  Let me finally make this point. We will, I assume, at some point have \na full debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. It will be a debate with \namendments offered by both sides--not amendments cleared by anyone, not \namendments in which someone is being a gatekeeper and which people have \nan opportunity to say here is how we feel about this issue. That is \ngoing to happen sooner or later.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could reclaim my time, I am glad to \ntry to enter an agreement as to how this issue would be handled. We are \nready to go. But the comment about gatekeeper--we have a lot of \nimportant work to do here. Agriculture, obviously, is a very important \nissue, and State Department authorization is very important, and \nintelligence authorization is very important. We have appropriations \nbills we need to move through. We have a limited amount of time in \nwhich to do that. We have this week and next week before the Fourth of \nJuly recess. Therefore, there must be some reasonable understanding, \nsome reasonable agreement about how much time or what amendments will \nbe offered. We do that all the time. Every Senator knows we enter into \nagreements to limit amendments or limit time. If we can get that worked \nout, then we will go forward. The alternative is that we can have \ndebate on this tomorrow, and we can have a couple of votes and sort of \nsee where we are and then decide how to proceed after that.\n  But I believe we have broad support outside of this Chamber and in \nthe Senate for the alternative that we have. Great work has been done \nby Dr. Frist and Senator Collins and Senator Jeffords, a broad group \nwithin our conference working with Senators from all regions of the \ncountry who understand this problem. We are ready to do it. As soon as \nyou can decide you are ready to have a vote on the merits of the two \npackages pending, with a reasonable number of amendments, we will do \nthat.\n  We are going to have to get some order as to how that is done, and we \nwill do that or we will just vote on the packages as they are and let \nthat happen. I think we can keep wrangling back and forth. I invite \nothers to join in the opportunity to discuss exactly the substance of \nthe two bills and also how we will handle them.\n  I see the chairman is here, and Senator Specter from Pennsylvania is \nhere, and others. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak \nrelatively briefly on the steel import limitation bill; a cloture vote \non the motion to proceed is scheduled tomorrow at 12:15. I will be \nengaged in committee hearings at that time, so I have sought a few \nminutes this afternoon to express my support to impose cloture on the \nsteel import limitation bill.\n  Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n289-141. While this is a strong measure, a so-called quota bill, I \nbelieve it reflects the necessity that strong action be taken to \nenforce U.S. trade laws to stop an avalanche of dumping by foreign \ncountries.\n  We have seen the disintegration of the American steel industry, the \ndecimation of the American steel industry by unfair foreign imports. \nTwenty years ago, in 1979, approximately 453,000 steelworkers were \nemployed. Today that figure is about 160,000. Some $50 billion has been \ninvested by the American steel industry to modernize, but there is no \nway that the American steel industry can compete with dumped goods. \nWhen I say ``dumped goods'' I mean goods which come into the United \nStates from a number of countries--from Russia, from Brazil, from \nUkraine, from South Africa, from China--where they are sold for less \nthan they are sold for in the exporting country; that is, sold for less \nthan the United States and sold for less than Russia, which is sending \nthem to the United States, and sold for less than the cost of \nproduction.\n  The situation requires a change. I will quote extensively from a \nletter sent by 12 executives from American steel companies to the \nSecretary of Commerce, responding to a comment by the Secretary of \nCommerce last week that the steel crisis is over--so said Secretary \nDaley. This letter, dated June 18, 1999, from the executives of 12 \nAmerican steel companies, says, in pertinent part, the following:\n       The steel crisis is still very much with us. Imports \n     volumes are down from the disastrous levels of 1998 but are \n     still very high by historic standards. The surge of imports \n     in 1998 caused inventories to balloon to extremely high \n     levels. These inventories have seriously depressed prices up \n     until the present and will continue to do so until these \n     stocks have been worked down. Moreover, cold-rolled imports \n     are up dramatically through April of this year, 24% above the \n     level of the first four months of last year. Imports of cut-\n     to-length plate are up dramatically--25% year-to-year for \n     this period.\n       Prices remain extremely depressed. The producer price index \n     for all steel mill products is down 9% (1999:Q2/1998/Q2). \n     This is the largest decline in nearly 20 years. Prices for \n     hot-rolled sheet, cold-rolled sheet and plate are down 11% \n     and 15% respectively.\n       Operating rates have plunged from 93% to 80% between \n     January and December 1998 and have remained at that depressed \n     level through the first half of 1999. The decline in \n     operating rates equates to about $2 billion in lost revenue \n     in the second half of last year. On an annualized basis, a \n     10% change in operating rate equals about $5 billion in \n     revenue.\n       The depressed prices and operating rates caused most \n     American steel companies to post losses in the most recent \n     quarter. Several steel companies have been forced into \n     bankruptcy. Thousands of those who were laid off due to \n     unfairly traded imports are still out of work. Many thousands \n     have seen their workweeks shortened and are still not back to \n     full time.\n       For our industry, therefore, this crisis is very real.\n  The steel industry started some seven actions for antidumping, and \nsix of those were subjected to suspension agreements by the Department \nof Commerce, to the detriment of the steel companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent this chart on steel imports and suspension \nagreements be printed at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The result of steel import limitations, so-called \nquotas, is a drastic remedy. We have seen not only steel but other \nindustries in the United States victimized by the failure to enforce \nU.S. trade laws.\n  For the past 15 years, this Senator has proposed legislation which \nwould authorize equitable relief to provide for enforcement of the U.S. \ntrade laws. At the present time, if complaints are filed with the \nInternational Trade Commission, it takes up to a year or longer to have \nthose matters resolved. An equitable action, a court of equity, would \nresult in having these matters resolved in the course of a few weeks. \nUntil that is done, it seems to me we need to take some very decisive \naction.\n  That is why I have cosponsored the steel import limitation bill. I \nurge cloture on the motion to proceed be invoked when this matter comes \nup for a vote tomorrow at 12:15.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intend to support the legislation the Senator just \ndescribed. The Senator from Pennsylvania described a condition with the \nsteel industry that relates to, among other things, the lack of \nenforcement of trade laws.\n  In North Dakota, we don't produce steel. We don't have a foundry that \nproduces a substantial amount of steel. We don't have steelworkers. \nHowever, we have farmers in almost exactly the same set of \ncircumstances. At least part of that reason is because of bad trade \nagreements, or trade agreements that have not been enforced.\n  A number of Senators, I am sure, will support the initiative \ntomorrow. I think tomorrow is actually a vote on the motion to proceed. \nI believe it is important to stand up for our economic interests.\n  It is not about protectionism; it is about standing up for our \ncountry's economic interests and making sure we enforce trade laws. If \nsomeone is dumping in our country--whether it is steel or wheat--we \nought to expect, as a steel industry or as family farmers, that our \nFederal Government will take action to enforce our trade laws.\n  I agree with the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think \na number of Senators, tomorrow, will be in agreement on that basic \npremise.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond briefly, I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for that statement.\n  I had presented legislation on equitable relief before the Finance \nCommittee. The Senate's colleague, Senator Conrad, is a member, and he \nmade the same statement about the similarity in wheat.\n  At lunch today, Conrad Burns was talking about similar problems in \nMontana. I will send a copy of the equitable legislation which I think \nwould cover many products. We will have an overwhelming response in \nthis body so that our trade laws are enforced, consistent with GATT, \nbut put teeth in an enforcement mechanism which is not present today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                            EXHIBIT 1.--STEEL IMPORTS AND SUSPENSION AGREEMENTS--SUMMARY OF FLAT-ROLLED SUSPENSION AGREEMENTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    By metric tons--              Dollar amount per metric tons--\n                                                                               -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Year of filing and product             Country           Final adjusted      Suspension   Estimated                                        Current\n                                                            margins (percent)    agreement    volumes w/    Agreement minimum    Estimated      import\n                                                                                  volumes       orders            price          fair price     value\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996--Plate CTL...................

Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the State Department \nauthorization and the Sarbanes amendment, numbered 689.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is before modification; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not yet been modified.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me inquire, is the modification that I understand has \nbeen agreed to--do both sides agree to it? I know our side does, but I \nwould not want to do anything against the wish of Senator Sarbanes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 689, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I send to the desk a modification of \namendment No. 689 and ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. \n     Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 689, as modified:\n       On page 39, line 11, insert after ``action'' the following: \n     ``that includes a suspension of more than five days''.\n       On page 41, line 16, strike ``one year'' and all that \n     follows through the end of line 22 and insert the following: \n     ``two years after the occurrence giving rise to the grievance \n     or, in the case of a grievance with respect to the grievant's \n     rater or reviewer, one year after the date on which the \n     grievant ceased to be subject to rating or review by that \n     person, but in no case less than two years after the \n     occurrence giving rise to the grievance.'.''.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, the majority leader desires, and I want \nto accommodate him in this, that this amendment be the rollcalled \namendment at 5:30.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent there be no \nfurther amendment to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I just discussed this with the Senator. I \nneed to know, if he will advise me, how long he intends to speak at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, in response to the Senator from North \nCarolina, I am going to introduce a bill. That will take about 4 or 5 \nminutes. Then I want to make a brief statement, perhaps 5 minutes or 7 \nminutes or so, on the test ban treaty. My intention would be probably \nno more than 10 or 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, if the Senator will conclude in 7 \nminutes, I have no objection at all, but I want to keep the time \navailable for Senators who will talk on the bill.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 1252 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from North \nCarolina allowing me to speak. We are on a very important piece of \nlegislation, and he is managing it. These are all very important \nissues. I wish my colleagues well as they work through their bill in \nthe next day or so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, for the record, I will offer a progress \nreport on where we stand on the State Department reauthorization bill.\n  Since we began last Friday and over the weekend, the staff has worked \ntogether with other staff, and as we now stand, there remain just three \namendments yet to be offered by Senators Wellstone, Feingold, and \nSarbanes. The Sarbanes amendment is in addition to the one that is \nscheduled for a vote at 5:30 this afternoon. I encourage all three \nSenators to utilize this time so we can put this bill to bed and send \nit over to the House.\n  I believe the Senator from Minnesota desires some time.\n  Madam President, how much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank the chairman \nfor recognizing me.\n  As the subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction over the State \nDepartment authorization bill, I compliment our chairman for all the \nwork he has put into this bill to move it quickly to the floor.\n  As he said, I hope we can get these amendments addressed and send \nthis bill to the House and hopefully have it signed by the President in \nthe very near future.\n  I worked closely and diligently with Members on both sides of the \naisle and the administration to craft legislation which will strengthen \nAmerica's leadership role in the international arena. This package \nenhances the security of our embassies abroad, establishes benchmarks \nfor the payment of U.N. arrears, and prioritizes our international \naffairs expenditures.\n  I am pleased this authorization bill contains the provisions of a \nbill I introduced, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism \nAct of 1999. In the aftermath of the embassy bombings in August of \n1998, the State Department Accountability Review Boards chaired by \nAdmiral Crowe concluded that we have devoted inadequate resources and \nplaced too low a priority on security concerns. Those findings echoed \nthose of the Inman Commission, which issued an extensive embassy \nsecurity report that raised these same points 14 years ago.\n  We seek to remedy that situation by establishing an Embassy Security \nand Construction Account so funds designated for embassy security will \nnot be used for other purposes. In addition to authorizing $600 million \na year for the next 5 years, this bill provides security requirements \nfor U.S. diplomatic facilities and requires the Secretary of State to \ncertify that the funds are being used to meet security objectives. It \nalso establishes requirements for threat assessments and also emergency \nprocedures. Working abroad will never be risk free. But we can take a \nnumber of measures, like these, to make sure that safety is increased \nfor U.S. Government employees overseas. We can also put forward \nrequirements to ensure we have an effective emergency response network \nin place to respond to a crisis should one arise.\n  I am also pleased that the U.N. Secretary General and the \nadministration have endorsed our U.N. reform package which provides \n$819 million in arrears and another $107 million debt relief in \nexchange for reforms. This is a positive step towards shaping a U.N. \nthat is a viable organization in the 21st century. Because any \norganization burdened with a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to \ncontrol spending will collapse under its own weight of inefficiency. We \nmust reform the United Nations now, and the United States has the \nresponsibility to play a major role. If we do nothing, and the United \nNations collapses under its own weight in a few decades, then we will \nhave only ourselves to blame.\n  I believe that the U.N. needs the discipline of actual benchmarks \ntied to\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nthe arrears to provide the impetus for fundamental reform; because \ngiven the power of an entrenched U.N. bureaucracy, true reform will \nonly occur when there are tangible incentives to change. We have seen \nhow difficult it is to streamline our own bureaucracy here in \nWashington. It is even more difficult to streamline an international \norganization where each member is involved in these decisions. But I \nwant to underscore that these reforms are achievable. These reforms \ninclude having Inspectors General in the specialized agencies; \npromoting merit-based employment; and establishing a code of conduct \nfor personnel with an anti-nepotism provision. Congress' message is \nsimple and it is straightforward. The U.S. can help make the United \nNations a more effective, more efficient and financially sounder \norganization, but only if the U.N. and other member states, in return, \nare willing to finally become accountable to the American taxpayers.\n\n  That being said, I want to emphasize that the U.N. does excel in \ncertain areas. The U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture gives \nfinancial aid to organizations that help torture survivors, like the \nCenter for Victims of Torture in Minnesota. Assisting treatment centers \nfor victims of torture is an effective method to lessen the incidence \nof torture by providing irrefutable medical and psychological evidence \nthat torture is actually still occurring. These centers also serve a \nstrategic purpose of restoring faith in the principles of human rights \nand democracy. That is why I am leading the effort to increase the U.S. \ncontribution to $5 million a year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the entire bipartisan package and, \nespecially, to understand how difficult it was to arrive at an \nagreement on the arrears. Again, I commend the chairman and also the \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee for their diligence \nand also their perseverance in effecting this compromise bill. This \nagreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the \nentire international community.\n  I compliment the chairman for all his fine work in getting this bill \nto the floor. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 886, the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act. I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank Chairman Helms and Senator Biden for their \nleadership in crafting this bipartisan bill.\n  Simply put, the bill before us is a piece of national security \nlegislation. I know we don't often think about the authorization of the \nState Department in these terms, but the truth is our first line of \nnational defense is diplomacy. We in Congress have spent far too little \nof our time and resources on ensuring we have a strong, well-financed \ndiplomatic corps. As a consequence we have failed to convince the \nAmerican public of the importance of our foreign policy institution in \nmaintaining U.S. national security.\n  I recognize that it's much easier to explain to our constituents the \nimportance of the Defense Authorization Bill to their safety and \nsecurity. The tangible results of the Defense Authorization Bill--a \nwell trained and well-equipped military force--is easily translatable \ninto a sense of greater national security. Rather than tanks and \nfighter aircraft, this bill authorizes our diplomats and overseas \nembassies. It authorizes funding for U.S. participation in \ninternational organizations and foreign language broadcasting. It is \nmuch less obvious to the American people how these types of activities \nhelp protect America. Mr. President, they do.\n  One of the most important lessons of the post-Communist era is the \nincreasing importance of diplomacy. A failure of diplomacy in today's \nworld is more likely to result in the need for the use of force. As one \nthinks about the instances in which the United States has been \ncompelled to use military force in the last decade--from the Persian \nGulf to Kosovo--each conflict was preceded by a breakdown of diplomacy, \nor at least an inability of diplomacy to solve the problem. During the \nCold War, we relied on our military might to deter Soviet aggression. \nToday's threats are more diverse and must be countered, not only with \nmilitary strength, but with strong intelligence and diplomatic \ncapabilities.\n  I intend to vote for this bill because I believe it is a positive \nstep in strengthening our diplomatic capabilities. To begin, this bill \nwould fully authorize the President's request for Diplomatic and \nConsular Programs. Just as we strive to have the best-trained and best-\nequipped military force in the world, we should do everything in our \nability to create a diplomatic corps with unparalleled insights into \nhow the world works. A key component of this is creating a State \nDepartment that is responsive, efficient, and capable. In my opinion, \nthe integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and \nthe U.S. Information Agency (USIA) into the State Department has \nimproved coordination of U.S. policy and led to greater effectiveness.\n  For our diplomats to be successful, they must be reasonably safe. The \nbill contains a five-year authorization for a $3 billion program for \nembassy construction and upgrading U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas. \nThe bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania taught us the \npainful lesson that too many of our diplomatic posts remain too \nvulnerable to terrorist attack. We can never guarantee absolute \nsecurity, but this bill will make an immediate downpayment of $600 \nmillion to upgrade security and establish a process to identify those \nfacilities most vulnerable and most in need of improvements.\n  This bill further promotes U.S. national security by authorizing such \nprograms as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the National Endowment \nfor Democracy (NED). Each of these are vital tools in our effort to \npromote democracy and provide hope to those people seeking to end \ntotalitarian rule. The surest way to foster U.S. national security is \nto extend the benefits of democracy and the rule of law to people in \nplaces like Iraq and Cuba.\n  Perhaps the most important component of S. 886 is the authorization \nto begin repayment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations. It may be \nsurprising to many Americans that, due to our failure to meet our \ninternational financial obligations, the United States is perilously \nclose to losing its vote in the General Assembly of the United Nations. \nAny member country with arrears equal to two years of its annual \nassessment automatically loses its right to vote in the General \nAssembly. Our failure to act on this issue by the end of the year will \nput the United States in such illustrious company as Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand Yugoslavia--each of which have also lost their voting rights.\n  Some may question the need for U.S. participation in the United \nNations. The simple fact is the multilateral nature of the U.N. \nimproves our ability to confront global challenges. Our participation \nin the United Nations has helped to reduce the threat of Saddam \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction program. Our participation in the \nUnited Nations has forced Libya to turn over the suspects from the \nLockerbie bombing so that they may face justice. Just recently we \nsought support in the United Nations to strengthen our hand in Kosovo \nand provide multilateral support for the ongoing peace implementation \neffort. It's naive to believe that being the largest debtor nation at \nthe U.N. will not have an increasingly negative impact on our ability \nto lead. Therefore, it is critically important that we pass this bill \nand set ourselves on the path to paying our debts.\n  There is one group of my constituents that consistently understand \nthe importance of U.S. foreign policy. Nebraska farmers and food \nprocessors know maintaining good diplomatic relations is essential to \nmaintaining good markets for their products. They also understand that \ninternational conflict and instability can affect not only their \nprosperity, but their safety as well. I intend to vote for this bill \nbecause I believe it will increase the safety of the American people by \nstrengthening our foreign policy institutions and improving our ability \nto avoid conflict.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, we will be voting, as I understand it, \non the amendment which I offered on Friday. The chairman at that time \nasked if I could go ahead, and I indicated I could to try to move the \nbill along.\n  We have worked over the weekend. Staff has worked on this amendment \nand some modification was made in it which was earlier sent to the desk \nby the chairman of the committee. I thank the chairman and his staff \nand the ranking member and his staff for working on this.\n  Actually, the chairman and his people were reasonably trying to get \nat a problem. We have made an adjustment that makes it work. If a \nForeign Service officer receives a suspension of more than 5 days, that \nfact will stay in his or her file until they next come up for promotion \nand for tenure. There would still be a minimum period when any \nsuspension will be in the file, but beyond that period, the minor \nsuspensions will drop out of the file. Any one that has been for more \nthan 5 days will remain in the file. That is to get at a problem.\n  Staff said to me, on occasion we get reports on these people, and \nwhen we look into it, we discover there was a major suspension but this \nsuspension dropped out of the person's record before they came up \nbefore a promotion board. People believe, in a case of something of \nmore than 5 days, which obviously would be of some consequence, that it \nought to remain in and not be excised from the record. We have made \nthat adjustment. I thank the chairman and his people for their \nresponsiveness.\n  The other amendment I believe was agreeable on Friday. That was on a \ngrievance, where we took it back up from 1 year to 2 years. The \ncommittee had dropped it from 3 to 1 in terms of the period when an \nemployee has to file a grievance. One year is tough, particularly if \nthat person is overseas, because they do not get home leave except \nevery 18 months. We took it back up to 2 years and made some other \nminor changes, and that is acceptable to the committee. I very much \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. How much time remains before the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, as I understand it now, with these \nchanges the chairman has suggested, the amendment is acceptable to the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is acceptable to the offerer \nwith the changes that have been made.\n  Mr. HELMS. This amendment, as modified, preserves one of the key \nForeign Service reforms in the bill. The bill currently requires that \nany disciplinary action taken against a member of the Foreign Service \nbe included in a Foreign Service member's file for at least one \nsuccessful tenure or promotion. Current practice requires that such \nactions remain in a personnel file for only 2 years.\n  The current requirement has enabled some Foreign Service members to \ngame the system and receive a promotion once the disciplinary action \nhas been removed from the file. For example, the committee was recently \nasked to review the promotion of an individual who had failed to attain \npromotion by two review boards while the disciplinary action remained a \npart of his file. After 2 years, when the action was removed from his \nfile, he immediately received promotion.\n  The Foreign Service, like the military, is intended to be an up or \nout system. In the military, disciplinary actions stay with an \nofficer's file for his entire career. The current provision in the bill \nseems to me to be a reasonable reform that would ensure a Foreign \nService promotion board can make an informed decision. I accept the \nreasonable compromise offered by Senator Sarbanes that ensures this \nrequirement applies only to more severe disciplinary actions.\n  Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n689, as modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 692\n\n (Purpose: To limit the percentage of noncompetitively awarded grants \n   made to the core grantees of the National Endowment for Democracy)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will offer today an amendment to make \na simple reform to the grants process for the National Endowment for \nDemocracy, the funding of which is authorized in the State Department \nauthorization bill which we are debating.\n  I want to make this very clear. I am not here to cut or eliminate NED \nfunding by even one penny. This doesn't cut the program at all. Rather, \nmy amendment simply requires the money given by the American taxpayers \nto NED each year be distributed fairly and effectively. The amendment, \ntherefore,\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\nreforms the NED's grant-making procedures, procedures about which it \ncan fairly be said, as of today, ``The fix is in.''\n  Here is how the grant process at NED works today. Currently, 65 \npercent of NED grant money goes automatically to four so-called core \ngrantees, and these are the Solidarity Center, an arm of the AFL-CIO; \nthe Center for International Private Enterprise or CIPE, an arm of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce; and two groups tied to America's major \npolitical parties, the International Republican Institute and the \nNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs.\n  My amendment simply would require that the grant process of NED \nbecome competitive. The amount of grant funds provided automatically to \nthe NED's four core grantees would be reduced incrementally over the \nnext 5 years, so all NED grant funds would be awarded competitively on \nthe merits by the time we get to the end of that 5-year period.\n  I hope we can all agree that more competition among applicants for \ngrant funds is a good thing and that it is the fairest way to apportion \nthe tax dollars NED distributes to help promote democracy. As it stands \nnow, the four grantees are hardly subject to any real scrutiny. That is \nwhy I say the fix is in for these very well connected organizations.\n  The NED is a private, nonprofit organization created by the U.S. \nGovernment during the cold war in 1983. The idea was a good one. The \nidea was to strengthen democratic institutions around the world through \nnongovernmental efforts. The NED is governed by an independent, \nnonpartisan board of directors and operates with an annual \ncongressional appropriation, so strictly speaking, it is not really an \nendowment. NED receives 97 percent of its funding from the taxpayers. \nUntil it has significant private sources of funding, it does not make \nany sense to me to guarantee most of its grants to four private groups.\n  The NED provides some direct grants, conducts analyses of the theory \nand practice of democratic development worldwide, and serves as a \nclearinghouse for information on that development. The NED makes \nhundreds of grants each year to support prodemocracy groups in Africa, \nAsia, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and \nthe former Soviet Union. The Endowment supports projects that promote \npolitical and economic freedom, a strong civil society, independent \nmedia, human rights and the rule of law.\n  There are also programs in the areas of labor, business, and \npolitical party development which are funded mostly through the four \ngrantees, although other applicants are prepared to conduct programs in \neach of these areas.\n  Obviously, I believe in the value of democracy and the imperative of \nthe United States to support democratic development, human rights, and \nthe rule of law abroad. So I do not take lightly at all the admirable \naims of the National Endowment for Democracy and do believe these goals \nare in the national interest of the United States.\n  Nevertheless, I continue to have concerns about this bizarre \nstructure of the endowment ``family.'' As I mentioned, more than 50 \npercent of the NED's budget, and some 65 percent of the grants it \nmakes, goes to these so-called core grantees--NDI, IRI, CIPE and the \nSolidarity Center.\n  Why do these core grantees get that funding year after year? Because \nat NED's inception, they had the political clout to get permanently \n``wired in.'' Whatever the goals of the originators of this strange \narrangement, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the core \ngroups necessarily offer programs of such superior quality that they \nshould get this annual bonanza while other independent organizations \nmust vie for funding from the NED's small remaining discretionary fund.\n  Sure--I am quick to say this--the core grantees have conducted some \nexcellent programs and many of them certainly serve important U.S. \nnational interests. I am sure they deserve to get some funding. But why \nis it they are automatically given 65 percent of grant funds? I have to \nbelieve there are other organizations out there that can do the job \nbetter on some projects, but they are not even allowed to compete for \nthis majority of the money.\n  In fact, I have the list of some 250 organizations that have \nsatisfied those individuals who review the remaining amounts of funds \nto the point where these organizations have been granted funds.\n  I must say in fairness, considerable progress has been made over the \nyears in addressing many of the most pressing concerns about the \nselection and monitoring of NED grants. As the result of several \nstudies conducted by the GAO, the Endowment has addressed many issues \nand has tightened up its project selection and performance monitoring \nprocedures. I certainly recognize that the NED has made a little bit of \nprogress in reducing the percentage of its grants that are slated for \nthese four grantees. It used to be as high as 80 percent of the total \nNED budget.\n  The NED has seen its funding attacked in this Chamber in recent \nyears, but each time the Senate has made a clear and sometimes \noverwhelming decision to preserve that funding. I understand that an \nappropriations bill which was filed last week zeros out funding for the \nNED, but I am absolutely confident those funds will be restored because \nthere is no other federally funded organization in America that is, \nfrankly, better connected on Capitol Hill than the National Endowment \nfor Democracy.\n  Today, I am certainly being realistic and trying to be positive and \nhelpful and trying to improve the program. I am not attempting to shut \ndown the NED. Let me repeat, my amendment does not seek to kill the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, nor does it cut the program funding \neven by one dime. Rather, I seek to reform the strange and unique \ngrantmaking structure that has evolved at NED.\n  Let me describe this amendment one more time. This chart shows, \nagain, the situation before our amendment and under current law. The \ndistribution, the very small portion in green is available to everybody \nelse after these four grantees are guaranteed 65 percent of the grant \nmoney. My amendment will decrease the amount in blue gradually over 5 \nyears by a small amount each year to 52 percent in fiscal year 2001, 39 \npercent in fiscal year 2002, so on until 2004 when there would be no \nnoncompetitive funds made available and the funds would go to the \napplicants who offer the best proposals. A novel idea: All the money \ngoes to the best applicants. That is a pretty good use of taxpayers' \ndollars, in my view.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator be willing to send his amendment to the \ndesk and count the time he has used against it?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it was my intention to offer the \namendment at the conclusion of my remarks. I certainly anticipated the \ntime I used would go against my time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am not trying to direct the Senator. I just want the \nclock to start running.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time I have \nalready consumed be counted against my time that I was allotted under \nthe agreement.\n  Mr. HELMS. That sounds fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman.\n  I will conclude my remarks, and at the conclusion of those remarks, I \nwill, in fact, send the amendment to the desk. This does not \nnecessarily mean any of the four core grantees will have to cut their \nbudgets, but it will mean they will have to actually make their case to \nNED that their proposals are the best use of taxpayers' dollars. As it \nnow stands, these four grantees know the fix is in, so there is less \nincentive to make sure every single program is as efficient and well \nplanned as it possibly can be.\n  My amendment will phase out this fix over a 5-year period and compel \neach of the four grantees to work a little harder to earn their grants, \nas hard as everybody else, so they can be in this big green pie of the \nbest applicants, not just the guaranteed applicants.\n  Again, this is not an amendment to kill or even cut funding for the \nNED. It is an amendment to use old-fashioned American competition to \nensure that\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\nthe best use of taxpayers' dollars in the funding of democracy programs \nhappens abroad. My colleagues who believe in fairness and competition \nand the efficient use of the taxpayers' money should vote aye.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of 250 organizations which \nreceived NED funds in calendar year 1998 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Organizations that Received NED Discretionary

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, after line 10, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 106. LIMITATIONS ON NONCOMPETITIVELY AWARDED NED GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Limitations.--Of the total amount of grants made by the \n     National Endowment for Democracy in each of the following \n     fiscal years, not more than the following percentage for each \n     such fiscal year shall be grants that are awarded on a \n     noncompetitive basis to the core grantees of the National \n     Endowment for Democracy:\n       (1) For fiscal year 2000, 52 percent.\n       (2) For fiscal year 2001, 39 percent.\n       (3) For fiscal year 2002, 36 percent.\n       (4) For fiscal year 2003, 13 percent.\n       (5) For fiscal year 2004, zero percent.\n       (b) Core Grantees of the National Endowment for democracy \n     defined.--In this section, the term ``core grantees of the \n     National Endowment for Democracy'' means the following:\n       (1) The International Republican Institute (IRI).\n       (2) The National Democratic Institute (NDI).\n       (3) The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE).\n       (4) The American Center for International Solidarity (also \n     known as the ``Solidarity Center'').\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 44 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin. He clearly is a strong proponent and advocate of democracy \nand has stimulated discussion on these issues as a valued member of the \nForeign Relations Committee. The National Endowment for Democracy which \nwas founded in 1983 included the so-called four ``core'' groups from \nthe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, Organized Labor, and the \nChamber of Commerce.\n  That foundation was deliberate. It was not a question of a strange \narrangement in which four groups in Washington sequestered the funds \nfor their own benefit. Very clearly, President Reagan and a bipartisan \nmajority of the Congress found that the checks and balances inherent in \nthat debate were very important in making certain that the National \nEndowment for Democracy was not politicized.\n  Let me mention that to have competition in which as many as 250 \ngroups interested in democracy compete for money, almost guarantees a \nsubstantial bureaucracy to vet all of the points of view and \napplications. Furthermore, under the worst of circumstances, it does \nnot necessarily bring about a strong bipartisan scrutiny of each \nother's proposals, quite apart from the scrutiny that organized labor \nmight get from the Chamber of Commerce and vice versa. In fact, the \nsystem has worked remarkably well.\n  I have served as a member of the Board of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy during the past 8 years. I have witnessed the process in \nwhich the Board--which is not divorced from the debate in Washington--\nthinks through those areas of the world that need specific emphasis.\n  Each of the four core groups is charged with finding proposals and \nfinding specific groups, often in countries that are emerging \ndemocracies, to bring forward ways in which democracy might be \nenhanced. Sometimes it is under very arduous and dangerous \ncircumstances. It is only after the core groups make their proposals, \nhaving reviewed them thoroughly, that the staff of the National \nEndowment for Democracy scrutinize them, ask for amendments, suggest \nchanges, delays or rejection.\n  Specific members of the Board who have particular expertise in \nvarious areas of the world spend a great deal of time pro bono taking a \nvery careful look at those proposals. But finally, each one of us, as \nBoard members, must pass on each and every single one of these grant \napplications.\n  On occasion we reject a fair number during a meeting, quite apart \nfrom whether a quota of grants has been allocated specifically to the \nfour. Each of the four ``cores'' has the ability and the talents to \nbring forward remarkable proposals for the advancement of democracy. \nThat has been occurring for the past 16 years.\n  The Foreign Relations committee has not held hearings on this \nproposal. It comes literally out of the blue. It may have some merit \nfor another organization at another time, but for this organization the \ngenius was in its initial inception--an opportunity to bring forward \nproposals that were not coming from the U.S. Government, from the State \nDepartment, from the White House, or the National Security Council.\n  It brought forward proposals from well-defined institutions in our \nsociety that are broadly based--members of the Democratic and \nRepublican parties, often elected officials, responsible to their \nconstituents, who are well aware of political currents in the country, \nand the institutions that characterize our national Chamber of Commerce \nand the AFL-CIO.\n  As a matter of fact, the Solidarity movement found resonance with the \nAFL-CIO. It was the labor movement of our country that brought forward \none of the most significant sets of proposals and advocacy.\n\n  It is a fact that at the recent 50th anniversary NATO celebration, \none of the great honors paid in this city was by the National Endowment \nfor Democracy to Lech Walesa. In many ways, Lech Walesa's leadership, \ncourageous as it was at a turning point in history, was a hallmark of \nthe work of the National Endowment. The checks and balances were at \nwork, because other groups took a look at the labor/Solidarity \nsituation in Poland and wondered whether it was appropriate for the \nUnited States Government to be appropriating funds that led to the \nchange of government in that country. On balance, our Government \nappropriated those funds but the National\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\nEndowment did make the decisions. They were outside the bureaucracy of \nthe Federal Government, outside the politicization that occurs when one \nparty or another gains dominance and a particular type of preferential \nstructure.\n\n  I make these points because I believe this is an arrangement that \nworks well. If the wagon isn't broke, we should not try to fix it. The \nsituation is clearly one that does not require any fixing.\n  There may be institutions in our society that wish we had established \na different sort of endowment. I suspect that if Members are prepared \nto vote for this amendment, it will be a very different National \nEndowment for Democracy. But I caution Members about the dangers of \nmaking these changes. Therefore, I ask for careful consideration by \nMembers. I ask, in fact, consideration of the remarkable work that is \nnow being done by the National Endowment for Democracy and the 16 years \nof very solid achievement by many great Americans who were outside of \nour Government, but who participated in boosting democracy through this \nvehicle.\n  I ask, therefore, for the defeat of the Feingold amendment. I am \nhopeful that as the votes are counted tomorrow, the National Endowment \nwill receive a vote of endorsement.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require at \nthis point.\n  Let me first say how much regard I have for the Senator from Indiana \nand enormous respect for his role on the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, his demeanor, and his knowledge. It is a pleasure to work \nwith him. We disagree on this one.\n  The Senator from Indiana suggests that this point about the National \nEndowment for Democracy comes from out of the blue. I have been here \nlong enough to know that year after year the former Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Bumpers, made several attempts to eliminate the program \nor change the program. It has been a regular subject of scrutiny in \nthis body, as it should be. I think to suggest that it is a surprise \nthat there would be some oversight of NED is not quite accurate.\n  What the Senator from Indiana is indicating, of course, is the \npolitical parties and business and labor are at the heart of a \npluralistic democratic society, that they are the fundamental concepts \nof American political life. I agree with him. I think it is important \nthat as we endeavor to encourage democratization around the world that \nwe try to include all of these elements of our democracy. But I do not \nthink it should be primarily limited or dominantly limited to these \nfour core grantees.\n  The Senator from Indiana knows far better than I do the origins of \nthe program. I appreciate his comments about what the thinking was in \nthe beginning, how these groups got together, and how the structure was \ncrucial for the program to begin. I do not dispute that. I am sure \nthere is some validity.\n  But I think after some 15 years, these groups and these organizations \nhave had time enough to develop their programs so they are ready to fly \non their own, that they are ready to compete against other applicants \nfor the funding in a free and fair manner.\n  The fact that the NED's four core grantees are guaranteed to receive \na set amount of funds every year seems to me fundamentally unfair and \nis a contradiction of our democratic principles, especially when you \nare talking about guaranteeing private groups taxpayer dollars, which \nis exactly what this does. Every group that conducts democracy programs \nshould have an equal opportunity to pursue Federal funding for its \nprograms, not just the ones that are so powerfully and politically \nconnected. These four well-connected groups are not the only people in \nAmerica that know something about political parties or business or \nlabor, but it is only these groups that are guaranteed 65 percent of \nthe grant money from this program. That is almost entirely taxpayers' \ndollars. To me, a much more appropriate system would be a competitive \none.\n  As I understand it, since the Senator fairly raises the concern about \nwhether the original understanding between these groups would be \npreserved, I am told that the board itself has representatives of both \nof the major political parties, as well as of business and labor, and \nthat they are the ones that would be making these decisions.\n  The Senator from Indiana indicates that this is a situation where \nsomething isn't broke so do not fix it. The fact is, in recent years a \nnumber of suggestions have been made about ways to help fix the \nprogram. There have been some problems. Some of these problems have \nbeen fixed. What I am trying to do here is continue the process of \nfixing it, of improving it.\n  As I indicated earlier, some 80 percent of this money was once tied \nup only for these four groups. Now it is lower, but it still represents \n65 percent of available grant money. What I am saying is, let us fix \nit, improve it, over the next 5 years, phasing this down so each year \nthis gets a little smaller. By the time we get to the end of that 5-\nyear period, we have all the money based on a fair competition and \nstill have a board that has representatives of both political parties \nand of business and labor so there is no real possibility of unfairness \nor partisanship in this regard.\n  All of this is offered in the spirit of trying to further improve the \nprogram, acknowledging its great worth, acknowledging the many good \nthings that are done. Let's just do a little better job of making sure \nour taxpayers' dollars are spent in a manner that involves the best \ninterests and the best applicants getting the money.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on \nthe Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the State \nDepartment authorization bill. Specifically, I would like to commend \nChairman Helms for the inclusion of a number of provisions dealing with \nChina. These provisions closely mirror legislation that I introduced \nlast year and earlier this year as Senate bill 89.\n  Section 701 of this act contains a number of findings on the human \nrights situation in China from the State Department's Annual Report on \nhuman rights practices. The government of the People's Republic of \nChina continues to commit widespread and egregious abuses of \ninternationally recognized human rights. Its prisons are overflowing \nwith tortured and mistreated citizens who would dare to practice their \nfaiths or exercise a political voice. Religious persecution, crackdowns \non political dissent, restrictions on the press, forced labor, forced \nabortions, repression of people in Tibet and Xinjiang province are, \nunfortunately, still a part of daily life in China.\n  In order to shed light on the dark practices of the Chinese \ngovernment, section 702 of this bill earmarks $2.2 million of money \nauthorized for the Department of State for additional personnel in U.S. \nembassies and consulates for each of FY2000 and FY2001 to monitor \npolitical and economic conditions, particularly human rights. These new \npersonnel, along with the creation of a prison information registry for \nthe People's Republic of China in section 703, will make it all the \nmore difficult for the Chinese government to deny that these abuses \npersist. With more centralized and accessible information, we will be \nable to better advocate for the release of these prisoners of \nconscience or faith.\n  It is also important that the people of China have access to the \ntruth. The U.S. may have accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in \nBelgrade, but it was no accident that the people did not hear President \nClinton's repeated apologies. Section 502 of this bill reauthorizes \nRadio Free Asia, bringing objective reporting to the people of China.\n  Section 705 strongly condemns the practice of organ harvesting, where \norgans from executed prisoners are sold\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\non the black market or where prisoners are executed for their organs. \nAccording to our own State Department, ``In recent years, credible \nreports have alleged that organs from some executed prisoners were \nremoved, sold, and transplanted. Officials have confirmed that executed \nprisoners are among the sources of organs for transplant but maintain \nthat consent is required from prisoners or their relatives before \norgans are removed * * * there were credible reports that patients from \nTaiwan had undergone organ transplant operations on the mainland, using \norgans removed from executed criminals.'' Where and when organ \nharvesting is taking place in China, it must be stopped.\n  Equally horrific is the practice of forcing women to undergo forced \nabortions or forced sterilization under the Chinese government's \npopulation control policies. Women who are pregnant with a second child \nfind themselves and their relatives harassed, fined, and sometimes even \nhave their homes destroyed until they are ultimately forced to undergo \nan abortion, even in the latest stages of pregnancy. Last June, the \nHouse International Relations Subcommittee on International Operations \nand Human Rights heard testimony of these practices from Gao Xiao Duan, \na former administrator of forced abortion, as well as Zhou Shiu Yon, a \nvictim of these policies. I believe that it is only appropriate that \nCongress act in response to this horrid devaluation of human life. \nSection 721 restricts visas for any foreign national whom the Secretary \nof State finds to have been directly involved in the establishment or \nenforcement of population control policies involving forced abortion or \nforced sterilization. There is no reason why we should welcome into our \ncountry those individuals who have no respect for human life.\n  United States-China relations are strained at this time. Amidst the \nwhirlwind of controversy, including espionage, campaign donations, the \naccidental embassy bombing, and a near $60 billion trade deficit, there \nare some who would argue that we should be quiet about human rights in \norder to preserve the relationship. But I would argue that human rights \nmust not be swept off our agenda. The Chinese government would like \nnothing more than for us to censor ourselves. I believe that this \nlegislation will help to ensure that human rights and the defense of \ninternationally recognized standards are kept intact.\n  Mr. President, there are two additional provisions it this \nlegislation. Section 704 requires the Secretary of State to report \nwithin 180 days on the feasibility and utility of establishing an \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Asia, modeled after the \nOSCE. Section 722 requires semiannual reports to Congress on the status \nof U.S. efforts to support the membership of Taiwan in international \norganizations that do not require statehood, and the appropriate level \nof participation in international organizations that do require \nstatehood for full membership. Taiwan's entry into international \norganizations has been held hostage to China's wishes for too long. In \nmany instances, such as World Trade Organization membership, Taiwan is \nmore qualified to join than China, yet simply because of China's \nsensitivities, it has been prevented from joining.\n  In the long run, we must recognize that the Chinese government is a \ntotalitarian regime. This dictatorship does not represent the people of \nChina, rather it abuses them in any way necessary to maintain its \npower. Similarly, this regime will use any necessary means to expand \nits power in Asia. If we are to effectively manage these aims, we will \nneed the help of our neglected allies in the region, namely Japan, \nTaiwan, and South Korea.\n  We cannot recover stolen information, but we must prevent future \ntheft through increased security at our national labs and other \nfacilities, more stringent background checks, controls on technology \ntransfers, and a Justice Department that does not hinder its own FBI's \ninvestigations. We cannot afford to give the Chinese government the \nmeans to fulfill its military aims.\n  We should, however, give the people of China the means to build their \nown democracy. Increased funding for Radio Free Asia, the Voice of \nAmerica, democracy building programs, and rule of law initiatives are \nvital because they represent an engagement with the people of China \nrather than the regime at the top. We must recognize the limits to \nengaging an insecure, transient government that is on the wrong side of \nhistory.\n  Finally, Mr. President, industry must do its part and aggressively \nadvocate human rights. Americans doing business in China must be active \nadvocates for human rights, to the Beijing government and to the \npeople. They must not be complicit in slave labor or other human rights \nviolations. The simple fact is that China desperately wants American \ntrade and American business. U.S. companies must use this leverage to \nadvance more than profits.\n  China is not yet our enemy, but neither is it our friend. Our China-\ncentered foreign policy must be replaced with a regional policy. We \nmust break off this Administration's obsession with trying to acede to \nBeijing's every demand. Such a policy can only strengthen a regime that \nwill seek to extinguish the flames of democracy abroad as it has done \nso effectively at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7320-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough June 16, 1999. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \nS. Res. 209, a resolution to provide budget levels in the Senate for \npurposes of fiscal year 1999, as amended by S. Res. 312. The budget \nlevels have also been revised to include adjustments made on May 19, \n1999, to reflect the amounts provided and designated as emergency \nrequirements. The estimates show that current level spending is above \nthe budget resolution by $0.4 billion in budget authority and above the \nbudget resolution by $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 \nbillion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $56.1 \nbillion, less than $50 million above the maximum deficit amount for \n1999 of $56.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated May 12, 1999, the Congress passed and the \nPresident signed the 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \n(P.L. 106-31). The Congress also cleared for the President's signature \nthe Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act (H.R. 435). These \nactions changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 1999.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, since I have a few minutes, I will speak \nabout the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  There was a piece in today's Washington Post which caught my eye, \nwritten by Mr. Paul Nitze, a former arms control negotiator and \nambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration. It was coauthored by \nanother gentleman. They made this point:\n\n       Approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by \n     the Senate is essential in order for the United States to be \n     in the strongest possible position to press for the early \n     enforcement of this vital agreement. Failure to act will \n     undercut our diplomatic efforts to combat the threat from the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n  I admit, I am not an expert in this area. I am not on the relevant \ncommittees, but I take a great interest in the question of the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems for nuclear \nweapons.\n  Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons known to mankind, \nthe most destructive weapons that have ever been developed on this \nEarth. There are numerous reasons why nations in this world seek to \ndevelop nuclear weapons. They are considered by some nations as a \nmeasure of their standing and prestige in the world. Others view them \nas the ultimate insurance policy. But, in fact, the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and the sheer number of nuclear weapons make this a \npretty unsafe world.\n  The proposition has been, going back to President Eisenhower's time, \nthat we ought to achieve a treaty banning the testing of nuclear \nweapons. In May of 1961, President Eisenhower said:\n\n       Not achieving a test ban would have to be classed as the \n     greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, \n     of any time, and of any party.\n\n  President Kennedy's speech at American University 36 years ago \naddressed the need for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He said:\n\n       A test ban would help check the spiraling arms race in one \n     of its most dangerous areas.\n\n  We must check the spiraling arms race. Since the Eisenhower and \nKennedy administrations, the leaders of this Nation have worked and \nlabored with other countries to fashion an agreement that would ban \nfurther testing of nuclear weapons.\n  Imagine their satisfaction if they could know that today 152 nations \nhave signed such an agreement, including China and Russia. Although 152 \nnations have signed such an agreement, we have not yet acted on that \nagreement in the Senate, and it is my profound hope that sometime in \nthe near future, in the next weeks or the next couple of months, in \nthis summer of 1999, that the Senate will review, debate and vote on \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I have spoken a couple of times in this Chamber on this issue. I am \nnot critical of anyone. There are strongly held views. I do not even \nknow how the vote would go if we had this vote. But I feel very \nstrongly we should have this debate and vote.\n  I have in this desk a reminder of the danger that existed in this \ncountry during the cold war that just ended with the old Soviet Union. \nI ask unanimous consent to show it to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a vial filled with chopped up \ncopper. This copper came from the wiring of a nuclear submarine the \nSoviet Union used to operate on the high seas with missiles and \nwarheads pointed at the United States. This submarine is gone. Its \nwiring has been chopped up. It was done so under an arms control \nagreement. We did not sink it. It was dismantled under an arms control \nagreement.\n  We must continue to work in every way to make progress in \nnonproliferation agreements and test ban treaties, and one of those \nsteps of progress, I hope, with the cooperation of all our colleagues, \nwill be to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the next week, 2 \nweeks, month or 2 months, in the summer of 1999.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to support Senate consideration of \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to request unanimous consent that \na June 21, 1999, Washington Post article written by Paul H. Nitze and \nSidney D. Drell, be printed in the Record following my remarks. This \narticle advocates the prompt ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. The United States initially led the global effort to \nstrengthen nuclear nonproliferation when we signed this treaty on \nSeptember 24, 1996; however, since that time, the Senate has not taken \nthe necessary steps towards ratification. Without the Senate's \nexpeditious approval of this treaty, the United States will be unable \nto assume a leadership position at the CTBT review conference this \nSeptember. We will also be undercut in our efforts to urge other \ncountries to ratify this agreement.\n  Both Ambassador Nitze and Mr. Drell have a long and distinguished \nhistory of service to both Republican and Democratic presidents. \nPresident Reagan awarded Ambassador Nitze the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. They both believe that America needs to lead the international \neffort to halt nuclear proliferation by ratifying the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. I urge my colleagues to read this important article. \nAs the authors note, ``failure to ratify the CTBT would have to be \nregarded as the greatest disappointment of any Senate, if any time, of \nany party.''\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 21, 1999]\n\n                      This Treaty Must Be Ratified\n\n                 [By Paul H. Nitze and Sidney D. Drell]\n\n       For more than five decades, we have served in a variety of \n     foreign policy, national security and intelligence positions \n     for both Republican and Democratic administrations. A common \n     thread in our experience is that our national interest is \n     best served when America leads. When America hesitates, \n     opportunities to improve our security and lost, and our \n     strategic position suffers. This year, America has an \n     opportunity to lead a global\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n     effort to strengthen nuclear nonproliferation by ratifying \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n       This fall, a review conference will meet to discuss ways to \n     bring the CTBT into effect even if it has not been approved \n     by all 44 nuclear-capable nations (i.e., those states with \n     nuclear reactors for research or power). The United States \n     was the first nation to sign the CTBT in September 1996; 151 \n     nations have now followed that lead. The U.S. Senate, \n     however, has refused to consider ratification of the treaty, \n     and only those nations that have ratified it will have a seat \n     at this fall's conference. Approval of the CTBT by the Senate \n     is essential in order for the United States to be in the \n     strongest possible position to press for the early \n     enforcement of this vital agreement. Failure to act will \n     undercut our diplomatic efforts to combat the threat from the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n       The president rightly has referred to the CTBT as the \n     ``longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in the history of arms \n     control.'' President Eisenhower was the first American leader \n     to pursue a ban on nuclear testing as a means to curb the \n     nuclear arms race. Today, such a ban would constrain advanced \n     and not-so-advanced nuclear weapons states from developing \n     more sophisticated and dangerous nuclear weapons \n     capabilities.\n       This is particularly important in South Asia. Last year, \n     both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests, threatening \n     a dangerous escalation of their nuclear arms competition. \n     Both countries now have expressed a commitment to adhere to \n     the CTBT this year. U.S. ratification would remove any excuse \n     for inaction on the part of these nations and would \n     strengthen their resolve.\n       The CTBT also fulfills a commitment made by the nuclear \n     powers in gaining the agreement of 185 nations to extend \n     indefinitely the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995. The \n     NPT remains the cornerstone of the worldwide effort to limit \n     the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce nuclear danger.\n       We strongly embrace President Reagan's vision of a world \n     free of nuclear weapons. The administration needs to engage \n     Russia on deep reductions in nuclear forces, despite the \n     disruption in our bilateral relations resulting from the \n     crisis in the Balkans. In the meantime, the United States \n     will be able to maintain the safety and reliability of its \n     own stockpile through the Department of Energy's science-\n     based stockpile stewardship program. Our confidence in this \n     program underpins our judgment that there is no technical \n     reason why the CTBT is not the right thing to do.\n       President Reagan's maxim--trust but verify--is still true \n     today. With the CTBT, the United States will gain new tools \n     to assess compliance with a ban on nuclear testing--including \n     the right to request a short-notice, on-site inspection if we \n     had evidence that a test might have occurred. Combined with \n     the treaty's extensive international monitoring regime and \n     our own intelligence resources, the CTBT is effectively \n     verifiable.\n       The Senate has an obligation to review expeditiously major \n     treaties and agreements entered into by the Executive so that \n     the world can be sure of America's course. When President \n     Reagan signed the INF Treaty in December 1987, which \n     eliminated an entire class of missiles, hearings in the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee began within weeks, and \n     the Senate voted to approve the treaty within six months. In \n     comparison, the CTBT was signed by President Clinton more \n     than 2\\1/2\\ years ago but still awaits its first hearing.\n       In May 1961, President Eisenhower said that not achieving a \n     nuclear test ban ``would have to be classed as the greatest \n     disappointment of any administration--of any decade--of any \n     time and of any party.'' Similarly, failure to ratify the \n     CTBT would have to be regarded as the geatest disappointment \n     of any Senate, of any time, of any party. We urge the Senate \n     to ratify the CTBT now.\n       Paul H. Nitze is a former arms control negotiator and was \n     an ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration. Sidney \n     D.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nboth cloture on the steel quota bill, and to the bill itself.\n  I oppose this dangerous and misguided legislation for three reasons.\n  First, the steel quota bill is really a phony bill of goods. It does \nnot do what it promises. It will not restore the vitality of troubled \nelements of the U.S. steel industry. That's because foreign imports \nhave little to do with the problems facing the American steel industry.\n  Why? Because the American steel industry is much more efficient than \nat almost any time in our past history. Fewer steel workers are \nproducing more steel today than they were 10 years ago. In 1987, when \nthe domestic industry produced 77 million short tons, 163,000 workers \nwere employed in the steel industry. In 1997, 10 years later, when the \ndomestic industry produced 106 million tons, employment was 112,000 \nworkers. During that 10 year span, our steel mills made 29 million more \ntons with 51,000 fewer workers.\n  Using the logic behind this quota legislation, the more efficient our \nsteel industry becomes, the more it requires protection from foreign \nimports. But in fact, the opposite is true. The more protection an \nindustry gets, the more inefficient it becomes. That is not good for \nour economy, or for American consumers. During the next few years, we \nmay see steel employment fall even further, perhaps by as much of 5,000 \nworkers per year, as inefficient integrated mills are closed. New, more \nefficient minimills will take up any slack. All of this will happen \nwhether or not steel quotas are imposed.\n  Who will really benefit from the quota bill?\n  According to the Institute For International Economics, one of this \ncountry's most distinguished and highly regarded think tanks, few steel \nworkers will benefit. But steel importers and profitable, efficient \nsteel makers will win big.\n  The Institute's report states:\n\n       The annual costs to American households for each steel job \n     saved would exceed $800,000. But steel workers would receive \n     less than 20 percent of this huge sum; lucky firms would \n     collect more than 80 percent of the jackpot. . . . Quotas \n     will enrich lucky steel importers (often those with the best \n     political connections) and efficient steel producers (they \n     are doing well enough already--11 of the 13 largest mills \n     earned more than $1 billion in 1998). . . .\n\n  The United States Senate should not help enrich a few lucky \nimporters. It should not give windfalls to companies earning a billion \ndollars a year.\n  I have the deepest concern for any American who loses his or her job \nfor any reason. It is a terrible, wrenching thing to lose a job. It \naffects families as well as communities. We must help where we can, \nthrough programs like trade adjustment assistance, that help displaced \nworkers through job retraining and placement assistance. But the one \nthing we must not do is react in haste, in a way that will kill far \nmore jobs than it will ever save, and in a way that will reward healthy \ncompanies with windfall profits.\n  The second reason I oppose the steel quota bill is that it flat-out \nviolates our WTO international trade obligations.\n  There are some who claim this is not the case. But, I want to read \nthe exact words of Article 11 of the GATT. This rule is part of the WTO \nrules that we and 133 other nations are committed to observe:\n\n       No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes, \n     or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, \n     import or export licenses or other measures, shall be \n     instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the \n     importation of any product of the territory of any other \n     contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of \n     any product destined for the territory of any other \n     contracting party.\n\n  We helped write that law. We demand that our trading partners observe \nit. We defend it when other countries try to keep our goods out of \ntheir markets. And most of the time, we win these cases.\n  Now, I'm not a lawyer. Maybe that's my problem. Perhaps I'm not \nclever enough to figure out where Article 11 says that quotas are OK. \nIt seems pretty clear to me. It says that you can't have restrictions \nother than duties, taxes, or other charges. But Article 11 goes even \nfarther than banning quotas. It says that you can't have any type of \ngovernment measure that leads to the imposition of a quota.\n  One important panel decision, the GATT panel on Semiconductors, \naffirmed this broad interpretation in 1988. It said that Article 11, \nunlike other GATT provisions, does not refer solely to laws or \nregulations. It has an even broader application, and refers to all \n``measures'' that restrict exports.\n  There are some exceptions to Article 11's broad ban on any measures \nrestricting exports. But the most relevant of these exceptions, the so-\ncalled Safeguard exception, does not apply because there is no proof \nthat our domestic steel industry has suffered serious injury from \nimport competition. Moreover, safeguard actions usually involve \nimposing increased customs duties, rather than quotas. Yes, there has \nbeen illegal dumping of steel by some countries into the United States. \nBut the surge of that dumped steel has largely been stopped. And even \nduring the highest point last year of the so-called\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nsteel crisis, 11 of the 13 largest steel mills were profitable, earning \ncollective profits of more than $1 billion. So much for serious injury.\n  The final reason I oppose the quote bill--and the most important \nreason--is that it will invite retaliation and perhaps spark a trade \nwar that no one would win, and in which everyone would lose.\n  We are approaching the 69th anniversary of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff \nAct of 1930. This legislation, which was enacted in July 1930, was one \nof the major mistakes of the Hoover Administration and the Seventy-\nfirst Congress.\n  The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act also started out with good intentions. \nIts aim was to help the American farmer with a limited, upward revision \nof tariffs on foreign produce. But it had the opposite result. It \nstrangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the \nDepression. Other countries faced with a deficit of exports to pay for \ntheir imports responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American \ngoods.\n  I went back to the historical record to see what happened to United \nStates agricultural exports when other countries stopped buying our \nagricultural products after we enacted that tariff. I was shocked by \nthe depth and the severity of the retaliation.\n  In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of \nagricultural goods. By 1932, that amount had been cut almost in half, \nto $589 million. Barley exports dropped by half. So did exports of \nsoybean oil. Pork exports fell 15 percent. Almost every American export \nsector was hit by foreign retaliation, but particularly agriculture. As \nUnited States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign \nretaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of many \nrural banks. Their weakened condition undermined depositor confidence, \nleading to depositor runs, bank failures, and ultimately, a contraction \nin the money supply.\n  Farm prices for many agricultural products are already at rock-bottom \nlevels. Can we in good conscience put so much of our economy at risk?\n  In 1998 the United States exported agricultural products worth more \nthan $53 billion dollars, accounting for one-third of America's total \nagricultural production, and nearly one million jobs. Agriculture is \nperhaps the most vulnerable sector of our economy to foreign \nretaliation, and our trading partners know it.\n  If you think the Depression is ancient history, and that retaliation \nagainst agriculture is a thing of the past, just look at our recent \nhistory.\n  In 1995, when the United States threatened to impose 100% tariffs on \nimports of Japanese luxury cars, Japan appealed the case to the WTO and \nstated that it might retaliate imposing duties on U.S. exports of \nagriculture products.\n  In 1983, China temporarily stopped buying U.S. wheat in retaliation \nfor the Reagan Administration's unilateral imposition of quotas on its \ntextile and apparel exports after negotiations to renew a bilateral \nagreement under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement broke down.\n  In 1985, the European Community raised tariffs on U.S. lemons and \nwalnuts in response to U.S. retaliation against subsidized EC pasta \nexports.\n  Even though we have made vast progress in managing our trade \nrelationships since the passage of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, in many \nways the world is still just one trade war away from a global economic \ncrisis.\n  In 1930, 1,000 of the nation's leading economists signed a letter \nurging the President and the Congress to not enact the infamous \nlegislation we now know as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. They were ignored. \nPolitics carried the day. American paid a steep price. Let us not \nrepeat the mistakes of the Seventy-first Congress. The quota bill is \nbad trade policy. It is bad for agriculture. It is bad for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7323-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to allow access for researchers to Continuous Work \nHistory Sample data of the Social Security Administration; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n        social security's continuous work history sample (cwhs)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nintroduce another Social Security-related bill.\n  This bill would give all researchers access to Social Security's \nContinuous Work History Sample (CWHS).\n  The access to the CWHS is critical for the general public and other \ngovernment agencies to fully evaluate the working of the current system \nand estimate the budgetary impact of any changes that need to be made \nin the future.\n  The CWHS is a key set of data which holds information on the work and \nbenefit histories of Social Security program participants. Until 1976, \nthis data was widely available to federal, state agencies, universities \nand private research groups.\n  There is no evidence of any misuse of the CWHS in the period before \n1976.\n  The 1976 Tax Reform Act denied access to CWHS data to almost all \nusers outside of the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Although it later extended the access to a few units of government \nagencies, private researchers are still denied access. The excuse was \nto protect privacy.\n  However, the IRS is covered by the same law. But it has interpreted \nthe law to enable it to make samples of individual tax returns \navailable to researchers on the basis that identifiers must be removed \nand the research must be bona fide.\n  Mr. President, if the IRS can make its data available to researchers, \nwhy cannot the SSA do the same?\n  Last year, during a Budget Committee hearing, I asked SSA \nCommissioner Apfel about this. Here is his reply:\n\n       The SSA supports, in principle, the idea of making data \n     from our administrative records available to researchers in \n     order to better inform the ongoing debate on the future of \n     Social Security.\n\n  The National Research Council and other academic institutions also \nsupport to give researchers access to the CWHS.\n  My legislation would amend the 1976 Tax Reform Act to allow bona fide \nresearchers access to CWHS data, and at the same time protect the \nconfidentiality and privacy of program participants.\n  It also requires researchers to sign a legally binding agreement that \nrestricts use of the data to the research and forbids the disclosure of \ninformation that could be used to identify individuals.\n  Mr. President, this is ``good government'' legislation. Allowing \naccess to CWHS data will open the entire Social Security system to \noutside scrutiny.\n  It will significantly improve oversight of the program and enable \nAmericans to know everything they need to know about how the system \noperates and what changes are needed to make it solvent.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support these legislative \ninitiatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1246. A bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to \nprohibit the imposition of discriminatory commuter taxes by political \nsubdivisions of States; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     tax fairness for commuters act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman and Senator Dodd to introduce the Tax \nFairness for Commuters Act. Last month, Governor Pataki of New York \nsigned legislation to ``repeal'' the New York City commuter tax. \nHowever, the legislation signed into law only repealed the tax for \nresidents of New York. The over 300,000 residents of Connecticut and \nNew Jersey will still be subjected to this tax.\n  I believe that the lawsuit jointly undertaken by New Jersey and \nConnecticut along with the city of New York and affected commuters will \nultimately prevail and this attempt will be proven unconstitutional. \nHowever, I am concerned about the attempted precedent that has been \nset.\n  Our legislation will remove the temptation of any State or any city \nto impose higher taxes on non-residents than it does on residents. The \nbill is very simple. It says that a State or city may not impose a \nhigher tax on the income earned by non-residents than it does on \nresidents. I hope that each Senator, no matter what part of the country \nthey are from, will recognize the inherent danger in discriminatory \ntaxes of this nature and will support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON IMPOSITION OF DISCRIMINATORY \n                   COMMUTER TAXES BY POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 4 of title 4, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 116. Prohibition on imposition of discriminatory \n       commuter taxes by political subdivisions of States\n\n       ``A political subdivision of a State may not impose a tax \n     on income earned within such political subdivision by \n     nonresidents of the political subdivision unless the \n     effective rate of such tax imposed on such nonresidents who \n     are residents of such State is not less than such rate \n     imposed on such nonresidents who are not residents of such \n     State.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for \n     chapter 4 of title 4, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n``116. Prohibition on imposition of discriminatory commuter taxes by \n              political subdivisions of States.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, and my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce legislation that would amend \ntitle 4 of the United States Code to prohibit the imposition of \ndiscriminatory commuter taxes by political subdivisions of States.\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n  On May 26, 1999, New York Governor George Pataki signed into law a \nrepeal of the commuter tax for people who work in New York City but \nlive outside of the five boroughs. This repeal only applies to \nresidents of New York state; it does not include the 330,000 people \nfrom New Jersey and Connecticut who work in New York City.\n  In 1966, Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Mayor John Lindsay initiated \nthe commuter tax. To the present day, New York City has enforced the \n0.45% tax on commuters' income much like a payroll tax. Estimates show \nthat this tax generates $360 million a year in revenue that helps to \nsupports services such as police and fire protection and emergency \nmedical care. New York state residents contribute $210 million a year \nin commuter tax revenue, while New Jersey and Connecticut residents \naccount for the remaining $150 million in tax revenue. The commuter tax \nrepeal eliminates more than $200 million from New York City's annual \ntax revenue.\n  New York State's unilateral, partial repeal of the commuter tax only \nfor its residents is an unfortunate development after 33 years of \nassessing the tax on all commuters who work in New York City. This is \nan unprecedented action on the part of a legislative body and state \nexecutive to repeal a tax on its residents but maintain it for non-\nresidents. The imposition of taxes only on out-of-state commuters could \nviolate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Limited \nrepeal discriminates against out-of-state commuters and inhibits \ninterstate commerce and travel.\n  Approximately 86,000 of my constituents work in New York City, \ncontributing an estimated $100 million in commuter tax revenue; 244,000 \nNew Jersey constituents account for an estimated $50 million in tax \nrevenue that goes to New York City. According to Connecticut Attorney \nGeneral Richard Blumenthal, the taxable income of Connecticut commuters \nis lower than non-commuters because of this tax that commuters pay to \nNew York. The commuter tax essentially draws away millions of dollars \nin tax revenue from Connecticut and gives them to New York City to \nsubsidize services and other public works.\n  This Connecticut and New Jersey subsidy to New York City is \nunacceptable. If a commuter tax is imposed all commuters--whether they \nare from Newark, New Rochelle, or New Haven--are equally responsible to \nbear it. There is no reason that our commuter constituents should be \npaying for New York City services while New York state residents are \nnot.\n  Senator Torricelli and I are joined by others who have taken action \nto force a repeal of the law passed by the New York state legislature. \nTwo attorneys, Richard Swanson and Thomas Igoe, filed a complaint in \nManhattan Supreme Court that seeks class-action status for other \ncommuters from New Jersey and Connecticut. Swanson from New Jersey and \nIgoe from Connecticut are colleagues at the Manhattan law firm of \nThelen, Reid & Priest. Moreover, Governor Rowland of Connecticut and \nGovernor Whitman of New Jersey plan to challenge the constitutionality \nof the commuter tax repeal bill in federal courts. New York City Mayor \nRudolph Giuliani also intends to file a lawsuit against the state, \nalthough his claim stands on different grounds than the ones brought \nforth by Governors Whitman and Rowland.\n  The partial commuter tax repeal bill that Governor Pataki signed \nincludes a provision that says that the tax will be repealed for all \ncommuters if a partial repeal is found unconstitutional in federal \ncourts. Even if the lawsuits succeed in their legal challenges, we \nstill need legislation that will prevent state governments from \ndiscriminating against nonresidents and imposing unfair commuter taxes \nin the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1247. A bill to develop and apply a Consumer Price Index that \naccurately reflects the cost-of-living for older Americans who receive \nSocial Security benefits under title II of the Social Security Act; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         fair cost of living adjustment for seniors act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 1999 has been declared the ``International \nYear of the Older Person'' by the United Nations.\n\n  In honor of this special tribute, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation specially designed to provide fair and accurate Social \nSecurity benefits in order to help all Americans achieve retirement \nsecurity.\n  I believe senior citizens in this country have made, and continue to \nmake, valuable contributions to their families, communities and to \nsociety as a whole.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the debate over Social \nSecurity's future has been attempts to frighten older Americans. Many \nseniors fear that they may lose their Social Security benefits.\n  To ease their fears and worries, I introduced legislation last month \nthat would require the government to legally guarantee seniors full \nSocial Security benefits plus accurate COLA adjustments.\n  In essence, this bill would give older Americans property rights to \ntheir Social Security benefits, which they do not have now. It is no \nwonder they now worry about loss of benefits.\n  However, an accurate method for how we calculate Social Security \nremains a subject of debate.\n  In order to understand this issue, Mr. President, we need to go back \nand take a closer look at how seniors' COLAs are currently calculated \nby the government.\n  To compensate for the effects of inflation, Congress passed \nlegislation in 1972 to give Social Security beneficiaries an automatic \ncost of living adjustment, or a COLA.\n  This COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as tracked and \nsurveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) under the Labor \nDepartment.\n  Currently, the BLS produces two official CPIs, one for All Urban \nConsumers called the CPI-U, and one for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical \nWorkers, called the CPI-W.\n  The CPI-U represents the spending habits of about 80 percent of the \npopulation of this nation, and the CPI-W is a subset of the formula, \nrepresenting about 32 percent of the total population. The government \nuses the later the CPI-W to measure COLAs for Social Security benefits.\n  But clearly, this does not reflect the older American population and \ntheir consumption habits. Spending habits of urban wage earners cannot \nbe equated with those seniors. Nevertheless, the government continues \nto use it calculating COLAs for Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Back in 1987, after considerable criticism of the CPI-W and its \napplicability to senior consumers, Congress amended the Older Americans \nAct of 1965 to require the BLS to develop an experimental CPI that \nwould better reflect the buying habits of consumers 62 years of age or \nolder. This is now known as the CPI-E.\n  The CPI-E places greater weight on the cost of such goods and \nservices as medical care and prescription drugs, areas where seniors \nspend more than other Americans.\n  Although it's still experimental, the preliminary finding shows \nannual increases in Social Security benefit payments received by older \nAmericans are not keeping pace with inflation on the goods and services \non which they spend much of their money.\n  Over the past 15 years, goods purchased by seniors increased 6 \npercentage points more than goods purchased by the general public. \nTheir medical costs skyrocketed 156 percent. The main reason that the \nCPI-E has been higher than the other two CPIs.\n  My concern is, as inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods \ncontinues to rise, without a fair COLA increase, older Americans' hard-\nearned Social Security benefits are worth less and less. Their \npurchasing power will continue to diminish.\n  Mr. President, that's why I am introducing legislation today to \nprevent that from happening. My legislation is simple and \nstraightforward. It first calls for the establishment of a CPI Review \nCommittee made up of well-known economists who have expertise in the \nfield, plus representatives of our senior citizens population.\n  The Committee will be given the task of studying how to analyze and \nimprove the CPI-E method, make recommendations, and form an \nimplementation plan to produce a CPI that accurately reflects the \nsenior population\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\nand their consumption that will be used to determine the Social \nSecurity COLA each year.\n  Appointing economic professionals will de-politicize this issue, and \nallow us to make sound policy based on merits rather than on political \nconsideration.\n  This is also consistent with the measures recommended by the Advisory \nCommission to Study the Consumer Price Index, or the Boskin Commission, \nwhich calls for Congress to establish an independent committee or \ncommission of experts to review progress in developing a new system of \nmeasuring the overall cost of living adjustments.\n  Within a year, the Committee I recommend is required to complete its \nwork. A pilot program will test the accuracy of the CPI-E over a 3 year \nperiod by using improved and recommended methods.\n  However, I must point out that the experimental CPI-E currently \ncomputed by the BLS has limitations. For instance, the number of \nconsumer units was relatively small, only 19 percent of the total \nsample.\n  Expenditure weights used in the construction of the CPI-E have a \nhigher sampling error than those used for larger populations.\n  That's the reason that my legislation specifically instructs the \nCommittee to remove this and other major limitations. To construct an \nimproved CPI-E that is more scientific, accurate and representative of \nolder Americans' spending habits.\n  We had the right idea in 1987. My legislation will improve on that \nlaw after we've had some time to analyze it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues will raise questions \nabout this bill.\n  First, they are going to say, what about the issue of cost? Mr. \nPresident, it is perhaps true that moving from the CPI-W to the \nimproved CPI-E to determine Social Security COLA increases may increase \nfederal spending.\n  As a consistent fiscal conservative, I am concerned about the \nbudgetary impact. I believe we must exercise caution and discipline on \nhow government spends our money.\n  However, the issue of a fair Social Security COLA is not at its root \na fiscal one, but rather an issue of fairness, particularly in the case \nof retired workers who rely upon their fixed Social Security pensions \nfor survival.\n  I have argued repeatedly that the federal government has entered into \na sacred covenant with the American people to provide benefits for \ntheir retirement if they pay into the system.\n  We have also committed to give them a fair COLA to keep up with \ninflation. It's our moral and contractual duty to honor that \ncommitment, and to ensure the program will be there for current and \nfuture beneficiaries.\n  Senior citizens are a unique consumer population that should not be \nlumped into a category that considers spending habits the same as the \naverage American family of four.\n  Once again, Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness and justice, \nnot an issue of cost. All my legislation asks for is an accurate CPI \nand a fair COLA, up or down.\n  Second question: if an official CPI-E is created, wouldn't it set a \npotentially dangerous precedent for creating a CPI for every seemingly \ndistinct population group? The answer is no.\n  Senior citizens comprise nearly 60 percent of Social Security \nbeneficiaries, and this number will increase substantially as the Baby \nBoomer generation retires. Furthermore, the Social Security program is \nspecifically intended to benefit senior citizens. It's only fair and \nrational to create an accurate CPI for them.\n  However, we have not forgotten that there is another distinct group \nof Social Security beneficiaries who receive disability benefits.\n  Because this group also spends more of their money for medical and \npharmaceutical goods and services, their purchasing power could be \naffected by the inaccurate CPI and therefore COLA increase.\n  My legislation specifically requires the Committee to look into this \nissue and make recommendations on how to resolve it.\n  Third question: would this legislation overlap and contradict the \nstudy conducted by the Boskin Commission? The answer again is no.\n  On the contrary, my legislation is a complement to the Boskin \nCommission report. It parallels the general recommendations of the \nBoskin Commission.\n  These include development of a new Consumer Expenditure Survey that \nis larger and therefore more representative of the American consumer; \ndevelopment of a new market basket of goods and services that can \nregister changes in the quality of products, the introduction of new \nproducts, and the substitution of less or more expensive goods when \nprices change; and development of a point-of-purchase survey that can \nregister consumer shifts to lower price outlets.\n  Finally, would this legislation set back Social Security reform \nefforts? The answer is no. As I mentioned earlier, it would be wrong to \nlet Social Security beneficiaries bear the burden of a mistake which is \nnot of their own making.\n  In fact, when we give a legal guarantee to older Americans that they \nwill receive Social Security benefits in full plus a fair COLA increase \nand take this fear away from them, it will be much easier to move the \nretirement system from a PAYGO system to a fully funded system.\n  This would in effect secure retirement income for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, retirement security for today's and \ntomorrow's seniors is essential to the social stability and economic \nprosperity of our society. This is all my legislation attempts to \nachieve.\n  I urge the Senate to make this issue the top priority for the 106th \nCongress. Working together, we will meet the demographic challenges and \nmove towards a society that allows all ages to progress in the new \nmillennium.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. McCain (for himself and Mr. Hollings)):\n  S. 1248. A bill to correct errors in the authorizations of certain \nprograms administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         legislation to increase the nhtsa authorization level\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat would increase the authorization level of the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration. The recently passed TEA-21 legislation \nauthorized NHTSA at its requested level, approximately $87.4 million.\n  Although the Department of Transportation requested $87.4 million, \nSecretary Slater now informs us that this authorization level will not \npermit the funding of key safety initiatives. The bill would increase \nthe funding levels to approximately $107.8 million. This amount is \nconsistent with the amount recently reported by the House Commerce \nCommittee. It is my intention to move this matter quickly in the \ncommittee.\n  I know that no one in this body wants a situation where highway \nsafety is degraded in any way. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to address this important issue of highway safety in a \nmanner that provides the appropriate funding level to meet safety needs \nwhile also meeting our budget obligations and the consensus of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 1249. A bill to deny Federal public benefits to individuals who \nparticipated in Nazi persecution; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the nazi benefits termination act of 1998\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, the Nazi \nBenefits Termination Act of 1999. This legislation seeks to halt an \nunintended and unwarranted series of public benefits payments to \nutlimately deportable individuals who assisted or otherwise \nparticipated in persecution sponsored by the Nazis or their allies \nduring World War II. The bill also closes a loophole in the current law \nwhich allows some of these deportable individuals to avoid the \nsuspension of their benefits by fleeing the United States. Such \nindividuals who illegally gain access to the bounty of the United \nStates, for example, by misrepresenting the facts of their wartime \nconduct, should not be allowed to benefit from their deceit at the \nexpense of the Treasury, including the Social Security Trust Funds. So \ntoo, individuals\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\nwho avoid entry of an order of deportation or removal by fleeing the \nUnited States should not be permitted to circumvent the intent of the \nlaw at the expense of the Trust Funds.\n  Recognizing the excellent work of the Department of Justice's Office \nof Special Investigations (OSI) in bringing and winning cases against \nthose who participated in Nazi persecution, the Nazi Benefits \nTermination Act of 1999 delegates to the Attorney General the \ndiscretionary authority to initiate proceedings to prohibit the payment \nof public benefits to any benefits receipient or applicant whom the \nAttorney General has reason to believe may have been a participant in \npersecution sponsored by the Nazis or their allies. Although OSI's \nsuccess in deporting former Nazi persecutors has resulted in the \ncessation of social security benefits payments to numerous persons, \nthis bill will, among other things, permit termination of benefits even \nbefore (or without) an order of deportation. This bill will apply to \npersons eventually subject to deportation who have assisted in Nazi \npersecution in any way. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence of \nsuch assistance or other participation in persecution is required. The \nAttorney General need not prove that a particular respondent is or was \na war criminal. Rather, this legislation adopts the Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals' properly broad interpretation of the Holtzman \nAmendment (now Sections 212(a)(3)(E) and 237(a)(4)(D) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act) terms ``participated'' or ``assisted'' \nin persecution. In Schellong v. I.N.S., the Sevneth Circuit properly \ninterpreted the Holtzman Amendment, which is incorporated into this \nbill's statutory standard. The standard set out by the Sixth Circuit in \nPetkiewytsch v. I.N.S., ignores the plain language of the Holtzman \nAmendment and is specifically rejected by this bill. The Nazi Benefits \nTermination Act of 1999, like the Holtzman Amendment, applies to \npersons who assisted or otherwise participated in Nazi-sponsored \npersecution in any way, and does not require a showing by the \ngovernment of personal or direct involvement in atrocities, \nvoluntariness or motive.\n  Section 2(b)(2)(B)(1) of the bill is drafted to cover naturalized \ncitizens whose admission to the United States was unlawful due, inter \nalia, to assistance in persecution or who otherwise procured their \ncitizenship illegally or by concealment of a material fact or \nmisrepresentation.\n  Section 3(a) of the legislation provides that Immigration Judges \nappointed by the Attorney General pursuant to the procedure established \nunder the regulations implementing Section 1101(b)(4) of Title 8 will \npreside over the benefits hearings established by this bill. The rules, \nprocedures, and rights applicable in these hearings are to be governed \nby the terms of this bill, existing regulations under Title 8, and any \nnecessary additional implementing regulations.\n  The preponderance-of-the-evidence burden of proof will apply in \nhearings conducted under Section 3(a) of the bill. This standard is \napplicable in federal benefits revocation proceedings and most civil \nproceedings. Under this standard, we can avoid the delays incident to \nassembly of proof in denaturalization and deportation cases brought \nagainst this class, and consequently stem current depletion of the \nTreasury.\n  Section 3(f) of the bill makes clear that findings under section \n3(c)(3)(A) of the bill may be based upon the collateral estoppel effect \nof denaturalization, deportation, or other appropriate judgments.\n  It is important to pass this legislation to help protect the public \nagainst unintended and unwarranted waste in paying benefits to \nultimately deportable individuals. This measure will help to conserve \nresources so that future generations can continue to rely upon social \nsecurity and other necessary public benefits payments.\n  I hope all my colleagues will be able to support this important \nlegislation and I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure a \ncontinuum of health care for veterans, to require pilot programs \nrelating to long-term health care for veterans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n          the veterans' long-term care enhancement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``Veterans' Long-Term Care Enhancement Act of 1999.'' There is no doubt \nthat demand for long-term care--for veterans and non-veterans alike--is \nincreasing. In the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), however, we \nface an even more pressing demand.\n  The numbers are staggering. About 34 percent of the total veteran \npopulation is 65 years or older, compared with about 13 percent of the \ntotal United States population. In the year 2000, the number of \nveterans aged 65 or older will peak at 9.3 million. In my state of West \nVirginia alone, we have approximately 57,000 World War II veterans.\n  Because VA has already faced considerable demand for long-term care, \nit has been forced to become a leader in this field. I am proud of VA's \nwork in developing geriatric evaluation teams, home-based primary care, \nand adult day health care. Our older veterans are leading richer lives \nbecause of these innovations. But to quote from the Report of the \nFederal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care, despite \nVA's high quality and long tradition, ``VA long-term care is \nmarginalized and unevenly funded.''\n  Frequently I hear from families of World War II combat veterans who \nneed long-term care because of a debilitating disease, such as \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's, or a stroke. A number of these families do \nnot have the money to place the veteran in a private nursing home for \nthe necessary long-term care; and because of the veteran's sacrifices \nduring World War II, they turn to the VA.\n  Or I will get a call from a wife of an aging, sick veteran who wants \ndesperately to keep her husband at home with her, but in order to do \nthat she needs home health care services, so she turns to the VA.\n  But when these West Virginian families are told by VA that the \nservices they need are not available to them, they simply cannot \nunderstand how they could be denied, and they turn to me in despair.\n  The challenge for all of us, of course, is to find a way to furnish \nthe appropriate array of services, in a cost efficient way, to all \nthose needing extended care.\n  As the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs noted in its March 15, \n1999, letter to the Budget Committee with the Committee's views on VA's \nbudget for FY 2000, ``The health care issue that VA must face over the \nintermediate term--indeed, the health care issue that the Nation must \nface over the next decade--is the need for long-term care among the \naging World War II generation. WWII veterans saved Western \ncivilization. We cannot turn our backs on them now.''\n  At the outset, I want to say that my wish would be for VA to provide \nlong-term care to all veterans who need and want it. While the \nlegislation I am introducing today is only one step toward determining \nwhat VA should be doing to meet the needs of veterans for long-term \ncare, I believe that it is an important step in that regard.\n  There are three key elements in the bill. First, are provisions which \nclarify that long-term care is not only nursing home care, and that \nexisting differences in law between eligibility for institutional long-\nterm care and other types of care offered by VA do not affect VA's \nability to furnish a full array of noninstitutional long-term care \nservices.\n  Specifically, the provision would add ``noninstitutional extended \ncare services'' to the definition of ``medical services,'' thereby \nremoving any doubt about VA's authority to furnish such services to \nveterans eligible for and enrolled in VA care. The term would be \ndefined to include the following: home-based primary care; adult day \nhealth care; respite care; palliative and end-of-life care; and \nhomemaker or home health aide visits.\n  Second, the bill would add clear authority for VA to furnish assisted \nliving services, including to the spouses of veterans. VA already \nfurnishes a form of assisted living services through its domiciliary \ncare program, but the provision in the bill would provide express \nauthority to furnish this modality of care to older veterans, thereby \nexpanding the continuum of extended care services offered by VA.\n  Third, VA would be mandated to carry out a series of pilot programs, \nover a period of three years, which would be designed to gauge the best \nway for VA to meet veterans' long-term care needs--either directly, \nthrough cooperative arrangements with community providers, or by \npurchasing services from non-VA providers.\n  While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over \nthe past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share \nits learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development \nbeyond that which met the current needs at the time. Some experts even \nbelieve that VA's expertise is gradually eroding.\n  For VA's expertise to be of greatest use to others, it needs both to \nbetter capture what it has done and to develop new learning that would \nbe most applicable to other health care entities.\n  Those who would benefit by further action to develop and capitalize \non VA's long-term care expertise include older veterans, primarily our \nhonored World War II veterans; those health organizations, including \nacademic medicine and research entities, with which VA is now \nconnected; and finally, the rest of the U.S. health care system, and \nultimately all Americans who will need some form of long-term care \nservices.\n  Each element of the pilot program would establish and carry out a \ncomprehensive long-term care program, with a full array of services, \nranging from inpatient long-term care--in intermediate care beds, in \nnursing homes, and in domiciliary care facilities--to comprehensive \nnoninstitutional services, which include hospital-based home care, \nadult day health care, personal assistance services, respite care, and \nother community-base interventions.\n  In each element of the pilot programs, VA would also be mandated to \nfurnish case management services, to ensure that veterans participating \nin the pilot programs receive the optimal treatment and placement for \nservices. Some form of assisted living services for veterans and their \nfamilies would be provided, as well. Preventive health care services, \nsuch as screening and patient education, and a particular focus on end-\nof-life care are also emphasized. In my view, VA must have ready access \nto all of these services.\n  As part of the pilot program, VA would be encouraged to seek the \ninvolvement of State Veterans Homes, so\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\nas to draw them into noninstitutional approaches to long-term care. Our \nState Veterans Homes are valuable assets.\n  Finally, a key purpose of the pilot program would be to test and \nevaluate various approaches to meeting the long-term care needs of \neligible veterans, both to develop approaches that could be expanded \nacross VA, as well as to demonstrate to others outside of VA the \neffectiveness and impact of various approaches to long-term care. To \nthis end, the pilot program within in the ``Veterans' Long-Term Care \nEnhancement Act of 1999'' would include specific data collection on \nmatters such as cost effectiveness, quality of health care services \nprovided, enrollee and health care provider satisfaction, and the \nability of participants to carry out basic activities of daily living.\n  From this effort, a number of things would result. First, VA would \ngain more precise information on exactly which services to offer, how \nbest to coordinate those services, and the relative cost and \neffectiveness of various services. There is no doubt that our veterans \nwould benefit from such findings.\n  Second, there would be a concrete demonstration of the feasibility of \nfurnishing a coordinated range of long-term care services, which in \nturn could lead to a greater likelihood that such an approach would be \nshared with, and replicated by, others.\n  Third, the value of such an approach, measured in quality of care, \nquality of life, cost effectiveness, and patient and provider \nsatisfaction would be demonstrated, thereby promoting its use by \nothers.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the chairmen and the \nmembers of the Committees on Veterans' Affairs--in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate--to advance the cause of long-term care \nin VA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide parents, taxpayers, and educators with \nuseful, understandable school reports; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  standardized school report card act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am introducing today a piece of \nlegislation called the Standardized School Report Card Act, along with \nmy colleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Byrd.\n  Every 6 to 9 weeks every parent in this country who has children in \nour public schools gets a report card to tell him or her how that \nstudent is doing in school.\n  Rarely, however, do parents get a report card telling them how the \nschool is doing for the students.\n  A number of States already do have school report cards--about 36, \nactually--but they vary around the country. Some have almost no \ninformation. Others are hundreds of pages long and very difficult to \nunderstand. Regardless, however, most parents never see a report card \nfor their child's school.\n  I think it would be useful, and my colleagues do as well, to ask that \nthere be a uniform or standardized school report card that will allow \nparents to understand what they are getting for the dollars they are \ninvesting in that school. What is their school doing versus the \nneighboring town's school? How are the schools in one State doing \nversus schools in another State? How can you compare what the parents \nand taxpayers are getting with respect to the dollars invested in \neducation?\n  The Standardized School Report Card Act will require schools to \nreport on eight key, basic areas in their report card and do so in an \neasily understandable manner.\n  The eight areas graded in the report cards would be: students' \nperformance, attendance and graduation rates, professional \nqualifications of teachers, average class size, school safety, parental \ninvolvement, student drop-out rates, and access to technology.\n  Some might say this legislation is unnecessary because there are \nalready some States that do have school report cards. As I have already \nindicated, that is true. However, the content varies widely, so they \nare not good tools for comparison.\n  In my home State of North Dakota, the State Department of Public \nInstruction has designed a school district profile that is published \nfor each school district. It does include a lot of interesting \ninformation, but a numbers of areas that are required under this \nlegislation are not covered at all.\n  My point is that we have a public education system in this country on \nwhich we spend a great deal of money. We send our young boys and girls \nto the classroom door, and we invest money, we build the schools, pay \nteachers, and buy the books. The question is, What do we get for all of \nthat?\n  Most of the classrooms I have visited are led and taught by wonderful \nteachers. I am very impressed by many of the schools I have had an \nopportunity to visit across the country and especially in North Dakota. \nAs a nation, when we spend $350 billion a year to provide an education \nto elementary and secondary students, parents and taxpayers need some \nuniform way to understand how there school is doing versus other \nschools. How is our State doing versus other States relative to the \ninvestments we are making in education?\n  That is the basis for the school report card legislation which I am \nintroducing today. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman and \nByrd in introducing this bill, and I hope others of our colleagues will \njoin us in cosponsoring it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Dorgan and Byrd, in introducing the Standardized \nSchool Report Card Act. This bill would require States and schools to \ndistribute an annual, easy-to-read report card to parents, taxpayers, \neducators, and the public. One of the top issues facing the nation's \neducation system is the need for greater accountability and the need \nfor greater parent involvement in schools. The bill we are introducing \ntoday will go a long way in helping to achieve these goals.\n  In our efforts to make schools accountable for the resources they are \ngiven, we must develop better means for measuring and communicating \nprogress in our schools; if we cannot measure progress, we cannot \nattain it. Our bill would require each school to report several key \nmeasures of progress. The bill would require reports of student \nperformance in language arts and mathematics, as well as any other \nsubject areas in which the State requires assessment. The report cards \nwould breakdown student data by gender, major racial and ethnic groups, \nEnglish proficiency, migrant status, disability status, and economic \nstatus. In this way, we can ensure that our schools are meeting the \nneeds of all students and that all students are being taught to the \nsame high standards. I also requested that the bill require reporting \nof dropout rates, because our educational system needs to do everything \npossible to keep our children in school until graduation. Many States \nwith report cards do not currently report this measure of educational \nprogress. Obviously, we are not making much progress if our children \nare giving up prior to graduation. We need to target our efforts to \nensure that our children stay in school and an important step in \nachieving that goal is to monitor and raise awareness of the problem.\n  The report cards required in this bill also would provide parents and \ntaxpayers with valuable information regarding the resources available \nand environment at each school. Our bill would require schools to \nreport average class sizes and student access to technology, including \nthe number of computers for educational purposes, the number of \ncomputers per classroom, and the number of computers connected to the \nInternet. In addition, schools would be required to report measures of \nschool safety, including the safety of school facilities and incidents \nof school violence, and measures of parental involvement. Based on this \ninformation, parents--as consumers of public education--can make \ninformed decisions about their children's education and monitor how \npublic resources are being used in their community.\n  Last session, I introduced an amendment to the Higher Education Act--\nwhich was ultimately passed and signed into law--which requires \ncolleges of education to report their performance in producing \nqualified teachers. That effort will help to ensure that teachers \ncoming into a school system have been properly prepared to teach. The \nbill we are introducing today will build on that legislation, by \nholding states and schools district accountable for the training, level \nof preparation, and proper placement of new teachers as well as \nteachers already in the system. Under the Standardized Report Card Act, \nschools would be required to report the professional qualifications of \nits teachers, including the number of teachers teaching out of field \nand the number of teachers with emergency certification.\n  I have spoken with many parents in my home state of New Mexico about\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\ntheir role in the public education system. These parents are eager to \nsupport their local schools and participate in their children's \neducation. But in order to do this, they need to be better informed \nabout how schools are performing and what resources are being devoted \nto each school.\n  With over $350 billion spent each year on education, parents and \ntaxpayers deserve to know how their schools are performing. We owe it \nto them and to ourselves to provide public measures of progress which \nwill assist our communities in their efforts to improve our systems of \neducation. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me by supporting \nthe standardized School Report Card Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Breaux, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1253. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Commerce, through the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide financial \nassistance for coral reef conservation projects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   coral reef protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coral Reef \nProtection Act of 1999.\n  This legislation will provide one hundred million dollars over a \nperiod of five years to preserve, sustain and restore the health of \nU.S. coral reef ecosystems; assist in the conservation and protection \nof coral reefs by supporting conservation programs; and provide \nfinancial resources for those programs. Additionally, this legislation \nwill leverage the federal dollars appropriated for these purposes by \nestablishing a formal mechanism for collecting and allocating matching \nmonetary donations from the private sector to be used for coral reef \nconservation projects.\n  The United States has substantial coral reef holdings in both the \nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans totaling more than 6,500 square miles. More \nthan 83% of these reefs lie among the islands of Hawaii and another 10% \nof them live among the other American islands in the Pacific including \nAmerican Samoa, Johnston Island, Palmyra Atoll, and the Northern \nMariana Islands. Hawaii, alone, is home to 47 different species of \ncoral. These coral reefs provide numerous recreational opportunities, \nare linked ecologically to adjacent coastal ecosystems such as \nmangroves and sea grasses, support substantial biodiversity, and \nprotect shorelines from wave damage. They also support major economic \nactivities, such as tourism and fishing, in coastal communities that \ngenerate billions of dollars annually. Despite this importance to both \nthe environment and the American economy, little is currently known \nabout the condition of coral reefs in the United States. Two points, \nhowever, are clear: coral reefs are threatened whenever they are close \nto large concentrations of people, and coral reefs are in decline.\n  This legislation will provide funding for research, conservation and \nrestoration of these extremely important resources and will complement \nthe efforts of the President's Coral Reef Task Force which was \nestablished by Executive Order last year. I ask that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coral Reef Protection Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems are considered \n     the marine equivalent of tropical rain forests, containing \n     some of the planet's richest biological diversity, habitats, \n     and systems and supporting thousands of fish, invertebrates, \n     reef algae, plankton, sea grasses, and other species.\n       (2) Coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems have great \n     commercial, recreational, cultural, and esthetic value to \n     human communities as shoreline protection, areas of natural \n     beauty, and sources of food, pharmaceuticals, jobs, and \n     revenues through a wide variety of activities, including \n     education, research, tourism, and fishing.\n       (3) Studies indicate that coral reefs in the United States \n     and around the world are being degraded and severely \n     threatened by human and environmental impacts including land-\n     based pollution, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, \n     vessel groundings, and climate change.\n       (4) Since 1994, under the United States Coral Reef \n     Initiative, Federal agencies, State, local, territorial, \n     commonwealth, and local governments, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and commercial interests have worked together \n     to design and implement additional management, education, \n     monitoring, research, and restoration efforts to conserve \n     coral reef ecosystems.\n       (5) 1997 was recognized as the Year of the Reef to raise \n     public awareness about the importance of conserving coral \n     reefs and to facilitate actions to protect coral reef \n     ecosystems.\n       (6) On October 21, 1997, the 105th Congress passed House \n     Concurrent Resolution 8, a concurrent resolution recognizing \n     the significance of maintaining the health and stability of \n     coral reef ecosystems by promoting comprehensive stewardship \n     for coral reef ecosystems, discouraging unsustainable \n     fisheries or other practices harmful to coral reefs, \n     encouraging research, monitoring, assessment of, and \n     education on coral reef ecosystems, improving coordination of \n     coral reef efforts and activities of Federal agencies, \n     academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and \n     industry, and promoting preservation and sustainable use of \n     coral reef resources worldwide.\n       (7) 1998 was declared to be the International Year of the \n     Ocean to raise public awareness and increase actions to \n     conserve and use in a sustainable manner the broader ocean \n     environment, including coral reefs.\n       (8) On June 11, 1998, President William Jefferson Clinton \n     signed Executive Order 13089 (64 Fed. Reg. 323701) which \n     recognizes the importance of conserving coral reef \n     ecosystems, establishes the Coral Reef Task Force under the \n     joint leadership of the Departments of Commerce and Interior, \n     and directs Federal agencies whose actions may affect United \n     States coral reef ecosystems to take steps to protect, \n     manage, research, and restore such ecosystems.\n       (9) The Nation benefits from--\n       (A) specific actions and programs involving coral reefs and \n     coral reef ecosystems including National Marine Sanctuaries, \n     National Wildlife Refuges, National Parks, and other marine \n     protected areas that conserve for future generations vital \n     marine resources, ecosystems, and habitats;\n       (B) the identification of coral habitats as essential fish \n     habitat under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act, which requires aggressive efforts to minimize \n     adverse effects on such habitat caused by fishing;\n       (C) identification of other actions to encourage the \n     conservation and enhancement of such habitat; and\n       (D) State and territorial coastal management programs for \n     the protection, development, and where possible, restoration \n     and enhancement of the resources of the Nation's coastal zone \n     for this and succeeding generations under the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act and other related statutes.\n       (10) Legislation solely dedicated to the comprehensive and \n     coordinated conservation, management, protection, and \n     restoration of coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems would \n     supplement Executive Order 13089 and House Concurrent \n     Resolution 8, and complement the management, protection, and \n     conservation provided by such programs as those administered \n     under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, Coastal Zone \n     Management Act, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act, as well as those administered by other \n     Federal, State, and territorial agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to protect consumers and promote electronic commerce \nby amending certain trademark infringement, dilution, and \ncounterfeiting laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAnticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act on behalf of myself, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Hatch, and Senator McCain. This legislation will \ncombat a new form of high-tech fraud that is causing confusion and \ninconvenience for consumers, increasing costs for people doing business \non the internet, and posing an enormous threat to a century of pre-\nInternet American business efforts. The fraud is commonly called \n``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals reserve internet \ndomain names or other identifiers of online locations that are similar \nor identical to trademarked names. The easiest prey for cybersquatters \nhas turned out to be computer-unsavvy trademark-owners in the non-\ninternet world. Once a ``brick and mortar'' trademark is registered as \nan on-line identifier or domain name, the ``cybersquatter'' can engage \nin a variety of nefarious activities--from the relatively-benign parody \nof a business or individual, to the obscene prank of redirecting an \nunsuspecting consumer to pornographic content, to the destructive \nworldwide slander of a centuries-old brand name. For the enterprising \ncybersquatter, holding out a domain name for extortionate compensation \nis a tried-and-true business practice, and the net effect of this \nbehavior is to undermine consumer confidence, discourage consumer use \nof the internet, and destroy the value of brand-names and trademarks of \nthis nation's businesses.\n  Many companies simply pay extortionate prices to cybersquatters in \norder to rid themselves of a headache with no certain outcome. For \nexample, Gateway recently paid $100,000 to a cybersquatter who had \nplaced pornographic images to the website ``www.gateway20000''. Rather \nthan simply give up, several companies already have instead sought \nprotection from cybersquatters through the legal system. For example, \nthe investment firm Paine Webber was forced to sue an internet Web \nsite, wwwpainewebber.com'' and its creator. The domain name at issue \ntook advantage of a typographical error--the missing ``.'' (dot) \nbetween ``www'' and ``painewebber''--in order to direct consumers \ndesiring to do business with Paine Webber to a website containing \npornographic images. As with much of the pre-internet law that is \napplied to this post-internet world, precedent is still developing, and \nat this point, one cannot predict with certainty which party to a \ndispute will win, and on what grounds, in the future.\n  Mr. President, some Americans continue to do a thriving, if \nunethical, business collecting and selling internet addresses \ncontaining trademarked names. Whether perpetrated to defraud the public \nor to extort the trademark owner, squatting on internet addresses using \ntrademarked names is wrong. It must be stopped for the sake of \nconsumers, for the sake of trademark owners and for the sake of the \nvast, growing electronic commerce that is doing so much to spur \neconomic growth and innovation in this country.\n  Mr. President, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act will \nhelp to establish uniform rules for dealing with this attack on \ninterstate commerce. This legislation would establish penalties for \ncriminal use of a counterfeit trademark as a domain name. Using a \ncompany's trademark or its variant as the address of an internet site \nwould constitute criminal use of a counterfeit trademark if the \ndefendant registered the address either knowingly and fraudulently or \nin bad faith. Among the evidence establishing bad faith would be \nregistry of a domain name with (1) intent to cause confusion\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nor mistake or deception, to dilute the distinctive quality of a famous \ntrademark, or intent to divert consumers from the trademark owner's \ndomain to one's own; and (2) providing false information on the \napplication to register the identifier, or offering to transfer the \nregistration to a rightful owner for consideration for any thing of \nvalue. Bad faith could not be shown where the identifier is the \ndefendant's legal first name or surname or where the defendant used the \nidentifier in legitimate commerce before the earlier of either the \nfirst use of the registered trademark or the effective date of its \nregistration. Violation of this prohibition would constitute a Class B \nmisdemeanor for the first offense; subsequent offenses would be \nclassified as Class E felonies.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Anticybersquatting Consumer \nProtection Act provides for statutory civil damages in trademark cases \nof at least $1,000, but not more than $100,000 ($300,000 if the \nregistration or use of the trademark was willful) per trademark per \nidentifier. The plaintiff may elect these damages in lieu of actual \ndamages or profits at any time before final judgment.\n  These provisions will discourage anyone from ``squatting'' on \naddresses in cyberspace to which they are not entitled. In the process \nit will protect consumers from fraud, protect the value of countless \ntrademarks, and encourage continued growth in our electronic commerce \nindustry.\n  Mr President, the growth of the Internet has provided businesses and \nindividuals with unprecedented access to a worldwide source of \ninformation, commerce, and community. Unfortunately, those bad actors \nseeking to cause harm to businesses and individuals have seen their \nopportunities increase as well. In my opinion, on-line extortion in \nthis form is unacceptable and outrageous. Whether it's people extorting \ncompanies by registering company names, misdirecting Internet users to \ninappropriate sites, or otherwise attempting to damage a trademark that \na business has spent decades building into a recognizable brand, \npersons engaging in cybersquatting activity should be held accountable \nfor their actions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the bill, a section by section \nanalysis and additional materials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that the unauthorized registration or use of \n     trademarks as Internet domain names or other identifiers of \n     online locations (commonly known as ``cybersquatting'')--\n       (1) results in consumer fraud and public confusion as to \n     the true source or sponsorship of products and services;\n       (2) impairs electronic commerce, which is important to the \n     economy of the United States; and\n       (3) deprives owners of trademarks of substantial revenues \n     and consumer goodwill.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRADEMARK REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) Recovery for Violation of Rights.--Section 35 of the \n     Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the registration and \n     protection of trade-marks used in commerce, to carry out the \n     provisions of certain international conventions, and for \n     other purposes'', approved July 5, 1946, (commonly referred \n     to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946'') (15 U.S.C. 1117) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d)(1) In this subsection, the term `Internet' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 230(f)(1) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(f)(1)).\n       ``(2)(A) In a case involving the registration or use of an \n     identifier described in subparagraph (B), the plaintiff may \n     elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered by the \n     trial court, to recover, instead of actual damages and \n     profits under subsection (a)--\n       ``(i) an award of statutory damages in the amount of--\n       ``(I) not less than $1,000 or more than $100,000 per \n     trademark per identifier, as the court considers just; or\n       ``(II) if the court finds that the registration or use of \n     the registered trademark as an identifier was willful, not \n     less than $3,000 or more than $300,000 per trademark per \n     identifier, as the court considers just; and\n       ``(ii) full costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n       ``(B) An identifier referred to in subparagraph (A) is an \n     Internet domain name or other identifier of an online \n     location that is--\n       ``(i) the trademark of a person or entity other than the \n     person or entity registering or using the identifier; or\n       ``(ii) sufficiently similar to a trademark of a person or \n     entity other than the person or entity registering or using \n     the identifier as to be likely to--\n       ``(I) cause confusion or mistake;\n       ``(II) deceive; or\n       ``(III) cause dilution of the distinctive quality of a \n     famous trademark.''.\n       (b) Remedies for Dilution of Famous Marks.--Section \n     43(c)(2) of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \n     registration and protection of trade-marks used in commerce, \n     to carry out the provisions of certain international \n     conventions, and for other purposes'', approved July 5, 1946, \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946'') (15 \n     U.S.C. 1125(c)(2)) is amended by striking ``35(a)'' and \n     inserting ``35 (a) and (d)''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n       Section 39 of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \n     registration and protection of trade-marks used in commerce, \n     to carry out the provisions of certain international \n     conventions, and for other purposes'', approved July 5, 1946, \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946'') (15 \n     U.S.C. 1121) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c)(1) In this subsection, the term `Internet' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 230(f)(1) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(f)(1)).\n       ``(2)(A) An Internet service provider, domain name \n     registrar, or registry described in subparagraph (B) shall \n     not be liable for monetary relief to any person for a removal \n     or transfer described in that subparagraph, without regard to \n     whether the domain name or other identifier is ultimately \n     determined to be infringing or dilutive.\n       ``(B) An Internet service provider, domain name registrar, \n     or registry referred to in subparagraph (A) is a provider, \n     registrar, or registry that, upon receipt of a written notice \n     from the owner of a trademark registered in the Patent and \n     Trademark Office, removes from domain name service (DNS) \n     service or registration, or transfers to the trademark owner, \n     an Internet domain name or other identifier of an online \n     location alleged to be infringing or dilutive, in compliance \n     with--\n       ``(i) a court order; or\n       ``(ii) the reasonable implementation of a policy \n     prohibiting the unauthorized registration or use of another's \n     registered trademark as an Internet domain name or other \n     identifier of an online location.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       A bill to protect consumers and promote electronic commerce \n     by amending certain trademark infringement, dilution, and \n     counterfeiting laws, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         section 1: short title\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer \n     Protection Act.''\n\n\n                          section 2: findings\n\n       This section sets out Congressional findings concerning the \n     effect of ``unauthorized registration or use of trademarks as \n     Internet domain names or other identifiers of online \n     locations'' (``cybersquatting''). Cyber- squatting (1) \n     results in consumer fraud, (2) impairs electronic interstate \n     commerce, and (3) deprives trademark owners of revenue and \n     consumer goodwill.\n\n\n                     section 3: trademark remedies\n\n     (a) Recovery for violation of rights\n       The Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1117) shall \n     incorporate the definition of ``Internet'' used in the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230 (f) (1)).\n       An ``identifier'' refers to an Internet domain name or \n     another identifier of an online location that is (i) the \n     plaintiff's trademark, or (ii) so sufficiently similar to the \n     plaintiff's trademark as to be likely to ``cause confusion or \n     mistake,'' ``deceive,'' or ``cause dilution of the \n     distinctive quality of a famous trademark.''\n       This section expands civil penalties for cybersquatting by \n     providing that before final judgment in a case involving the \n     registration or use of an identifier, a plaintiff may--\n     instead of seeking actual damages or profits--elect to \n     recover statutory damages of at least $1,000, but not more \n     than $100,000 (at least $3,000, but not more than $300,000 if \n     court finds that the registration or use of the trademark was \n     willful) per trademark per identifier, as the court considers \n     just. Furthermore, the plaintiff may recover full costs and \n     reasonable attorney's fees.\n     (b) Remedies for dilution of famous marks\n       This section amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n     1125 (c) (2)) by making the remedies set forth in section 3 \n     (a) also available for the willful dilution of famous marks \n     or trade on the owner's reputation.\n\n\n            section 4: criminal use of counterfeit trademark\n\n     (a) In general\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 2320 (a) (``Trafficking in \n     Counterfeit Goods or Services'') by adding criminal penalties \n     for the use of a counterfeit trademark on the Internet. Like \n     section 3 (a), this section incorporates the definition of \n     Internet used in the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     230 (f) (1)). It also incorporates the same definition of \n     ``identifier'' found in section 3 (a).\n       Under this section, whoever knowingly and fraudulently or \n     in bad faith registers or uses the trademark of another would \n     be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor. Repeat offenders would be \n     guilty of Class E felony.\n       Prima facie evidence that a registration or use was \n     fraudulent or in bad faith would require satisfaction of the \n     following elements:\n       (1) the defendant registered or used an identifier with \n     intent to (a) cause confusion or mistake, deceive, or cause \n     dilution of the distinctive quality of a famous trademark, or \n     (b) with intention of diverting consumers from the trademark \n     owner to the defendant; and\n       (2) the defendant provided false information in its \n     application to register the identifier or offered to transfer \n     the identifier's registration to the trademark owner or other \n     person or entity for something of value; and\n       (3) the identifier is not the defendant's legal first name \n     or surname or the defendant had not used the identifier in \n     legitimate commerce before the earlier of either the first \n     use of the registered trademark or the effective date of its \n     registration.\n     (b) Sentencing guidelines\n       (1) In general\n       The United States Sentencing Commission shall provide for \n     penalties for the criminal use of counterfeit trademarks by \n     amending the sentencing guidelines in accordance with the \n     guidelines for crimes against intellectual property (18 \n     U.S.C. 2320).\n       (2) Factors for consideration\n       The United States Sentencing Commission shall take into \n     account the Findings promulgated in Section 2 and ensure that \n     the amendments to the sentencing guidelines adequately \n     provide penalties for the crimes described in this Act.\n\n\n                   Section 5: limitation of liability\n\n       An Internet service provider (ISP) or domain name registrar \n     shall not be liable for monetary damages to any person if it \n     removes an infringing identifier from domain name server \n     (DNS) service or from registration, or transfers it to the \n     trademark owner: (1) upon written notice from the trademark \n     owner and (2) in compliance with either a court order or the \n     reasonable implementation of a policy prohibiting the \n     unauthorized registration or use of another's registered \n     trademark.\n       This limitation shall apply without regard to whether the \n     domain name or other identifier is ultimately determined to \n     be infringing or dilutive.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1999.\n     Hon.

It advocates \n     growing the economy through innovation and supports free-\n     market policies. ITI members had worldwide revenue of more \n     than $440 billion in 1998 and employ more than 1.2 million \n     people in the United States.\n       Over the past several years, trademark holders have found \n     it difficult and expensive to prevent infringement and \n     dilution of their marks online, especially as \n     ``cybersquatters'' have made a cottage industry out of \n     intentionally registering others' trademarks as domain names \n     and seeking to sell the domain name back to the rightful \n     owners. Such activity damages electronic commerce by sowing \n     confusion among consumers and other Internet users.\n       While some ITI members have concerns about the bill's \n     criminal provisions, we believe the importance of federal \n     legislation to stop cybersquatting should not be \n     underestimated and we look forward to working with you as \n     this legislation is considered by the Senate.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                                 Phillip Bond,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7336-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7336-S7338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n  At the request of Ms. Landrieu, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Robb) was added as a cosponsor of S. 25, a bill to provide Coastal \nImpact Assistance to State and local governments, to amend the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965, the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \nAct, and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly referred \nto as the Pittman-Robertson Act) to establish a fund to meet the \noutdoor conservation and recreation needs of the American people, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 37\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Grams) and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 37, a bill to amend title XVIII of the \nSocial Security Act to repeal the restriction on payment for certain \nhospital discharges to post-acute care imposed by section 4407 of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n\n                                 S. 57\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 57, a bill to amend title 5, \nUnited States Code, to provide for the establishment of a program under \nwhich long-term care insurance is made available to Federal employees \nand annuitants, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Fitzgerald) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend the \nTariff Act of 1930 to eliminate disincentives to fair trade conditions.\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n\n\n\n                                 S. 71\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mrs. Lincoln) was added as a cosponsor of S. 71, a bill to amend title \n38, United States Code, to establish a presumption of service-\nconnection for certain veterans with Hepatitis C, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 115\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was added as a cosponsor of S. 115, a bill to \nrequire that health plans provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay \nfor mastectomies and lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast \ncancer and coverage for secondary consultations.\n\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n(Mr. Shelby) was added as a cosponsor of S. 285, a bill to amend title \nII of the Social Security Act to restore the link between the maximum \namount of earnings by blind individuals permitted without demonstrating \nability to engage in substantial gainful activity and the exempt amount \npermitted in determining excess earnings under the earnings test.\n\n\n                                 S. 288\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 288, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from income certain amounts \nreceived under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program \nand F.

If \n     such an individual's care would most appropriately be \n     coordinated by such a specialist, such plan or issuer shall \n     refer the individual to such specialist.\n       (B) Treatment as primary care provider.--Such specialist \n     shall be permitted to treat the individual without a referral \n     from the individual's primary care provider and may authorize \n     such referrals, procedures, tests, and other medical services \n     as the individual's primary care provider would otherwise be \n     permitted to provide or authorize, subject to the terms of \n     the treatment plan (referred to in paragraph (1)(C)(i)).\n       (C) Ongoing special condition defined.--In this paragraph, \n     the term ``special condition'' means a condition or disease \n     that--\n       (i) is life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling, and\n       (ii) requires specialized medical care over a prolonged \n     period of time.\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\n       (D) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) \n     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals \n     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner \n     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) Standing referrals.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health \n     insurance coverage, shall have a procedure by which an \n     individual who is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and \n     who has a condition that requires ongoing care from a \n     specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist \n     for treatment of such condition. If the plan or issuer, or if \n     the primary care provider in consultation with the medical \n     director of the plan or issuer and the specialist (if any), \n     determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the \n     plan or issuer shall make such a referral to such a \n     specialist.\n       (B) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) \n     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals \n     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner \n     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).\n\n     SEC. __105.

provision of health insurance coverage, and a health care \n     provider is terminated (as defined in paragraph (3)), or \n     benefits or coverage provided by a health care provider are \n     terminated because of a change in the terms of provider \n     participation in a group health plan, and an individual who \n     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee in the plan or \n     coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the \n     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer \n     shall--\n       (A) notify the individual on a timely basis of such \n

with respect to an individual, the provisions \n     of paragraph (1) (and the succeeding provisions of this \n     section) shall apply under the plan in the same manner as if \n     there had been a

period under this subsection with respect to \n     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through \n     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the \n     delivery.\n       (4) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security

plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that would exceed the cost-sharing that could \n     have been imposed if the contract referred to in subsection \n     (a)(1) had not been terminated.\n       (2) The provider agrees to adhere to the quality assurance \n     standards of the plan or issuer responsible for payment under \n     paragraph (1) and to provide to such plan or issuer necessary \n     medical information related to the

(4) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security

plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRoberta Foust, or ``Bobbie'' as she is known to her many friends and \nreaders. With her recent retirement from The Paducah Sun, Bobbie \ncompletes a distinguished career as a journalist.\n  Her byline has long been a familiar one to news readers in the \nwestern part of Kentucky. She worked for The Calvert News in Calvert \nCity in the 1960's. In 1972, she began working as a reporter and \nphotographer for The Tribune Courier in Marshall County, in the heart \nof Kentucky's Western Lakes region. After 5 years, she moved to the \nrival Marshall County Messenger, where she was responsible for all news \ncontent, layout, and design. She returned to The Tribune Courier in a \nsimilar capacity in 1979. In 1988, she became the editor of the weekly \nHerald Ledger in Eddyville, a position she held until the local \nownership sold the paper in 1991.\n  Bobbie then joined the largest newspaper in far Western Kentucky, The \nPaducah Sun, a daily with a circulation of 31,000. With the Sun, Bobbie \nserved as a general assignment reporter. In this position, she worked \nin Marshall, Lyon, and other lakes-area counties. Besides the usual \nbroad assortment of news she covered in her day-to-day duties, Bobbie \ncovered certain continuing stories, and developed an in-depth knowledge \nin these areas that was widely recognized. Among these were the Land \nBetween the Lakes and the role of the Tennessee Valley Authority in LBL \nand Western Kentucky. During this time, Bobbie earned broad respect in \nthe region she covered, as well as at TVA headquarters in Knoxville and \nWashington.\n  I have not only been a regular reader of Bobbie's, but have often \nbeen covered in her stories. Over the years, I have had the opportunity \nto get to\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\nknow her first-hand, and feel that I am in a uniquely qualified \nposition to comment upon her journalistic legacy. Bobbie has earned a \nreputation of persistence, thoroughness, and objectivity--the three \nlodestars of her profession. Always firm in getting the story for her \nreaders, she was unflappably cordial in personal demeanor in the \nperformance of her duties.\n  Bobbie's retirement plans include the possibility of taking some \ncollege course work, and hopefully, the role of occasional contributor \nto The Paducah Sun. Along with Bobbie's husband, Ray, and children, \nDonna, Terrie, Jackie, and Dennis, I wish Bobbie an enjoyable and \nproductive retirement. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing \nthe career of this outstanding Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7367-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          committee on health, education, labor, and pensions\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRoberta Foust, or ``Bobbie'' as she is known to her many friends and \nreaders. With her recent retirement from The Paducah Sun, Bobbie \ncompletes a distinguished career as a journalist.\n  Her byline has long been a familiar one to news readers in the \nwestern part of Kentucky. She worked for The Calvert News in Calvert \nCity in the 1960's. In 1972, she began working as a reporter and \nphotographer for The Tribune Courier in Marshall County, in the heart \nof Kentucky's Western Lakes region. After 5 years, she moved to the \nrival Marshall County Messenger, where she was responsible for all news \ncontent, layout, and design. She returned to The Tribune Courier in a \nsimilar capacity in 1979. In 1988, she became the editor of the weekly \nHerald Ledger in Eddyville, a position she held until the local \nownership sold the paper in 1991.\n  Bobbie then joined the largest newspaper in far Western Kentucky, The \nPaducah Sun, a daily with a circulation of 31,000. With the Sun, Bobbie \nserved as a general assignment reporter. In this position, she worked \nin Marshall, Lyon, and other lakes-area counties. Besides the usual \nbroad assortment of news she covered in her day-to-day duties, Bobbie \ncovered certain continuing stories, and developed an in-depth knowledge \nin these areas that was widely recognized. Among these were the Land \nBetween the Lakes and the role of the Tennessee Valley Authority in LBL \nand Western Kentucky. During this time, Bobbie earned broad respect in \nthe region she covered, as well as at TVA headquarters in Knoxville and \nWashington.\n  I have not only been a regular reader of Bobbie's, but have often \nbeen covered in her stories. Over the years, I have had the opportunity \nto get to know her first-hand, and feel that I am in a uniquely \nqualified position to comment upon her journalistic legacy. Bobbie has \nearned a reputation of persistence, thoroughness, and objectivity--the \nthree lodestars of her profession. Always firm in getting the story for \nher readers, she was unflappably cordial in personal demeanor in the \nperformance of her duties.\n  Bobbie's retirement plans include the possibility of taking some \ncollege course work, and hopefully, the role of occasional contributor \nto The Paducah Sun. Along with Bobbie's husband, Ray, and children, \nDonna, Terrie, Jackie, and Dennis, I wish Bobbie an enjoyable and \nproductive retirement.

Mr. President, I ask that we take a moment \ntoday to recognize the State of West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\nOne hundred thirty-six years ago, on June 20, 1863, West Virginia \nassumed its proud position as the 35th State of the Union. Since that \ntime West Virginia's natural resources and its citizens have and will \ncontinue to play a positive role in our Nation.\n  The phrases: ``the mountain state,'' ``wild, wonderful,'' and ``a \nwelcome change'' are always reminders of West Virginia. Indeed, there \nare countless rolling hills dotted with horses, cows, sheep and their \nyoung. The State is home to memorable valleys, known for their rushing \nstreams and rivers filled with bass and trout. Then there are the \nbeautiful colors throughout the fall and spring that bedeck our \nglorious mountains, attracting tourists from across the globe.\n  West Virginia is a combination of rural farming communities, coal \ntowns, resorts, and growing cities. It is unquestionably a State in \nwhich there is a place for everyone. I believe it is this diversity \nthat attracts many to the State and causes numerous children raised in \nWest Virginia to remain and invest in the State as adults.\n  West Virginians are proud of their State. As we stand at the dawn of \nthe 21st century symbols of West Virginia pride and achievement can be \nheard, read, seen, and touched throughout the world via locally \nproduced music, literature, works of art, and crafts. West Virginians \nare also proud of their people. Almost two centuries, ago, the State \nwas known as the fighting place of the Hatfields and McCoys. Since that \ntime, West Virginia has been the home of such remarkable people as, \neducator Booker T. Washington, pilot Charles ``Chuck'' Yeager, gymnast \nMary Lou Retton, authors Pearl S. Buck, John Knowles, and Denise \nGiardina, singer and song writer Kathy Mattea, artists Barrie Kaufman, \nand Susan Poffenbarger, former astronaut Jon A. McBride, scholar Henry \nLouis Gates, countless athletes, and numerous others.\n  Today we have the opportunity to honor 136 years of statehood. I ask \nthat we celebrate the people of West Virginia, that we honor the \ncourage of their endeavors and achievements. I ask that we take \nstrength from the majesty of the mountains as do the constituents of \nWest Virginia, and finally that we, as members of this distinguished \nbody, remember the broader message of freedom recognized by West \nVirginia's logo: Montani Semper Liberi, Mountaineers are Always Free. I \nam proud of this State and its people and am honored to represent \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7369-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO SHEILA ZELLERS, BRIAN HARDEN, ERNIE JONES, AND DON GREEN\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nfour brave individuals who lost their lives last week in a tragic \nhelicopter crash in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Sheila Zellers, Brian \nHarden, Ernie Jones, and Don Green, were crew members on a helicopter \nproviding emergency medical service to rural Eastern Kentucky. On \nMonday June 14, 1999, these dedicated care-givers were returning to the \nUniversity of Kentucky's Chandler Medical Center in Lexington, \nKentucky, from Breathitt County Airport. Tragically, they did not make \nit.\n  Mrs. Sheila Zellers, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, served as the flight \nnurse on the helicopter and had worked with the University of \nKentucky's hospital for more than twenty years. She served in the \nhospital's neonatal intensive care unit and emergency room before \nbecoming a flight nurse in 1991. More importantly, she was a loving \nwife and mother. Our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Jeffrey \nand their four sons.\n  Mr. Brian Harden, from Richmond, Kentucky, was the paramedic on \nMonday's flight crew. While only 33, he had already had a distinguished \ncareer providing emergency medical services in Kentucky as a paramedic. \nFlight paramedics, such as Mr. Harden, are critical in providing \nemergency care from the time they leave the scene until they reach the \nhospital. I would like to extend the Senate's deepest sympathies to his \nwife Patricia, and their two young daughters.\n  The helicopter's two pilots, Ernie Jones and Don Green, were both \nwell-known among their colleagues as experienced, highly-skilled \npilots. Frequently, the pilots who fly these emergency helicopters are \ncalled upon to land their helicopters in small parking lots, highways, \npastures, and gorges, in order to safely evacuate their patients. Their \nfamilies and friends will be in our prayers.\n  It is important that we recognize the impact these individuals and \ntheir colleagues have on the citizens of Eastern Kentucky. Like so much \nof rural America, the residents of Eastern Kentucky lack easy access to \nthe advanced medical resources and trauma centers available in more \nmetropolitan areas. In order to provide this much needed care to \nEastern Kentucky, the University of Kentucky Medical Center began \nhelicopter flights to the region in 1987. For 12 years, these emergency \nmedical crews have ferried accident victims, critically ill children, \ncardiac patients, and infants too ill to travel by ambulance to the UK \nMedical Center. It is not unusual for these dedicated caregivers to \nwork twelve hour shifts and fly up to seven missions a day, each time \nmaking a difference in the lives of their patients. It is with this in \nmind that we recognize the sacrifices of these dedicated care-givers \nand note that they will be forever missed by their families, friends, \ncolleagues, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7369-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO SHEILA ZELLERS, BRIAN HARDEN, ERNIE JONES, AND DON GREEN\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport of S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. This bill will \nprovide relief to hundreds of propane suppliers, farmers, and ranchers \nin my State of South Dakota.\n  The Fuels Regulatory Relief Act would exempt propane from being \nincluded under the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management \nProgram, or RMP, rule. The RMP rule was crafted as a way to increase \nawareness among state and local governments and the public of hazardous \nchemicals in communities. The thinking behind this rule was that if \nchemical companies had to develop and make public information about a \nworst case scenario in the event of an accidental release, the \ncompanies would take steps to lower the possibility of such an \naccident. Also, the authors of this rule thought local emergency teams \nwould be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to an accident at \na hazardous chemical site if the teams knew in advance how much damage \nto expect.\n  I do not have any problems with the RMP rule in that respect. I think \ncommunities can benefit from knowing the potential for chemical \naccidents that could happen within their borders. I do, however, have \ndeep concerns about the inclusion of substances that are not toxic but \nare flammable. The RMP rule was not created to regulate flammable \nsubstances, as demonstrated by the EPA's decision not to include \ngasoline under the rule. Yet propane is included under the rule, and \npeople who have more than 16,000 pounds of propane on their property \nwill have to submit an RMP.\n  Complying with this rule is a great burden on propane suppliers, \nfarmers, and ranchers, as the cost per site may be as much as several \nthousand dollars. I have been contacted by a number of propane \nsuppliers in my State who have expressed their frustration with having \nto submit an RMP, and the American Farm Bureau has voiced its concerns \nabout the effects of this rule on farmers who use propane for fuel \npurposes. Small business owners, farmers, and ranchers who possess and \nuse large amounts of propane should not be forced to comply with a rule \ndirected at curbing accidents involving hazardous chemicals, especially \nwhen flammable substances are subject to a number of other federal \nregulations.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 880, the Fuels \nRegulatory Relief Act. I believe that exempting propane from inclusion \nunder the RMP rule is consistent with the purpose of the rule, as it \ndoes not change the way hazardous and toxic chemicals are regulated. \nThe Fuels Regulatory Relief Act will save propane users and suppliers \nin my State thousands of dollars in compliance costs, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its expeditious passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7369-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FUELS REGULATORY RELIEF ACT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of the Senate, an OP-ED entitled ``Taxing Web Wallets'' that \nappears in today's New York Times. This article on the\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\ntax treatment of Internet Commerce is by my nephew, a former Treasury \nofficial, Michael Moynihan. Last October Congress passed the Internet \nTax Freedom Act, which placed a three year moratorium on any new taxes \non the Internet. But as Michael Moynihan points out, ``. . . we have \nyet to address the long-term tax consequences of the movement of trade \non line.''\n  I ask the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 21, 1999]\n\n                           Taxing Web Wallets\n\n                         (By Michael Moynihan)\n\n       Washington--Last month, 14 million Americans bought \n     something on the Internet. Taking advantage of what might be \n     the last tax loophole, 99 percent of them did not pay sales \n     tax. Without knowing it, most broke the law. States cannot \n     force out-of-state sellers to collect sales taxes, but 45 \n     require buyers to pay the tax anyway. Compliance is virtually \n     nil. Today, a Congressional commission on electronic commerce \n     takes up two key questions: How do we tax the Internet? \n     Should we?\n       The Internet Tax Freedom Act, passed last fall, impose a \n     three-year moratorium on cyber-specific taxes. By banning the \n     infamous ``bit tax,'' which would tax every E-mail and \n     downloaded image, the law helped the Internet marketplace \n     flourish. Freedom from a thicket of 30,000 state and local \n     taxing jurisdictions has provided predictability to the Web \n     economy.\n       But we have yet to address the long-term tax consequences \n     of the movement of trade on line. Last year, Americans bought \n     $43 billion in goods and services over the Internet; next \n     year the figure is expected to reach $250 billion. That's a \n     lot of lost sales tax. Governments will have two choices: cut \n     services or find this money elsewhere. When the moratorium \n     expires in 2001, the Internet will become fair game. \n     Retailers who can't or won't sell on line, from barbers to \n     boutiques, will clamor for equal sales tax treatment.\n       The erosion of sales tax revenue could mean the end of the \n     sales tax altogether. In Europe, where governments rely on \n     value-added taxes, fearful authorities are already diverting \n     inspectors from ports to the post office, where they open up \n     individual packages looking for wily Internet scofflaws. And \n     no one has come up with a way to monitor the purchase of \n     digital goods like software.\n       Why can't we just extend the obligation to collect sales \n     tax to Internet merchants? Thirty thousand taxing \n     jurisdictions means millions of rules, not easily adapted to \n     E-commerce. The big states are quiet because they themselves \n     are high-tech leaders. Though the commission will make its \n     recommendations next May in an election year, it shouldn't \n     pull punches. If the panel doesn't develop fair tax rules for \n     the new economy, 30,000 local authorities and their overseas \n     counterparts will be waiting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7370-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              STEEL CRISIS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a crisis facing the steel \nindustry in the United States, a crisis that has left over 10,000 \nsteelworkers out of jobs and could jeopardize the jobs of thousands of \nadditional workers. This disruption is a result of subsidized and \ndumped goods coming into the United States from a variety of \ncountries--from Russia, from Japan, from Brazil, from Indonesia--at far \nunder the cost of production and far under the price the steel is being \nsold in those countries.\n  While our existing laws and administrative procedures are in place \nand we've received favorable preliminary indications from \nadministration officials, the time it takes to process these cases is \ntoo long and does not respond to a situation as dire as ours quickly \nenough. For example, hot-rolled carbon steel dumping petitions filed in \nSeptember 1998, a full 10 months after the import surge began, were \nonly recently decided. Under current law, industries and workers must \nwait until the injury has occurred or is so imminent as to be \nunavoidable to file a section 201 case.\n  Meanwhile, steelworkers continue to lose their jobs and the steel \nindustry is suffering tremendous losses from which it may not easily \nrecover. I shouldn't have to remind anyone that five American steel \ncompanies have declared bankruptcy and two of them are in the State of \nIllinois (LaClede Steel in Alton, IL, and Acme Steel in Riverside, IL) \nand at least 10,000 of the Nation's 170,000 steelworkers have been laid \noff. Illinois is one of the top steel producing States and we're proud \nof our steelworkers, the industry, and the products that they make for \nthe American people and the world.\n  It is my belief that we should approach this situation with both \nshort-term and long-term strategies that will complement each other and \nproduce the maximum benefit for the U.S. economy, the steelworkers, and \nthe industry. First, steel mills need access to capital to stay open \nand to keep their workers on the job, producing the finest and best \nsteel in the world. That's a short-term approach that will help the \nindustry and the workers when they need it most: now. And that's an \napproach that we take with this bill: H.R. 1664, Byrd-Domenici Steel \nOil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program.\n  H.R. 1664 would provide a short-term, GATT legal, guaranteed loan \nprogram to address the cash flow emergency created by the historic \nsteel import surge. The maximum aggregate amount of a loan guarantee \nthat could be available to a single company would be $250 million. The \nguarantees provided to U.S. steel mills would be 6 years in duration, \nwould require the commitment of collateral, and would require a fee to \nbe paid by the borrower to cover the cost of administering the program. \nThe level of guarantees to be provided to a steel mill would be 85 \npercent.\n\n  Finally, a board would be created in order to implement a steel loan \nguarantee program that provides maximum benefits to the U.S. steel \nindustry and protection to the taxpayers.\n  Second, we need to put more teeth into current trade laws. \nSpecifically, we should strengthen section 201 language by removing a \nvery high causation standard and replacing that standard with a lower \nthreshold by which U.S. industries and workers can prove their cases \nmore easily. Let me state for the Record that if we reform our trade \nlaws and we ensure our trading partners know we are serious about \nenforcing those laws, the incentive to dump steel or other imported \nproducts will be reduced. I liken this to the Senate filibuster. The \nthreat of a filibuster may be far more effective than the actual \nfilibuster itself. Similarly, the threat of more readily-proven dumping \ncases may, in fact, make a country think twice about dumping a product \nillegally into this country.

This disruption is a result of subsidized and \ndumped goods coming into the United States from a variety of \ncountries--from Russia, from Japan, from Brazil, from Indonesia--at far \nunder the cost of production and far under the price the steel is being \nsold in those countries.\n  While our existing laws and administrative procedures are in place \nand we've received favorable preliminary indications from \nadministration officials, the time it takes to process these cases is \ntoo long and does not respond to a situation as dire as ours quickly \nenough. For example, hot-rolled carbon steel dumping petitions filed in \nSeptember 1998, a full 10 months after the import surge began, were \nonly recently decided. Under current law, industries and workers must \nwait until the injury has occurred or is so imminent as to be \nunavoidable to file a section 201 case.\n  Meanwhile, steelworkers continue to lose their jobs and the steel \nindustry is suffering tremendous losses from which it may not easily \nrecover. I shouldn't have to remind anyone that five American steel \ncompanies have declared bankruptcy and two of them are in the State of \nIllinois (LaClede Steel in Alton, IL, and Acme Steel in Riverside, IL) \nand at least 10,000 of the Nation's 170,000 steelworkers have been laid \noff. Illinois is one of the top steel producing States and we're proud \nof our steelworkers, the industry, and the products that they make for \nthe American people and the world.\n  It is my belief that we should approach this situation with both \nshort-term and long-term strategies that will complement each other and \nproduce the maximum benefit for the U.S. economy, the steelworkers, and \nthe industry. First, steel mills need access to capital to stay open \nand to keep their workers on the job, producing the finest and best \nsteel in the world. That's a short-term approach that will help the \nindustry and the workers when they need it most: now. And that's an \napproach that we take with this bill: H.R. 1664, Byrd-Domenici Steel \nOil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program.\n  H.R. 1664 would provide a short-term, GATT legal, guaranteed loan \nprogram to address the cash flow emergency created by the historic \nsteel import surge. The maximum aggregate amount of a loan guarantee \nthat could be available to a single company would be $250 million. The \nguarantees provided to U.S. steel mills would be 6 years in duration, \nwould require the commitment of collateral, and would require a fee to \nbe paid by the borrower to cover the cost of administering the program. \nThe level of guarantees to be provided to a steel mill would be 85 \npercent.\n\n  Finally, a board would be created in order to implement a steel loan \nguarantee program that provides maximum benefits to the U.S. steel \nindustry and protection to the taxpayers.\n  Second, we need to put more teeth into current trade laws. \nSpecifically, we should strengthen section 201 language by removing a \nvery high causation standard and replacing that standard with a lower \nthreshold by which U.S. industries and workers can prove their cases \nmore easily. Let me state for the Record that if we reform our trade \nlaws and we ensure our trading partners know we are serious about \nenforcing those laws, the incentive to dump steel or other imported \nproducts will be reduced. I liken this to the Senate filibuster. The \nthreat of a filibuster may be far more effective than the actual \nfilibuster itself. Similarly, the threat of more readily-proven dumping \ncases may, in fact, make a country think twice about dumping a product \nillegally into this country. Legislation was recently marked up in the \nFinance Committee that addressed the issue of section 201 and we should \nhave a healthy debate about that as well.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, we have a responsibility as Senators \nto address this issue as well as the serious situation the oil and gas \nindustries is currently experiencing; and, I hope we can find a \nconsensus solution that will help both these backbones of the U.S. \nindustrial sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7370-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOEL YEATON\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an \nissue that is important to me, and many of my constituents, in the \ncontext of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The tragedy of Pan \nAm Flight 103 occurred over ten years ago. 270 people were killed as a \nresult of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, including 189 \nAmericans. The bombing of Pan Am 103 was the worst act of international \nterrorism ever directed against the United States.

I would like to address \nfor a few moments an issue which, frankly, more than half of the people \nin America identify as something that worries them--a worry over your \nhealth insurance. How good is it?\n  The rules being written by insurance companies now have you worried \nas to whether you can go to a doctor and get the kinds of treatment you \nreally need for yourself, or your wife, your husband, or another member \nof your family. Can you go to the hospital of your choice if you have \nan emergency and need to go to the emergency room? Can you go to the \nhospital that is closest to where the accident occurred or to your \nhome, or wherever? Does your insurance company say you have to go to \nanother place? If you need a specialist--absolutely need one for your \nown medical care--can you expect, under your plan, to get that \nspecialist, or do you expect to enter into a negotiation with your \ninsurance company as to whether they will let you go to a certain \nspecialist?\n  When you doctor sits down with you in his office, when your heart is \nbeating hard and you want to know what kind of treatment you need for \nthat someone you love, are you sure that doctor is always telling you \nhis best judgment based on years of medical training, or is he telling \nyou what the insurance manual says he can tell you under the terms of \nhis contract with the insurance company? If, God forbid, something goes \nwrong with a procedure, or something is done that ends up wrong, can \nyou hold whoever is responsible accountable even if it was the \ninsurance companies fault?\n  These are basic questions that families across America are asking \nevery day. In fact, a Rand study said that 115 million Americans either \nhad a personal experience, or a member of their family or someone they \nknew had such an experience, with an insurance company that troubled \nthem about whether or not they were being treated fairly.\n  So the question before the Congress is: Can we try to bring some \nbalance back to this situation so consumers and families across \nAmerica, when they sign up for health insurance, have some assurance \nthat they are going to get fair treatment, professional treatment, and \nquality care? It is pretty basic, isn't it?\n  Can you think of another time in your life when you are more \nvulnerable than when you are sick, or when you have a baby you love in \nyour arms and you say: Doctor, what does my baby need? Have you ever \nfelt more helpless? I have been there! A lot of Americans have been \nthere. You want to know, when that doctor looks in your eyes and says \nthe best treatment for your little girl is the following surgery at the \nfollowing hospital, that that is his best medical decision, not an \ninsurance company decision.\n  How can you hold people accountable in medical care when you have a \nsituation under the law where you cannot take the insurance company \ninto court to hold them responsible for their decisions? That, sadly, \nis the law today.\n  So the law that we are hoping to debate on the floor of the Senate \nand the House called the Patients' Bill of Rights would try to rewrite \nthis basic relationship, so that when you are dealing with your health \ninsurance company, it is with more confidence that you are getting the \nbest care, that you are getting honest answers from your doctor, that \nthe recommendation coming to you for a member of your family or \nyourself is the best medical recommendation, not an insurance company \nrecommendation.\n  Now, this is an issue that is not new. We have had it around for a \nwhile. But for some reason, the leadership on the other side of the \naisle does not want to debate this issue. They don't want us to talk \nabout it. In fact, today there was an unrelated bill, the agriculture \nappropriations bill before the Senate. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota \nlooked at the agriculture appropriations bill and offered the Patients' \nBill of Rights as an amendment to it. What does that have to do with \nagriculture? Well, not much. People listening will say: Why did you do \nthat? Well because he was, in desperation, trying to get this matter to \nthe floor because, try as we might, leadership on the other side of the \naisle does not want to debate this issue. They don't want Members of \nthe Senate--Republicans or Democrats--to enter into a debate and have \nto face tough questions.\n\n  How are you going to vote? If I am not mistaken, I accepted voting as \npart of my responsibilities as a Senator from Illinois. Isn't that why \nI am here--to debate issues and vote, to use my best judgment to try to \nimprove the law so the people in my State and across the Nation are \nbetter off?\n  One of the key questions here is: What do you do when an insurance \ncompany decides that they are not going to provide certain care to you? \nYou have heard these cases. You have seen them in local hometown \nnewspapers, on television, and on the radio where somebody says they \nneed a certain treatment and the insurance company says no.\n  What is next? Well, under the bill we have proposed on the Democratic \nside, we have a speedy independent appeals process. Well, it keeps you \nout of court and gets a decision made by somebody who may be objective. \nI think that is fair. That is what the Democratic bill proposes.\n  The Republican bill, however, suggests that the insurance company \nshould decide whether a denial is actually appealable and the insurer \nwhich has turned you down gets to pick somebody who will then decide \nwhether the insurance company is right or wrong. And if you are \ninjured, by their denial, you cannot sue. Sound fishy? It does to me. \nBasically, as far as I am concerned, the insurance company is \ninsulating itself from ever making the right judgment.\n  That is exactly the situation that we have today. It was recognized \nby one of the major newspapers in this country, USA Today. This article \nis from June 19 of last year. They called insurers the ``new \nuntouchables''--people you can't sue--your HMO, managed care insurance \npolicy.\n\n       Bill Weaver, age 52, says his HMO misdiagnosed a brain \n     tumor for 2 years and told him his condition was inoperable \n     and hopeless.\n       Jerry Cannon's wife Phyllis died from leukemia after her \n     HMO denied a bone marrow transplant her physician \n     recommended.\n       Melody Louise Johnson died at the age of age 16 of cystic \n     fibrosis. Her mother says the HMO overruled the specialists.\n\n  These are families from across America. Under the law as it is \ncurrently written, what recourse do these people have for the terrible \noutcomes dealing with insurance companies? Listen to this. They can go \nto Federal court and hire a lawyer and sue the insurance company. Do \nyou know what they can recover? The cost of the procedure--the cost of \nthe medical procedure. So if somebody dies, God forbid, you cannot \nrecover for their death. If someone lingers and suffers literally for \nyears because of a bad decision by the insurance company, they are not \nliable for that. If someone can't go back to work for 12, 24, or 36 \nmonths, you cannot recover a penny for that. They are the\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nuntouchables, the HMOs, the managed care insurance companies. They \ncannot be sued for anything other than the cost of the procedure.\n  Well, I am sure, if you are listening to this, you think there must \nbe a whole lot of companies in America which have similar treatment. \nNo. This is the only group of companies in America that cannot be held \naccountable for their wrongdoing. How did it happen? Well, it happened \nright here. It happened right here many years ago when we passed \nsomething called ERISA, the Employee Retirement Insurance Security Act. \nThis was a bill passed in 1974 that was supposed to protect workers. \nInstead, in recent years it has provided insurance companies with a \nlegal shield. And 123 million Americans with their health insurance \nplans through their employer have nowhere to go when a bad result comes \nout of a bad insurance company decision. I think that is wrong.\n\n  I don't think these insurance companies should be treated any \ndifferently from any other company, large or small, in America, or any \nother person, for that matter. If you are so reckless as to drink too \nmuch and get in your car and have an accident, can you be held \naccountable in America? You bet you can, and you should be. But if an \ninsurer is reckless in making a decision about health insurance for \nsomebody's daughter--if they make the wrong decision and they are \nmaimed, crippled, or they die, can they be held accountable as an \ninsurance company? Well, no, not really. That doesn't make sense, and \nit is not fair.\n  Let me tell you about another case that really illustrates this very \nclearly. Carly Christy. These are the words of her father:\n\n       Carly was nine years old when she was diagnosed with \n     malignant kidney cancer. When the HMO insisted that we trust \n     our daughter's delicate surgery to remove the cancerous tumor \n     from her kidney to a doctor with no experience in this area, \n     we were forced to find an expert and pay out of our pockets. \n     You only get one chance at removing a Wilm's tumor correctly \n     and successfully, to ensure the highest probability of \n     survival in children, and we weren't willing to take that \n     chance with our daughter's life because the HMO wanted to \n     save money.\n\n  Her father Harry Christy says:\n\n       Congress must close this loophole and hold health plans \n     accountable for cost-cutting decisions that result in patient \n     injury.\n\n  Take a look at the two bills on the floor--the Patient's Bill of \nRights, as they call them. How would they help Mr. Christy with his \nlittle daughter?\n  Frankly, the Republican bill offers no recourse, no place to turn, \nbecause the HMO didn't deny treatment. In the Republican bill only \noutright denials are appealable, all quality issues are not appealable. \nIn Carly's case the HMO just said you have to go to Dr. X who has never \ndone this before. They were going to get treatment but not from the \nbest doctor.\n  If it is your daughter, don't you want the best and the brightest in \nAmerica operating on her to try to save her life? If they said go to \nthis other doctor who has never done this before on a surgery that is \nlife and death, wouldn't that cause you some trouble?\n  Harry Christy decided he and his wife were going to pay for this out \nof their pockets. I don't have to tell you what kind of money we are \ntalking about. Average families literally put everything on the line--\ntheir homes, savings, everything they can gather--for this care. That \nis how much they love this little girl and how much they think the \ninsurance company made a big mistake.\n  Under the Republican approach, that insurance company cannot be held \naccountable, because they said go ahead, go to a doctor who is \ninexperienced and if Carly had been injured by that insurance company's \ndirection, the insurer would still have been immune from suit.\n  The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights says first you have a speedy \nexternal appeal, by someone not chosen by the insurance company, to \ndecide whether the insurance company is right. If it turns out they are \nwrong, you can literally recover what it costs and the pain and \nsuffering your family has gone through. If your daughter, for example, \nbecause of this mistake, has long-term problems, she can recover for \nthat, too. I think that is sensible. I think it is reasonable.\n  We have a chance with the Patients' Bill of Rights to do something \nfor families across America--to finally bring this issue to the floor \nof the Senate. It is regretful that today when Senator Dorgan tried to \nbring this issue before the Senate, he was stopped. The Republican \nleadership was so determined not to debate this issue, they pulled this \nbill from the floor. They said we will not debate it.\n  Of course, we are in evening business and Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland will follow me and discuss this as an issue whose time has come. \nThis is an issue that affects literally all Americans. If we are going \nto make certain that we cover the millions of Americans who are \nconcerned about their health care coverage, concerned about the quality \nof care, and concerned about their rights under the law, then we have \nto deal with reform that is meaningful.\n  The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights has the endorsement of 200 \nprofessional organizations, including medical organizations, labor \norganizations, and consumer organizations. They have come forward and \nsaid this is the real deal here, the Democratic version is the real \ndeal. The Republican bill has no support. Well actually they probably \nhave the support of insurance companies, but it doesn't have the \nsupport of any health groups. I think this is about health and access \nto health care.\n  We wrapped up last week a 5-day debate on protecting computer \ncompanies from being sued if they don't change their computers for this \nY2K problem. The debate went on a long time. I think it was an \nimportant debate.\n  If we can spend 5 days debating protecting computer companies, can't \nwe spend 5 hours talking about protecting families across America, \nworried about health care coverage? Can't we bring for a vote on the \nSenate floor the very fundamental question as to whether or not the \ncourthouse doors are closed when it comes to health insurance \ncompanies? Can't we suggest that in America--rich or poor, individual \nor business--we are all held accountable in court, all of us as \nAmerican citizens, and that we shouldn't have the untouchables, the \nhealth insurance companies, who can't be brought into court?\n  I hope this week we will take this issue up. I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will understand the gravity of this issue and \nmove forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today also to join my colleague from \nIllinois and to speak about an issue which is of great concern to the \nAmerican people. That is the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  As is my colleague from Illinois, I am terribly frustrated. We are in \nthe third week of June. Yet we have not been able to get this \nlegislation to the floor for debate. Senator Dorgan today tried to do \nthat, but he was frustrated.\n  As Members go around this great country--and I will speak from my \nexperience in Rhode Island--we talk to our constituents and there is a \nsense we have made progress on economic issues. The economy is doing \nbetter. People feel better about their jobs and about the future.\n  If you speak with them for any length of time and ask them what \nreally bothers them, they will quickly state they are afraid of getting \nsick. They are afraid, as a breadwinner, of becoming sick and not being \nable to get the care they need, even though they are in an insurance \nprogram. And they are particularly concerned about the health of their \nchildren.\n  They have heard the stories and read the newspaper articles, as the \nSenator from Illinois pointed out, about the numerous people who have \nbeen paying for insurance or have been the beneficiaries of employer-\npaid-for insurance. They have become ill, gone to their HMO thinking \nthat at least they had insurance coverage, and they discovered they did \nnot have it. They did not have it when it counted. They did not have it \nwhen they needed it, when they were ill or their children were ill.\n  That is why we are advocating so strenuously bringing the Patients' \nBill of Rights to the floor for debate.\n  In March, I participated in the deliberations in the Senate Health \nEducation Labor and Pensions Committee. We voted out a bill on partisan \nlines. It is not the bill I prefer. It is a bill that is deficient in \nmany respects. However, it is the basis of debate, and it is the basis \nof the debate we should be having today on the floor of this Senate.\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\n  There are two versions of this legislation. There is a Republican \nproposal and there is a Democratic proposal which my colleague from \nIllinois was talking about so eloquently. There are many differences. \nOne of the most startling differences is that the Republican proposal \ncovers a very small fraction of Americans. Not all Americans that have \nprivate health insurance are covered by HMOs. Under the Republican \nbill, a lucky 48 million Americans would have some protections.\n  Ask yourself, if these protections are appropriate for 48 million \nAmericans, why aren't they appropriate for every American who is part \nof the managed care health plan? I think the answer is quite clear: The \nRepublican version is more sham than substance; more window dressing \nthan a valiant, serious attempt to address the concerns of every \nAmerican.\n  That is unfortunate. Why should there be one person who is lucky \nenough to fall within a narrow category that is covered by the \nRepublican plan--that person having access to quality care, that person \nhaving certain appeal rights--yet his neighbor, who is also covered by \nan HMO plan but one that is funded slightly differently is without \nthese protections? There is absolutely no logic to this. The Democratic \nproposal would cover all Americans who are in these private HMO plans. \nIt would do so in a way that ensures people are getting what they paid \nfor.\n  That is the other irony in this whole debate. We are not talking \nabout a program which, through the generosity of the government or the \ngenerosity of someone else, people are getting some health care from \ninsurance companies and they are deciding they shouldn't get X or they \nshouldn't get Y. These health insurance companies are being paid \nsignificant premiums by individuals and their employers for coverage. \nYet the coverage is not being provided in so many cases.\n  I am particularly concerned that this narrow scope is extremely \ndetrimental to the children of this country.\n  Only about a third of the children in these managed health care plans \nwould be protected by the Republican program. I ask, very sincerely, \nwhy can't we at least cover every child in America? Is that too much to \nask? I think not. I believe every American would recognize the need to \ndo that.\n  Now, managed care has provided benefits for children in this country. \nTheir emphasis on preventive care, their emphasis on immunizations are \nall very good. But, frankly, I have a distinct impression a lot of what \nthey are calling coverage for kids amounts to taking the premiums but \nnot providing the service.\n  I had the occasion to meet with a physician from California, from the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, who has a very innovative \nprogram. In this program, he goes from school to school with a van to \ncover children who have asthma. It is very effective because not only \ndoes he diagnose the children and then treat them and then follow them \nup, which is critical, but he also looks at the statistics.\n  He was able to essentially categorize all his patients into three \ngroups: Those with private HMO insurance, those with California \nMedicaid insurance for low-income children, and those children without \nany coverage at all. What was startling to me was that when he looked \nat these different populations, he found essentially these kids got the \nsame coverage, regardless of their category of insurance. All they \nreally got was an emergency room visit, and when they saw the doctor \nbecause they had a terrible asthma episode, they were given, in the \nemergency room, a little paper bag with an inhaler and a few bits of \nmedicine and then they were sent home--those without insurance, those \nwith Medicaid insurance, and those in managed care plans for which an \nemployer was paying a great deal of money.\n  That just goes to show we really have to do a great deal more to \nensure that children get the benefit of the health insurance plan they \nare supposed to be part of. Then we have to ensure that all of our \ncitizens who participate in these plans get fair and adequate coverage. \nThat is at the heart of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, \nensuring that all of our citizens who are in these managed care plans \nget access to quality coverage at affordable prices.\n  I would like, for a moment, to concentrate on children in these \nplans, because, as I said before, this is a special concern of mine. I \nthink, at a minimum, we can emerge from this Congress with legislation \nthat guarantees every child in America access to quality health care, \nprovisions in their managed care plans that make sure children are \ntreated and treated well.\n  Senator Durbin was talking about a parent whose child had a rare \ncancer. The HMO said: Yes, your daughter is quite ill, perhaps \nterminally ill. We will send her for treatments, not to a pediatric \noncologist or a pediatric surgeon, someone who specializes not only in \ncancer but pediatric cancers, we are just going to send her to a \nsurgeon. Those parents had to pay out of their own pocket, presumably, \nto get the right kind of care for their child.\n  In the Democratic bill, there would be a guarantee that a child would \nhave access to a pediatric specialist and pediatric services, because \nchildren are not just small adults. They have specialized health care \nneeds that are very different from those of adults. But too often in \nmanaged care plans throughout this country they are simply treated as \nsmall adults, if they are treated in particular at all.\n  There are some other things we have to have for children in these \nplans, particularly for children. We have to have expedited review, not \nonly if their life is in jeopardy but also their development because \nthis is another difference between an adult and a child. Adults are \nusually fully developed. Children are not. There are conditions which \nmight not be life threatening but certainly threaten their development, \nboth physical and intellectual. In those situations there have to be \nexpedited appeals. Then we have to have the continuity of care for \nchronically ill or terminally ill children.\n  We also have to recognize the information parents get when they make \na choice about their health care plans should include specific \ninformation about how that plan treats children. Too often such \ninformation does not exist. Too often it is all done in terms of adult \noutcomes, adult studies. Unless parents have this information, \nsometimes the only time they realize how well their child is covered is \nwhen they discover their child is not covered well at all because he or \nshe is deathly ill and is not getting the kind of care he or she needs \nor deserves.\n  I am encouraged because Senator Bond has introduced a bill entitled \n``Healthy Kids 2000,'' which includes access to pediatric specialists \nsimilar to that in my legislation. Also, Senator Chafee has introduced \na managed care bill, which also talks about access to pediatric \nspecialists. So I hope there is an emerging consensus across the aisle \nthat we have to do more for children in managed care.\n  But let me say again, the Democratic bill strongly and emphatically \ndefines the special rights of children in managed care. We have \nactually taken surveys and asked the American people, regarding access \nto care for children, what do they want; what do they demand. They want \nhigh-quality care. They want access to specialists. They want to be \nable to protect the development of children. They want to have \nexpedited reviews when children's development or lives are threatened. \nAnd they are willing to pay for these provisions. What we found in too \nmany managed care plans is that these types of protections just do not \nexist.\n  In 1992, there was a study done of pediatricians. They found there \nwere significant barriers to pediatric referrals in the managed care \nsystem, that pediatricians in the managed care system often encounter \nbarriers to referring their patients to pediatric specialists. Of these \npediatricians who were surveyed, 35 percent believed their patient's \nhealth was compromised because of the denial of access to pediatric \nspecialists. This is a real problem, and it is a problem the Democratic \nproposal resolves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted for morning business \nfor each Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\n\n  Mr. REED. As I mentioned, these provisions that would help protect \nchildren are provisions which the American people want and the American \npeople will pay for. They are provisions that are at the heart of the \nDemocratic Patients' Bill of Rights. I think it is time to move. It is \ntime to move forward on a debate about this critical issue, an issue \nthat affects every family in this country. It is an issue that is \ncritical to their well-being. It is an issue, frankly, that they sent \nus here to work on, to debate and to vote on. Difficult votes they may \nbe, but they sent us here to take these votes.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join together to begin the debate, to \nreach a conclusion, and to do something the American people want us to \ndo--give them the opportunity to protect their health and the health of \ntheir families.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nbody for 10 minutes, under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, for what he had to say today. He is exactly \nright about one of the problems we face these days with HMOs; that is, \nthat many types of children's health are neglected.\n  Just today I was in both Rochester and Syracuse, back in my State, \nNew York, meeting with doctors and patients and health care providers \nabout the problems they face in the health care area. What I found over \nand over was this problem that we are talking about that would be \nrectified by the Patients' Bill of Rights, as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland correctly pointed out.\n\n  I had a doctor in Syracuse, just this afternoon, maybe 3 hours ago, \nmention to me that one of her patients needed a pediatric oncologist, \nbut the family's HMO would only allow an oncologist, not a pediatric \noncologist.\n  They had the procedure done--it was not done correctly--four times, \nand only on the fifth time did the HMO relent and allow the pediatric \noncologist do the job. Then it was done and, thank God, successfully.\n  The amazing thing about this is this would have saved money had they \nrelied on the judgment of this doctor and used a pediatric oncologist \nright at the beginning. Then very simply the HMO would have saved \nmoney, the child would be healthier, and everyone would be happier.\n  When many people ask, what is the problem with HMOs--and there are \nmany and they have been documented by my friend from Illinois and my \nfriend from Rhode Island--one of the things I am beginning to learn is \nthat when HMOs come in, they try a cookie-cutter approach. They say one \nsize fits all.\n  In Rochester this morning, a young man told me this story: His wife \nneeded a very special type of medicine because she was receiving \ntreatment, I think it was for cancer. In any case, her immune system \nwas down. She needed these drugs to help build up her immune system. \nThese drugs are lifesaving. They are very precise. In other words, one \nhas to measure the level in the blood before determining how much of \nanother dose is needed. They are expensive--hundreds and hundreds of \ndollars a week--and they have to be taken at exactly the right time. If \na dosage is missed, say, at 8 o'clock in the morning, you could acquire \nan illness that could kill you because your immune system is deficient.\n  Everything was going fine. This young man said that he and his wife \nhad no problems with their HMO through their travail of her illness, \nuntil the HMO decided that all prescriptions should come through a \nmail-order house in Texas. He has gone through an enormous amount of \ntrouble.\n  First of all, his wife has to have her blood taken and measured in \nRochester and then communicate all the time with the facility in Texas. \nSecond, sometimes the medicines do not arrive, and when they arrive \nlate, if her blood level is different, they cannot be used.\n  Every week this young man and his wife are shelling out hundreds of \ndollars because the HMO is insisting for this particular drug, a rare \ndrug, a special drug and one that requires a great deal of care before \nit is administered, that they have to get it through this mail-order \npharmacy.\n  He said to me: If we had diabetes, and if the mail-order house was \nsending us the insulin, it would be just fine, because in those \ninstances, it is a set dose of insulin and they could send a whole \nbunch.\n  When they ran out, they could send a whole new bunch. They could send \ncopayments. He said making them go through this mail-order house for \nthe immune drug made no sense.\n  Today, as I went through the day and listened to people, I found that \nhappens all the time. Yes, in most cases, a pediatrician or a pediatric \nsurgeon might do the job, but in certain cases an oncologist is needed. \nWho knows that? Certainly not the actuary sitting in the insurance \ncompany's home office who is now making the decision. The person who \nknows that, of course, is the physician or the nurse who has spent \nlong, long years studying it and has had many years of experience in \nfiguring this out.\n  The problem we face and the problem we are trying to rectify with the \nPatients' Bill of Rights is to deal with many of these situations, to \ndeal with the fact that medicine is not a cookie-cutter enterprise, \nthat one size does not fit all, as much as a corporate mentality might \nlike to see that happen in the name of saving dollars. In reality, in \nmost cases, you lose dollars. Certainly the amount of dollars paid into \nthe health care system is increased, not decreased by these mistakes, \nwhich are often very costly.\n  The more I listen to my constituency throughout my State, from one \nend of the State to the other, the more I have come to the conclusion \nthat we really do need this Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, we were \ndebating State Department authorization which is obviously important. \nWe have to deal with diplomacy. We have many other bills before us. But \nI cannot think of one that seems to have the urgency and importance to \nmy constituents that this Patients' Bill of Rights does. I hope we can \nmove quickly and bring the bill to the floor.\n  There are two sides to this argument, as there are to most serious \nissues. I am hopeful the Patients' Bill of Rights that I have \ncosponsored and that Senator Kennedy has introduced will be the one \nthat is passed. I join my colleagues, Senator Durbin from Illinois and \nSenator Reed from Rhode Island, in hoping that will happen. At the very \nleast, we are entitled to debate the issue.\n  This is such an important issue that we should debate it, and it is \nin the tradition of the Senate that when an important issue is facing \nus, we do not just say: Let's lickety dispose of it; you vote your \nbill, we will vote our bill, and that is that.\n\n  We are trying to come to the best possible product and coming to the \nbest possible product entails a significant amount of debate. Is it \nworth the time? Ask the pediatrician in Syracuse if it would have been \nworth the time. The amount of time and energy that she and the family \nshe looked after far exceeded 4 or 5 days of debate. Ask the young man \nin Rochester who is having such trouble with his HMO using this \npharmaceutical house. The amount of time and energy that that one \nfamily is going through will exceed the amount of time we spend on this \ndebate. Of course, that is happening every day to tens of thousands, \nperhaps hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of American \nfamilies. The argument that we do not have time to debate this issue, \nthat we ought to just dispose of it and get rid of it, does not make \nmuch sense.\n  In conclusion, I am joining my colleagues this evening and, I \nbelieve, many of my constituents in asking that once and for all we \nstop delay. It is already the end of June. We only have 6 or 7 weeks \nleft on the legislative calendar, and we should debate the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We must let people decide what should be the HMOs' \nresponsibility in terms of specialists, in terms of appeal, in terms of \nemergency rooms, in terms of the ability to be sued, and then I believe \nwe will come up with a pretty good product. This issue is of grave \nimportance to many families. It will become of even greater importance \nto many others.\n  I make a further plea to the majority leader in this body, someone \nfor whom\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nI have a great deal of respect--and I know he has the best interests of \nthe people at heart--and that is that we, as soon as we can, hopefully \nbefore the July 4 break, have a full-fledged, open debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It is my judgment, and I think the judgment \nof many, that there will be enough support in this body to pass a bill \nand end the pain and agony and suffering of so many American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/21/senate-section/article/S7376-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7376]\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1256\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.
