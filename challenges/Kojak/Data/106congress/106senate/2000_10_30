Senators should also be aware that multiple votes \ncould occur each day starting tomorrow. Negotiations are ongoing, and \nit is still hoped that agreements can be made to wrap up the 106th \nCongress prior to the elections.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask a question of the acting \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. I am wondering if the Senator from \nAlabama would check with the majority leader to give us some idea of \nwhen he is planning to come in tomorrow; he is planing multiple votes. \nNumerous people have been calling and asking about that today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What I understand is this, that the majority leader has \nmade this proposal to the Democratic leader which has not been accepted \nas of yet; that he would ask unanimous consent we stand in recess when \nwe complete our business today until 5 p.m. Tuesday, and that the time \nbetween 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. be a period for morning business with the \ntime equally divided, and that at 7 p.m. the Senate proceed to consider \nthe 1-day continuing resolution and a vote occur immediately on the \nresolution when it is received from the House without amendments, \ndebate, or motions in order. That will be the proposal at this point, \nas I understand it. But I am sure the majority leader would be open to \nimprovements.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I say to my friend, I guess the good news is that \nultimately there will have to be an end to the 106th Congress because \nthe calendar is going to run out eventually. I hope we will see fit to \nmaybe wrap up the work we have.\n  As you know, there has been tremendous work on Labor-HHS during the \npast 24 hours. Early this morning we thought we had an agreement worked \nout. As you know, my counterpart in the House on the Republican side, I \nunderstand, threw what we refer to as a monkey wrench into the proposed \nworkout of the Labor-HHS bill which now, it is my understanding, is in \nfurther negotiations.\n  Time is really working very fast against us. As you know, we have \nsent a number of bills to the President. He is going to have to make a \ndecision on those bills, whether he is going to veto them or sign them.\n  I know the majority leader is aware of all the problems that this \nCongress faces, but I hope that we exert any influence any of us have \nto try to work out this Labor-HHS bill. I think if that were worked \nout, we could probably resolve the other issues, or at least I hope so. \nThere are a few other issues such as assisted suicide and immigration \nthat would still be outstanding, but hopefully we could resolve those \nif we got this big final spending bill done.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sure the majority leader would work toward that \nend. I know it has been his goal since this Congress began to move the \nappropriations bills to not find us at this point. Frankly, I am \nsympathetic with the fact that he has tried to do that and has been \nfrustrated time and again. I think some people wanted us to end up in \nthis very position, and they got their wish. And as far as I am \nconcerned, we can stay here until January 1 or December 31 to do our \nbusiness. Wiser people will decide that.\n  Mr. REID. You don't mind if we take at least a day or two for \nThanksgiving and Christmas, do you?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do prefer to take off Christmas. But we have a high \nduty to do our work and do it right.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments, and I note that he desires, and \nI do, that we reach an accord.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, what I would like to do for a few minutes is \ntalk about the Governor of Texas and his plan regarding Social \nSecurity. I will not go into a lot of detail other than to say that the \nactuarials that are cited show that his plan is impossible because he \nis promising the same trillion dollars to two different groups, and in \neffect, the plan, just in a few short years, would bankrupt the country \nand we would have staggering deficits again.\n  So that those within the sound of my voice do not think that these \nstatements that I am making are coming from the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee or the Democratic National Committee, let me read a \nnumber of quotes.\n  First of all, from Ron Gebhardtsbauer, who is Senior Pension Fellow \nat the American Academy of Actuaries, who said:\n\n       ``I don't see any way they pay off the public debt.'' And \n     given Bush's large package of tax cuts, ``in 2015 the budget \n     will go negative. There won't be a surplus anymore.''\n\n  Paul Krugman, economist and columnist for the New York Times stated \non October 29:\n\n       George W. Bush's proposal, admittedly, does not count on \n     the stupidity of markets. Instead, he trusts the people: \n     voters are not supposed to notice that the same pool of money \n     is promised to two different groups of people.\n\n  Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers, who, by the way, is not only \nSecretary of Treasury and a brilliant academician but is also a \nfiduciary with the Social Security trust fund and has an obligation in \nthat regard also, here is what he says:\n\n       Now, there is of course, a Social Security surplus of \n     approximately $2 trillion over the next 10 years. That \n     surplus is currently earmarked to pay the guaranteed benefits \n     for the baby boom generation when it retires. If that surplus \n     is diverted to new accounts, then the resources will not be \n     there to pay the guaranteed benefits when the baby boom \n     generation retires.\n\n  Robert Ball, former Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration, said on October 27, just a few days ago:\n\n       I've looked over Governor Bush's plan. He takes one \n     trillion dollars out of Social Security for savings accounts. \n     But Social Security is counting on that money to pay \n     benefits. His plan simply doesn't add up and would undermine \n     Social Security.\n\n  Henry J. Aaron and Alan Blinder, Century Foundation Study of Governor \nBush's Social Security proposal, Washington Post, August 24:\n\n       In a recent report, we showed that Social Security \n     retirement benefits would have to be cut as much as 54 \n     percent to restore balance under a Bush-style privatization \n     plan.\n\n  In an editorial in the New York Times yesterday:\n\n       The governor's scheme would siphon money out of Social \n     Security at the very moment when both seniors and younger \n     taxpayers want to see long-term fixes to ensure its solvency.\n\n  Mr. President, the fact is that Governor Bush's plan ruins Social \nSecurity and ruins our economy. That is not a very good duo, as far as \nI am concerned, when you take into consideration that Social Security \nis the most successful social program in the history of the world.\n  We need to make sure that we do what we can to strengthen the \nprogram. Governor Bush's program weakens the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11350-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11350-S11351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEANINGFUL LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I find myself in amazement when I hear the \nRepublican's spin that the Democrats played partisan politics in this \nCongress.\n  The truth is, we have repeatedly asked for the Republican leadership \nto work with us so we could have meaningful legislative accomplishments \nfor\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\nthe people in Nevada and in other States represented in this body.\n  These legislative accomplishments should include meaningful \nprescription drug benefits that help people--not the HMOs; a meaningful \nPatients' Bill of Rights--benefits to ensure the American people \nreceive the urgent medical care they need rather than an HMO litigation \nprotection bill; meaningful funding for education; that is, funding for \nschool construction, repair, and modernization rather than denying \nStates any Federal assistance to maintain our Nation's schools.\n  We always hear that this takes away from local control. No one on \nthis side of the aisle wants to take local control away from schools.\n  We have many programs that we have worked on that have been very \nhelpful in school districts.\n  I have not heard a single person from the Clark County School \nDistrict, the sixth largest school district in the country--basically \nLas Vegas--complain about too much Federal money, or too much Federal \ncontrol. Quite the opposite. The calls I get are for more help, \nespecially school construction and repair and modernization.\n  I think we need a meaningful tax cut; that is, a significant tax to \nensure we can still pay down the debt rather than a tax cut of such \nmagnitude that we forget our current obligations; targeted tax cuts, \nfor example, that would allow a child to go to school not based upon \nhow much money the parents have but how much ability they have. A tax \ncredit to allow the parents to deduct up to $10,000 a year per child \nwould be most helpful to the American people. That is what we call a \ntargeted tax cut. Of course, we need a minimum wage increase.\n\n  Speaking of Governor Bush, the reason Governor Bush has not been an \nadvocate for a minimum wage increase is the State of Texas has one that \nis almost $2 an hour less than the Federal minimum wage.\n  In some States, the wages are much higher. You have some \njurisdictions that have a minimum wage as much as $11 an hour. But here \nwe don't. We have a $5.15 minimum wage. We want to increase it 50 cents \nan hour. We are getting all kinds of static for trying to do that. We \nneed to do that.\n  Campaign finance reform: Certainly with this campaign season, people \nunderstand how we have to do something to take money out of campaigns. \nWe need to have campaigns more meaningful. It shouldn't be how much \nmoney you are able to raise. It should be what the merits of your \nclaims are.\n  As we get closer to Halloween, the debt of the American people should \nscare them more than any ghost. Instead of giving them treats, this \nRepublican Congress, in my opinion, played a dirty trick on the \nAmerican people. They are scheming to drive a stake through the heart \nof the positive Democratic agenda--an agenda that could make a real \ndifference in the lives of working people.\n  We do not have the legislative accomplishments that we need. Instead \nwe have accomplishments that could have been.\n  I know that there are others here wishing to speak. We have a limited \namount of time.\n  I see my friends from Illinois and Minnesota. I would be happy to \nyield my time to either of them.\n  How much time does the Senator from Illinois desire?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I give 20 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask the Chair to advise me \nwhen I have consumed 10 minutes.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11351-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11351-S11353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE AMERICAN CHOICE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me follow up on a statement made by \nthe Senator from Nevada about the choice the American people are facing \nin just a very few days.\n  I think if you believe that governing America is easy business, then \nthe choice is easy, too.\n  I happen to think that the set of circumstances the next President \nwill face is pretty challenging.\n  I can recall only a few years ago on the floor of the Senate when we \nspent most of our time debating deficits and talking about \nconstitutional amendments to end deficits. But now we are debating \nsurpluses. What are we going to do with the extra money?\n  We believe on the Democratic side that the first obligation has to be \nto reduce the national debt so that our kids don't carry that burden, \nand strengthening Social Security and Medicare. We believe that after \nwe have met those obligations, we should target tax cuts to help the \nmiddle-income and working families deal with problems that are \nmeaningful, problems such as paying for college education for their \nkids.\n\n  We believe on the Democratic side we should be able to deduct up to \n$12,000 a year of tuition fees paid for your children in college. I \nhave taken that across the State of Illinois, a pretty diverse State, \nand it is widely accepted. People believe that is an excellent change \nin the Tax Code.\n  We also want to give families--working families, single mothers, too, \nfor that matter, who need to have good quality day care--an additional \ntax credit so they can afford to leave their kids in safe day care. We \nsay to the mother who wants to make the sacrifice to stay home with the \nkids, you deserve a tax break too; you are making a sacrifice. Our Tax \nCode should recognize that. That is targeted tax cuts the Democrats \nsupport.\n  So many people have aging parent and grandparents. We want to \nincrease the deductibility of expenses incurred in caring for their \nparents. Baby boomers have noted their parents need extra help as they \nlive a longer life. They need extra assistance. We want to be there. \nThe Tax Code should support families who do their best to help \nrelatives, to help their parents.\n  We believe, bringing this together, we can keep America moving \nforward because we won't be embarking on a risky tax scheme, one that \nhas been proposed by Governor Bush. The idea of $1.6 trillion in tax \ncuts, 40 percent of which go to the wealthiest people in America, is a \nbitter pill to swallow. Who are the top 1 percent wage earners in \nAmerica? People who make over $25,000 a month, over $300,000 a year. \nGovernor Bush says these poor struggling people making only $300,000 a \nyear need a tax break, $2,000 a month worth of a tax break.\n  I am sorry, but, frankly, I prefer to target that tax break to the \npeople who really need it. A fellow such as Bill Gates at Microsoft has \nbeen very successful, God bless him for his creativity, but this man's \nnet worth is greater as an individual than the combined net worth of \n106 million Americans. Does he need Governor Bush's tax break? I don't \nthink so. I know a lot of families across Illinois want to have a tax \nbreak to send one of their kids to college so that kid might have a \nchance to have a successful career and business or whatever they \nchoose.\n  That is the difference. That is the choice. I think a lot of people \nin this election want to overlook a little history. Let me share some \nof that history.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time I consume asking questions not \nbe charged against the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be charged against the Democratic \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, does the Senator agree \nthe best tax cut the American people could get would be if they paid \ndown the national debt? That would give Bill Gates a break and \neverybody in America a break; is that not true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. If we pay down our \ndebt, we stop borrowing to service the debt. As we stop borrowing, the \ndemand for capital goes down. That is, the cost of capital goes down, \nwhich is the interest rate. As interest rates go down, every family in \nAmerica can feel it on their mortgage payment, on their loan for school \npayment, or their auto payment. That is as good as, if not better than, \na tax cut, if we reduce that burden on our kids and bring down the \ninterest rates in the process.\n  Mr. REID. One more question I want to ask my friend from Illinois. I \nhave a long-time friend; we went to high\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\nschool together. We were inseparable friends. He was my chief of staff \nuntil he retired 2 years ago. His mother has been very ill. She passed \naway last night.\n  The point I want to make is this: My friend's sister, my friend \nGloria, with whom I also went to high school, spent many months caring \nfor her mother in her home. She gave up her job. It was a tremendous \nburden, but it was her mother. She did it; she is a caring person; she \ngave up her life to take care of her aged mother.\n\n  Do you know what tax break she got from that? Nothing.\n  As I understand what my friend is saying, the Senator thinks we \nshould spend a little bit of this surplus to give my friend Gloria a \ntax break so that she and other people similarly situated who are \nwilling to take care of their mother or other loved ones--and there is \nno better care that can be given--should be given some kind of tax \nincentive for doing this; is that what my friend is saying?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. If you really believe in family \nvalues, is there a stronger family value than a son or daughter willing \nto sacrifice for an aging and ailing parent? If we are going to support \nfamily values with the Tax Code, shouldn't we include in that Tax Code \nsome assistance for your friend and her situation? They would give \n$2,000 in tax breaks to Bill Gates, and he wouldn't even notice it. I \nam telling you, your friend will, as will a lot of other baby boomers \nacross American who are caring for their parents. That is the \ndifference. That is the choice. It really is a graphic choice.\n  If you look at this chart, there has been a suggestion that having \nsurpluses at the Federal level must be easy, so anybody can do it, yet \nhistory tells otherwise. It wasn't until halfway through the Clinton-\nGore administration that we finally turned the corner, and now we are \ngenerating the largest surplus in history. We are paying down America's \ndebt for the first time.\n  Look at all the red ink that occurred under Ronald Reagan and \nPresident George Bush and the early years of the Clinton \nadministration. We finally turned this corner in the belief we could do \na $1.6 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest people and take $1 trillion \nout of the Social Security surplus and use it for some privatization \nscheme. Frankly, I don't think that is responsible. If I owe anything \nto the people of Illinois and this country, it is to maintain the \neconomic growth and prosperity we have seen.\n  Let me mention one other point. Basic economics says Alan Greenspan's \ngreatest fear is inflation. Every time he thinks we are moving toward \ninflation, what does he do? He raises interest rates a notch and slows \nthings down. I can also say you can create inflation with government \nspending or tax reductions. Injecting $1.6 trillion into our Nation's \neconomy through tax cuts will energize the economy and create \ninflationary pressure, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest \nrates in response.\n  So George W. Bush gives a tax break on one hand and creates an \neconomic circumstance that raises interest rates on the other. You get \nto take your new tax break and pay for a higher ARM, your adjustable \nrate mortgage on your home. There is no benefit to your family. There \nis a real benefit if you reduce the debt, the deficit of this country, \nand make sure our kids don't bear that burden.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I see the illustrative chart. It appears to me every year \nthat President Clinton has been in power, in office, the deficit has \ngone down. Does the Senator from Illinois--and I was in Congress in \n1993 when we took a very tough vote, the Clinton budget deficit \nreduction act was a tough veto. Not a single Republican voted for it in \nthe House, not a single Republican over here. Al Gore came over and \nbroke the tie.\n  Would the Senator agree with me, that is what put the country on the \nroad to economic recovery where we created 22 million jobs--the lowest \nunemployment in 40 years--we have surpluses instead of deficits; we \nhave a Federal Government today that is 300,000 people fewer than when \nGore and Clinton took office? Does the Senator believe that is the \nreason this chart is illustrated the way it is?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't think there is any doubt. It was a tough vote, \nand we both know some of our colleagues lost their reelection campaigns \nbecause of it, because people demagogued and said it was the biggest \ntax increase.\n  It was on the wealthiest people in the country and also the biggest \ntax cut in history, and it was right thing to do. It was the right \nmedicine. People on Wall Street and the business community know we \nfinally have a President who will take a difficult but necessary path \ntoward bringing us to a surplus economy. That is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  To think this could happen under any President, I say, is wishful \nthinking, because I have served under three Presidents and I can say in \nthe early days we didn't see any indication that the deficits were \ngoing to decrease. In fact, just the opposite is true. We can see in \nthe President George Bush era the deficits were increasing each year. \nIt wasn't until the Clinton-Gore administration started that the \ndeficits were reduced, leading to a surplus.\n  Then take a look at the overall impact to which the Senator from \nNevada alludes. We are in the longest economic expansion in the history \nof the United States of America, 115 months. We have seen the effort \nmade, the longest sustained surplus coming out of our Federal deficit \nin our history. We have seen more money generated to pay down debt than \nat any time in our history. What does it mean?\n  As the Senator has noted, the unemployment rate of this country has \nbeen coming down steadily since 1992, the election of Bill Clinton and \nAl Gore. We can see the unemployment rate is the lowest peacetime level \nin 42 years. This does not happen automatically. It isn't just \nsomething we can expect to see automatically. We have to make the right \nchoices. Some of them are difficult. Some are painful. Some are easily \ndemagogued in 30-second ads. These choices have paid off for America.\n  Let me show the Senator from Nevada some charts to back up other \nthings he said: 22 million new jobs have been created under the \nClinton-Gore administration. Is this something that is easy to do? \nObviously, President George Bush couldn't do it. In his 4 years, he \nmanaged to create some 2.5 million jobs; President Reagan, 16 million \nunder his 8-year period. But 22 million were created across this \ncountry in Clinton-Gore.\n  There used to be a debate whether we value work. Since I was a little \nboy growing up in my family, work was important. You proved your mettle \nas a person by going to work. Now 22 million Americans have a chance to \ngo to work and their chance to realize the America dream.\n  Look at the inflation rate. This is the lowest level since 1965. \nInflation being low means a lot of people can understand that their \ntake-home pay is still worth a lot if it keeps up with inflation.\n  In the bad old days, we had inflation rates in double digits. Now we \nare down to an inflation rate that is below 3 percent. People who are \nalways left out in this equation are the poorest in America. We see now \nthe lowest poverty rate in two decades was in 1999. It means basically \nwe have not just helped those the best off in America, we have tried to \nhelp everybody. That means more job creation bringing more people off \nwelfare, and our welfare rolls are the lowest they have been in modern \nmemory. All these positive things have occurred. The question people \nhave to face in the election on November 7 is basically the same \nelection question Ronald Reagan posed many years ago: Are you better \noff today than you were 8 years ago? For the vast majority of Americans \nthe answer is, overwhelmingly, yes. There is a fear, of course, unless \nwe make the right decisions and elect the right leaders, we could \njeopardize that situation.\n\n  Look at Federal spending. I noticed George W. Bush goes around saying \nAl Gore wants to spend more and more at the Federal level, but this \nchart shows spending is moving in the opposite direction. Since the \nelection of Bill Clinton in 1992, we have seen a steady decline of \nFederal spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product. Our \nspending is more effective. We are trying to do things that are \nimportant for America, and it has been evidenced in our economy and \neconomic growth.\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\n  Take a look a little more closely at the tax cut that would be \nhappening here under the proposals we have seen from George W. Bush. We \nsee basically the average tax cut for the lowest 20 percent of \nAmericans ends up this year being worth about $18. If you happen to be \nin the top 1 percent, it is worth over $4,000. As you look at these, \nyou understand this is a clear choice.\n  I want to go back to one point made by the Senator from Nevada. I \nthink it is an important one. Last week it wasn't the Democratic Party, \nit wasn't the Republican Party, it was the American Academy of \nActuaries that analyzed the George W. Bush proposal for Social \nSecurity. This is a group that is supposed to know their business when \nit comes to analyzing what policy changes would mean.\n  Here is what they said in their release of October 27: Bush's plan on \nSocial Security would signal a return to Federal budget deficits around \n2015.\n  How could that be good for America? How could it be good for us to go \nback to a deficit situation, adding to our national debt and drawing \nmore money out of the economy to pay interest on it, raising interest \nrates, creating an inflationary spiral?\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Texas Governor George W. Bush's plan to cut taxes and \n     divert Social Security payroll taxes to establish individual \n     accounts would make it all but impossible to eliminate the \n     publicly held national debt.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to be advised when he had 10 \nminutes remaining. There are 10 minutes remaining\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The program is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning most of the payroll \ntaxes collected now are disbursed to recipients. We say, If we draw \nmoney out of Social Security, and we know we need to have it, how do \nyou replace it? He was asked repeatedly in the third debate: Governor \nBush, how do you replace the $1 trillion you take out of Social \nSecurity? He cannot answer the question because the hard answer to that \nquestion is the only way to replace it is to take one of three options: \nReduce Social Security benefits; raise the payroll tax on Social \nSecurity; or somehow extend the retirement age beyond 67.\n  I do not think any of those is a popular option. I hope we never have \nto face them, but if Governor Bush is going to propose massive changes \nin Social Security, then he has to face the music and explain it to the \nAmerican people before the election.\n  I would like to address a separate issue, but one equally important \nin this debate over the next President of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11353-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11353-S11358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the pace of U.S. deployments and the use \nof force overseas has been a hot issue in policy debates in Congress \nand on the campaign trail. Presidential candidate, Governor George W. \nBush, says that he will put an end to the Clinton Administration's \n``vague, aimless and endless deployments;'' that he would replace \n``uncertain missions with well-defined objectives.''\n  So the question is: Has the President improperly committed our forces \noverseas in major missions and at an unprecedented rate compared to his \npredecessors? I don't think so. I want to take some time today to look \nat the deployments in question and at deployment statistics. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the lists of \ndeployments, so Americans can judge for themselves if they think there \nwere missions that the military should not have undertaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to look at why a deployment of between 10,000 and \n30,000 soldiers to the Balkans, or deployments of several thousand \nmilitary personnel at a time for disaster relief or humanitarian aid \ncould disrupt a military that has a combined force of about 2.2 million \nactive and reserve personnel.\n  The hardships suffered by our men and women in uniform are painfully \nreal and should not be understated. I salute the sacrifices our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are making everyday to defend \nour national security. Many of these hardships have arisen because the \nworld has changed drastically and so has our military.\n  Our military has changed from a post-World War II forward-based force \nto much more of a projection force. When we talk about deployments \ngoing up, we are talking about times when we send our forces away from \ntheir home bases and their families. After World War II, we had a half \nmillion troops stationed in Europe, but with their families, if they \nhad families. Those troops were not considered ``deployed,'' because \nthey were based there. So when people talk about a massive increase in \ndeployments, they are generally not counting those who are stationed in \noverseas bases.\n  That is how having 10,500 soldiers in the Balkans today can be \nconsidered and counted as a major deployment, but stationing a half \nmillion troops in Europe from the end of World War II through the 1980s \nis not even counted as a deployment by classic definition.\n  Our military has also changed drastically. It used to be a force of \nmainly single, young men. Today, our forces are filled with married men \nand women, many of whom also have children. So deploying them on \nrepeated missions overseas, along with frequent job changes, as well as \nbeing over-worked at their home bases, creates serious hardships for \nfamily life.\n  I submit today that many of the problems encountered by our men and \nwomen in uniform are related to the ways our military is organized and \nmanaged, based on the assumptions developed following our experience in \nWorld War II. I recommend to my colleagues an excellent, thoughtful \npaper, entitled ``It's The Personnel System,'' by John C. F. Tillson of \nthe Institute for Defense Analysis. His paper explores the personnel \nand organizational assumptions that underlie the military, as well as \nthe intersection of deployment tempo, personnel, or job-changing tempo, \nand operating tempo at home bases.\n\n  These are complex problems that require serious thought. I think it \nis very sad that these issues would be reduced to a conclusion that the \nUnited States must pull out of our leadership role in the world instead \nof addressing those problems head-on.\n  What are those unending missions that the Clinton Administration has \ngotten us into? Most of them were inherited from the Bush \nadministration or Ronald Reagan's administration, or even earlier ones.\n  Of the 100,000 troops currently deployed long-term away from home, \nonly 10,500 or a little over 10 percent are deployed by the Clinton \nAdministration--to the Balkans. The rest of the major long-term \ndeployments were inherited, including deployments in Japan, the Korean \npeninsula, the Persian Gulf, and Navy deployments in the Western \nPacific and the Mediterranean, as well as the mission that went wrong \nin Somalia. The only other major mission that the Clinton \nAdministration took on that it did not inherit was to Haiti; and \ncontrary to what Governor Bush said during the second Presidential \ndebate, that mission is over.\n  I have seen many figures bandied about claiming that the Clinton \nAdministration has used force at a much greater pace than Presidents \nBush and Reagan before him. Where do these claims come from?\n  For example, an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on October 18th by \nMackubin Thomas Owens from the Naval War College and the Lexington \nInstitute, says that:\n\n       Deployments have increased three-fold during the Clinton \n     years.\n\n  He further stated:\n\n       These deployments have included some combat missions, but \n     have consisted primarily of open-ended peacekeeping and \n     humanitarian operations--48 missions, to be precise, from \n     1992 to 1999.\n\n  Apparently, a 1999 Congressional Research Service report, Instances \nof Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798--1999, was used to \nsubstantiate these claims. Specifically, the CRS report shows that \nduring the Reagan and Bush administrations there were 17 and 16 uses of \nforce overseas respectively. This compares to 49 uses of force overseas \nduring the first 7 years of the Clinton administration.\n  Unfortunately, reading the CRS report this way is a gross \nmisrepresentation of the facts and an absurd misuse of the CRS report, \nwhich was intended\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\nonly to be a compendium or rough survey of the range of uses of force. \nCRS and its fine analysts should not be blamed for the poor analysis of \nothers who used the report as a source.\n  For instances of use of force in recent years, the CRS report is just \na list of times when the President and Defense Secretary reported to \nCongress consistent with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, and the report \nnotes that the instances of use of force listed vary greatly in size \nand significance. The degree to which each President reports to and \nconsults with Congress on war powers matters varies greatly. The \nClinton Administration has reported to Congress diligently. To simply \nadd up each instance without reading and analyzing them inevitably \nleads to a gross misinterpretation of the facts and to conclusions that \ncannot survive serious scrutiny.\n\n  Let me provide that scrutiny using CRS' numbers.\n  Of the 49 instances of use of force cited in the CRS report, 14 were \neither evacuations of U.S. citizens from Third World countries or minor \nincreases in security at U.S. embassies. This is hardly the troop \ndeployment depicted by the critics of the Clinton administration. \nMoreover, 24 other uses of force were merely continuing operations or \nsimply status reports about continuing operations, 5 of those separate \nentries for status reports on peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.\n  There are 7 separate citations regarding air attacks on Iraqi ground \ntargets after the gulf war.\n  The analysis suggests the numbers have been misused. Frankly, it \nraises a question of whether or not the military has been used \neffectively over the past 8 years. I certainly think it has.\n  There were 4 entries regarding the deployment of troops in Haiti--3 \nof which were reporting on the number of troops coming home! But those \n``counted'' as uses of force by the Clinton Administration. So did \nreductions in US forces from Bosnia.\n  The largest deployment under President Clinton--some 30,000 troops to \nBosnia for peacekeeping missions--is dwarfed by the 600,000+ troops \nsent to the Persian Gulf during Desert Shield/Storm under President \nBush, yet the deployment to Bosnia counts for 15 entries in the CRS \nreport, and the entire Gulf War, only one. The invasion of Grenada with \n8,800 US troops has but a single entry.\n  The entries for the Clinton years included many instances of rescuing \nAmerican citizens or humanitarian aid. Yet there were very few such \ninstances for the Reagan-Bush years. It seems unlikely that hardly any \nU.S. citizens needed rescuing during those years, so I suspect such \nentries are simply missing.\n  How do we make sense of these numbers?\n  If we sort out all the multiple entries for the same deployment, as \nwell as the minor deployments for embassy security and evacuations, it \nbecomes clear that the number of distinct uses of force by the Clinton \nAdministration is not that different from the Bush or Reagan years.\n  Deconstructing the CRS instances of use of force to include only \ndistinct uses of force, we find that: over 8 years, there were 16 \ndistinct uses of force by President Reagan, the major one the invasion \nof Grenada; 13 uses of force over the 4 years of the Bush \nAdministration, the major ones being Panama, the Persian Gulf, and \nSomalia; and 13 uses of force for 7 years of the Clinton \nAdministration, the major ones being Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  The misuse of the CRS report was an egregious distortion of the \nClinton Administration's record. To set the record straight, I asked \nthe Defense Department what its numbers show.\n  First, I should note that there is no uniform method for counting \ndeployments at the Defense Department; some count training and \nexercises as deployments, and some count domestic missions, like \nfighting the fires in the West or helping with Hurricane Andrew clean-\nup.\n\n  In March 1999, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sent a report to \nCongress entitled, ``U.S. Military Involvement in Major Smaller-Scale \nContingencies Since the Persian Gulf War.'' In that report, Secretary \nCohen notes that:\n\n       . . . since the end of the Persian Gulf War in February \n     1991, U.S. military forces have conducted or participated in \n     approximately 50 named, overseas SSCs [small-scale \n     contingencies] involving the deployment of 500 or more \n     military personnel at any one time. This includes three \n     crisis response/show of force operations, three limited \n     strike operations, ten noncombatant evacuation operations, \n     four no-fly zone enforcement operations, three maritime \n     sanctions enforcement operations, six migrant operations, ten \n     peace operations, ten humanitarian assistance operations, and \n     one operation to provide emergency overseas assistance to \n     other U.S. government agencies.\n\n  I asked the Defense Department for more detail, so DoD also sent me \nsupporting data for the Secretary's report, showing 60 contingencies \nfrom 1980-1999--26 from 1980-1992, the Reagan-Bush years, and 34 during \nthe Clinton Administration. Instead of 50 since February 1991 mentioned \nin the Secretary's report, it lists 44 contingencies since then.\n  The 34 contingencies during the Clinton Administration are those \nmissions that have a ``name,'' like ``Avid Response'' or ``Sustain \nHope.'' The sources of this information are the reports to Congress \nconsistent with the War Powers Resolution, just like the CRS report. \nHowever, the data doesn't suffer from repetition, since it only uses \nnamed missions, so multiple reports were consolidated. These \ncontingencies also include many instances of rescuing Americans or \nhumanitarian aid missions.\n  However, almost all the data from 1980-1991 uses that same CRS \nreport, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-\n1999, as its source, which may suffer from undercounting smaller \ndeployments for that time period. I would like to ask the Defense \nDepartment today to look at its own internal data for the period on \nwhich it relied on the CRS report.\n  I also asked the Army to provide me with deployment data, which I \nwould like to submit for the Record. The Army lists 38 deployments \nsince 1989, including humanitarian assistance, noncombatant \nevacuations, and domestic disaster relief in Florida, Hawaii, \nCalifornia, Midwest floods, and Western fire-fighting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled \n``Major Overseas Smaller-Scale Contingency Operations'' and another \nentitled ``Operational Deployments'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           MAJOR OVERSEAS SMALLER-SCALE CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS\n [Involving the deployment of 500 or more U.S. Armed Forces personnel--\n                        March 1991-February 1999]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Location                   Operation             Dates\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      CRISIS RESPONSE/SHOW OF FORCE\n \nKuwait..........................

Active duty \n     soldiers deployed to Montana and Idaho to assist with and \n     support firefighting efforts.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. As a point of comparison, the Institute for Defense \nAnalysis (IDA), under contract from the Defense Department, completed a \nstudy in February 1998 entitled, Frequency and Number of Military \nOperations. Contained within the study are a number of databases \ndetailing the deployment of U.S. forces overseas. One data set from an \nearlier IDA study covering U.S. military overseas deployments from \n1983-1994 showed that President Reagan averaged 9 deployments per year, \nPresident Bush averaged 9.5 deployments per year, while Clinton \naveraged 5.5 deployments per year.\n  Another data set from Defense Forecasts, Inc. listed U.S. Air Force \ndeployments from 1983-1996. It showed the following number of average \nannual Air Force deployments: 19 per year under President Reagan, 37 \nper year under President Bush, and 27 per year under President Clinton.\n  For all those critics of the pace of the use of military force under \nPresident Clinton, I would like to ask, which missions of those in the \nlists I have submitted for the Record should this country not have \ndone? Governor Bush mentioned only one in the second Presidential \ndebate--the mission to Haiti.\n  Of the missions listed in the table from the Defense Secretary's \nreport, which should we have skipped? Should we have said no to the 9 \nmissions evacuating noncombatants and Americans in trouble? Should the \nUnited States have said ``sorry we can't help'' to those in the 9 \nhumanitarian assistance missions? Should the military have been \nprevented from helping stem the flow on illegal immigrants or not \nhelped give safe haven to the Kurds, as in the 6 missions listed under \n``migrant operations''? How about enforcing the no-fly zone and the \nsanctions against Iraq, or perhaps the shows of force and limited \nstrikes to keep Iraq in check?\n  Looking at the Army's list, perhaps critics would like to show where \nthe Army was over-reaching? Was it when it helped the residents of my \nstate of Illinois and of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota during the \nmassive flooding in 1993? Maybe we shouldn't have asked soldiers to \nhelp put out the fires all over the West last August? Maybe we \nshouldn't have helped the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America \nin\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\n1998, or perhaps we should have turned down the humanitarian mission to \nthe survivors of the Rwandan genocide in 1994? Some say we shouldn't \nhave even tried to restore democracy in Haiti.\n  When I read these lists, it makes me proud of what our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines have done for our country and for the \nworld, at great cost to themselves and their family lives.\n  Clearly there is a national consensus that we have been over-working \nour troops and we need to look deeply into what assumptions and \nmanagement systems we need to change to fix these problems--rather than \ndecide that we must pull back from the world and from the vital \nnational security missions those men and women have been so ably \nundertaking.\n  But where on these lists are those ``vague, aimless and endless \ndeployments'' that Governor Bush referred to? Which ``uncertain \nmissions'' would he ``replace with well-defined objectives''?\n  There's only one major long-term peacekeeping mission on those lists, \nand that's the U.S. mission to the Balkans--the only major deployment \nstill in place that President Clinton did not inherit from Governor \nBush's father.\n\n  Governor Bush has called for a U.S. withdrawal from the Balkans and \nfor a ``new division of labor'' between the United States and its NATO \nallies--this at a time when the U.S. strategy is bearing fruit with the \nfall of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and when United \nStates forces make up less than 15 percent of the troops on the ground \nin the Balkans.\n  Bush's intent to reduce the United States' role in Europe and NATO \nhas been greeted with alarm and dismay across Europe.\n  Following two world wars, history has shown us the importance of the \nU.S. role in keeping peace and promoting stability in Europe; of \nstopping racist, ultra-nationalist dictators. After the United States \nand Europe alike spent years wringing its hands about the \nultranationalist policies that ripped Yugoslavia to shreds, the United \nStates led to step in and stop the ethnic cleansing. Was that the wrong \npolicy? Should we have just watched while Southeastern Europe went to \npieces? It was painful and messy, and it took time, but I think we did \nthe right thing. The new leaders in Croatia, and now, I hope, in \nSerbia, are ready for a new, democratic path.\n  Our experience with the Kosovo campaign showed just how important \nAmerican leadership and American defense capability is to the NATO \nalliance. Europe has said it's ready to do more to beef up its defense \nand peacekeeping capabilities, but it's a long way from being able to \nundertake a Kosovo-like campaign without the United States. That \nreality became painfully clear to European leaders during the Kosovo \ncampaign, and they have determined to do something about it.\n  Just a few years ago, I was proud to vote in the United States Senate \nto enlarge NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. \nThis enlargement was to help integrate the states that had thrown off \nthe yoke of the Warsaw Pact into Western European institutions. It \nhelped to cement democracy and give those countries a stake in the \ndefense of Europe. I want to see more East European countries join \nNATO, particularly the long-suffering Baltic countries of Lithuania, \nLatvia, and Estonia. I am afraid that will not happen if the United \nStates pulls back from its commitment to NATO.\n  After the United States led Europe and NATO to stop the Yugoslavian \nwars, are we to pull back? After the United States led NATO to expand \nthe fold of democratic, market-oriented states committed to Europe's \ndefense, are we to leave?\n  I believe the answer to those questions is a resounding no.\n  It is time to address the hardships of those in the military as the \nmanagement issues that they are and stop claiming that the United \nStates can no longer handle vital national security missions like our \ninvolvement in the Balkans because of those hardships.\n  Let's stop hiding behind the many differing deployment statistics and \ndebate policy. This Administration has kept our commitment to NATO and \nto Europe, while it has continued to contain Saddam Hussein, and \nprotected our vital interests in protecting Japan, South Korea, and the \nTaiwan Strait. Those aren't ``vague, aimless, or uncertain'' missions. \nThese missions are at the heart of our national security and our \nleadership role in the world today.\n  I close by pointing to one particular thing that has come up in the \nlast 2 weeks in the Presidential campaign. For months, Governor Bush's \nsenior foreign policy advisers have been complaining that the U.S. \nmilitary is overextended and engaged in too many peacekeeping \noperations. It is this last deployment in the Balkans that has drawn \nGovernor Bush's ire, even though the 10,000 troops represent, as I said \nearlier, less than 1 percent of the U.S. military.\n  Recently, Governor Bush's foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, \ncalled for withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Balkans as a ``new \ndivision of labor'' under which the United States would ``handle a \nshowdown in the Gulf, mount the kind of force needed to protect Saudi \nArabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan Strait,'' while Europe would be \nasked to do peacekeeping on its own.\n  I have always been in favor of burden sharing, and I believe the \nEuropeans and every other group across the world who need our \nassistance should not only pay for that and defer the costs to American \ntaxpayers but put the lives of their young men and women on the line.\n  I believe it is naive of Governor Bush to suggest that America's \ncommitment to NATO is just a statistical commitment. America's \ncommitment to NATO makes it work, and the suggestion that Governor \nBush, if he had the chance, would diminish the American role in NATO, \nhas raised concerns all across Europe because for over 60 years now, \nNATO has been a source of stability and pride and defense for our \nEuropean allies.\n  The U.S. involvement is much more than just bringing men and women to \nthe field. It is a symbol of the force and commitment of the United \nStates. I am proud of the fact, as I stand here, that in modern times \nthe United States has never engaged in these military conflicts hoping \nto gain territory or treasure. We are there for what we consider the \nright reasons: to protect democratic values, to provide opportunity for \nthe growth of business opportunities, and free trade. That has \nbasically been the bedrock of our policy in NATO for many years and \nwill continue to be. I hope we can continue to make that commitment in \nyears to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 3 additional minutes under the time allotted on \nthe Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I close this segment by saying if we are \ngoing to maintain the superiority of the United States in the world, we \nmust maintain a military force second to none, and that is a fact. For \nthose who suggest we have somehow diminished our power, I suggest to \nthem: Which military would you take in place of the United States? It \nis not just our technological advantage--that is amazing--what is \namazing is the commitment of the men and women in this military to this \ncountry and to the defense of our values. I am proud of the fact that \nas a Member of Congress, in the House and the Senate, I have been able \nto support this buildup of military strength, which has meant we have \nconquered communism, we have allowed countries to see their freedom for \nthe first time in decades, and we have built alliances, like NATO, into \nthe envy of the world.\n  For those who suggest the American military is somehow understaffed, \novermanned, underutilized, overutilized--whatever the criticism may \nbe--I do not think that is a fact. I also think those who want to \nrewrite the history of the last 50 or 60 years and try to define a new \nrole for NATO are causing undue concern among our allies in Europe. \nNATO is important. I know this because of my own experience dealing \nwith the Baltics.\n  My mother was born in Lithuania. I followed the arrival of democracy \nin Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. I know they are concerned about \ntheir future and security. They are counting on NATO. They are praying \nfor the day when they can become part of it.\n\n  When Governor Bush suggests we are somehow going to diminish \nAmerica's\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\nrole in NATO, it raises serious questions not only in the United States \nbut around the world. It goes back to the point I made earlier: If \nbeing the President of the United States and Commander in Chief of our \nforces was an easy job then many people could fill it. If it is a tough \njob demanding experience and good solid judgment, then I think the \nAmerican people should best look to someone involved in that. Vice \nPresident Gore has tried to stand not only for the strength of NATO in \nthe past but in the future. I believe as leader, if he is elected on \nNovember 7, he will continue in that proud tradition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11358-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11358-S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDUCATION BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have now served on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Subcommittee. I have been on that committee 15 years. Each \nyear when we pass the budget for education and health, there are always \ntough negotiations, but we always manage to get through it and we get \nit to the President and move ahead.\n  This year we had some long and tough negotiations on our bill. The \nfirst part of the year, the majority leader of the Senate said \neducation was going to be their priority. Yet here we are at the end of \nthe year--actually at the beginning of the new fiscal year; we are a \nmonth into the new fiscal year--and we still do not have our education \nbudget through yet. It is going to be the last bill through.\n  We have been working very hard over the last several weeks to bring \nthis bill to its final conclusion. First of all, the chairman of our \nappropriations subcommittee, Senator Specter, worked very hard this \nyear to get it through our committee and to get it through the Senate. \nThen we went to conference, and we have been locked in conference now \nfor the better part of 3 months, most of it over the last month working \nout these differences, as we do on bills.\n  Last night, Sunday night, we met for what was supposed to be our \nfinal negotiating process on the education budget. We started meeting \nlast night after our vote in the Senate, so that must have been around \n8 or 9 p.m. We met until almost 2 a.m. There were tough negotiations. \nSenator Stevens, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nCongressman Bill Young from Florida on the House side, Congressman \nPorter, Congressman Obey, the ranking Democrat on the House \nAppropriations Committee and on the subcommittee that deals with \neducation, and I and, of course, the Director of OMB, Mr. Lew, was \nthere also.\n  As I said, we had tough negotiations, but we had it down to about \nfour or five issues, finally, and we hammered them out.\n  Finally, at about 1:30 a.m. this morning, we reached our agreement. \nAs is usually true of any agreement or compromise, there are things in \nthe compromise that I do not like. I am sure there were things in there \nSenator Stevens does not like. There are items in there that \nCongressman Porter, a Republican from the House, and Congressman Obey \ndo not like. Together we decided this was the best package we could do, \nand we all shook hands on it.\n  Today, thinking we had finally reached an agreement on this important \neducation bill, I find out that Majority Whip DeLay has turned his \nthumbs down on it, and so did Majority Leader Armey turn his thumbs \ndown on it. Evidently, Speaker Hastert has said the same thing.\n\n  What are we doing here? Why do we even have committees? Why don't we \njust let Speaker Hastert and Congressman DeLay and Congressman Armey \ndeal with everything?\n  The reason we have the committees is because people such as Senator \nStevens know these issues. He has been working on these issues for \nyears. And Congressman Porter and Congressman Young and Congressman \nObey and Senator Specter and myself, we know these issues. We know the \nins and outs of these issues. We have been working on them a long time.\n  I am not on the Commerce-State-Justice Committee, so I could not \nnegotiate on that because I do not know all the ins and outs of it, and \nneither does Congressman DeLay or Congressman Armey or Congressman \nHastert know that. Yet they turned thumbs down on this deal we struck \nlast night.\n  Senator Stevens worked long and hard to reach this agreement. I am \nsure he was not happy with everything that was in it, just as I was \nnot. But Senator Stevens dealt in good faith. We gave our word. We \nshook hands on it. So did Congressman Bill Young. I have worked with \nCongressman Young for 15 years--and Congressman Porter and Congressman \nObey. We reached our agreements. We walked out of the room at 1:30 a.m. \nAnd today, Congressman DeLay and Congressman Armey say: No.\n  I do not know. I feel very badly for Senator Stevens and the others \nwho worked very hard on this, gave their word, shook hands. We had the \nagreement.\n  What is at stake here? Is this all just an inside ball game, that it \nshouldn't bother anybody outside the beltway? Here is what is at stake.\n  In education: Pell grants, some of the largest increases ever in Pell \ngrants; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, giving money out \nto the States to help pay for the education of kids with disabilities; \nclass size reduction, hiring more schoolteachers to reduce class size; \nschool modernization so we can get money out to our schools so they can \nrepair and fix up their schools. The average age of our schools in \nAmerica is 42 years. They need to be fixed up. We had money for that.\n  In health care, medical research: All the money for NIH for medical \nresearch; all the money for our community health centers that are doing \nso much to help our uninsured people in this country with health care; \nan important cancer-screening program for breast and cervical cancer \nfor women.\n  Child care: One of the biggest increases that we have ever had for \nchild care.\n  These issues are too important to be playing politics at this late \nmoment. That is what is happening on the House side--pure politics.\n  Again, I hope this is just a temporary setback. Congressman Armey, \nCongressman DeLay, and Speaker Hastert are talking about things that \nthey do not understand. I am hopeful they will meet with Congressman \nYoung and Senator Stevens, who understand that we had an agreement. Not \neveryone liked it, but it was a good agreement. It was one that we \ncould live with, and one that I felt the President could sign.\n  So these issues are much too important for our Nation's future, for \nour kids' future, for the health of women--too important for these \nkinds of partisan games this late in the year.\n  I just want to take this time to urge our friends on the House side \nto not play games with this important education bill. We have to get \nthis money out. We are already a month into our fiscal year. Our \ncolleges, our school boards, our State departments of education need to \nknow, need to have this money out there, so we can continue to hire \nteachers and reduce class size and modernize our schools.\n\n  We need to get the money out there for breast and cervical cancer \nscreening for women all over America. What we do not need is the kind \nof interference that we have had by Congressman DeLay and Congressman \nArmey and Congressman Hastert on the House side.\n  Now is the time to pull together, as we did last night. This was a \ntrue bipartisan effort. Republicans in the House, Democrats in the \nHouse, Republicans in the Senate, and Democrats in the Senate worked \ntogether and we got an agreement. That is the way this place should \nwork. Senator Stevens led it on the Senate side, Congressman Young on \nthe House side. We got our agreements. It is too bad we see this last \nminute kind of partisan bickering from the House leadership.\n  Again, I am hopeful this is a temporary setback. Let's get our \neducation bill done. Let's get it to the President so he can sign it, \nso we can move ahead with the necessary task of educating our kids in \nthis country. It is, indeed, a sad day today when we see what happened \nin education.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Louisiana\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\nthe remainder of the time, I just want to say to the Senator from Iowa, \nwho is the subcommittee ranking Democrat, who has done such a \nremarkable job, I could sense from your voice in your presentation you \nwere up most of the night working on this. It is not just last night \nthat you worked on it; you have worked on this bill for months----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Months.\n  Mr. REID. And months and months. It is a great bill. It does so much \nfor the American people. And there are no accolades here for you today, \nas there should be, because you have done such a remarkably good job of \nnot only working that bill but making sure that the people in this \nSenate and the people around the country understand those people who \nhave no voice.\n  This subcommittee, of which you are the ranking member, is a \nsubcommittee that does not have a lot of lobbyists working for the \nunderprivileged. There are a lot of people working against them. We \ndepend on you. We, on this side of the aisle, depend on you. And you \nare very dependable. I personally appreciate, as we all do over here, \nthe great work you have done.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his very kind \nremarks. I would just say to him, also, that, quite frankly, we had \ngreat cooperation from Senator Stevens on the Republican side in \ngetting this bill through. He worked very hard on it, too. I just want \nto make that point because it is just a darn shame that in these last \nhours we have gotten thrown into this partisan thing on the House side \nby the House leadership.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe good Senator from Iowa and acknowledge his great work in the area \nof education. As he has pointed out--and the Senator from Illinois \nearlier this evening, and our leader from Nevada--we believe in \nbipartisanship. We believe in working together. But we do believe there \nare certain principles worth fighting for: The principle of fairness, \nthe principle of equality, the principle that if we are going to help \npeople, then let's try to help everyone, not just those in the upper-\nincome levels.\n  In my State--I represent Louisiana--it is very important that we try \nto spread some of these tax benefits, health benefits, and education \nbenefits to households that earn under $75,000. That is not to say that \npeople above those income levels do not also need help. I am not saying \nthat household incomes of $75,000 and greater or ``wealthy'' or \n``rich'' or ``well off'' or those who ``don't have difficulties'' don't \nalso need help.\n  But it is important, when we do tax cuts, to try to do it as much as \nwe can for people at all income levels. That is why I am here today to \nnote one provision in the underlying bill in relation to savings and \npensions and 401(k)s and IRAs--a wonderful tool for people to save, if \nit could be designed properly and the rules drafted correctly.\n  I rise today, however, to note a hard-to-miss opportunity for this \nCongress to make real tax cuts for America's working families. It is \nhard to miss, but it looks as if we missed it because the tax bill \nbefore us does not target help to middle-class families or give them \nadditional savings tools.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain.\n  Throughout this year, many of us have advocated meaningful, \nresponsible, and targeted tax cuts. I had hoped we would come up with a \ntax reduction bill which distributed benefits equally among all income \ngroups, recognizing that some families have had more help through our \nTax Code than others. But all families, whether they are at $10,000, \n$20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $75,000, or $100,000, should be helped \nfairly. This bill fails to do that. We have before us a bill that fails \nto even meet this simple test of common sense.\n\n  I had hoped this Congress would produce tax cuts designed to \nencourage family savings, not just additional consumption because while \nincomes have risen dramatically over the past several years, savings \nrates have actually declined. Savings should be made more attractive \nfor all Americans, not just those who are already saving but those who \nneed help or incentives to save. It not only helps them and their \nfamilies but strengthens our whole economy.\n  While the net worth of a typical American family has increased \nrecently, the net worth of families under $25,000 has declined. \nAccording to the most recent numbers from the Commerce Department, the \nnational savings rate in August of 2000 dropped to a negative 4 \npercent, meaning people are spending more than they save. This is a \ndramatic drop from the mid-1970s, when Americans saved about 10 percent \nof their income, or even the 1980s, when it fluctuated between 5 and 7 \npercent. I think we should do something about that.\n  The bill before us, which expands IRAs and 401(k)s, doesn't hit the \nbull's-eye. It doesn't hit the target. It is helping families that are \nalready saving to potentially save more--I argue it doesn't really \naccomplish that--and it doesn't help those families trying to get into \nthe savings habit.\n  I introduced a bill earlier that is called SAVE, Savings Accounts are \nValuable for Everyone, which is to help middle- and moderate-income \nfamilies build assets for themselves through IDAs, while also expanding \nIRA contributions.\n  The Senator from Louisiana, Russell Long, former chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, once said: The problem with capitalism is \nthere aren't enough capitalists. I agree with him.\n  If we created and expanded IDAs, individual development accounts, and \nIRAs, and 401(k)s in the right way, we could, in fact, create more \ncapitalists, create more pools of capital, help people to build assets \nand strengthen the economy for everyone. We need to expand economic \nopportunities for more families, not just help those already on the \nright track.\n  According to another study, nearly one-third of all U.S. households \nhold traditional IRAs. The average income of these families is $62,500. \nAverage assets are about $200,000. Just 10 percent hold Roth IRAs. That \nmeans 43 percent of households have chosen to use individual retirement \naccounts. But this is the point: Only 4 percent of those households \nsave at the maximum rate. So by doubling an IRA from $2,000 to $5,000 \nor from $2,500 to $5,000, one has to question are we trying to help the \ntop 4 percent who are saving at the maximum rate? Couldn't we spread \nthat money out in a better way to encourage more people to save?\n  I know I only have a minute or two remaining. Let me address one \nother point.\n  I support a 401(k) savings plan. I think it is very effective. Many \nemployers are moving to that in addition to or in lieu of their \ntraditional pension plans. But why increase the limit of 401(k)s when \nthe idea would be to try to use our money to entice more employers and \nmore workers to use the 401(k) model?\n  This tax bill does nothing to help low- and moderate-income families \nsave for the future.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This tax bill does nothing to help low- and moderate-\nincome families save for their future. That is where IDAs would come \nin. If we took the opportunity to institute a new savings vehicle \ncalled IDAs, expanded IRAs in the right way, and gave additional \nbenefits for 401(k)s, we could use our money more wisely, spread it out \namong many more families in America.\n  My message is, there is a better way to do it. I hope when this bill \nis vetoed by the President, there will be ample consideration to make \nthese modifications. It would not cost more--as this chart shows, $58 \nbillion to $44 billion. It would only require common sense, compassion, \nand the will to do so.\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the end of this session of the 106th \nCongress Brian Benczkowski will be leaving my staff. Brian has worked \non the Hill since his third year in law school. He started as an intern \nwhile still in law school, served as the senior analyst for judiciary \nissues for the Senate Budget Committee, and worked closely with my \ngeneral counsel to develop, and enact, over the President's veto, the \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  Brian was my counsel for the second round of Whitewater hearings and \nwas part of the team for the historic impeachment trial of President \nClinton. Brian worked on Juvenile Justice legislation and helped me \ntake on the Mexican drug lords.\n  He learned the highway, airport and other infrastructure needs of New \nMexico as well as any Highway and Transportation Secretary in any \nGovernor's cabinet. He was knowledgeable on immigration issues and \nhelped my caseworkers with the really tough, but worthy immigration \nproblems that are a daily fact of life in a border state. Just to prove \nthat Brian had a soft side, he was my staff person for Character Counts \nduring the 106th Congress.\n  Brian was instrumental in drafting the claims process legislation for \nthe victims of the Cerro Grande fire. From the date that the fire first \nstarted to the day that the President signed the bill, complete with \nthe $640 million to pay the claims, was fifty days. It is a good \nlegislative product, and it proved that the delegation and the Congress \ncould be bipartisan and act expeditiously in an emergency.\n  Brian is a talented lawyer, a caring and hard working member of my \nstaff.\n  For a young man raised in Virginia, taught the law in Missouri with \nparents now living in Connecticut, he has made many New Mexico friends, \ndeveloped a taste for green chile and amassed an understanding of the \nborder. At one point I remarked that his Spanish was as good as any \nother staff member in my office.\n  So what is it that such a talented young man would choose to do when \nleaving Capitol Hill?\n  Banking legislative assistants and counsels with backgrounds in \nsecurities often end up at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission or at one of the Wall Street \nfirms. However, the typical career path wouldn't do for this \nuntypically talented young lawyer. He is going to New York to work for \nthe first, real sports stock market!\n  This new sports stock market will list the baseball and other trading \ncards of today's marquee athletes and major league sports rising stars. \nJust like any major stock exchange, the exchange is a market maker. \nJust like E-trade or Ameritrade people will have sports brokerage \naccounts.\n  Brian is a baseball fan, former baseball player and a font of \nknowledge when it comes to sports. As a former minor league baseball \nplayer myself, I know baseball and am a fan of most other sports. ESPN \nwas a great invention that adds to most men's enjoyment of life, sports \nand the pursuit of happiness. Hopefully, this new sports stock exchange \nwill add another dimension to the way we all follow sports.\n  Many of us share a passion for sports, but very few of us get to take \nthat passion, and merge it with the law, get a impressive title like \nAssistant General Counsel, receive a pay check and stock options. \nHowever, Brian is going to do just that at thePit.com. I wish him and \nhis new company every success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11360-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11360-S11365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I open by saying if I have heard it once \nin the last 2 months, I have heard it 40 times as the other side of the \naisle tries to convince us and the American people that what really has \nmade the American economy so strong, with its 22 million new jobs, is \nthe fact that they voted on a tax increase bill in the year 1993 that \namounted to $247 billion over 5 years, and it is called the Clinton-\nGore plan, in quotation marks; sometimes referred to on the floor as \n``the plan.''\n  Before we are through this evening, we hope we can convince our \ncolleagues that that plan had very little to do with the state of \neconomic well-being, jobs, and confidence of the American people today.\n  However, there are several subjects I want to touch on quickly, \nbecause the other side cannot come to the floor for 15, 20, or 30 \nminutes without talking about them. The first one is what the plan of \nthe Governor of Texas on Social Security is going to do to our senior \ncitizens. They proceed as if they know, and they don't know.\n  The distinguished Governor from Texas has given us an idea. The idea \nis to let every senior who is on Social Security keep their check and \nthe program remain totally intact while we let younger Americans invest \na little piece of their Social Security money in a preferred or \nprotected account in the stock market.\n  They come down here and do some arithmetic gymnastics, which is hard \nfor any one to understand. They support their statements by citing the \nSecretary of the Treasury, a genius I believe they called him. We all \nknow Secretary Summers. We all know he is rather bright. We all know he \nwas a very young Harvard Ph.D. faculty member. But for him to take to \nthe streets telling Americans he knows what that Bush plan is going to \ndo to senior citizens is absolutely deplorable. I have seen Secretaries \nof the Treasury come and go. We had a great one before this one. Never \nhave I seen anybody attempt to do this.\n  I want to tell the American people the truth about the Vice \nPresident's plan on Social Security. I would almost say there is no \nplan because, in fact, the plan he is talking about is accepted by so \nfew in the Congress, despite the fact that it has been around since \n1999, in case anybody is interested.\n  You know, we voted on it a couple times in the Budget Committee. I \nthink perhaps that there was one time when a Democrat voted for it--one \nmember. I think we might have forced a vote on the floor that included \nthat and nobody voted for it.\n  So what is the Vice President's plan? I will tell you plain and \nsimple. He wants to put some new IOUs in the trust account for senior \ncitizens, and the IOU says we, the American people, promise to pay to \nthe trust fund the face value of these IOUs. He says let's put about \n$10 billion worth in there. Guess what happens. He puts them in there a \nfew years from now and indicates that that helps make Social Security \nsolvent.\n  So that the American people might understand an IOU in the parlance \nof your checkbook, it is a postdated check. Have you ever postdated a \ncheck? It used to be illegal. It may still be if you do it with the \nintent to cheat. But some people postdate a check and say, I won't have \nthe money for 2 months, so will you take my check and it will be good \nthen. That is what an IOU is--except the Congressional Budget Office \nsays 50 years from now, when the IOUs all come due, the total amount \nthat the taxpayers of America will owe to that fund will be $40 \ntrillion--not billion but trillion, $40 trillion.\n  Who will owe it? Well, of course, the Vice President is not worried \nabout that today; right? It is our children who are going to pay it, I \nsay to the occupant of the chair. Some day down the line, we are going \nto have to raise taxes generally or raise the Social Security \nwithholding tax so high that it probably will make the program \ninoperative and ineffective.\n  It is amazing that the Secretary of the Treasury and the people on \nthat side of the aisle--my friends, the Democrats of the Senate--would \ntalk about the plan of the Governor of\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\nTexas when their candidate has a plan before us that would eventually \nrequire that we raise taxes--and I left out an option--or dramatically \ncut programs. They would have to cut American programs to the tune of \n$40 trillion over this period, or raise new taxes.\n  Now you would think if you had a plan that was that embarrassing, you \nwould not have the courage to get up and critique other programs that \nactually do try to reform Social Security. Democratic Senator Pat \nMoynihan and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have both stressed the need \nto reform Social Security, which is just what Governor Bush is trying \nto do.\n  Now my Democratic colleagues also have another line of argument. They \nsay that what we really should do is pay down the debt. They then say, \nwhy are Republicans against that? Well, they know we aren't. We have \nalready paid down $360 billion of debt over the last three years. The \ngreatest threat to debt reduction is the Vice President of the United \nStates' spending proposals. He has asked for 200 new programs and has a \ncomplicated tax code proposal. Let me address this latter point \nbriefly. My Democratic colleagues have attacked Governor Bush's tax \nplan tonight, however, it is based on the very sound principle that \neverybody who pays income tax should get a break. That's not the case \nunder the Gore plan, where 50 million American taxpayers get no break \nat all. Why? Because taxpaying Americans don't get a tax break. It is \nAmericans who are selected by the Vice President's plan. If you meet \ntheir criterion--if you're the ``right'' kind of person--you get a tax \nbreak. But that doesn't mean everybody paying income taxes gets a tax \nbreak.\n  Now let's get back to the size of the Government that Vice President \nGore would fund. Let me give you an example of the charades he plays in \norder to say he is not spending very much money. See, I have estimated \nthe plan, and it spends a lot of money. I ask Senator Gramm if he knows \nthat the Vice President's Retirement Savings Plus (RSP) plan, the one \nthat is going to help low income Americans save money, which he talks \nabout so much--i.e. if someone saves $500, the government will match \nthis contribution 3:1, thus giving this person an additional $1500 of \ntaxpayer money for deposit to their savings account--do you know when \nthat plan would be fully implemented under his proposal? Nine years \nfrom today, assuming he wins. So the centerpiece of his ``tax'' plan \nwould not fully phase-in until after two full Presidential terms and 1 \nyear. If you assume such an unrealistic phase-in, of course, it won't \ncost very much. But neither should anybody kid themselves that his \nbudget isn't full of those timing gimmicks, in order to give the \nappearance that he does not spend the Social Security surplus.\n\n  There are all kinds of strange dates such as the RSP one. In fact, \nthis major one he speaks about being such a good plan for low-income \nAmericans to save money, I repeat, won't go fully phase-in until 9 \nyears after he is elected, if he is elected. The Vice President has not \nprovided enough information to tell when all of his 200 programs phase-\nin. But I can tell you that if you just look at the overall programs \nand add them up cumulatively in your mind, there has not been a bigger \nincrease in American programs since Lyndon Baines Johnson invented the \nGreat Society.\n  Now what actually happens under the plan of the Governor of Texas is \nvery simple. Of the surplus, he says 50 percent will be saved for \nSocial Security and debt reduction. If you want to go add that up, it \nlooks as though he would pay off the debt entirely by the middle of the \nnext decade. Frankly, if that could happen, what a marvelous thing it \nwould be. If Democrats keep pushing for more spending, we might not do \nit that fast, although I can tell you the money is there barring that. \n50 percent of the projected surpluses is for Social Security and debt \nreduction under the plan of the Governor of Texas, 25 percent is to be \ngiven back to the American people since it is their money to begin \nwith, with every taxpayer getting a tax cut of some type, and 25 \npercent goes toward new priorities, new things such as increased \ndefense or money we may need to add to the Medicare program to pay for \nprescription drugs. The ratio is 50, 25, 25.\n  The other side of the aisle likes to get up and brag about how they \nare paying down the debt. I submit to you that if you took the litany \nof Gore programs and what he wants to do in every area to increase \nthings such as prescription drugs for everyone, as he suggests, in the \nmanner he suggests, debt reduction will suffer. His new programs are \nvery costly and we expect the cost estimates to rise the more that \npeople look at them. Let's look at prescription drugs. When that \nprogram was first submitted to the Congress by President Clinton, we \nthought it would cost $120 billion. The last reference we have from the \nCongressional Budget Office says that plan would cost $430 billion.\n  So you see, there is no question that there is not going to be very \nmuch money left over if you put all those programs the Vice President \nhas in mind into effect and give them to the American people in a \nreasonable period of time. If you want to delay them incessantly, \nobviously they won't cost much; but will the American people think they \nhave been fooled if that is the case and he is to get elected? I \nbelieve they will wonder, what in the world were they talking about \nwhen they told us they were going to give us that?\n  I want to also say that when it comes to reducing the size of \nGovernment--I want to repeat one more time, our friends on the other \nside always cite the total number of reductions in employees that have \noccurred since Bill Clinton took office. What they don't tell you is \nthat 96 percent--and I just put it in the Record 2 days ago, and it \ncomes from the Office of Management and Budget, not Domenici's staff--\nOMB says 96 percent of all employee reductions, described as stripping \ndown Government, came from civilians in the Department of Defense. In \nother words, we started drawing down that Department of Defense so \nquickly and rapidly, and continued it, so 96 percent of the employee \nreduction comes from the Department of Defense, and 4 percent comes \nfrom all the other civilian programs, which they would lead you to \nbelieve have been seriously restrained and many employees have been \ntaken from their ranks. Not true.\n  I will shortly yield to my friend from Texas for about 20 minutes. \nHowever, before I do, I want to point something out. When my Democratic \ncolleagues speak of the Clinton plan for the recovery of the United \nStates, which caused America to have all these 22 million new jobs, new \nhigh technology, and breakthroughs in communications--and I say that \nfacetiously--, they ignore the fact that the first plan the President \nsent to us was a $26 billion stimulus package for American economy, \neven though the economy had already begun posting strong growth before \nhe took office. Does my friend from Texas recall that?\n  Standing right back over there was the Senator from the State of \nColorado, who is now retired. He came to the floor and told us what was \nin that $26 billion that we were supposed to spend. He found all kinds \nof things that were promised to mayors during the election and to all \nkinds of groups in America by the Governor of Arkansas as he \ncampaigned. I can't remember. Some of them were igloos, and all kinds \nof strange things--skating rinks for some communities.\n  The first thing we did was to say we aren't going to do that. The \nfirst phase of the recovery plan was a $26 billion stimulus which never \noccurred. That would have caused more money to be spent, not less.\n  To lead into what is being said on the other side of the aisle, and \nby our President and by our Vice President about this plan--the 1993 \ntax increase of $243 billion--, I would like to hearken back to Alan \nGreenspan, who coined a phrase. Perhaps my friend from Texas remembers \nit. He used two words, ``irrational exuberance.'' Do you recall that, \nSenator Gramm? Irrational exuberance?\n  I am going to borrow that phrase today--not to describe the \nspeculative activities in the stock market, as Dr. Greenspan did, but \nrather to describe my colleagues who have been attributing the 1993 \nClinton/Gore tax increase budget plan as the genesis of this long boom \nwe have been experiencing.\n  I want to talk shortly about what really caused the boom. But I \nunderstand my friend from Texas would like\n\n[[Page S11362]]\n\nto speak for 20 minutes. I yield that off my time, reserving the \nremainder for myself.\n  I want to say just before I yield that I have looked at some polls \nthat somebody presented--maybe even some polls that were published.\n  I am thrilled with the American people because you know they don't \nbelieve the irrational exuberance of the other side. They do not \nbelieve it.\n  They come down here and keep on saying it, but the American people \njust do not believe it.\n  The primary reason for this boom has been the evenhandedness of the \nFederal Reserve Board in making sure we do not let inflation go \nrampant, and controlling interest rates where they could so that the \nAmerican economy would always grow, and if it was coming down, to have \na safe landing.\n  They put that No. 1.\n  In terms of who did it, Dr. Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve \ndeserve much of the credit.\n  The American people, no matter how many times the plan is discussed \nabout the 22 million jobs and all the other things, they do not believe \nit. And they shouldn't.\n  Who do they put in second position as responsible for this? I didn't \nthink it was going to be the case because we don't do a very good job \nof talking about it. But they said the Republican Congress which puts \nsome real controls on spending.\n  When we are finished tonight, we will show you that actually happened \nwhen we took over the U.S. Congress.\n  In third place, in terms of who did it, who brought it, they put the \nPresident's plan.\n  I yield to my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank Senator \nDomenici. I want to try to add a few things to what he said, and then \ngo on and say what I was going to say.\n  I want to begin with the Secretary of Treasury, Larry Summers. Let me \nsay that we are both good friends as well as economists. We both used \nto teach economics.\n  Yet, I think a lot of people are unhappy in that the Secretary of \nTreasury injected himself into politics--something that the Secretary \nof Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense have \nnot done in the past. I think that made people unhappy.\n\n  But let me say this with regard to Al Gore's plan, a plan which \nsimply adds IOUs to the Social Security trust fund. I believe Larry \nSummers would have given an ``F'' to any freshman economics student in \nhis class who thought that you could strengthen Social Security by \nsimply printing paper--IOUs; I have a copy of one here--and putting \nthem into a filing cabinet in West Virginia.\n  Let me give a high authority on this issue, the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Our Vice President said if we would simply print more of these IOUs--\nyou notice, Senator Domenici, that they say ``nontransferable''--if we \nprinted more of these IOUs and put them in a metal filing cabinet in \nWest Virginia, which is all the Social Security trust fund is, we could \npay benefits with these IOUs.\n  But let me quote from the economic report of the President. This is \nPresident Clinton speaking. This is the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget of the \nPresident, and on page 337, here is what he says about these paper \nIOUs. He says:\n\n       These [Social Security trust fund] balances are available \n     to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund \n     expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds \n     are not set up to be pension funds, like the fund of private \n     pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets \n     that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. \n     Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, \n     will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \n     public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The \n     existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, \n     by itself, have any impact on the government's ability to pay \n     benefits.\n\n  That is Bill Clinton.\n  So Al Gore's proposal to simply print more IOUs and put them in a \nfile cabinet is deemed as phony--not by Pete Domenici, not by Phil \nGramm, not by the Republican Congress, but by the President of the \nUnited States, Bill Clinton. The President's own budget says it very \nclearly. This is a bookkeeping entry. No benefits can be paid from \nthese IOUs.\n  The Gore plan means, in essence, raising taxes.\n  Just one other point to amplify what Senator Domenici said. A picture \nis worth 1,000 words.\n  This is page D11 of the Washington Post of this past Tuesday. This is \na want-ad page. You have used want-ads yourself. So have I when looking \nfor a job.\n  These are jobs that range from pet groomers, to painters, to data \nentry, to day labor, to dispatchers, to retail sales jobs, and \neverything in between.\n  You might look at this want-ad page in Tuesday's Washington Post and \nask yourself, how many people who took these jobs would get an Al Gore \ntax cut where they could keep part of what they earned and spend it on \nwhat they chose to spend it on?\n  Here are all the jobs from pet groomer, to custodian, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n  You see all the jobs. They are the people who, if they took those \njobs and were married, could get marriage penalty tax relief from \nRepublicans.\n  I am tempted to go through and read the jobs. But I am not going to \ndenigrate good jobs in America.\n  But the point is that all of the jobs listed on page D11 in Tuesday's \nWashington Post want-ad page for jobs, for every one of those jobs, if \nyou took it, you would be to rich to get Al Gore's marriage penalty tax \nrelief.\n  This is what would be left.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is assuming that each one of those took the \njob, and they are getting paid and earning income pursuant to the job.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The question is, if married couples took these jobs, are \nthey too rich for Al Gore's tax cut? All of them are, except that \nhandful--about 89 percent of the jobs on that page are too rich.\n  Let me get to what I wanted to say.\n  Some people at home probably wonder why we are talking about the \nPresidential campaign on the floor of the Senate. I think it is a good \nquestion. We weren't doing it. Our colleagues have come out here every \nday and talked about the Presidential campaign, I guess, because they \nare losing it in America. They think they might win it on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  One of the wonderful stories that has been told is that Bill Clinton \nwas elected President, and he courageously proposed the largest tax \nincrease in American history.\n  They did everything from proposing to tax your utility bill, to \ntaxing gasoline, to taxing 75 percent of Social Security benefits if \nyou made over $25,000.\n  Courageously, the Vice President, sitting in that very chair, and \nSenator Domenici was here along with me, when it came down to a tie \nvote, the Vice President courageously broke the tie in voting to tax \ngasoline and tax Social Security benefits. And then as if the sky \nopened and God spoke, interest rates came down, the stock market went \nup, the economy prospered, and, therefore, our Vice President and the \nDemocrats deserve credit.\n  Senator Domenici, myself, and every other Republican were too \nignorant to understand that by taxing gasoline and taxing Social \nSecurity and having the largest tax increase in American history, we \ncould produce prosperity.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield, I suggest to the Senator, \nand I wonder if the Senator concurs, six Democrats voted with \nRepublicans. That is why it was 49-49.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right. They had a majority in both Houses of \nCongress when Bill Clinton became President, and when they voted they \nhad a substantial majority here, I think 54 or 55 Democrats. Six of \nthem voted with us against this largest tax increase in American \nhistory, but there was a tie and Al Gore broke the tie. It was then \nthat the sky opened, interest rates came down, the stock market \nspiraled, and prosperity ensued.\n  There are only a couple of problems with that. One, it is totally \nunbelievable. It makes absolutely no sense. Finally, it is verifiably \nfalse.\n  This is the rest of the story. This is the budget that included this \nlargest tax cut in American history. In this budget, ``A Vision of \nChange for America,'' Bill Clinton tells us on page 22 that if we raise \ntaxes with the largest tax increase in American history, and 6 years \nlater, if we implement the largest tax increase in American history, 6 \nyears later he states the deficit will be $241 billion. Nowhere in this \nbudget is\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\nBill Clinton promising to balance the Federal budget. His promise is, \nif you have the largest tax cut in American history--and then they \nforget or our Democrat colleagues want us to forget the rest of the \nstory--if you spend $26 billion on a new stimulus package, they were \ngoing to stimulate the economy. Remember they had ice skating huts in \nConnecticut, they had Alpine slides, these water slides in Puerto Rico. \nThis was their economic plan. We killed that.\n  The final part of their proposal that Senator Domenici will not have \nforgotten but our Democrat colleagues want to forget was having the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system. That was part of \nthis vision, too. But we killed it deader than Elvis. It never came \ninto reality.\n  Here is my point: we didn't adopt the Clinton plan. They raised \ntaxes, they taxed Social Security benefits, they taxed gasoline. But we \nkilled their $26 billion spending program, and we killed the Government \ntakeover of health care.\n  Now, their first budget, with the largest tax increase in American \nhistory, promised $241 billion of deficits 6 years later. Then, in \ntheir midsession review in September of 1993, they discovered we hadn't \ndone the stimulus package. So with their tax increase, we were headed \nfor a $181 billion deficit in 6 years.\n  Then, in 1995, the President proposed another budget. But in 1995, \nPresident Clinton, who now has courageously raised taxes on Social \nSecurity and gasoline and most other things, is asked, well, Mr. \nPresident, when are you going to balance the budget? Remember that, \nSenator Domenici? This is what he said: In 9 years, 10 years, 8 years, \n9 years, 7 years, 7 to 9 years, 7 years, 9 years, 10 years. In other \nwords, 2 years after his tax increase went into effect, our colleagues \nwere asking Bill Clinton when he wants to balance the budget. Two years \nafter his tax hike, he was still saying we are 9, 10, 7 years away from \never balancing the Federal budget.\n  Now, what happened in 1994? Our colleagues joshed around yesterday \nsaying when they proposed to have the Government take over the health \ncare system, when they proposed this $26 billion of stimulus package, \nand when they adopted the largest tax increase in American history, I \nsaid this is going to cost people their jobs. So they josh around \nsaying: Well, where did it cost jobs?\n\n  Let me state what happened: In 1994, 52 Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives lost their jobs. The Speaker of the House lost his job; \nthe first time in 132 years that it ever happened. Three powerful \ncommittee chairmen--Rostenkowski, Brooks, and Glickman--lost their \njobs. Not one Republican incumbent in Congress was defeated.\n  Now, supposedly the sky had opened. Everything was wonderful with \nthis tax increase. But guess what. When the new Republican Congress \ncame to Washington, this is the first thing that landed on our desk, \nand this is Bill Clinton's budget. He is still President. He sends us a \nnew budget. He says that by the end of 1999, if we will adopt his \nbudget, the deficit will be $181 billion.\n  Now, his tax increase has been the law of the land now for 2 years. \nYet he is still saying virtually $200 billion deficits as far as the \neye can see.\n  Let me make a final point that I think takes the cake. In his \nmidsession review, this is in September of 1995, we have a Republican \nCongress. Bill Clinton says: If you will forget what these Republicans \nare saying and adopt my budget, if you are willing to cut $927 billion \nof programs over the next 10 years, then we might have a surplus in 10 \nyears.\n  We didn't adopt Bill Clinton's budget. His budget said we were going \nto have a $200 billion deficit from 1994 to the year 2000. Instead, we \nadopted our own budget. We reformed welfare. Bill Clinton now says the \ngreatest achievement of his administration is welfare reform. He not \nonly had nothing to do with it, he fought it every step of the way. He \nvetoed it once, then twice, and he has tried to repeal it every day \nsince it has passed.\n  Republicans reformed welfare and it set into motion--and I have to \nsay as Democrats accused us of not knowing what was going on that I \nnever dreamed it would be as successful as it has been--a 40-percent \ndecline in welfare rolls as people have begun to work and America has \nprospered.\n  What happened under the Republican Congress? We started it at a $200 \nbillion deficit, but under the Republican Congress the deficit started \nto decline. By 1997, we balanced the budget and we have a surplus.\n  When Bill Clinton signed this heroic tax increase, and this is from \nhis official documents, he gave a statement in signing the bill.\n  How many times do you think he mentioned balancing the budget when he \nsigned that tax increase? None. How many times do you think he talked \nabout saving and reforming Social Security and Medicare? None. Those \nthings were the furthest thing from his mind.\n  If you listen to the mythology that we have been forced to listen to \nhere, the mythology runs as follows. They raised taxes, and then \ninterest rates declined and the stock market boomed--right?\n  The problem is that is wrong. If you look at their numbers, when Bill \nClinton became President, 10-year Treasury interest rates were 5.87 \npercent. He raised taxes, and what do you think happened to interest \nrates? They went up to 7.9 percent. And if you look at the chart on \ninterest, the big turning point in interest occurred in November of \n1994. Why? Because help was on the way. Help was on the way. We elected \na Republican Congress, interest rates went down, and that interest \nrate, which had risen to 7.9 percent on 10-year Treasury bonds is, \ntoday, 5.71 percent.\n  What about this booming stock market? By raising taxes on gasoline \nand Social Security and the largest tax increase in American history, \ntheir mythology is that Bill Clinton set off this boom in the stock \nmarket. There is only one problem: It ain't so. When you look at the \nDow Jones Industrial Average between 1993 and 1994, over that 2-year \nperiod when Bill Clinton's tax increase went into effect, the Dow went \nup by 13 points, about 6.5 or 7 percent a year--around there. I don't \nhave the exact day of the tax and the day Clinton became President--\njust looking at the numbers.\n  What do you think happened when we elected a Republican Congress? \nWhat happened was the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 4,493 to \n10,836, today.\n  So the problem with their story which they are trying to tell the \nAmerican people is that it is not believable, it does not make sense, \nand it is verifiably false. When they raised taxes, none of their \nbudgets showed these tax increases ever balancing the Federal budget. \nWhen they raised taxes, there was no decline in interest rates. \nInterest rates went up, not down. When they raised taxes, the stock \nmarket was relatively flat. All of that changed when we elected a \nRepublican Congress in 1994. All of that changed.\n  So basically the point I want to make--how much time have I left in \nthe 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The point I want to make is: Look, there is plenty of \ncredit to go around for the good things that have happened in America. \nI am not trying to deny the President some of the credit. I do believe \na lot of credit goes to the Federal Reserve Bank. But the idea that by \nimposing the largest tax increase in American history, by taxing \ngasoline, by taxing Social Security benefits, and that somehow this \nproduced a balanced budget and set off this economic boom is laughable \nfrom a logical point of view. It is not borne out by the facts. The \ntruth is, these good things that started happening largely started \nhappening in November of 1994.\n  It was a good story. Maybe somebody believes it, but they should not. \nIf they look at the facts, they will see that basically that story is \nnot true.\n  The final point I want to make: We are now coming to the end of this \nsession. In the waning hours of this Congress, the President is saying: \nIf you don't spend more money, I am not going to let the Congress go \nhome. If you do not further inflate an already inflated budget, I am \ngoing to veto these bills and not allow us to go home. He is saying to \nus: If you do not grant amnesty to people who violated the laws of \nAmerica by coming to the country illegally, I am going to veto the \nCommerce-Justice-State bill and\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\npotentially shut down the FBI, the DEA, the criminal justice system, \nand the courts.\n  We are at the end of the Clinton administration, not at \nthe beginning. President Clinton had his opportunity. He raised taxes. \nHe tried to implement a $26 billion stimulus package. He tried to have \nthe Government take over and run the health care business. He had his \nchance.\n\n  We ought to have this election and let people decide. Do they want to \nspend this surplus? If they do, they will know how to vote. If they do \nnot----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded the Senator from Texas has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We ought to let them vote before we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will hold up the health care plan again, \nI say to Senator Gramm, I want to make a statement about it. I made a \nmistake. If you look at the President's FY 1995 budget and health plan, \nit would have increased outlays by $1.4 trillion--I said billion. \nBillions are gone; they are not in our vocabulary. The $1.4 trillion is \nthe additional outlays that the President's budget and health plan \nwould have generated if we'd adopted his plan versus the outlays that \nthe government actually recorded over the five years covered by his \nbudget.\n  You heard Senator Gramm describe one of the most significant \nindicators of prosperity--the 30-year Treasury bond yield. Here is the \nchart that describes precisely what he spoke of. Here is 1993. You see \nshortly after that, yields drop a little bit. But then look at what \nhappens in the middle of 1993. It goes to its highest rate on this \nchart. Yields only begin to fall again after 1995 and the election of a \nRepublican Congress. After that, yields come back down on a sustained \nbasis.\n  I want to just insert a comment, since there is so much talk about us \ndoing nothing here. This is sort of extraneous, but I think it is \nterribly relevant to our discussion. This is a late-this-evening quote \nfrom the President of the United States:\n\n       Again, we have accomplished so much in this session of \n     Congress in a bipartisan fashion. It has been one of the most \n     productive sessions.\n\n  He goes on and asks for more. But for all those who have been \nlistening, again, to the ``mythology,'' to borrow one of Senator \nGramm's words, that we have not had a very productive Congress, let me \nsay the President of the United States spoke today and that is what he \nsaid.\n  Let me say to the American people, to all the investors who took \nrisks, to all of the people who invested in new technology since 1993--\nwe will just use that date--to all the millions of Americans who get up \nevery day and work hard and raise their standard of living: You know \nthat it was not ``the plan'' that caused America to achieve again and \ngrow again. Let me suggest we have had one of the most remarkable \nproductivity increases during the last five years of this recovery that \nwe have had ever in American history. We had a period right after the \nSecond World War that rivaled this in productivity.\n  Did the productivity of the investors, risk takers, American workers, \nthe banks with new technology, the new computers--did all that happen \nbecause we had a plan to raise taxes $243 billion? Of course not. Of \ncourse not. Did that $243 billion tax increase reduce inflation and \ncause it to stay down? Of course not. Productivity did, and \ninternational trade did, and the Federal Reserve Board did. That is the \nkind of thing that made America's prosperity so significant in the past \ndecade.\n  Did that tax increase reduce regulatory burden, which all American \ncompanies will tell you started falling under Ronald Reagan, and has \ncontinued up to the recent telecommunications deregulation? That was \nnot a result of the ``plan,'' that $243 billion tax increase. \nDeregulation was part of giving American business more freedom to \nachieve, expand, and to do things in the most efficient way rather than \nthe most burdensome way.\n  Did it help business become more efficient in managing its \ninventories? Of course not. The 1993 budget plan had nothing to do with \nit. Just-in-time inventory management had a lot to do with it, making \nfirms' profits go up and their efficiency increase.\n  We could go on. Did global trade, which essentially kept inflation \nunder control and opened new horizons to American business--was that \nimpacted by the $243 billion ``plan'' which we hear regularly? No. It \nis only ``irrational exuberance'' that would cause my Democratic \ncolleagues to claim that the 1993 tax hike generated today's marvelous \neconomy.\n  I am not sure that ``irrational exuberance'' is even an adequate word \nwith which to describe the day-after-day trek to the floor of the \nSenate Democrats to remind us that all good things came from that day, \nthat day when a difficult vote was taken to increase taxes \ndramatically. I think the American people understand that the 1993 \nbudget plan had little to do with where we are and where we are going \nto end up. It is because we have a free economy and we have made it \nfreer.\n  Frankly, let the people judge whether we are more apt to keep this \neconomy going if we have a tax reform measure that gives everybody some \nof their money back to spend as they see fit. I believe they will say \nthat that gives this economy a much better chance than 200 new programs \nthat the Government is going to run which we do not have today, and we \nestimate--and I think this is a modest estimate--that we could not \nadminister with less than 20,000 new employees.\n  Americans understand their prosperity does not come from the size of \nour National Government. Maybe it is inverse to the size of our \nNational Government. I believe that might be a fairer estimate of \nAmerica and the world. Maybe the smaller our National Government gets, \nthe better we will compete and that is very important in the global \neconomy.\n  I do say the President of the United States deserves credit on trade. \nHad some Democrats said that votes to further free trade were an \nimportant reason behind our strong growth, I would have agreed with \nthem on that point. Trade has been an important positive in the chain \nof things that have happened to make economic life better in these \nUnited States.\n  I have time remaining. If there are any Senators on our side who want \nto speak----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Looking at the chart, I joined this body in 1997, and \nat that time we had a very tough battle on this side to produce a \nmodest tax reduction, the $500-per-child tax credit and reduce capital \ngains from 28 to 20 percent and even lower for lower income people. \nThey told us that was going to run up the debt; we were going to have \nmore debt. Looking at that chart, interest rates appear to have gone \ndown and, in fact, our surpluses have occurred since then; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friend from Alabama, that is \nabsolutely true, and he probably heard me on the floor today. I \nmentioned enough subjects, but capital gains was also on my list \nbecause we've gotten some very unexpected returns to the Treasury from \nthis source. Clearly, the 1997 capital gains reduction--which we \naccomplished and the President signed although it wasn't high on his \nlist--has been one important factor behind this surplus that is now \ncarrying us into this better period with a lot more flexibility on what \nwe can do in the future.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Actually reducing tax rates on capital gains increased \nincome to the Government; is that fair to say?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All indications are that it did. There are several \nthings which have combined to get these tremendous new revenue \nincreases. One of them clearly is capital gains. Another is that real \nincomes have increased for all Americans in all income quintiles. They \nare paying a lot more taxes, and when you have more Americans paying \nincome taxes because they are working, obviously you collect more \nrevenue and you make Social Security more solid. All of those are \npositive things that occur when the American economy is flourishing, \nwhen it is booming, when more and more people are working.\n  Capital gains is very instrumental in that regard. I think there are \nmany in this body who think in the near future\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\nwe ought to think seriously about reducing capital gains further. In my \nopinion, it is very helpful for the stock market, government fiscal \nposition and the economy. Higher stock values--particularly in the \nNasdaq have greatly contributed to investment in new technology, \neverything from computers to telecommunications, and everything in \nbetween. This is good for the economy, since it boosts productivity and \nkeeps inflation down. The higher the productivity, even when you get \nless and less unemployment, you do not get inflation. Americans do not \nappreciate low inflation yet. Most all other things can be cured in the \nAmerican economy if you keep inflation low.\n  Does the Senator have a further observation?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have remarks which I will give if the Senator is \nfinished. I enjoyed so much hearing his analysis.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield those 5 minutes to Senator Sessions. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to follow up on the marvelous remarks \nthat have gone before, I remember the first hearings I attended of the \nJoint Economic Committee. I tell this story about who gets the credit \nfor the economy. Alan Greenspan was the witness that day. I am not a \ntrained economist. I have been interested in these issues, but I am not \na trained economist.\n  We started the discussion, and the chairman made a joke about who \ndeserved credit for the economy: Was it Mr. Greenspan or was it \nPresident Clinton? Members on both sides joked about that and laughed a \nlittle bit, and we went on with the hearing.\n  I had an article from USA Today, not a great economic journal, but it \nwas an interesting article, and it interviewed businessmen from \nGermany, Japan and England, asking them why the U.S. economy was doing \nso much better than theirs. They had double-digit unemployment of 12 \nand 13 percent, higher inflation, and less growth than we were having. \nThey asked them why. They all agreed. They said it was because the \nUnited States, even though our taxes are high, had less taxes, less \nregulation, and a greater commitment to the free market.\n  I asked Mr. Greenspan if he agreed with that. He looked up at me and \nsaid: ``I absolutely agree with that.'' Less taxes, less regulation, \nand a greater commitment to the free market. ``Absolutely,'' he said, \nthat is the basis for the sound American economy.\n  I think our taxes are still too high, but they are less than Europe. \nOur regulations are less, and we are more committed to letting free \nmarket forces allocate our resources than having the Government do it \nas they do in the European countries. I believe that is the basis for \nbeing successful.\n  I thought later what I really should have said at that time was that \nRonald Reagan deserves credit for this economy because that is what he \nfought for and that is the direction we moved.\n  We have had substantial increases in taxes that have burdened \nAmericans substantially.\n  There is one thing that troubles me about this economy, and that is \nthe rising cost of fuel in America. If there is one thing that \nthreatens our economic growth, it is the increase in energy prices. I \nhave been talking with businessmen in my State. They tell me their \nconcerns. Their profits are down.\n  I traveled with a truck driver from Birmingham to Clinton to \nMontgomery. He told me he is paying $800 more a month for fuel. I \ntalked to businesspeople about their fuel costs. Families that were \npaying $100 a month this time last year for gasoline for their clunkers \nand all that they have their families driving around in, are now paying \n$160 a month for that fuel. That is $60 a month taken out of their \nfamily's budget that they could be spending for things in the \nmarketplace. They will not be spending it in the marketplace because it \nis going to pay for energy costs. That is a threat to us. We need to \nbreak that cycle.\n  It occurred not so much because of economic forces but because of \npolitical actions by the OPEC nations when they got together and \nwithheld supplies and drove up energy prices and sat there and \ncollected billions of dollars from America. The OPEC politicians beat \nour politicians. They outsmarted us. They took advantage of our lack of \nproduction of American industry. We got even more and more indebted to \nthem for our energy, and they drove up the price. We had no choice but \nto pay it.\n  We are paying 20 cents more, 60 cents more per gallon of gasoline and \nmost of that is going straight to those countries. If we tax gasoline \nin America 50 cents a gallon, which is not too far from what we do, at \nleast that money goes to the State of Alabama or to the Federal \nGovernment and is spent in the United States. In effect, OPEC has taxed \nus. Every time you go to the gas pump and pay for that gasoline, much \nof it is going straight out of our country. It is a huge transfer of \nAmerican wealth. It has the potential to not only damage the family \nbudget but to damage our economy. I think we have to do something about \nit.\n\n  The long-term solution is to get serious and start increasing \nproduction. We have the capacity to increase production in the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Go ahead.\n  Mr. President, I will withhold.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will simply say this. In this election--since we are \ntalking about elections here on the other side--the American people \nhave a choice: Will they elect a President who, with his deepest core \nbeliefs, would be a no-growth, no-production kind of President or will \nwe elect a President who understands America's critical need for energy \nand who will help create policies that are environmentally sound, that \nwill allow us to remove ourselves from under this yoke of the OPEC \ncartel?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11365-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION MODIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I wanted to take a moment to \ndiscuss H.R. 5239, the Export Administration Modification and \nClarification Act. The Senate approved H.R. 5239 with a substitute \namendment on October 11, and the House took up and passed the bill, as \namended, earlier this afternoon.\n  Since 1994 our export control system has been maintained under a \nregulatory framework pursuant to the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act based on the provisions of the Export Administration Act of \n1979. The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), which administers our \nexport controls, recently has faced court challenges regarding the \nintegrity of that framework. Specifically, the courts have questioned \nBXA's authority--known as 12(c) authority--to maintain the \nconfidentiality of sensitive information submitted by industry pursuant \nto our export control rules.\n  While comprehensive review and updating of the Export Administration \nAct will be early on the agenda of the Senate Banking Committee next \nyear, we are undertaking a simple extension of the 1979 Act at this \ntime to set the stage for that review. It is important to note, \nhowever, that replacing the 1994 expiration date with a 2001 expiration \ndate will make clear that BXA's authority to apply the 12(c) \nconfidentiality provision of the 1979 act is to be considered as \ncovering any information regarding license applications obtained during \nthat time period, as if there had been no interruption of authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11365-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11365-S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, on November 11th, people across the \nUnited States will celebrate Veterans' Day--a day in which we pause to \nremember and to honor the brave men and women who served their country \nin our armed forces.\n  November 11th also marks the anniversary of the armistice that ended \nWorld War I, a conflict that promised to be the ``war to end all \nwars.'' Unfortunately, the peace that followed World War I was short-\nlived. The world soon was plunged into the cauldron of World War II, \nfollowed by the terror of the Cold War--played out on so many fronts, \nmost tragically in Korea and Vietnam. Today we face continued threats \nto our liberty, with outlaw leaders of rogue states waging extremist \ncampaigns against freedom and democracy, as well as the persistent \ndanger of terrorist attacks--which we have seen all too recently with \nthe USS Cole tragedy.\n  Indeed, the world is still a dangerous place, and World War I's \npromise of a lasting, worldwide peace has yet to be realized. The \nconflicts of the last century remind us that freedom constantly \nrequires great sacrifices and often the lives of those who defend it. \nIt is these patriots, the men and women of our armed forces, who \nanswered the call of service and protected the freedoms we cherish. \nAlthough we can never fully repay the debt we owe these courageous \nAmericans, we can and must continue to recognize the price they paid.\n  This year, Veterans' Day falls just four days after Election Day. I \nfind this particularly fitting, as there is no greater symbol of \nAmerican liberty than our ability to participate in free and fair \nelections. Above all else, we owe this freedom to our veterans. Time \nand again, our democracy has been preserved by these brave men and \nwomen.\n  This Veterans' Day marks another special occasion; the groundbreaking \nceremony for the World War II Memorial, to be located on the National \nMall in our nation's capital. This monument will stand in recognition \nof a generation of Americans who served their country so ably in \nresisting the forces of Nazism and oppression. This was a defining \nmoment in our nation's history, and one to which almost every American \nfeels some connection. My own father is a World War II veteran, and \nPurple Heart recipient.\n  Unlike my father, however, many Americans did not return home from \nthis noble campaign. They were the duty-bound sons and daughters of our \nnation, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for \nfreedom. In the words of President Lincoln, they ``gave the last full \nmeasure of devotion,'' and we must uphold the memory of their heroism \nwith respect, with reverence, and with our heartfelt admiration.\n  This is the purpose of Veterans' Day. Although mere words do not pay \nadequate tribute to the sacrifices our veterans have laid upon the \naltar of freedom, the knowledge of their noble deeds lives in the \nhearts and minds of those who are free--and shall not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11366-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11366-S11367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 3164\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bayh \nfor his efforts on S. 3164, the Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act, \nwhich the House passed today. This bill, which I cosponsored along with \nSenators Grams and Cleland, will greatly assist federal, state, and \nlocal efforts to crack down on crime committed against older Americans. \nAlthough I wish the Congress had also acted on additional proposals to \nprotect elderly Americans, including S. 751, the Seniors Safety Act, I \nam glad that we were at least able to pass this legislation.\n  I have been concerned for some time that even as the general crime \nrate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the rate of \ncrime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I \nintroduced the Seniors Safety Act with Senators Daschle, Kennedy, and \nTorricelli over a year ago. The Judiciary Committee refused to hold \nhearings on this bill, which provides a comprehensive approach to a \nvariety of problems affecting seniors today.\n  Thankfully, the Republican majority was less hostile to S. 3164, \nwhich includes one of the titles from the Seniors Safety Act. This \ntitle does two things. First, it instructs the Attorney General to \nconduct a study relating to crimes against seniors, so that we can \ndevelop a coherent strategy to prevent and properly punish such crimes. \nSecond, it mandates the inclusion of seniors in the National Crime \nVictimization Study. Both of these are important steps.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes important proposals \nfor addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, especially \nfraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, this bill \nauthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to \nestablish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate \nthem about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about \ntelemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and \nthrough State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions \nthat will help seniors protect themselves against crime.\n  I hope that when Congress reconvenes in January, we will consider the \nrest of the Seniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive \nprotections for our seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a \ncomprehensive approach that would increase law enforcement's ability to \nbattle telemarketing, pension, and health care fraud, as well as to \npolice nursing homes with a record of mistreating their residents. The \nJustice Department has said that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of \nassistance in a number of ways.'' I have urged the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as \nOctober 1999, and again this past February, but my requests have not \nbeen granted. Now, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of \ntime for hearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and \nsignificant parts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee as part of the unfinished business of this \nCongress.\n  Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the \nmajority in the Congress has declined to consider. First, the Seniors \nSafety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. \nNursing homes\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\nprovide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 \npercent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care \nat some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job \nwith a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect \nseniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. \nIt does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority to \ninvestigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that engage \nin a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the \nmore important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing \nthat 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's \n``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed \nthat 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to \nprovide optimal care.\n  Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarket \nfraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This legislation \nwould give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate \ntelephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. \nIf someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can take away \ntheir gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law \nshould allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In \naddition, this proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style \nclearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about \ntelemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could find \nout whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over \nthe Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convicted of \nfraud.\n  Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who \nhave worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-\nearned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The \nbill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who \ndefraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft \nin connection with employee benefit plans.\n  Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability \nto fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute \nfor Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately \ntarget vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's \npatients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law \nenforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional \ninvestigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute \nhealth care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also \nprotects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples \nof health care fraud.\n  I commend Senators Bayh, Grams, and Cleland for working to take steps \nto improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We have done \nthe right thing in passing this bipartisan legislation and beginning \nthe fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I urge consideration \nof the Seniors Safety Act. It would provide a comprehensive approach \ntoward giving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need \nto prevent crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11367-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11367-S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE VACCINE ACQUISITION STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to notify my colleagues \nof my efforts to change the Department of Defense's vaccine acquisition \nstrategy. You see, it is my belief that the BioPort/anthrax debacle \nprovides lawmakers with an excellent case study, one which illustrates \nthat the Department's present policy of relying on the private sector \nto provide vaccines critical to the protection of our men and women in \nuniform is fatally flawed and must be changed. There exists a growing \nconsensus that the Department of Defense must shoulder the \nresponsibility and begin to produce biological warfare vaccines for \nitself.\n  In the early 1990's, in the aftermath of the gulf war, \nrecommendations were presented to senior Defense Department acquisition \nofficials to fulfill the urgent demands of war-fighters to develop \nvaccines against biological agents. One of the principal \nrecommendations was for the construction of a Government-owned, \ncontractor-operated (GOCO) vaccine production facility. Detailed and \nthoughtful studies presented many merits to the GOCO approach. Without \nlisting all of its merits, I will point out that the GOCO option would \nguarantee the country access to a vaccine supply immune from the \nfoibles of a profit-driven pharmaceuticals industry.\n  For reasons that remain a mystery to this day, the Defense Department \ndid not elect to pursue the safer, GOCO option. Rather, the Department \nchose to contract with a private-sector entity we now know as BioPort, \nfor the vaccine against the biological agent anthrax.\n  Since embarking on this acquisition strategy, events have proceeded \nas many had feared they would; disastrously. Last summer, the Defense \nDepartment awarded the BioPort corporation extraordinary contract \nrelief to a previous contract for the production and vulnerable storage \nof the anthrax vaccine. The terms of the contract relief reduced the \nnumber of doses of vaccine to be produced by one-half, charged the U.S. \ntaxpayer almost three times as much as was originally negotiated, and \nprovided BioPort with an interest-free loan of almost $20 million. \nBioPort officials have stated that even this may not constitute enough \nsupport. I question the fitness of whoever negotiated such a horrendous \narrangement on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n  In July, because of BioPort's continuing troubles, the Department was \nforced to dramatically scale back the scope of Phase One of the \nimmunization program because the rapid rate of vaccinations threatened \nto consume the last of the Department's stockpile of FDA approved \nvaccine. Now, only those personnel who are deployed to high-threat \nregions, such as the Persian Gulf and the Korean Peninsula, will \nreceive vaccinations. As it appears increasingly apparent that neither \nadditional lots of vaccine, nor the new production line in East \nLansing, will receive FDA approval anytime soon even this dramatically \nreduced effort may completely exhaust the Department's supply of \nvaccine, leaving our troops vulnerable.\n  As the Department is preparing to transition into production of the \nfirst of more than a dozen new bio-war vaccines developed under the \nJoint Vaccine Acquisition Program, it was apparent to me that unless we \nwish to repeat the mistakes of the past, a new acquisition strategy is \nurgently needed.\n  My colleagues and I on the Senate Armed Service Committee are making \nefforts to prevent the Defense Department from continuing to pursue a \nflawed acquisition strategy. Through oversight hearings and legislative \nprovisions within the national defense authorization bill, we are \nactively providing the Department with some much needed guidance.\n  On April 14, I chaired the second of three committee hearings on the \ntopic of vaccine production. During that hearing, DOD personnel who had \nadvocated the GOCO route in the early Nineties, and were overruled, \nwere given the opportunity to testify. Their testimony is perhaps the \nmost important the committee has received all year on this topic.\n  At a third committee hearing, conducted in July, the Department \nannounced that it had published a solicitation for a second-source of \nthe Anthrax vaccine. As the Department received only cursory inquiries \nfrom the pharmaceutical industry during the required thirty day period, \nthis effort appears to have failed.\n  In response to the testimony received by the committee, I drafted \nsection 221 of the Senate's fiscal year 2001 national defense \nauthorization bill. Section 221 requires the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct a reevaluation of the present vaccine acquisition. The report \nwill include an evaluation of the commercial sector to meet DOD's \nvaccine requirements and a design for a Government-owned, contractor-\noperated vaccine production facility.\n  Section 221 also notes that a significant body of work regarding this \ntopic was assembled in the early 1990's including Project Badger, which \nrecommended that a GOCO vaccine production facility be constructed at \nthe Pine Bluff Arsenal in my home state of Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\n  I am pleased to report that the provision was retained in the \nconference report which the Congress voted to send to the President for \nhis signature.\n  In addition to hearings and legislative provisions, I have begun a \ndialog with numerous personnel within the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense. I would be remiss if I did not mention the many productive \nconversations I have had with the Under Secretary of Defense, Rudy \ndeLeon. Because Secretary deLeon is relatively new to his position and \nhas little ownership over the flawed decisions of the past, he has been \nvery willing to explore alternative acquisition strategies including \nthe solution I favor: construction of a Government-owned, contractor-\noperated vaccine production facility. As evidence of his commitment to \nfind a solution, vaccine production was the first topic discussed by \nthe Defense Resources Board, which Secretary deLeon chairs, when it met \nto begin its preparation of the Defense budget submission for fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  I have encouraged Secretary deLeon to include $25 million in the \nfiscal year 2002 Defense budget submission for R, in addition to $400 \nmillion in the next version of the Department's Fiscal Years \nDevelopment Plan, to cover construction costs. To ensure that funding \nfor this project does not come at the expense of other critically \nneeded bio-defense programs, I will soon meet with the Director of OMB. \nI am hopeful that I can explore with Mr. Lew ways to increase the top-\nline of the Defense budget to cover the expense of this project.\n  For too long DOD has pursued a flawed acquisition strategy that is a \ndisservice to both the American taxpayer and our men and women in \nuniform. The Department must be weaned from its dependence on the \nprivate sector for the provision of critical biological warfare \nvaccines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11368-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FIREARM HOMICIDES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week I submitted a list of some of the \nhigh profile shootings that took place over the past two years and the \ncasualties that occurred as a result. That list was long, far too long. \nThe number of shootings, in schools and public places, have claimed the \nlives of too many Americans, especially our young people.\n  I believe all of us want to know why children in the United States \nseem more vulnerable to gun violence than children in other \nindustrialized nations? Some would argue that it is because American \nchildren are watching movies and television programs that are \ndisturbingly violent. Some say that our children are lacking in \nreligious influences. Certainly, these may be factors, and we should do \neverything we can to steer our kids in the right direction, but if we \nare going to protect children's lives, we must first and foremost limit \nour children's access to guns.\n  I have repeatedly made the point that Canadian children, who play the \nsame video games and watch the same movies are much safer than their \nAmerican counterparts. The reason-- Canadian laws successfully limit \nminors' access to firearms while American laws do not.\n  How else can one explain that during the year 1999 in Detroit, \nMichigan there were 337 homicides committed with firearms (Source: \nMichigan State Police). For the same year, in Windsor, Ontario, a city \nless than half a mile away from Detroit, there was just a single \nfirearm homicide (Source: Windsor Police Services). In one year, 337 \nfirearm homicides in Detroit versus one in Windsor, even though the \nchildren in these cities often listen to the same radio stations and \nwatch the exact same television programs. That is a shocking statistic, \none that should jolt this Congress to action. Unfortunately, to my \ngreat disappointment, this Congress will adjourn without doing a single \nthing to protect our children from gun violence in Detroit or anywhere \nelse in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11368-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

She was blessed with a beautiful singing \nvoice which she has passed down to her children and grandchildren. She \nalso has a flair for any kind of handiwork, including quilting, and she \nstill enjoys sewing. ``Everyone in Timmonsville knows Thelma,'' one of \nher daughters explained, and rightly so; Mrs. Thelma Rivers is truly a \ntreasure. My wife, Peatsy, and I wish her continued health and \nhappiness and the most joyful of birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11368-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO KENNERLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

Kennerly is one of nine \nschools to be named recently to the 2000 National Schools of Character \nin recognition of its exemplary work to encourage the social, ethical \nand academic development of its students through character education.\n  Sponsored by the Character Education Partnership, National Schools of \nCharacter is an annual awards program recognizing K-12 schools and \ndistricts demonstrating outstanding character education initiatives and \nyielding positive results in student behavior, school environment, and \nacademic performance. Kennerly exemplifies its school motto ``Friends \nLearning Together'' by involving students, teachers, parents, and the \ncommunity. Included in Kennerly's character education programs are a \nCharacter Plus Team, a Character Club, and a Character Cabinet.\n  As a strong supporter of character education, I am pleased to see \nthat Kennerly's Character Education program has produced great results, \nboth in academics, and in the social climate of the school. Academic \nperformance has increased, and discipline problems have decreased. I \nhave fought to increase the amount of funding available for character \neducation because schools like Kennerly have demonstrated that \ncharacter education programs increase the value of education for all \nour children and enhance our communities. It is truly a privilege for \nstudents to attend schools like Kennerly.\n  So, I extend my congratulations to Kennerly Elementary School in St. \nLouis, Missouri, for its outstanding character education \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11368-5", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11368-S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF PROJECT ACORN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the \ncharitable efforts of Project Acorn, a non-profit organization that \nworks to place and fund children in two-year preschool scholarship \nprograms. What started out as Stuart and Jill Lasser's individual act \nof kindness has become an expanded effort throughout Morris County and \nnow across New Jersey to help families who cannot afford quality \npreschool education. The couple's lofty objectives and hard work \nenabled the organization to flourish over the past five years through \npartnerships with benefactors, volunteers, and area preschools.\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\n  Education has been, and continues to be, the cornerstone of \nopportunity and advancement in American society. Preschool education \nprovides the foundation and many of the basic tools that children need \nto succeed. Study after study has shown a direct correlation between \nhigh-quality early childhood education and success in life. All of \nthese studies on the effects of preschool education have shown higher \nshort-term and long-term gains such as higher I.Q. scores and a greater \nlikelihood of graduating from high school and college.\n  Project Acorn has provided hundreds of families with the critical \nresources necessary to place their children in a variety of preschool \nprograms. These scholarships defray the costs of preschool education \nand thereby ``plant the seeds for a better community, one child at a \ntime.''\n  Project Acorn has helped many young individuals in Morris County. It \nserves as an excellent example of what can be accomplished by concerned \ncitizens who have identified an urgent need within their community, and \nit is an honor to recognize their vision and compassion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11369-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER OLIVER ANDERS RETIRES\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate will be diminished \nconsiderably when one of my favorite U.S. Capitol Police Officers, Andy \nAnders, retires at the end of this month.\n  When I first met Andy, the day I was sworn in as a Senator, he was \none of the so-called Fearless Five. Those were the officers who were \nstationed just outside the entrance to the Senate chamber near the \nelevators. That was his post for 19 years.\n  Even though he is called Andy, his real name is Oliver Anders. His \nhometown is Greer, South Carolina, and the first vote he ever cast was \nfor Senator Strom Thurmond. As you can see, Andy is a man of very good \njudgment.\n  For the last five years Andy has been assigned to the fourth floor of \nthe Capitol outside the Senate Security spaces. He is one of the most \ntrusted and dependable members of the U.S. Capitol Police force.\n  He is also a well informed student of American history. When I \nlearned he planned to visit my State during his vacation several years \nago, I suggested some special sites for him to see in Vicksburg, \nNatchez and Jackson. My Administrative Assistant, at that time, Wiley \nCarter, who was also a great friend and admirer of Andy, went with him \nto the State Capitol and introduced him to the Speaker of the State \nHouse of Representatives and other officials and also arranged a tour \nof the Governor's Mansion. Of course, Andy enjoyed all of this special \nattention. But, he deserved it.\n  We don't do enough in my opinion for those who work hard and \nfaithfully every day to make the Senate a safe and secure place to \nwork. Since he began his career with the U.S. Capitol Police on \nNovember 4, 1974, Oliver Anders has been one of those you could always \ncount on to be at his post, carrying out his important \nresponsibilities, with a smile and kind greeting for all Senators, and \ntheir constituents.\n  We will miss him greatly, but we won't forget him or the excellent \nway he performed his duties. I wish him much happiness and satisfaction \nin the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11369-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11369-S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       35TH ANNIVERSARY OF VISTA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very proud that VISTA is \ncelebrating its thirty-fifth anniversary this year. VISTA is special \nfor me because it was my work in VISTA that brought me to West Virginia \nand changed the course of my career.\n  Because of my work in Emmons, WV, as a VISTA worker, I decided to \nmake West Virginia my home and public service in government my life. In \nEmmons, I worked for a community center, preventative health care, and \nfought to get a school bus so those teens would get a high school \neducation. From the grassroots, I learned how government can improve \nthe quality of life in a community. I pursued a career in government, \nbeginning with a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. My work \nin Emmons was very meaningful, and it changed me. I have stayed in \ntouch with the people of Emmons and joined them this summer to \ncelebrate the community finally getting clean water.\n  I have also stayed in touch with VISTA and was delighted to \nparticipate in the VISTA anniversary events, as many former VISTA \nworkers did.\n  Mr. President, I ask to print in the Record, the remarks of John E. \nGherty, president and CEO of Land O' Lakes, Inc., and more importantly \na former VISTA worker. His remarks outline the history of VISTA and \ncapture its vision for the future.\n  The remarks follows:\n                                                  October 13, 2000\n       Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to be \n     with you to celebrate the 35th anniversary of VISTA--now a \n     proud part of AmeriCorps.\n       I wanted to participate in this celebration for a couple of \n     very important and very personal reasons.\n       First, because I truly believe in the principles behind \n     VISTA and AmeriCorps. I take considerable pride in the \n     program's 35 years of accomplishment--and in my own \n     participation some 32 years ago. I'll tell you more about \n     that in just a few minutes.\n       My second reason for being here is even more personal. It's \n     because the youngest of my three daughters, ten-year-old \n     Katherine, told me it was important for me to be here. Let me \n     explain.\n       Originally, I thought I might be addressing this group on \n     the weekend, and that I might bring Katherine with me. One \n     evening about six weeks ago, I got home somewhat late and \n     went up to her room to say goodnight. It seemed like the \n     right time to ask her if she would like to take a trip to \n     Washington, DC.\n       Like most ten-year-olds, she responded with a question of \n     her own. ``What for?''\n       I told her I was considering speaking to a group called \n     AmeriCorps, which was the successor to VISTA.\n       Her response--and you parents will understand this, was \n     another question of her own--``What's AmeriCorps or VISTA \n     do?'' I told her it was an organization formed to help people \n     in need in the United States--and that it dealt with issues \n     like poverty, hunger, health care and housing.\n       Her eyes lit up with understanding, and without hesitation, \n     she said ``Dad, you should go.''\n       I tell you this story because I believe Katherine's almost \n     instant understanding serves to reinforce the fundamental \n     importance and value of what each of you has accomplished or \n     is committed to accomplishing as VISTA alumni and AmeriCorps \n     participants.\n       This afternoon's program brings together a unique mix of \n     new AmeriCorps/VISTA participants and VISTA alumni.\n       As one of those alumni, I have a message for all of the new \n     participants. What you accomplish during today's working \n     sessions, and the work you put in during the coming year, \n     will make a difference.\n       It will make a difference not just in the lives of those \n     who benefit from the services you develop and provide--but in \n     your lives as well.\n       That, in fact, is what this three-day celebration is all \n     about . . . recognizing the ongoing difference VISTA has made \n     in the lives of the millions of people who have been served \n     by its programs, as well as in the lives of the 130,000 VISTA \n     alumni who delivered those programs.\n       Let me take just a few minutes to reflect on my own VISTA \n     experience.\n       I remember when President Kennedy announced the formation \n     of the Peace Corps back in 1962. I was a student at the \n     University of Wisconsin . . . an institution rightfully known \n     for the quality of its education and the strength of its \n     activism.\n       I recall being impressed with the concept of the Peace \n     Corps, and being convinced it was something I wanted to do \n     once I finished school. After graduating from business school \n     and entering law school, I was even more convinced that \n     public service was not only a personal opportunity, but--\n     quite simply--just the right thing to do.\n       It was at about that time that VISTA--then referred to as \n     ``The Domestic Peace Corps''--was formed.\n       When I completed law school, I sought out public service \n     opportunities and was offered the chance to serve with the \n     Peace Corps in Ethiopia or Botswana. I felt very strongly, on \n     a personal level, about the importance of giving a priority \n     to addressing our needs here at home. So, I focused my \n     energies on becoming part of VISTA.\n       I soon found myself--fresh out of law school at the \n     University of Wisconsin and not really that far removed from \n     my family's Western Wisconsin farm--on my way to Chicago to \n     work out of the Henry Booth House, which was part of Hull \n     House, in the lckes public housing development on \n     Chicago's South Side.\n       How much of a culture shock was that? For those of you who \n     aren't familiar with the South Side of Chicago, Folk singer \n     Jim Croce--in his song ``Bad Bad LeRoy Brown''--referred to \n     the area as ``the baddest part of town.''\n       On the surface, that was a pretty apt description. It was a \n     tough, poverty-stricken, inner-city neighborhood, where Black \n     Power was an influential and powerful force--and for good \n     reason.\n       It was a pretty challenging environment for a fresh-out-of-\n     school, Caucasian, farm-\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\n     kid from Wisconsin. I can tell you truthfully that there was \n     considerable community skepticism regarding my intentions and \n     my motives.\n       As you can imagine, my VISTA involvement proved to be a \n     truly eye-opening experience.\n       It was also tremendously rewarding, knowing that I was \n     contributing to the future of what I came to think of as my \n     South Side community--that I was helping to establish \n     programs and services that would continue to benefit the \n     neighborhood after I was gone.\n       It was also a significant learning experience. In fact, I \n     am absolutely convinced that my personal VISTA ``take-aways'' \n     matched, and probably even exceeded, what I gave to the \n     program.\n       When I think about what I learned during my VISTA \n     involvement, five things come to mind almost immediately:\n       The absolute importance of taking responsibility and \n     creating opportunity;\n       The essential role of teamwork and team building;\n       The importance of building effective alliances;\n       The strength that can be found in diversity; and\n       The need to identify leaders and build leadership skills.\n       These were critical elements in my ability to fulfill my \n     role with VISTA ... and over the years I have found them to \n     be the critical building blocks for success, no matter what \n     the endeavor or organization.\n       Let's look at these five concepts--starting with the \n     importance of taking responsibility and creating opportunity.\n       My VISTA involvement taught me that, to truly succeed, you \n     must take personal responsibility for getting the job done. I \n     saw the importance of sizing up the issues and--in an \n     environment where there were not a lot of rules or precedents \n     to follow--taking the initiative in ways that made a \n     difference.\n       My participation in VISTA also taught me that long-term \n     success depends on the ability to create opportunity. The \n     success of VISTA programming is not based on ``hands-outs,'' \n     it's based on creating opportunities for people to better \n     themselves.\n       I can guarantee--from personal experience on Chicago's \n     South Side--that given the opportunity to succeed, and even \n     the slightest bit of sincere encouragement, people will take \n     advantage of it.\n       For example, when I arrived at the Ickes public housing \n     development back in 1968, food prices and food quality were \n     significant issues. Poverty and mobility limited residents' \n     choices.\n       Working with community residents, we formed a volunteer-led \n     food buying club focused on bringing higher-quality, fairly \n     priced groceries into the neighborhood.\n       Very quickly we had a crew of volunteers in each building \n     taking weekly grocery orders from fellow residents and \n     additional volunteers turning their apartments into food \n     distribution centers.\n       We were able to leverage our volunteer force and our \n     increased buying power to make higher-quality groceries \n     available at better prices. Just as important, perhaps, the \n     residents had a new sense of self-esteem--of knowing they \n     could take control--that they could have a say in community \n     quality of life.\n       The program gave them the opportunity to succeed and they \n     took advantage of it.\n       VISTA also gave me new insight into the importance of \n     teamwork and team building. I learned that one of the first \n     elements in being successful at anything is to recognize that \n     you simply cannot do it all alone.\n       In VISTA, I quickly recognized the importance of going out \n     into the community and identifying the team players--those \n     with the skills, the commitment and the spirit to get the job \n     done--and getting them on your team.\n       I also learned a great deal about the importance of \n     building effective alliances--and that sometimes you find \n     strong allies where you least expect them.\n       Going back to the issue of food quality and prices. There \n     was a particular grocery chain which was taking advantage of \n     its location and the limited resources of neighborhood \n     residents. High prices and very poor quality meat and produce \n     were the rule--not the exception.\n       In our wisdom--or perhaps our ignorance--our VISTA team \n     decided to organize a picket line at the store to bring \n     attention to its shortcomings. It was a tense situation, and \n     we actually feared for our safety and that of the residents \n     who were supporting us.\n       At that same time, a gang called The Blackstone Rangers--\n     known for years as an intimidating ``take no prisoners'' \n     organization--was making a real effort to change their image. \n     The most outward signs of that effort were their donning of \n     distinctive red berets and the changing of their name to the \n     Peacestone Rangers.\n       Well, they decided to make our cause their cause--and with \n     these allies on the picket line, the balance of power shifted \n     in the community's favor.\n       My VISTA involvement also taught me the strength that can \n     be found in diversity. I learned that by bringing together \n     people of different cultures, different viewpoints and \n     different skills in pursuit of common goals, you can being \n     even greater force to bear on those goals.\n       I also learned that when you are getting your hands dirty \n     in pursuant of a common goal, people very quickly forget \n     whether you are white, black, young or old, from the farm or \n     the city.\n       Once you roll up your sleeves and get down to the task at \n     hand--diversity is not a problem, it is a powerful problem-\n     solving tool.\n       Finally, VISTA taught me a lot about leadership. I'm not \n     talking just about how to best exercise my own leadership \n     role--but also about identifying existing and potential \n     leaders and building leadership skills in the community.\n       I learned that to succeed, you must drive leadership skills \n     throughout the organization--and you must give those new \n     leaders responsibility and authority.\n       Believe me, I met lots of strong, effective leaders on \n     Chicago's South Side. Some were single mothers with babies \n     balanced on their hips, others were experienced organizers \n     from the Reverend Jesse Jackson's Operation Breadbasket, \n     and still others were elderly couples who had lived their \n     entire lives in a neighborhood they refused to give up on. \n     Yes, and some were even wearing the red berets of the \n     Peacestone Rangers.\n       They were all different, but they all shared a vision, and \n     an ability to motivate others in pursuit of that vision. They \n     were true leaders--and our team of VISTA volunteers would \n     have accomplished very little without them.\n       Were these important lessons?\n       I think all the VISTA participants from the past 35 years \n     would agree that the lessons they learned in VISTA--the \n     insight they gained and the skills they honed while serving \n     the community--helped prepare them for success, no matter \n     what course their lives took.\n       To this day--more than 30 years later--my own service with \n     VISTA continues to have an impact on my life and my career.\n       I continue to believe with a passion that corporate social \n     responsibility is absolutely non-negotiable. No matter what \n     business you are in--the recognition of corporate social \n     responsibility must be part of your core values and an \n     essential element in your organizational vision.\n       And, I'm not just talking about corporate and foundation \n     giving--or the encouragement of community service and \n     volunteerism. I'm also talking about the way you treat \n     employees, customers and owners; the ethics and values you \n     bring to your business practices; the respect you show for \n     the environment.\n       That's why, at the company I work for today--Land O'Lakes--\n     we have included being our customers' first choice; our \n     employees' first choice; responsible to our owners; and a \n     leader in our communities as critical elements in our vision \n     of being one of the best food and agricultural companies in \n     the world.\n       Our extended vision statement states clearly that--We \n     recognize our responsibilities to the communities in which we \n     operate. And that we will be proactive in dedicating \n     resources to build a better quality of life, operate in an \n     ethical and environmentally sensitive manner and live by our \n     values.\n       What about our internal community--our employees? Again, in \n     our vision, we state clearly that ``We believe in respecting \n     diversity and in encouraging teamwork, involvement, \n     development and empowerment of all employees.\n       What does all this sound like? It sounds very much like my \n     personal takeaways from VISTA--taking responsibility; \n     creating opportunity; building teams, teamwork and effective \n     alliances; and developing leaders and leadership.\n       In just a few minutes, you are going to break into work \n     groups and tackle the task of developing Pilot AmeriCorps \n     VISTA projects for 2001 and beyond.\n       I urge you to be aggressive and ambitious in those \n     deliberations. To recognize that, in a time of what many call \n     unprecedented prosperity--there is still significant poverty \n     in America. In fact, approximately 32 million Americans--one \n     in nine--live on incomes below the poverty level.\n       I believe today's combination of prosperity and poverty \n     makes each and every American's social responsibility even \n     more demanding.\n       We must ask ourselves, in a nation as prosperous as ours:\n       Why do children still go to school hungry?\n       Why are so many still homeless?\n       Why are so many citizens isolated from health care by \n     economics or geography?\n       Why is quality education or training still out of the reach \n     of so many individuals desperately trying to better \n     themselves?\n       In short, we must ask ourselves the tough questions--and \n     then come up with the right answers--the programs it will \n     take to address these issues--the programs that will close \n     the gap between prosperity and poverty.\n       No one is going to do it for us. We must each take this \n     responsibility, first as individuals and then as part of \n     larger communities and organizations. But then again, that's \n     why you are all here--because you are willing to take that \n     responsibility, to act in ways that can truly make a \n     difference.\n       I applaud that willingness and, seeing the spirit in this \n     room, I am confident what you are doing will make a \n     significant difference in communities across America.\n       Since we are meeting in our nation's Capitol, I'd like to \n     close my remarks with a comment from a speech by former \n     President Woodrow Wilson.\n       ``You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in \n     order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater \n     vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement.\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\n       You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish \n     yourself if you forget this errand.''\n       As VISTA celebrates 35 years of service, and embarks on \n     year 36 as AmeriCorps VISTA, it is clear to me that the \n     program and its people remain clearly focused on that task--\n     on enabling the world to live more amply, developing a \n     greater vision for all and generating a finer spirit of hope \n     in communities across our nation.\n       Ultimately, the lives of each of you--and of the people you \n     touch--will all be richer for it. I can guarantee it--and my \n     daughter Katherine would agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11371-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF DR. MICHAEL ASSEY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr President, I rise today to remember one of \nSouth Carolina's finest doctors, Michael E. Assey, who passed away on \nOctober 28. A graduate of Georgetown University's School of Medicine, \nMichael joined the staff of the Medical University of South Carolina \n(MUSC) in 1979 and rose to the position of Professor of Medicine, Chief \nof Cardiology. In 1998, he was named to the ``Best Doctors in America'' \nlist. He served as governor of the American College of Cardiology and \nas president of the S.C. affiliate of the American Heart Association. \nMichael also authored numerous medical articles and medical textbook \nchapters. While at MUSC, he received the prestigious Golden Apple Award \nfor excellence in teaching. The President of MUSC, Raymond Greenberg, \nsaid, ``his professional legacy lies in the generation of young doctors \nwho, as Michael Assey's students, not only learned clinical skills, but \ncompassion and commitment.'' With Michael's passing, the Medical \nUniversity has lost a great doctor and great teacher and South Carolina \nhas lost a great man. My wife, Peatsy and I send our thoughts and \nprayers to Michael's devoted wife, Valerie, and their two \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11371-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 30, 2000, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House agrees to the amendment of the Senate to the \nbill (H.R. 2498) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nrecommendations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding \nthe placement of automatic external defibrillators in Federal buildings \nin order to improve survival rates of individuals who experience \ncardiac arrest in such buildings, and to establish protections from \ncivil liability arising from the emergency use of the devices.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \njoint resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Health Care Financing Administration; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 617\n\n       Whereas, over a half million senior citizens across the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been severely affected by \n     the problems of Medicare HMO withdrawals, increases in \n     premiums and decreases in benefit packages effective January \n     1, 2001; and\n       Whereas, this year 65 managed care companies chose not to \n     renew their Medicare+Choice contracts for 2001; and\n       Whereas, seniors on fixed incomes who rely on their Federal \n     and State Governments to provide them with some measure of \n     health care protection are now facing extreme uncertainty; \n     and\n       Whereas, approximately 577,000 Pennsylvania seniors who are \n     members of a Medicare HMO are facing substantial plan \n     coverage changes effective January 1, 2001; and\n       Whereas, ninety thousand of these seniors in 38 counties \n     across this Commonwealth are being dropped from their HMOs; \n     and\n       Whereas, thousands of seniors living in a county from which \n     their Medicare HMO is not withdrawing may be dropped from \n     their plan because their county code for Social Security \n     purposes or their zip code, or both the county code and zip \n     code, is identified as being in the neighboring county from \n     which the Medicare HMO is withdrawing; and\n       Whereas, many of these seniors may not have received \n     information that they need to ensure that these county code \n     or zip code or both code problems are corrected, and other \n     seniors are consistently receiving misinformation from their \n     Medicare HMO regarding the status of their coverage as of \n     January 1, 2001; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Health Care \n     Financing Administration and health insurers withdrawing \n     their Medicare HMO coverage in any\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\n     county within Pennsylvania to take immediate steps to ensure \n     that subscribers who live in a county that is not impacted by \n     the insurer's withdrawal are not mistakenly dropped from \n     their plan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and \n     Human Services, the members of Congress from Pennsylvania, \n     the Secretary of Aging of the Commonwealth, the Insurance \n     Commissioner of the Commonwealth and each health insurer \n     offering Medicare HMO coverage in Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-636. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Food and Drug Administration; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 215\n\n       Whereas, several committees of the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have conducted hearings \n     throughout this Commonwealth attempting to ascertain the \n     casual factors behind the rising costs of prescription drugs \n     as well as the enormous impact on both private and government \n     purchasers; and\n       Whereas, in recent years the cost of prescription \n     medication has climbed at an astonishing rate, due in part to \n     increased utilization spurred by advertising and promotional \n     activities comparable to Hollywood's finest productions; and\n       Whereas, the FDA, under the purview and guidance of the \n     Clinton Administration, eliminated necessary restrictions on \n     drug advertising, thereby ending decades of consumer \n     protection; and\n       Whereas, the FDA, with the consent of the Clinton \n     Administration, allowed these dangerous and wasteful \n     practices to commence, making the United States the only \n     country in the world that allows direct-to-consumer \n     advertising of prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, Citizens for consumer Justice, a Statewide \n     consumer group, indicates that these promotions and \n     advertisements, not research and development, are the \n     pharmaceutical industry's fastest growing expenditure; and\n       Whereas, such increased advertising has been shown to be \n     effective in increasing market share since ten of the most \n     heavily advertised drugs account for almost 25% of total drug \n     expenditures; and\n       Whereas, the top 25 direct-to-consumer advertised drugs \n     posted sales growth totaling 43.2% in 1999 alone, and such \n     growth clearly exceeds the 13% growth posted by other \n     nonmarketed drugs; and\n       Whereas, increased advertising can create a demand for the \n     product rather than an actual medical need; and\n       Whereas, grave problems can arise when increased use is \n     merely the result of increased marketing with no \n     corresponding improvement in health; and\n       Whereas, it appears that increased marketing may prove to \n     be a more profitable investment for manufacturers than \n     further research and development; and\n       Whereas, in 1999 pharmaceutical companies spent 33 times as \n     much in the direct-to-consumer advertising as they did in \n     1993, causing expenditures to rise from $55 million to more \n     than $2 billion; and\n       Whereas, prescription drugs are now the fastest growing \n     segment of health care spending, rising 18% from $79 billion \n     in 1997 to $93.4 billion in 1998; and\n       Whereas, in 1999 spending rose 19% from the previous year, \n     and comparable increases are expected to occur in future \n     years; and\n       Whereas, an industry representative testified that the \n     introduction of a generic product immediately lowers a drug's \n     price by 30% to 80%; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Trade Commission has alleged that some \n     pharmaceutical companies have paid generic drug manufacturers \n     to forego or delay manufacturing of certain medications; and\n       Whereas, consumers in the United States pay more for the \n     same medication than consumers in other countries as a result \n     of these practices; and\n       Whereas, the runaway cost of prescription medications \n     affects all Americans, not just Pennsylvanians or the \n     elderly; and\n       Whereas, constant bombardment of drug advertisements has \n     the potential to have a serious negative effect on children \n     by giving them the distorted message that the consumption of \n     drugs is a desirable behavior which resolves all of life's \n     difficulties, which message is counterproductive at best and \n     counteracts government and community-based efforts to prevent \n     tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse by children; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania implore the Congress of the United States to \n     review the actions of the FDA, whose marketing guidelines \n     appear to promote and advance the best interests of the drug \n     companies and their advertising outlets rather than the \n     American consumer; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress and the FDA move to prohibit \n     direct consumer marketing or in the alternative to impose \n     tighter restrictions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress, each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-637. a joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Rhode Island relative to the Reauthorization \n     of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States twenty-five \n     years ago enacted the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) with a commitment of forty \n     percent (40%) federal funding of the costs of local school \n     districts and states in carrying out the mandates of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (``IDEA''); and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States recognized in \n     1994 the Congressional ``commitment of forty percent (40%) \n     federal funding'' and further recognized that it was only \n     federally funded at the rate of eight percent (8%) (20 U.S.C. \n     6062); and\n       Whereas, The federal appropriation of $5 billion for the \n     federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2000 is projected to \n     fund only 12.7% of the cost of carrying out the mandate of \n     IDEA and due to increasing costs, will probably provide even \n     less than 12.7% federal funding; and\n       Whereas, Local school districts in Rhode Island and \n     throughout the United States are mandated to meet the \n     spiraling costs of carrying out the provisions of IDEA; and\n       Whereas, The failure of the Congress of the United States \n     to fully fund its original commitment of forty percent (40%) \n     federal funding has placed a severe burden upon local school \n     districts to meet the costs of the federal mandate, resulting \n     in an insufferable burden upon local taxpayers and diversion \n     of funds from other education programs, thus lessening the \n     quality of education; and\n       Whereas, It is time now, twenty-five years after the \n     enactment of IDEA, that the Congress of the United States \n     appropriate the funds necessary to fully fund its original \n     commitment to provide forty percent (40%) federal funding of \n     the costs of carrying out the provisions of IDEA; now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly of the State of Rhode \n     Island and Providence Plantations hereby memorializes the \n     Congress of the United States during the reauthorization of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to fulfill \n     the original commitment of the Congress of the United States \n     to provide for forty percent (40%) federal funding to local \n     school districts to carry out the mandates of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit a duly certified copy of \n     this resolution to: (1) each member of the Rhode Island \n     delegation in the Congress of the United States;

A bill to provide for the establishment of an HMO Guaranty \nFund to provide payments to States to pay the outstanding health care \nprovider claims of insolvent health maintenance organizations; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        HMO Guaranty Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that I \nhope will help states which have been stricken by managed care plan \nfailures to overcome the devastating effects of such an event on the \nhealth insurance sector.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen an alarming upswing in the \nnumber of HMO failures across the nation. According to Weiss Rating, \nInc., the nation's only provider of financial safety ratings for HMO's, \nthe number of HMO failures grew 78 percent between 1998 and 1999. \nFurthermore, Weiss found another 10 HMO's were at high risk of failure \ndue to mounting losses and capital deficits. The growing financial \ninstability we are seeing in the managed care market has serious \nramifications for state insurance regulators, not to mention hundreds \nof thousands of Americans who rely on these plans for their health \ncare.\n  In light of this volatility in the health insurance market, I believe \nthat the Federal Government can be a constructive and stabilizing force \nfor states dealing with the aftermath of an HMO liquidation. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would create a mechanism that would \nprovide an added layer of protection for providers and subscribers when \na participant in the health insurance market fails. Specifically, the \nbill establishes an HMO Guaranty Fund, which would be used to pay \noutstanding health care providers' claims for uncovered expenditures \nand to fulfill contractual obligations made prior to an HMO's \nbankruptcy. For those families left without health insurance, the fund \nwould also subsidize temporary coverage for subscribers as they seek \nalternative sources of health insurance.\n  Many states have responded to a health plan insolvency and the unpaid \nbills they leave behind by creating a temporary fund designed to at \nleast partially reimburse hospitals and providers for the expenses \nincurred during the course of providing care to patients. These \nguaranty funds are typically financed by levying a fairly sizable fee \non the remaining health insurers in the state. While this may work in \nsome cases, it is not necessarily appropriate in every circumstance. In \nother words, not every health care provider and subscriber has the \nopportunity to access this kind of guaranty fund.\n  For instance, when Harvard Pilgrim Health Plan of New England failed \nin my home state of Rhode Island, there was discussion of setting up \njust such a fund. However, the extremely small size of our insurance \nmarket and the few plans that remained in operation simply could not \nsupport a bailout of this magnitude. Fortunately, the Rhode Island \nInsurance regulator was able to reach an agreement with the \nMassachusetts parent organization of Harvard Pilgrim to pay outstanding \nprovider and hospital claims. Unfortunately, other States might not be \nas lucky.\n  It is my view that the Federal Government may be better positioned \nthan an individual State to spread the risk and the premiums required \nto subsidize the fund across health insurance plans operating around \nthe country. Furthermore, it would also enable both ERISA and non-ERISA \nplans to be covered under a nationally-based standing fund.\n  I hope the legislation I am introducing today will mark the beginning \nof an ongoing discussion that will explore some of the issues \nsurrounding the financial health of HMO's in this Nation. In closing, \nMr. President, while it is unlikely that action will be taken on this \nlegislation late in the session. I look forward to working with \ninterested organizations as well as my colleagues to strengthen and \nenhance the legislation I submit today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to make \ninapplicable certain political broadcasting provisions to noncommercial \neducational broadcasting stations; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n             THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING INTEGRITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nBroadcasting Integrity Act of 2000, legislation that would make the \nFederal Communications Act's political broadcasting provisions \ninapplicable to noncommercial educational broadcasting stations.\n  I believe the current law is well-intentioned to serve the public \ninterest by allowing federal candidates to communicate their views to \nthe general public. However, these provisions are having some \nunfortunate side effects as federal candidates are exploiting loopholes \nin the Act to the detriment of public broadcasting. Many Vermonters and \nmy colleagues have seen in recent news reports that public radio and \ntelevision stations are being forced to give free, uncensored air time \nto any Federal candidate under provisions of the Federal Communications \nAct. As a strong supporter of public radio and television, I find this \nphenomenon disturbing.\n  I an concerned that this valuable public resource is being \ncommandeered and exploited as a way to get free advertising. Unlike \ncommercial stations, public radio and television are heavily dependent \non listener contributions. Many of these listeners are reconsidering \ntheir future financial support of these stations if this loophole is \nnot closed and programming is replaced by a flood of political \nadvertising. It seems inevitable that the number of candidates using \nthis avenue will increase dramatically in the next federal election \nunless we make this minor but important legislative correction.\n  Mr. President, we can not allow this to happen which is why I am \nintroducing this bill today. I believe this narrowly tailored \nlegislation will close this loophole and preserve the integrity of \npublic broadcasting. I call on my colleagues to join me and support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 3264. A bill to ensure that individuals with histories of mental \nillness and other persons prohibited from owning or possessing firearms \nare stopped from buying firearms by requiring instant background checks \nprior to making a firearms purchase, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the records access improvements act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, issues surrounding possession and \nownership of firearms have been some of the most divisive in this \nlegislative session and political season. Americans hold a wide range \nof differing opinions regarding gun rights and responsibilities, and \nthe proper balance of those rights against the need for public safety. \nBut, despite the larger differences, most Americans agree that there \nare common sense actions that can be implemented to protect the rights \nof law-abiding citizens while preventing those with criminal records or \nhistories of violent behavior from access to firearms.\n  I support the provision in federal law that prohibits certain people \nfrom owning or possessing firearms. Under current law, certain \ncategories of persons are unable to purchase guns. These include \nfelons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, the mentally \nincompetent, and persons convicted of crimes of domestic violence. \nThese proscriptions protect law-abiding citizens from those who have \ndemonstrated they cannot use firearms responsibly. This law protects \nlaw-abiding gun owners because the fewer people who criminally misuse \nguns, the less sentiment that there will be to impose more restrictions \non lawful gun owners.\n  In 1994, the Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \nAct that instituted a system to check whether a prospective gun \npurchaser, prior to the transfer of a firearms, is ineligible to \npossess a gun because he or she falls into one of the nine prohibited \ncategories. The permanent phase (phase II) of the Brady Act--that went \ninto effect November 30, 1998--requires an instant background check be \ndone on the buyer when a firearm is purchased from a licensed dealer. \nEither the State or the Federal Government conducts this check. This is \nto ensure that those prohibited by federal law from owning guns do not \npurchase them. It makes sense, and although the legislation was passed \nbefore I arrived in the Senate, I support the instant background check.\n  Since the implementation of the Brady Act in 1994, through the end of \ncalendar year 1999, 22 million background checks have been conducted on \npotential firearms purchasers. Of that 22 million, more than 536,000 \nindividuals were determined ineligible. And since phase II of the Brady \nAct went into effect in 1998--mandating Instant Background Checks in \nplace of checks with a mandatory waiting period--more than 8.6 million \nrequests for instant checks were received, with 2.4 percent of \napplicants being denied.\n  I would note that unfortunately, this Administration has chosen not \nto prosecute those felons for attempting to buy a gun, which is a \nfederal crime. Federal prosecutions have fallen at the same time \nbackground checks have given law enforcement a reliable tool for \ntracking down and locking up criminals trying to buy guns. In 1993, the \nClinton-Gore Administration prosecuted 633 people for trying to \nillegally purchase a gun. That fell to 279 in 1997 and rose to 405 in \n1999. From 1994 to 1999, the Administration prosecuted an average of \n404 defendants for violations of the gun purchasing law annually--a 36-\npercent drop from 1993. Obviously, we need to prosecute felons who are \nattempting to illegally buy guns.\n\n  But there is another hole in the current law. While the federal \ndatabase of state criminal records is fairly comprehensive, the same \ncannot be said of\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\nmental incompetency records. Forty-one states, including the State of \nMissouri, do not permit records of the criminally insane to be searched \nprior to a firearm sale. This is a travesty. The result of this \nloophole is that individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms \nbecause of mental impairment are allowed to slip through the cracks--\noften with tragic results.\n  In April of this year, the New York Times did a series of four \narticles on what they termed as ``rampage'' killings--multiple-victim \nkillings that were not primarily domestic or connected to a robbery or \ngang. The New York Times examined 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks in \na computer-assisted study including the shooting in 1999 at Columbine \nHigh School in Littleton, Colorado, a day-trading firm in Atlanta, and \na church in Fort Worth, Texas. The New York Times study found that at \nleast half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health \nproblems, and at least eight had been involuntarily committed. These \narticles highlight the difficulty of enforcing the provision of our gun \ncontrol laws that prohibits people who have been involuntarily \ncommitted to mental institutions from buying a handgun.\n  For example, Gracie Verduzco, was a 35-year-old paranoid \nschizophrenic who believed she had a transmitter in her left ear that \nreceived messages from a satellite and had been involuntarily \nhospitalized in Arizona twice. In addition, she had been committed to a \nmental hospital by a judge in the District of Columbia after she had \nthreatened President Clinton. Despite three involuntary commitments, \nshe was able to buy a .38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop in Tucson, \nArizona by lying on her gun application. She used it to kill one person \nand wound four others there on May 21, 1998.\n  According to the Justice Department, about 150,000 people a year are \ncommitted to mental institutions by court order in the United States. \nIn total, there are now perhaps 2.7 million people who have been \ninvoluntarily committed at some point in their lives and are therefore \nbarred by the federal law from buying a handgun. In response to some of \nthe highly publicized cases, authorities in nine states have allowed \nlaw enforcement agencies some form of access to mental health records. \nAnd the number of ineligible individuals who attempt to purchase guns \nhas been alarming. According to the Illinois State police, 3,699 people \nwere turned down in Illinois from 1996 to 1998, when records showed \nthey had been either voluntarily or involuntarily committed within the \nlast 5 years, the legal test under Illinois law. An additional 5,585 \npeople who were hospitalized from 1996 to 1998 were found to already \npossess gun permits, which as a result, were revoked.\n  The New York Times reported, ``But at the national level, as in most \nstates, there has been no comparable effort to create access to court \ncommitment records for gun checks. That lack of action is in stark \ncontrast to the long effort by gun control groups and the Clinton \nadministration in winning enactment of the Brady law to create \ndatabases screening out convicted felons, who like the involuntarily \ncommitted, were barred by the 1968 law from handgun purchases.''\n  If we are serious about reducing the criminal misuse of firearms, \nthis has to change. Federal law already makes the purchase or \npossession of firearms illegal for people the courts deem mentally \nincompetent, but the law is difficult, if not impossible to enforce \nbecause mental-health information is not currently part of \ncomputerized, instant background checks. That's why today I introduce \nthe Records Access Improvement Act, to encourage states to make certain \nmental health information available to the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System (NICS).\n  At present, the instant check system is administered jointly by the \nstates and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 15 states, state \nagencies serve as points of contact (POCs), and conduct full background \nchecks for both long guns and handguns. In 11 states, state agencies \nconduct partial background checks for handguns only. In POC states, \nfederal firearm licensees contact the state agency, rather than the \nFBI. In non-POC States, Federal firearm licensees contact the FBI \ndirectly through the NICS system. Over half of the applications for \nfirearm transfers were checked directly by the FBI, while the remainder \nof applications were checked by State or local agencies.\n  In February 2000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported \nthat the identification of non-felons ineligible to purchase firearms \nis likely to remain problematic under NICS. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics stated that new enabling statutes may be required to \nidentify and access such information.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is such a statute. \nSpecifically, this bill will encourage states to make the information \navailable to the NICS system by tying the receipt of grants made under \nthe Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to the provision of relevant \ndata to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. President, I don't think I will even need to take \n5 minutes tonight. There will be time tomorrow to discuss this \nconference report. Then, if there should be cloture, we will see. There \nis also up to 30 minutes for postcloture debate. There are a number of \nSenators who will have a lot to say about this bill.\n  I make one point tonight for colleagues because there will be plenty \nof opportunity to talk about it substantively later. This piece of \nlegislation that comes before the Senate is what I call the invasion of \nthe body snatchers. This was a State Department authorization bill that \nhas been completely gutted. There is not one word about the State \nDepartment in this bill. The only thing that is left is the bill \nnumber. Instead of the bankruptcy bill, it was put into this conference \nreport. This is hardly the way to legislate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. As I understand it, the conferees who were originally \nappointed to the foreign aid bill were not even informed of the \nconference. Not every conferee was informed of the new conference; am I \ncorrect in assuming that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator from New York that is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thought that was an important point that our own \nconferees were not told there was a conference to move this along.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This conference report is worse than the bill that \npassed the Senate. The Schumer provision was taken out. The Kohl \nprovision was taken out. It is absolutely amazing to me that we would \ntry to jam through a bill, which I believe is very harsh toward the \nmost vulnerable citizens, which purports to deal with the abuse--the \nAmerican Bankruptcy Institute states, at best, a 3-percent abuse--but, \nat the same time, enables people who have millions of dollars to buy \nluxurious homes in some States in the United States of America and \nshield all their assets from bankruptcy.\n  We do great for people who have millions of dollars to buy luxury \nhomes and shield themselves from any liability, but we are going to \npass a piece of legislation--and I will have the documentation tomorrow \nfrom bankruptcy professors, law professors, and judges across the \ncountry that have roundly condemned a piece of legislation that is one-\nsided--that doesn't call for the credit card companies to be \naccountable at all, is harsh in its impact on the most vulnerable \ncitizens, is opposed by the civil rights community broadly defined, \nwomen's organizations, consumer organizations, labor organizations, and \na good part of the religious community because of its one-sidedness. It \nis so harsh in its impacts on the most vulnerable citizens. I will lay \nthis case out because it claims to deal with the problem of widespread \nabuse. The American Bankruptcy Institute tells us at best we are \ntalking 3 percent. I have seen no high figures presented by anybody.\n  The bill now is worse than what Senators voted on on the floor of the \nSenate. Again, the process is absolutely outrageous. A State Department \nbill, on which hardly anybody was consulted, was completely gutted, and \na bankruptcy report put in instead.\n  I hope my colleagues will defeat this piece of legislation. I come to \nthe floor tonight to let Senators know there are a number of Senators \nready to debate. We will have much to say tomorrow. If there should be \ncloture--we will see--we will have much to say after that cloture vote \nas well. The more people in this country know the substance of this \npiece of legislation and the outrageous way this is being done, I think \nthe angrier people will become. It is important people in this country \nknow what this piece of legislation is about and the harsh impact it \nwill have on so many citizens--women, low-income people, moderate-\nincome people, working income people.\n\n  On this conference report, Senators who decided to do this, dared not \ndo anything about a family being able to take millions of dollars and \nshielding themselves from liability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I augment what my friend from Minnesota \nsaid about the bill. Aside from the procedural problems, I have never \nseen anything like this in the 20 years I have been in this Congress. \nAside from the other provisions, I want to talk about the amendment I \nhave added to this bill. Let's not forget, Senators, 80 Members voted \nfor that provision. I think 17 voted against the provision.\n  The bill that comes back is a different bill. The provision that I \nwrote into the bill which is so important deals with the use of \nbankruptcy as a way to violate the laws of this country.\n  Very simply, we passed a law a while ago called a face law. It gave \nwomen who sought to have abortions the ability to actually have what \ntheir lawful rights are. Blockaders started blockading the place. Then \nthey actually used violence to stop the right to choose, a \nconstitutionally given right.\n  The face law simply said the clinic could sue those who used violence \nor threat of violence against them--not people peacefully protesting; \nthat is their American right. I defend that no matter how much I \ndisagree with their position. All of a sudden, the right to choose was \nrestored. It had not been available in 80 percent of the counties in \nthis country because of the blockaders who believed, since they were \ngetting their message from God, they superseded the rest of us. That, \nof\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\ncourse, is dangerous thinking. Any one could believe if we have a \nmessage from God we ought to impose it on someone else, and we all have \ndifferent views of what God is telling us.\n  In any case, now they have found a new way to violate the law. That \nis to declare bankruptcy. Let me inform my colleagues of one case, the \nso-called Nuremberg files. The group put together on the Internet names \nand addresses of doctors, of their wives, of their children. When a \ndoctor was killed, as Dr. Slepian, in my home State of New York, near \nBuffalo, NY, they put an ``X'' next to his name. If a doctor was \ninjured, his named was shaded.\n  Those people were sued under the face law. Of course, the Oregon \ncourt in which they had the trial ruled they had violated the law. To \nnot pay judgment, each of them went back to their own States and \ndeclared bankruptcy. Whether the bankruptcy issue is held or not, this \nlittle clinic does not have the ability to go back to 12 or 13 \ndifferent States and pursue the same litigation all over again.\n  All our provision says is that you can't use bankruptcy for this. It \nwas never intended for this, just as you couldn't use it as a shield if \nyou were sued because of drunk driving. It is not pro-life or pro-\nchoice.\n  My lead cosponsor is Harry Reid, my friend and colleague, who \nbelieves as strongly in the pro-life movement as I believe in the pro-\nchoice movement. It is not partisan. Immediately, Senators Snowe, \nJeffords, and Collins joined us in cosponsoring the amendment. It \npassed in this body, supported by both pro-choice and pro-life \nSenators, 80-17.\n\n  This new little provision--it was taken out. To me, it is the most \nimportant provision in this bankruptcy bill. Yes, we need to change our \nbankruptcy laws for the better. I do not disagree with that. But to do \nit and do it in this way and not give the Senate its voice says to me: \nLet's go back to the drawing board and scrap it.\n  This is an issue that relates to the Constitution of the United \nStates itself, the rule of law. This is an issue that says if the \nConstitution grants you a right, we are not going to let cowards use \nthe bankruptcy law to hide behind, avoiding their just civil \npunishment. As the Senator from Minnesota said, you will hear from us \non this. If the people who were managing this bill cared so much about \npassing it, they should have kept the so-called Schumer amendment in \nthere. It would have been a lot easier to get things done. But that did \nnot happen, they could not and would not.\n  Because the amendment I have added addresses head-on this fundamental \nuse of the bankruptcy system, I will not rest until we do everything \nprocedurally possible to make sure that a bankruptcy reform package \nwithout it fails.\n\n  I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am disheartened to hear the Senator \nfrom New York would take such a strong position on this bill since he \nhad been an original promoter of it. It passed this body by 90 votes, \nat least twice, I think three different times--88 or 90 votes. It is \ngood to see Senator Grassley here, who was the prime sponsor of the \nlegislation. To have it die over this one issue is really unbelievable, \nparticularly since Senator Grassley and others have offered several \ndifferent ways we could meet the objections on the abortion clinic \nlanguage, which I consider to be awfully insignificant in the line of \nthe legislation except for the important philosophical and legal \npoints. I think it will be a tragedy if we do not.\n  This bill passed this body by around 90 votes, over 90 votes one \ntime--three different times. It has been debated in committee. If I am \nnot mistaken, the vote was 18-2 in committee, the Judiciary Committee, \non which Senator Grassley and I served and brought that bill out. It is \na bipartisan bill.\n  I, along with Senator Reid, got involved with working with the White \nHouse not long ago on reaffirmations, the one issue they said was left \nto settle, and we settled that issue to the satisfaction of the White \nHouse.\n  Now what do we have? A move to kill, once again, good bipartisan \nlegislation that has been overwhelmingly supported in this Senate. It \nis a shame and a disgrace. It is outrageous that somehow, some way, we \npassed this with veto-proof majorities and we are not able to get it up \nfor a last vote or get it passed.\n  I feel strongly about that. Maybe now we can get it out of here and \nthe President will see fit to sign it. The homestead language Senator \nWellstone mentioned, I agree with him. I think we ought to make bigger \nchanges in the provisions that say people can put all the money they \nwant to in a homestead and not have it taken from them in bankruptcy. \nYou could put $10 million in 160 acres and a mansion and you would not \nhave to give it up to pay your just debts to your doctor, to the gas \nstation down the street, to the friends from whom you borrowed money. \nThat is not right.\n  We made, though, for the first time, over the vigorous objections of \nseveral key States that have those kinds of provisions in their State \nConstitutions--Texas, Florida, Kansas--they fought tenaciously for \nthat, but we made historic progress in limiting the ability of a debtor \nto hide his assets in a multimillion-dollar mansion. That was a great \nstep forward. To say we ought to keep current law, which has no \ncontrols whatsoever, and not pass this bill, that has the first \nhistoric steps to control debt abuse, is really cutting off your nose \nto spite your face. That is the kind of thing we are hearing.\n  Let me tell you what this bill fundamentally does. It says if you are \nof median income--that is, $44,000 for a family of four--if you are a \nfamily of four and you are making below that $44,000, you can be \nbankrupt and not pay any of your debts, just as the current law says. \nBut if you are making above that and the judge concludes you can pay a \npart of your debts--10 percent or more--then he can order you to go \ninto chapter 13 and pay back some of the debts that you can pay back.\n\n  What is wrong with that? We have had a doubling of filings in \nbankruptcy over the last 10 years. We have over a million bankruptcies \nfiled per year. It is being done primarily because lawyers are \nadvertising. Turn on your TV anytime at night and you will see they are \nthere: ``Solve your debt problems, call Old John, 1-800. We will take \ncare of your debts.''\n  Do you know, if you owe $60,000 and you really don't want to pay that \n$60,000 debt, and today you are making $80,000, you can go down to a \nbankruptcy lawyer, file chapter 7, and wipe out that debt and not pay \none dime of it? You can do that. There is no control. It is being done \nall over America today and it is not right. What does that say to a \ngood, hard-working family who sits down around the kitchen table, pray \ntell, and tries to figure out how they can pay their debts? This family \ndoes not buy a new car, does not go on a vacation, does everything \nright, they pay their debts, and clever John goes down to the \nbankruptcy lawyer and doesn't pay his debt. Something is wrong in \nAmerica when we allow that kind of abuse to occur time and time again.\n  It is true--I do not believe it is 3 percent--the majority of people \nwho file bankruptcy will not be affected by this bill. But those who \nare abusing it will be. If you are a doctor and you are making $150,000 \na year and you owe $300,000 in student loans and other debts, and you \ncan pay $50,000 of that, shouldn't you be required to pay it? We have \nexamples of physicians declaring bankruptcy against all their debts \nwhen they could have easily paid a substantial number of them. Why \nshouldn't they pay what they can pay?\n  In America, we believe if you are hopelessly in debt and you cannot \npay out, we give people--and we always have--the right to file \nbankruptcy. It is just that it has become so common, the process of \nadvertising and filings. The numbers are going up. While the economy is \nhitting records we have never had before, filings in bankruptcy keep \ngoing up. What is going to happen when we have a serious problem in \nthis country?\n  We have worked hard. I put in a provision that says before you file \nbankruptcy, you ought to talk to a credit counseling agency. Credit \ncounseling agencies actually help people who are in debt. They help \nthem set up budgets, they advise them whether or not they can pay off \ntheir debts. If not, they will go to a lawyer and file bankruptcy. But \nif they could pay it off, pay down the\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\nhigh interest notes first, negotiate with creditors, set up a payment \nplan, get the whole family in--if there is a drug problem, gain \ntreatment; if there is a mental health problem, get treatment. Gamblers \nAnonymous can be used for people who have these problems. A lot of \nthese things are driving bankruptcy.\n  None of that is occurring in bankruptcy court. Lawyers come in, they \nclaim a $1,000 fee, or $2,000, or whatever, and their secretaries fill \nout the forms. They don't even meet the client until they get to court. \nThe judge declares all their debts wiped out, and they walk out of \ncourt. That is not helping treat the root cause. But credit counseling \ndoes. It says: We respect you, American men and women. We want to help \nyou get your financial house in order, and if you can avoid bankruptcy, \nwe will show you how and help you do that. That is a good step in the \nright direction.\n\n  There are a lot of other things in this bankruptcy bill that improve \nthe law. It has not been changed in over 25 years. We have new \nexperience with the law. We have seen a host of abuses of the law, \nloopholes through which people are driving trucks. We closed those \nloopholes.\n  For the most part, it has been overwhelmingly received by everybody \nin this body. Over 90 Senators in this Senate have voted for it, \nDemocrats and Republicans. The White House has approved all of these.\n  We have a problem with bankruptcy. We can do better. This bill is \nfair. It raises protections for women and children far above anything \nbefore.\n  Before, lawyers and other debts were paid before child support. In \nthis bill, alimony and child support are raised to the highest level. \nThe first money paid goes to pay child support. That is a big, positive \nchange. By killing this bill, that will not happen. The old rules will \nbe in effect and children and women will not get that preferential \ntreatment.\n  We can do better. This is a good bill. I think the President will \nreconsider. He has been involved in this process for well over 3 years, \nas we have been wrestling with it, having hearings and debates on this \nfloor and in the House. To say this is sneaking the bill in is really \nunbelievable. It has been a source of regular debate and bipartisan \nagreement, and now we get to the very last of this session and see an \neffort to derail it over this odd idea that out of all the activities \nin America, if you get sued by an abortion clinic, you cannot file for \nbankruptcy.\n  One of the suggestions I made and others have made is, what about a \nunion group that tears down a business? What about a group of \nenvironmental activists that tears up and protests and illegally does \nbusiness? Do they get to claim bankruptcy against their debts, but not \nthose who go to an abortion clinic because they are religious, I \nsuppose?\n  Why should we have such a double standard, a political law in \nbankruptcy? That is a political act, not something that ought to be in \nthe bankruptcy court of America.\n  I said if you either take it out or draw it broadly and it covers \nsimilar acts by other groups, then I will support it, but I am not \ngoing to vote for a law that simply targets one group that one Senator \ndoes not like. What is right about that? How is that good law? Some \nSenators and the President do not like abortion protesters. I guess he \nthinks they are too religious, so they do not get to claim bankruptcy, \nbut everybody else does. People who put metal spikes in trees that \ninjure people in the forest business, I guess they do not count.\n  That is where we are on this. That is such an infinitesimal problem \nwhich we can overcome, unless the real agenda is to see bankruptcy does \nnot pass. I hope that is not so. We have gone too far. We have worked \ntoo hard. We have a bill that has bipartisan support. I am hopeful yet \nthat the President will sign it, and it will be good for America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/30/senate-section/article/S11381-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 2 P.M.
