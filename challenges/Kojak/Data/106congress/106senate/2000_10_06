Mr. President, the Congress has wisely passed and will \nsend to the President for signature H.R. 4733, the energy and water \ndevelopment appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. I strongly urge \nthe President to sign this vital legislation.\n  Proper management of our Nation's rivers is a concern for many \nAmericans. Our rivers provide us drinking water, transportation, and \nrecreation. They also provide habitat for aquatic life, wildlife, and \nbirds. Good management techniques provide that all of these purposes \nare taken into account and managed appropriately and fairly. I firmly \nbelieve that H.R. 4733 provides for good river management. \nSpecifically, section 103 prohibits the use of funds to revise the \nMissouri River Master Water Control Manual if the revision provides for \nincreases in springtime water releases during spring\nN O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy. The cost for \nthe microfiche edition will remain $141 per year with single copies \nremaining $1.50 per issue. This price increase is necessary based \nupon the cost of printing and distribution.                          \n                                    Michael F. DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\n\nheavy rainfall or snow melt. Many Iowans see this as just good common \nsense.\n  Increased spring water releases could easily cause the wild Missouri, \nand its many tributaries, to once again flood low-lying areas, \nincluding farmland and communities. Floods would cause a severe \neconomic hardship on those affected. Farmers would be unable to plant \ncrops, and home and business owners would experience property damage. \nEconomic activity in the flood areas would decrease or cease during and \nimmediately after the flooding, causing a loss of income for those \nimpacted.\n  Many Americans forget what it was like to live along the Missouri \nprior to the construction of the dams. They forgot that the Missouri \nwas truly wild. They forgot what it was like not to be able to safely \nplant your crops, grow them with some security that there would not be \nsummer floods, and then be able to harvest them safely. They forgot \nwhat it was like to lose all or part of a crop. That meant the loss of \nyour investment in time, labor, seed and other inputs. And that meant \nno income coming in after the harvest.\n  The folks in town were hurt, too. Houses and businesses were swept \naway. Basements were flooded with water, muck and other debris. \nSometimes the water level went higher than that to the first floor, or \neven higher. Furniture and family keepsakes were destroyed. Businesses \nlost inventories. They could not serve their customers if the store was \nclosed. Public drinking water system suffered damage, as did sewer \nsystems. The economic devastation was high. The quality of life \nsuffered. Increased spring water releases would also cause less water \nto be released during the summer months. The lower river levels would \nhalt river barge transportation. Barges are a key part of the \nagricultural transportation system. Loss of barge traffic would \ndelivery the western part of America's great grain belt into the \nmonopolistic hands of the rail roads. Iowa farmers have clearly told me \nthat this is unacceptable.\n  Loss of the use of barges to transport agricultural commodities will \ndrive up farm transportation prices. That in turn will drive up the \noverall price of our agricultural goods that must compete in the \ninternational marketplace. This is unfair to our hardworking farmers, \nas it puts them in jeopardy of losing markets.\n  While the farm crops travel down-river to reach markets, the loss of \nbarge traffic would also affect bulk commodities and other items that \ntravel up-river to Iowa. They include fertilizer for farm use, salt for \nhighways in winter, steel for processing plants, and the like. The \npotential for moving cement for construction purposes would also be \nlost with lower summer water levels. I have talked to many Iowans who \nlive along the Missouri River. They have told me of the devastation \nleft from past floods. That devastation was more than economic. It \nproduced heartache and broken dreams. Though Iowans are a strong \npeople, the past floods have left their scars on individuals and in \ncommunity life. Those Iowans have joined together on a nonpartisan \nbasis to say, ``No more floods!'' That is the message for the President \nto consider as he deliberates on the energy and water appropriations \nbill. The President is in a powerful position to either do good or to \ninflict harm. It is almost as if he were actually God, able to exercise \nthe power to flood or not to flood. That is how powerful he is on this \nissue. It is an awesome power that I hope that he uses wisely. It is my \nhope that he will decide to prevent flooding. It is my hope that he \nwill listen to our farmers and not make their jobs more difficult than \nthey already are. It is my hope that he will sign this bill.\n  Mr. President, let the people live in their homes, work in their \nbusinesses and farm their farms in safety.\n  Clearly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has violated Federal law \nin its ordering of the Corps of Engineers to begin a spring flood. It \nignored the process set forth in the Endangered Species Act. These \nprocesses are there to protect everyone, and they were not followed. It \nhas also based much of its opinion on speculation, not facts. The \nPresident must depend upon facts and protect due process. H.R. 4733 is \ngood legislation which should be signed into law. It does not deserve a \nveto. Mr. President, please sign this important legislation.\n  President Clinton, one time, in private conversation with me, you \ntold me how you understood the problems of the farmers more than most \nPresidents ever did because you had studied them so much.\n  Mr. President, you have been in the White House 8 years. I do not \nknow how long it has been since you have visited a supermarket. But \nremember, food grows on farms, it does not grow in supermarkets. You \nhave an opportunity here to help the farmers in the States of Iowa, \nNebraska, Kansas, and Missouri to be able to put their crops in in the \nspring, to be able to take those crops out in the fall, to be able to \nship the harvest down the river when it is most needed, so that the \nfarmers are not the captives of a monopolistic railroad if the barge \ntraffic isn't there for competition.\n  So, Mr. President, show us that you do, in fact, understand the \nproblems of the farmers and sign this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know Members are waiting to determine \nwhether or not we are going to have a vote today. The majority leader \nhas indicated we likely will have one. From the minority's perspective, \nwe badly want to move to the Transportation appropriations bill which, \nas we speak, the House is discussing.\n  But we have a number of Members who are rightfully unwilling to do \nthat until we get the legislation and are able to look at the \nconference report, which we don't now have. I hope we can start talking \nabout the conference report, with the hope of getting the actual \ndocument as soon as possible so that Senators can look at it.\n  I know one Senator indicated he would like to be able to have a day \nto look at the conference report. I will check with this Senator and \nothers to see if that can be expedited, if they have an opportunity to \nreview the conference report.\n  In short, the minority is saying that we are ready to move forward \nand we are willing, in the late days of the session, to expedite things \nas much as we can, but there are certain basic things we need to read, \nsuch as a bill or a conference report, before we vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10038-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10038-S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSMAN SIDNEY YATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to report to the Senate \nand to the Congress that I learned a few moments ago that one of the \ngreatest servants of the American people in the Congress in the 20th \ncentury passed away last night.\n  Sidney Yates was a Congressman from the city of Chicago who was \nelected in 1948 and served until 1999, with only 2 years that he wasn't \nin service. His was an amazing story. I guess it was a great story of \nAmerica. His mother and father were Russian immigrants who came to this \ncountry in the beginning of the last century. He grew up in the city of \nChicago and went to law school. Before that, he distinguished himself, \nas hard as it may be to understand today, in athletics. He was a semi-\npro basketball player and was a member of a Big Ten basketball team \nwhen he was a student at the University of Chicago. His semi-pro \nbasketball team was called the Lifschultz Fast Freighters. I used to \njoke with him about this trucking company and the fact that he was the \nbasketball star for them in the city of Chicago.\n  On an impulse, in 1948, he decided to run for Congress. It didn't \nlook like a very good year. Tom Dewey was supposed to be elected \nPresident, and this young man who had never run for office before was \ngoing to try to be elected to the House of Representatives. People \ndidn't give him much of a chance, and his style of campaigning was in \nsharp contrast with what we do today. I asked him how he ran for office \nin 1948. He said he had a buddy who\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\nplayed a guitar and they went from one ward meeting to the next singing \nethnic folk songs for the groups there. If there was a German group, he \nsang in German. If it was a group of his fellow Jewish Americans, he \nsang something they would find appealing.\n  There was a young lady watching that campaign by the name of Mary \nBain. She had volunteered to work on the Truman campaign. She saw this \nyoung man in 1948 wandering around Chicago running for Congress and, \nfrankly, took pity on him and said, ``I am going to try to help this \nfellow.'' To everyone's surprise, he won in 1948 and came to the House \nof Representatives; he began a long term of service there. His term of \nservice included many years on the House Appropriations Committee. He \nwas a stalwart, a fighter, a person of real value and principle.\n  In 1962, Sid Yates was persuaded to leave the House of \nRepresentatives and run for the Senate. He ran against Everett M. \nDirksen--no small task even in 1962. He lost that race, which was the \nonly loss in his political life. In 1964, he returned to the House of \nRepresentatives and once again took up service on the House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I was elected many years later, in 1982, and a couple years after \nthat began to serve on that same Appropriations Committee. Probably the \nbest fortune I had as a Member of Congress was when I decided to take a \nchair next to Sid Yates in the Appropriations Committee and sit next to \nthis great man for more than a decade. I learned so much and had such a \ngreat time in that experience because of who Sid Yates was and what he \nstood for.\n  When you look back at Sid's career, there were several things that \nreally made a difference to him, meant a lot to him, and made a \ndifference in this country. He had a passionate commitment to the arts. \nYou know, that gets to be controversial from time to time. The National \nEndowment for the Arts is occasionally a whipping boy here on Capitol \nHill. But Sid Yates never faltered. He believed in the arts. He was a \nman of the arts. I used to love to listen to him quote the classics \nfrom memory. His knowledge of art and music was absolutely legendary.\n  When Sid retired from the House of Representatives, the tributes came \npouring in, but particularly from people around the United States who \nunderstood that Sid Yates stood up and defended the arts in America \nwhen nobody else would. My daughter is an art student at the Art \nInstitute of Chicago. She knew of Sid Yates. She never met him \npersonally, but she knew what he stood for. He was always there \nfighting for the National Endowment for the Arts and for arts in \nAmerica.\n\n  As chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of Appropriations, he also \nhad the responsibility to protect America's national parks and many of \nour national treasures. He protected them with a vengeance. I can \nrecall some of the titanic struggles in the Appropriations Committee \nwhen people would want to exploit America's national treasures. They \ndidn't have a chance when they fought Sid Yates.\n  There were so many other areas where he worked so hard. I recall the \ncreation of the Holocaust Museum. Sid was devoted to the nation of \nIsrael. So many people across America looked to him, and so many \nMembers of Congress looked to him for guidance on important issues \ninvolving the Middle East. When he was asked to be part of the creation \nof the Holocaust Museum, you just knew it would be a success, as it has \nbeen here in Washington, DC. He was one of the founding members on the \nboard of directors there and a person absolutely revered for his \ncommitment in that regard.\n  Through it all, too, he was committed to the rights and freedoms of \nAmericans. I know it wasn't always popular, but you could count on him \nto stand up, in good times and in bad, for the freedoms that were \nguaranteed under the Bill of Rights. Sid Yates was a great man, and he \nhad a great partner in life in his wife Addie, who was always by his \nside during his public service.\n  I once asked him what his greatest achievement was in the Congress, \nand I was surprised that he said: Well, you would not think of it when \nyou think of me as a Democrat, but back in the 1950s, the atomic \nsubmarine program was being debated in America, and a fellow by the \nname of Hyman Rickover was being criticized on Capitol Hill. I came to \nhis defense because I thought he was a good man and had a good program. \nI am proudest of that moment.\n  I never would have guessed that, but that was just part of Sid's \ncareer. For over 50 years, Sid Yates was fighting for America, fighting \nfor Chicago. He left his mark on the Chicago shoreline and the museums \nand institutions of that great city. But most of all, he left his mark \nin our hearts--those of us who had the good fortune of serving with \nhim, learning from him, and standing today in tribute to his great \nmemory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the morning \nhour be extended for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say, before my friend from \nIllinois leaves the floor, that I had the pleasure of serving with Sid \nYates. I served with him in the House, of course, but didn't know him \nvery well in that large body. I came to know him better after coming to \nthe Senate and being a member of the Interior Subcommittee on \nAppropriations while he was chairman of that committee on the House \nside.\n  We worked very closely together. Everything the Senator from Illinois \nhas said is absolutely true about Sid Yates. He was a distinguished \nman, and a distinguished looking man. When he left the House, he was \nalmost 90 years old; handsome; stood tall; never faltered a word of his \nspeech.\n  Being from the western part of the United States, I will never forget \nSid Yates. He stood for the West. He loved the wilderness, and he \nhelped us protect the pristine wilderness of Nevada and other places in \nthe West. Native Americans never had a better friend in the Congress \nthan Sid Yates.\n  I didn't know Sid Yates as well as my friend from Illinois, but I \nhave great respect and admiration for Sid Yates, and I will never \nforget him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator from Nevada for his comments. I think each one of us who served \nwith Sid Yates on either side of the aisle will never forget him. When \nhis retirement came about, Congressman Ralph Regula, a Republican from \nOhio, never missed a retirement event for Sid Yates. I think it showed \nthat he reached across the aisle and established friendships and \nalliances that were not just good for Congress but were good for \nAmerica. He was a wonderful man. I am blessed to have known him, to \nhave served with him, and perhaps to have learned a few lessons at his \nside.\n  I think his legacy will be his efforts for education, for defense of \nthe arts, for defense of the environment, and for the rights of \nAmericans.\n  Our condolences go to Addie and his family. We wish them strength in \nthis time of loss and tell them we stand by their side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10039-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the reason I am objecting to taking up the \nDepartment of Transportation appropriations report is that it contains \na substantive amendment to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The \nlegislation was never approved by either House or Senate commerce \ncommittees and failed in its attempts to correct indisputable faults \nwith safety data collection and retention practices of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  Well over 100 Americans have died, and estimates are that as many as \n150 in other countries. This is a very serious safety issue in which \nAmerican lives are at stake.\n  I am simply asking to take up this legislation. I will be glad to \nhave any amendments and time agreements associated with it--anything \nthat we can do to move this legislation along.\n  The House Commerce Committee yesterday passed similar legislation. We \nare told it will be passed on the floor of the House by next Tuesday.\n  Why we can't take up this bill, which is designed according to \nconsumer organizations, according to the Secretary of Transportation, \naccording to all outside observers and safety experts, to stop or at \nleast take action to reduce the number of American lives that will be \nlost on the highways of the United States of America is really hard to \nunderstand.\n  Let me do the best I can to explain it.\n  What is happening here is the ``fix is in.'' Here is the fix. The \nHouse will pass a bill. The Commerce Committee passed a bill, and the \nHouse will pass that bill this week.\n  We have a series of holds on this legislation which passed the \nCommerce Committee by a vote of 20-0 in a bipartisan fashion after \ngetting testimony from experts from all over America, from the \nSecretary of Transportation, from the Acting Director of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, and others. That bill is now on \nthe calendar. There are holds on the bill.\n  Here is the fix. The House will pass the bill. The Senate will refuse \nto take up the bill because of holds, and we will then pass--no matter \nhow hard I try to prevent it--the Department of Transportation \nappropriations safety report that contains simply language concerning \nwhat can be done about this issue.\n  I have taken the floor on many, many occasions to talk about the \ninfluence of special interests in Washington. The automotive industry \nis now blocking this legislation. The word is on the street. The \n``fix'' is in that the bill will not pass the Senate, or pass the House \nso House Members can say we did what we needed to do.\n  You know what we are talking about here. We are talking about the \nlives of American citizens who are in danger as we speak. The special \ninterests will now prevail over safety interests, where lives of \nAmericans are literally at stake. Remarkable. Remarkable commentary. \nRemarkable.\n\n  I have a letter and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 5, 2000.\n     Hon.

It reads:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain and Senator Hollings: We are writing in \n     support of your decision to halt the FY 2001 Department of \n     Transportation Appropriations bill pending Senate action on \n     the Ford/Firestone amendments to the Motor Vehicle Safety \n     Act.

I don't think many American citizens would approve \nof the Senate blocking legislation which is designed to save lives.\n  There may be a couple of controversial aspects of this bill, although \nit passed out of the Commerce Committee unanimously. There may be a \ncouple of controversial aspects of this bill. Fine, let's have \namendments and time agreements. We can dispose of those controversial \naspects of it in a matter of a few hours. I eagerly welcome such a \nthing. The Senator from Alaska has just objected to us taking up this \nlegislation which we could dispose of in a few hours. The lives of \nAmerican citizens are at stake here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For one moment for clarification on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Alaska has just objected to us moving \nforward with legislation which, in the view of any outside expert, has \nto do with American lives that are endangered on the highways of \nAmerica due to a flaw in the Bridgestone/Firestone situation and/or \nFord automobiles.\n  This is serious business. This is serious business. There has been a \nseries of holds put on this bill. We now object to taking up this \nlegislation in favor of an appropriations bill which has watered down \nlanguage which is intended--at least in the view of some--to address \npart of the problem. It does not. Ask any safety expert. It does not.\n  As to the language that has been inserted in the conference bill, I \nguess we can all thank the advocates of safety for the provision that \nwas in the bill that prevented the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration from addressing rollover accidents for a year until a \nNational Academy of Sciences study was completed--again, the special \ninterests.\n  I intend to do whatever I can to see this legislation is brought up \nbefore the Senate. I hope those Senators who have a hold on this bill \nwill step forward and identify themselves. This isn't an ordinary piece \nof legislation. This is a piece of legislation that has to do with the \nlives of American citizens and those overseas. I don't know of a more \ncompelling problem.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Department of \nTransportation appropriations report that contains a substantive \namendment to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. This legislation was \nnever approved by either the House or Senate Commerce committees and it \nfails in its attempt to correct indisputable flaws with the safety-\nrelated data collection and retention practices of the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration.\n  The language contained in the appropriations report falls short of \nthe mark\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\nfor many reasons, but for now, I will list only the key shortcomings. \nFirst, it fails to require manufacturers to collect and report \nessential safety-related information that would allow the Secretary to \nidentify potential consumer-safety issues. Second, it fails to increase \npenalties for violations of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. And \nthird, the language does not require NHTSA to upgrade the 30-year-old \nfederal tire-safety standard.\n  Prompted by an August 9, 2000, announcement by Ford Motor Company and \nBridgestone/Firestone to recall millions of potentially defective \ntires, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation \nheld a September 12th hearing that was attended by the Secretary of \nTransportation, NHTSA's Acting Administrator, the parties involved in \nthe recall, and several consumer groups. All who testified agreed that \nsystemic changes were needed to make the processes of sharing safety-\nrelated information more efficient. In response, on September 15th, \njoined by my colleagues, Senators Gorton and Specter, I introduced S. \n3059, the ``Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Equipment Defect \nNotification Improvement Act.'' This bill would dramatically amend the \ncurrent law by ensuring NHTSA's possession of critical information \nregarding motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment that would enable \nit to make sound safety-related decisions.\n  Following the introduction of S. 3059, the House Commerce Committee \nbegan consideration of H.R. 5164, the ``Transportation Recall \nEnhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act,'' also referred to \nas ``T.R.E.A.D.'' While the House's bill does not appear to be entirely \nadequate to correct the current law, it does seek to accomplish similar \nobjectives as S. 3059. Therefore, I was encouraged by the possibility \nof compromise prior to the conclusion of the 106th Congress. However, \ndue to the limited amount of time remaining prior to the adjournment of \nthis Congress, the differences of the House bill, and the unapproved \nactions taken by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation, I offer today a narrower version of S. 3059 that I hope \nthat my colleagues would support.\n  Mr. President, I would like to outline what the new version of the \nbill would do:\n  Reporting requirements: The bill would direct the Secretary to \ncollect additional safety-related information from manufacturers; \nspecifically, it would mandate that the Secretary require manufacturers \nto collect and report new information about defects--\nincluding information about foreign recalls, but only to the extent \nthat the information may assist in the identification of potential \ndefects related to motor vehicle safety or failures to meet the federal \nmotor vehicle safety standards. This information would include \naccidents or incidents, claims data, warranty adjustment data, and \nother safety-related information. The method, manner and extent of the \ncollection of this data would be determined through rulemaking by the \nSecretary.\n\n  Civil penalties: This legislation would increase the Motor Vehicle \nSafety chapter's maximum civil penalty from $800,000 to $15,000,000, \nand allow for the assessment of larger civil penalties for intentional \nand willful acts.\n  Criminal penalties: The Secretary would be authorized to assess \ncriminal penalties for knowingly violating provisions of the Motor \nVehicle Safety Act, which results in death or grievous bodily harm. \nThis provision of the bill has been the subject of much discussion. Let \nme briefly describe what would be required for a manufacturer to be \nsubject to criminal penalties under this section. The manufacturer, \ntheir officers or directors, would have to order, authorize, or ratify \nthe introduction of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment into \ninterstate commerce while knowing that the motor vehicle or equipment \nviolated federal safety standards, that violation created a serious \ndanger of an accident that would result in death or serious injury, and \ndeath or such injury occurs. Let me be clear, the standard required \nunder this provision is ``actual knowledge.'' This provision is \nintended to provide the option of criminal penalties only in instances \nof conduct that are so egregious as to render civil penalties \nmeaningless.\n  The inclusion of a criminal penalties provision has received support \nfrom the Secretary of Transportation, Jacques Nasser, who is the \nPresident and CEO of Ford Motor Company, and consumer groups such as \nPublic Citizen. This type of penalty is not novel. Multiple agencies \nare authorized to assess criminal penalties, including, among others, \nthe Department of Labor, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the \nFood and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis provision would authorize the Secretary, in conjunction with the \nU.S. Attorney General, to pursue criminal penalties against automobile \nmanufacturers in instances where State governments may not have the \nresources to enforce their relevant law.\n  Updating safety standards: Finally, this bill would require NHTSA to \nupgrade the tire-safety standard for the first time in 30 years.\n  Regardless of whether the House or Senate version of the bill is \nenacted, the need for this legislation was triggered by the possibility \nthat Ford and Bridgstone/Firestone may have had knowledge of a safety-\nrelated problem concerning the performance of certain tire models prior \nto the recall, but refrained from reporting even the possibility of a \ndefect to NHTSA. Notwithstanding whether or not the manufacturers knew \nof the problem, the situation focused my attention, as well as the \nattention of my colleagues, to flaws that exist in the reporting \nprocesses between manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle \nequipment, and NHTSA. S. 3059 would amend the Federal Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act to make it more difficult for manufacturers to knowingly \nconceal safety-related information from the Secretary of Transportation \nand increase the penalties for such unlawful conduct.\n\n  Under current law, manufacturers are not required to report to NHTSA \neither ``claims data,'' which include personal injury or property \ndamage claims that can be helpful early-warning indicators of potential \nthreats to consumer safety, or overseas actions involving equipment and \nvehicles sold in the United States. Furthermore, should manufacturers \nfail to report safety-related information that is required by the \nSecretary, the maximum civil penalty allowable under the current law is \na mere $980,000. To put this in perspective, last year Ford Motor \nCompany spent $2.57 billion on advertising. Other than minor \nadjustments over the last two years, the maximum civil penalty has not \nbeen updated since its enactment, which means, at a minimum, if \nadjusted for inflation it should be five times that amount in the year \n2000. Finally, the current law does not allow for the assessment of \ncriminal penalties for particularly egregious conduct. The absence of \ncriminal penalties coupled with a nominal maximum civil penalty creates \nan environment where meaningful enforcement is impossible commonplace. \nThis bill would change that practice.\n  Mr. President, thus far, NHTSA has linked more than 100 deaths to the \nfailures of Bridgestone/Firestone tires that are subject to the current \nrecall. Each day it becomes more apparent that these deaths may have \nbeen avoided had NHTSA possessed vital safety-related information that \nthe law does not currently require manufacturers to report. The \nlegislation that I have introduced does not accomplish all of the \nneeded reforms, but it is a positive step toward a more efficient \nexchange of safety-related information between the Secretary and \nmanufacturers. Nevertheless, S. 3059 is being held up partly due to the \ninfluence of the automotive industry. The lives of American consumers \nare being placed at risk. We must act quickly to resolve the flaws in \nNHTSA's data-collection processes and prevent the recurrence of this \ncrisis.\n  I express my deep disappointment that the ``fix'' is in from the \nspecial interests. This bill will be held and will not be passed by the \nSenate; it will be passed by the House. Guess what. We couldn't do \nanything. I hope the American people are well informed by the media and \nby those family members who have lost loved ones and by the public \nsafety advocate who see what is happening here. It is not my proudest \nmoment in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended to the hour of 11 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield, just so I can enter into a colloquy \nwith my friend?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to Senator Stevens, the problem we are having on this \nside, as I know you are having on your side of the aisle, is whether \nthere is going to be any votes this morning. Would you be able to \ndetermine that quickly from your leader, as to whether or not there is \ngoing to be a vote? We have a number of Senators, with the holiday \ncoming up, with places to go. We need to know whether there is going to \nbe a vote this morning.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say with due respect to my friend--and despite words \nat times, he is my friend--I believe the Senator from Arizona would \nhave to answer that. It is our intention, once the papers are here, to \nmove to proceed to that conference report. That is not a debatable \nitem. There would be a vote immediately. After that, the conference \nreport would be before the Senate, I would ask for the yeas and nays, \nand it would be a matter of time, how much time the Senator from \nArizona wishes to debate the bill.\n  I know of no other speakers.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to my friend from Arizona and there is no \nquestion he is going to want to speak for more than a half-hour or an \nhour.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would expect that. I honor his right to do so. It \nwould be my predilection that you should address that to the leader. \nThe question is how late in the day would the Senator from Arizona \nfinish his brief comments?\n  Mr. REID. If, in fact, he would finish today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is for the Senator from Arizona to determine.\n  Mr. REID. I guess my question to the Senator from Alaska is, if we do \nnot vote on that, does the majority leader want us to vote on something \nelse today? I hope in the next few minutes there could be a \ndetermination made as to whether or not, around 11 o'clock when we \nfinish morning business, there will be a vote on something other than \nthe Transportation appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I might say to my good friend from Nevada, and to the \nSenate as a whole, it has been my request to the leader that we proceed \nwith appropriations bills and only appropriations bills so we can get \nthem to the President. We have been doing that. We do have other \nappropriations bills on the move now. The Agriculture conference was \nfinished last evening. I do not think we can get to that today. But I \ndo believe we should try to finish the Transportation bill today if we \ncan and take up Agriculture appropriations next week.\n\n  We have three other conferences that are going forward and we do, I \nunderstand, have an agreement now--nearly an agreement on how to handle \nthe VA-HUD bill. So we should be voting on several bills early next \nweek. But I do not know of any other bill that we can get before the \nSenate today in the form of a conference report. I do think we could \nhandle the VA-HUD bill if we could round up that agreement. It is still \nwaiting for one clearance. I doubt we will finish that one today. We \nshould take that up early next week, however.\n  Mr. REID. It sounds to me it is fairly safe to assume there will not \nbe any votes on appropriations bills today. As I said, I have spoken to \nmy friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If my friend will yield, I am seeking agreement to take \nup this legislation on which American lives are at stake--not money but \nsafety and lives of Americans. I am seeking an agreement to take that \nup. If we could get agreement to get that bill up, with relevant \namendments, then I will be more than happy to not impede the work of \nthe Senate.\n  I do not know of a higher priority than to take up legislation about \na compelling issue that has to do with the lives of the American \npeople. So I hope we could get an agreement to take up that \nlegislation, either now or in the next several days. Then I would \ncertainly remove my objections to proceeding with an appropriations \nbill. Apparently, that is not the case because there are ``rolling \nholds'' on this legislation. I think that is really quite remarkable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arizona knows, I am a \nmember of the conference committee, and I support the legislation he \nmentions. But I also know portions of it are in this bill and were \nagreed to by the Transportation conference committee, and the matter he \nsuggests is a leadership issue. I am in no position to negotiate on \nwhen the bill, that I also support, would come up. But I do believe our \nproblem is trying to get this bill on its way. We cannot flood the \nWhite House with bills, appropriations bills, and expect to get answers \nin time.\n  We are trying to get them down day by day so we can get some timing \nand get some response. If the President wishes to veto them, we will \nhave to come back and deal with those, too.\n  But we are trying to move this bill. This bill is ready to go. The \nTransportation bill is ready to go. It contains a portion of the bill \nthe Senator from Arizona has mentioned--not all of it but a portion of \nit. It is not negative, but it is not totally positive.\n  I do believe the issue he reaches, whether or not the Senate will \nallow the consideration of the bill--that is under consideration now in \nthe House--at any particular time, is a matter for the leader to \ndetermine, not for me. I would like to move forward with this \nTransportation bill. I urge my friend to allow us to do that because it \nis a significant bill, one of the most significant Transportation bills \non which I have been privileged to work. It sets a new process for \ntrying to reduce the increasing numbers of drunken drivers on our \nhighways.\n\n  If there is a safety problem out there that is greater than the one \nthe Senator from Arizona mentioned, it is alcohol. I do not want to see \nthis bill delayed. I would like to see it get to the President. I am \ninformed the President will sign it. I hope he will. We could get\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\nit to him today if the Senator from Arizona will allow us to do that. \nBut for now, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No, no.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Pardon me. I do thank the Senator for yielding. I \napologize and yield back to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nMinnesota has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor. I know his \nurgency, being able to speak for up to 10 minutes, but there are a \nnumber of Senators who are concerned about whether or not we are going \nto have a vote. It appears, based on what the Senator from Alaska said \nand interchanges with the Senator from Arizona, we are not going to \nhave a vote on appropriations bills today. That seems very clear. So \nunless there is a vote on some other issue, or on a motion to proceed \nto it, I don't think we will have a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I am still hoping the \nleadership will agree to take up this bill. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee says he is not in the leadership. I have seen \nthe Senator from Alaska have significant effect on the leadership from \ntime to time. What I am hoping is we can get this issue resolved and \nmove forward with the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield further? Without question, there \nwill be a vote on the motion to proceed to the Transportation \nappropriations bill today--without any question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period for morning business \nto end at 11 a.m. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor for not to \nexceed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one has to keep a twinkle in one's eye, \nI guess. I am glad we are going to vote on something. I do not mind \nbeing here Monday early or Friday late as long as we are working. \nSometimes it is a little maddening when there are other things you want \nto do back in your State that you think are important and you do not \nknow if we are going to have a vote.\n  I am glad we are going to vote on something and move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10043-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10043-S10044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the spirit of moving forward, I \nthank colleagues for the bipartisan work on the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act. I especially thank Senator Brownback with whom I have \nhad a chance to work very closely on this bill. There are other key \npeople as well.\n  This conference report, without going into all the details, which \nwill come to the Senate I hope--``pray'' may not be too strong a word--\nprobably Tuesday--it looks as if we are just now working out a time \nagreement. I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  What is important about this legislation is that we have one part of \nit that deals with trafficking, which I want to talk about in a moment, \nand the other is the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \nwhich received a huge vote in the House of Representatives.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, has made a huge difference. I \ncould talk for hours about the shelters, about the hotline, about the \nways in which police take violence against women more seriously, about \nthe ways in which the country takes this more seriously. Still, about \nevery 13 seconds a woman is battered in her home, and still there are \nsomewhere around 3 million to 10 million children who witness this.\n  We have to do even better. I look forward to a couple of efforts next \nyear, one dealing with a program which will electronically link all of \nthe shelters, so with one phone call, one, you will know where to go \nand can be saved, and, two, it will focus on the children who witness \nthis violence. I feel good about the fact we are going to move forward \nwith this. It certainly appears that way. I thank all Senators who have \nbeen willing to cooperate.\n  I also feel good about the trafficking bill on which I have had a \nchance, as I said, to work with Senator Brownback.\n  So colleagues know, these two pieces of legislation have a lot of \nintegrity in how they interrelate with one another. One deals with \nviolence against women, children, and families. There are a number of \nwomen organizations around this country that have worked on this. They \nmade this possible. And the strong voices of Senators--from Senator \nBiden to Senator Leahy to Senator Boxer and others--have made a huge \ndifference.\n  I started on the trafficking legislation 3 years ago. I do not even \nknow if it is appropriate to brag, but it is not about me. My wife \nSheila said this is something we really should do. There has been great \nhelp from a lot of Senators.\n  Again, I thank Senator Brownback and also Representatives Chris Smith \nand Sam Gejdenson for their help and work, and Connie Morella is always \nthere on all these issues. I will talk more about staff and the great \nwork by people after this passes. It has not passed yet, but I think we \nare there. I say to Senator Reid, I believe we are there in terms of \nfinally getting a time agreement and we can move this forward.\n  We are talking about the trafficking of some 2 million women, and \nmainly girls, for the purposes of forced prostitution and forced labor, \nsome 50,000 to our country. This rivals drug trafficking in terms of \nhow scummy it is and how exploitative it is.\n  What happens is these women, girls, in countries that are going \nthrough economic chaos and disarray are recruited. They are told they \nwill have an opportunity to be a waitress, an opportunity to come to \nanother country, such as our country, and make an income and be able to \nbuild a good life.\n\n  This happened at a ``massage parlor'' 2 miles from here in Bethesda \nwhere these girls were forced into prostitution. What happens is, these \nyoung women, young girls, do not know their rights; they do not know \nwhat they are getting into. They come to these countries, and then it \nbecomes a nightmare.\n  This legislation focuses on prevention. We have an outreach through \nAID with some of the nongovernment organizations and others who really \ndo the information work so that young girls, young women, know what \nmight be happening to them, know about trafficking, know what the \ndangers are, and hopefully will have some knowledge about this before \nthey are exploited. That is the first piece.\n  The second piece is the protection piece. The bitter irony is that \nall too often one of these young girls, young women, steps forward and \nsays: This is what is happening to me. If they should escape from it, \nthey then are deported. So the victim is the one who ends up being \npunished. There is a temporary visa extension for 3 years, and then \ndecisions are made after that.\n  There are services for these women and girls. I say ``girls'' because \nwe are talking about children, too, 12, 13 years of age. In Minnesota, \nwe have a very, I think, holy place called the Center for the Treatment \nof Torture Victims. When women and children go through this hell, there \nis a whole lot that needs to be done to help them rebuild their lives. \nWe have a provision for those services.\n  The final thing is prosecution. If you are going to be involved in \nthe trafficking of a girl under the age of 16 for purposes of forced \nprostitution, you can face a life sentence. We should take this \nseriously. We will be the first country to pass such strong \nlegislation, the first Government in the world. This will be a model \nfor a lot of other governments around the world.\n  This is one of the best human rights pieces of legislation in the \nCongress in some time. I am not objective because I have had a chance \nto be a part of it. I am proud of the fact that we are going to do \nthis. I am proud of the fact that it is going to be linked with the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. And I am proud of \nthe fact the Senate next week, I hope early on, right after Yom Kippur, \nthe Jewish holiday, will take decisive action and will pass this most \nimportant human rights legislation. I say to all colleagues, please \ncooperate. Please, let's do this. This will make a difference. It will \nmake a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Minnesota leaves the \nfloor, I want to make a couple comments. There have been, as the \nSenator indicated, a number of people who have worked very hard on \ndomestic violence. Senator Joe Biden authored the original legislation \nand has been a model for what has transpired since then.\n  I say in the presence of the Senator from Minnesota that since he \ncame to the Senate, this has been an issue he has worked on \npassionately. I appreciate the work he has done.\n  The Senator from Minnesota mentioned his wife Sheila. I remember the \nwork the two of them have done together.\n  I remember the display they put in the Russell Building, which \ncertainly dramatized the need for continuing the work in this area. \nThere are many unique partnerships in America today, but one of those \nthat I admire greatly is that of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. They have \nworked on these issues together. I think it goes without saying that \nthe good work the Senator has done would not be as good but for the \ninvolvement of his wife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Reid from Nevada is very gracious towards lots \nof Senators. That is just the way he is. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10044-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SAFETY AND THE TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to emphasize the bipartisanship \nof the request made by my distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nArizona, to get some kind of consent for S. 3059, the bill dealing \nwith, of course, the defective equipment. We had extensive hearings.\n  Let me emphasize several things that we learned during the hearings.\n  One, generally speaking, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration has been--I do not want to say defunct; I will use an \nelaborative; dormant. The testimony showed there had not been a single \nrecall ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in \nfive years. They had not ordered a recall.\n  Now, of course, I have kept up on this because I have had to stand in \nthe well defending my trial lawyer friends who really bring about far \nmore safety than one would normally suspect. In the 5-year period, \nthere have been 99 million recalls. And everybody can write a thank-you \nnote to Mark Robinson in the Pinto case. He never collected a cent in \nhis punitive damages. But once industry realized there could be just \nthat--lawsuits --then they began to voluntarily have recalls. And that \nis what occurred here.\n  This defective tire situation, causing multiple deaths--over 100 that \nwe know about in the United States--was not a result of recalls ordered \nby NHTSA. More or less, the lawsuits, even though gagged, had really \nbrought it to the attention of NHTSA to get off the dime, wake up, and \nstart acting.\n  So we brought together now a measured safety precaution where this \nwill not occur again. And again, it has been simmered down somewhat \nfrom the unanimous vote. We have been working, on both sides, with \nconsumer product safety officials, with the tire companies. I talked to \nthe tire companies themselves. Their main objection, in a way, to that \nbill was dealing with foreign defects, in reporting foreign defects and \notherwise. Of course, you can call it the A tire here in the United \nStates and manufacture the B tire in another country like it is \ndifferent, but it is the same tire. So we would want to know about the \nrecalls in Saudi Arabia, which started first, in order to bring the \nattention here of the Firestone defect.\n  So we worked it out. Now here we have a unanimous report out. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as he just said \na moment ago, had no objection to that bill coming up because he voted \nfor it to be reported favorably to the floor of the Senate. Otherwise, \nthe distinguished majority leader, as a member of our committee, voted \nfor it. So there has to be an untying of this snarl or knot so that we \ncan get things done.\n  The only reason we cannot get it done is that we cannot offer an \namendment to the conference report. If the conference report were an \nitem just called up, we could call up this amendment, have a time limit \nfor 10 minutes to a side, and easily adopt or reject the amendment, \nwhich was the bill, S. 3059. But, of course, it is a conference report, \nand under the rules we cannot just bring it up as an amendment. I say \nthat so everybody will understand.\n  But as the distinguished chairman of our committee, Senator McCain, \npointed out, we could easily agree to give it some kind of \nconsideration--an hour to a side. It could be called up so we can stop \nthis indiscriminate killing on the highways due to faulty equipment.\n  I think it ought to be emphasized that we found this out really as in \ngetting past the gag orders. I do not like these gag orders, but \nsometimes they do promote settlements of judicial disputes. So we do \nnot have anything in the bill in relation to the gag orders. But when \nyou get lawsuits--that means that you have gone to a lawyer; you have a \nserious injury or you maybe have a death case, or whatever it is--so \nwhen you get multiple lawsuits, then that notice is given, of course, \nto NHTSA, and we can act from there.\n\n  But it is a studied, deliberate, measured response. Generally \nspeaking, they don't ever agree. I do not want to infer the industry \nagrees this is a good bill, but listening to them, they didn't have any \nserious objection that I can discern.\n  I support 100 percent Senator McCain's movement on the floor. He is \nnot holding things up. We can get a Transportation conference report to \nthe President here on Friday. We can come in here on Tuesday, if there \nis a holiday on Monday. We can easily get it to the President.\n  And as has been indicated, it has already been approved. We know the \nWhite House folks watch and make sure their concerns are taken care of \nin the measure. So whether it gets there Friday, gets there Tuesday, \nnext Wednesday, let's get on with having safety in America.\n  The Senator from Arizona standing in the well is not being an \nobstructionist whatsoever, but trying to promote safety where everybody \nis agreed. But, as he said, there is a ``fix'' on somewhere because why \ncan't we just call up the bill and get an agreement and everything else \nof that kind?\n  Our distinguished leader, the Senator from Nevada, says perhaps there \nis not going to be any vote in the Senate. And the Senator from Alaska, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee says, oh yes, we are going \nto have a vote to move to proceed. But that is not going to get us \nanywhere because with the vote to proceed, we will still have plenty of \ntime to talk. And we will talk into next week, and talk into Tuesday \nand Wednesday, and everything else, to show to the American people that \nthere is some kind of responsibility with this political entity here, \nthe Senate.\n  Heavens above, when we have everybody agreed--it is totally \nbipartisan--why can't we move deliberately and bring it up and have a \nvote on it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak about energy, which seems \nto be one of the things I think is very important that people are \ntalking about. But first I wish to comment a little on the progress, or \nlack thereof, that we are making in the Senate. It is not unusual that \nwe come up to the end of the session and find ourselves kind of blocked \nup here, and things have been postponed until now. Of course, it is the \nappropriations bills that always end up in this category. We have 13 of \nthem to pass in order to keep the Government going. The fiscal year \nexpired at the end of September, of course. We have extended our time \nand will do it into next week again.\n  One of the important roles of Congress is this allocation of funding. \nIt is one that is very important and really needs to be given all the \nattention we can give it. I think we ought to move as quickly as we can \nto do that job. I hope we don't end up with huge omnibus bills at the \nend of the session. They are so large that people don't know what is in \nthem. I would rather we deal with them individually as much as \npossible. Let me say that one of the things we ought to consider, which \nI have supported since I have been in the Congress--and from my \nexperience in the Wyoming Legislature--is I think we ought to have a 2-\nyear budgeting arrangement, which would alleviate this sort of thing \nevery year. Nevertheless, we are not there.\n  However, we need to move forward. When we are ready with the \nappropriations bills, we ought to do that. I favor the bill being \ntalked about here. I think it is a good bill. I don't know why it \nwasn't brought up earlier in the week when we were sitting here and \ndidn't have anything before us. Now we are down to the last hours of \nthis week and we bring up something that stops the opportunity for us \nto pass legislation regarding appropriations. I think that is \nunfortunate. In any event, we ought to be doing that.\n\n  Obviously, one of the difficulties with appropriations has been this \nidea of attaching to them the kinds of things that are not within the \nappropriations process because it is the end of the session, and \nbecause they have not been handled, or some refused to handle them \nearlier. That was wrong, in my opinion. I hope we consider a rule that \nwould make that more difficult.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Regarding energy, we ought to talk about that. We ought to talk, more \nimportantly, about where we want to be, and what we think the role of \nthe domestic energy program ought to be to achieve what we consider to \nbe our goal. I have become more and more aware of the importance of \nthat sort of thing in all the legislation that we address. Really, it \nbecame clear to me when we were talking about re-regulation of \nelectricity. We got wrapped up in all the different kinds of details \nthat necessarily go into it, but really I don't think we had a clear \nvision of where we wanted to be when we were through. We didn't have a \nclear vision of our goal.\n  To a large extent, I think that is the case with energy. We have high \nprices, for gasoline, for natural gas, and we are going to have higher \nelectricity and heating oil prices, and so on. Of course, that is the \nproblem we see, but what do we see as the solution? I think certainly \nthese high prices ought not to be a big surprise. This administration \nhasn't had an energy policy. We were very happy when oil was $10 a \nbarrel. When it gets up to $35 a barrel, we are very unhappy, and I \nunderstand that. I don't recommend that, either.\n  We ought to have intermediate pricing. You don't do that without an \nenergy policy. We have lacked a domestic energy policy that keeps us \nfrom being entirely dependent and subservient to OPEC and the foreign \noil producers. We have allowed ourselves to do that.\n  It is not new that we don't have one. The Clinton administration has \nrelied on short-term fixes. The most current one was to release crude \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was 30 million barrels, \nand I don't suppose that will change the world. That is a short-term \nkind of reaction, not a long-term solution to where we are going. That \nhas been the latest short-term fix.\n  I agree with increasing funding for Low-Income Housing Energy \nAssistance, and other short-term fixes. Those are good, and they have \nto be done because of where we are. But the fact is, if we are going to \nget out of that over time, then we have to do something different. We \nhave to take a look at EPA's regulations that have had the effect of \nshutting down coal-fired powerplants in the Midwest. We have more coal \nresources probably than most anything. We can do more about the \ndifficulties that have happened in the past. We have done a great deal \nbecause coal is now a clean source, but this administration has made it \nmore and more difficult for that to happen. The fact that coal supplies \n56 percent of the Nation's electric energy is very important, of \ncourse.\n  I have a personal feeling about it because our State is the highest \nproducer of low sulfur coal. We have had 36 refineries shut down since \n1992. No new ones have been built since 1996, largely because the EPA \npressed for continuing restrictions that make it much more difficult. \nThis administration--particularly the Vice President--calls for green \nalternatives. I don't know of anybody who opposes that idea. Green \nalternatives, right now, provide about 2 percent of our energy needs. \nIt is going to be a very long time before solar or wind energy moves in \nto do that. So that can't be our short-term/long-term policy.\n\n  There are a lot of things that can be done and we are moving to try \nto do that. It has to do with domestic energy policy which would help \nincrease domestic production so that we are not totally subject to the \nwhims of OPEC. Since 1992, our oil production in this country has gone \ndown 17 percent. Consumption has gone up 14 percent. Part of that is in \nStates such as Wyoming in the West, where 50 percent of the State is \nowned by the Federal Government. Those areas of Federal land--not all--\nare for multiple use.\n  We found this administration making it much more difficult for \nexploration and production to take place for the multiple use of public \nlands. That is not a good idea. U.S. jobs were involved in the \nexploring and producing. We used to have 400,000 of those jobs. Now it \nis less than 300,000, which is a 27-percent decline. These imports are \nrapidly growing--up 56 percent now--and we need to move forward with \nthat.\n  This is really an issue we can do something about. We need to do \nsomething about it. I could go over a lot of things this administration \nhas brought about that have helped to create the energy crisis we are \nin now. I am urging that we look at some of the things that are \navailable to us and that we can do to reach the goal we want in order \nto be more self-reliant for our energy. We can do something about \nconsumption, too, and I have no problem about that. However, that is \nnot a short-term problem. A short-term problem is going to be the price \nto farmers, ranchers, truckers, and to people who use oil particularly \nfor heating in the wintertime.\n  Certainly we are not going to be able to solve this problem in the \nnext few days. I hope we can move forward with our appropriations \nprocess, which is obviously before us now. I do think we ought to be \ngiving a great deal of thought to establishing a domestic energy policy \nthat will, in fact, help level out our dependency on foreign oil and be \ngood for this economy and good for American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I await the return of the Senator from \nAlaska, who I believe would like to object to a unanimous consent \nagreement I may seek.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut is waiting, perhaps we can extend \nmorning business for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise--and will be joined by my friend and \ncolleague from Alaska--to speak about a remarkable gift that was made \nto our wonderful country yesterday.\n  Yesterday, it was announced that the Library of Congress--the \ngreatest library in the world--would receive the single largest gift in \nits history--$60 million--to promote scholarly excellence. Like a \nuniversity, the center will have endowed chairs in a number of fields.\n  The remarkable gift by a remarkable person will also establish a $1 \nmillion annual prize for lifetime achievement in scholarly endeavors.\n  The gift has been made by a wonderful man whom I have known for many \nyears and for whom I have great admiration, John Kluge. He is also a \nvery good friend of the Senator from Alaska.\n  John Kluge immigrated to our shores from Germany nearly eight decades \nago.\n  He began his working life selling shoes, clothes, and stationery, and \nmoved up from there to become one of our nation's most successful \nbusinessmen. Like many others whose lives followed a similar path, Mr. \nKluge has decided to give something back to the country that has given \nhim so much over his years of living in this Nation. His remarkable \ngift of $60 million will benefit all Americans by raising standards of \nscholarly excellence, and blazing new paths of knowledge in areas of \nscience, the humanities, and the social sciences.\n  It will also, in my view, be immensely beneficial to our institutions \nof government. Those of us who serve in those institutions will have \nthe benefit of the fresh, bold thinking that men and women of scholarly \nachievement can bring to the most pressing challenges that we face as a \nnation. Hopefully, this gift will contribute to making our nation even \nmore prosperous and just in the years to come.\n  Perhaps most importantly, however, this gift stands as testimony to \nthe unique and ongoing promise of America. Every day, we are reminded \nby events large and small that this is an extraordinary country. Our is \na country that--despite its problems--offers individuals a level of \nfreedom, equality, and dignity unsurpassed anywhere else on the planet, \nor indeed, in the history of the world. That is why people risk their \nlives to come to our shores.\n  That is why we are the inspiration for people who in fact yesterday \nrose up against tyranny--the people of Yugoslavia--on the shores of the \nBalkans.\n  The extraordinarily generous gift given yesterday by Mr. Kluge to the \nLibrary of Congress reminds all Americans that ours is a land of \nlimitless possibility--a land where even the most humble can go on to \nachieve great success. And it is a gift that reminds each one of us \nthat, in our own way, we have an opportunity and an obligation to give \nback to the country that has given us so much. Because more than \nanything else, America is the sum of the acts of selfless patriotism of \nits people. Any time we are reminded of that fact, my colleagues, we \nreceive a gift whose value far exceeds its monetary sum.\n  John Kluge gave such a gift yesterday, as he has on countless other \noccasions.\n  In addition to this remarkable gift which John Kluge gave to the \nLibrary of Congress, he has helped raise $48 million in private funds \nfor the Library on previous occasions to establish an electronic \nenterprise, the National Digital Library, with which my colleague from \nAlaska has been deeply involved. Congress appropriated an additional \n$15 million for that program.\n  Over the years, he has given $13 million of his own money to the \nLibrary, including $5 million to kick start the digital library.\n  John Kluge was the major contributor who orchestrated the wonderful \n200th celebration of the Library of Congress.\n  He has given millions of dollars to other wonderful causes, \nuniversities, and other worthwhile enterprises.\n  I have known John Kluge for years and years. He was a wonderful \nfriend of my parents. I have spent an awful lot of time with him over a \nnumber of years, particularly in the last number of months. He truly is \na great American, truly a great patriot, and his wonderful contribution \nis going to make the Library of Congress an even greater institution in \nthe years to come than it has been.\n  I wanted to take a minute to express the gratitude of all of us, my \nconstituents, and all Americans to John Kluge for his remarkable \ncontribution to our Nation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday, as chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library of Congress, it was my privilege to join Vice \nChairman Bill Thomas and Dr. James Billington out by our Ohio Clock to \nannounce the largest gift in the history of our Library in 200 years. \nThere has never been a greater gift to the Library of Congress.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut has said, John W. Kluge is a \nmarvelous individual who is renowned in the international corporate \ncommunity as one of the Library's staunchest supporters and most \ndevoted people to the Madison Council. As a matter of fact, he was the \nfounder of the Madison Council. He has now given the Library a gift of \nanother $60 million.\n  Mr. Kluge's leadership in the Madison Council has enabled the Library \nto raise a total of $222 million in private donations for the Library \nover the last 10 years. His contributions alone amount to $73 million.\n  Yesterday's gift of $60 million will establish The John W. Kluge \nCenter and Prize in the Human Sciences which will endow 5 scholarly \nchairs, and fellows, and will recognize areas of study not currently \ncovered by the Noble prize structure. The Center will endow chairs in \nareas such as American law and government, American cultures and \nsocieties, technology and society, and modern culture. The Librarian \nwill make the appointments in consultation with the Library's Scholars \nCouncil, and the first chairs will be awarded in 2001.\n  The Kluge Prize in the Human Sciences will include areas of study not \ncovered by the Nobel Prize, including areas such as history, \nanthropology, sociology, literary and artistic criticism. Strangely \nenough, I had been discussing with one of my esteemed friends a similar \ntype of approach to cover areas not covered by our Nobel Prize process. \nThe prize will be a cash award of $1 million.\n  In addition, the award ceremony will recognize a lifetime of \nachievement in the Intellectual Arts, just as the Kennedy Center Honors \nrecognize lifetime achievement in the performing arts. As Dr. \nBillington noted, ``the Kluge Center will help bridge the divide \nbetween the academic and political worlds, between knowledge and \npower.'' He summed up the need for the Center best when he said, ``We \nneed broader and deeper exchanges; to make time for greater \ncontemplation, what Milton called `wisdom's best nurse'.''\n  I speak for all of the Joint Committee members in saying that we are \ndeeply grateful for the support the Library has received from Mr. \nKluge, and the private sector under Dr. Billington's leadership. Over \nthis past year, and in celebration of the Library's Bicentennial, the \nprivate sector has supported hundreds of activities. With Mr. Kluge's \nextraordinary gift of $60 million, the total amount of gifts and \ndonations to the Library during its bicentennial year from the private \nsector, particularly the Madison Council, totals $106 million.\n  On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Library, I extend Congress' \ndeepest thanks to John Kluge, and all of the members of the Madison \nCouncil. Their generosity has been outstanding. It has helped to make \npossible the digital initiatives at the Library, and has added \npriceless collections over the past 10 years. The nation owes Mr. Kluge \na debt of gratitude for his generous support. I ask that a copy of the \nremarks\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\nthat Mr. Kluge made regarding his gift be included in the Record as \nwell as an article that appeared in the New York Times. It is my hope \nthat Members will read his remarks. They are significant. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of his remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     John Kluge's Remarks at the Tea Hosted by Senator Ted Stevens\n\n  Thank you, Dr. Billington.\n  I have known the Librarian of Congress, Jim Billington, for ten years \nand during that time, my admiration for him and faith in him as the \nhead of our national library have multiplied many times over. Dr. \nBillington came to the Library with a great vision of what the Library \ncould be and should be in our new global society. He knew that the vast \nknowledge contained in the Library, if made available to all, could \nenrich and enlighten the lives of people everywhere. He knew that the \nLibrary of Congress is something that every American can be deeply \nproud of--a symbol of our open democratic society; and a visible \npromise from our lawmakers that whatever information is available to \nthem is also freely available to everyone. And he knew that visitors to \nthe Library would come away inspired by it and proud that the most \nbeautiful building in Washington, perhaps in the country, is a library. \nIt has been a privilege for all of us on the Madison Council to join \nwith the Congress in helping the librarian fulfill his vision.\n  We have seen the Library transformed--from a great, but under-used \nand little known federal institution, to an open and universally \naccessible resource for students, scholars and learners everywhere. \nThis exciting transformation, and my confidence in the Librarian and \nhis talented staff, have led to my decision to endow a center for \nscholarship and a prize in the human sciences which were just \nannounced. My deepest wish--as a person who came to this country as a \nchild with almost nothing and has enjoyed the freedom to try new \nthings, to take risks and at least sometimes to succeed--is to make a \ncontribution that helps others have the same kind of opportunity. I \nhope that the scholars who come to this center to grapple with some of \nthe most important issues of our time and future times, will have the \nsame wish--to use their talents and brains to better the world.\n  Thank you Madison Council members for making the Library a priority \nin your lives. Your dedication over the past ten years has paid off \nrichly for a great American institution and for the nation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. He made those remarks at the time he announced this \naward yesterday in our presence in the Mansfield Room in the Senate.\n  I also ask unanimous consent an article from the New York Times \npertaining to this gift be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 5, 2000]\n\n            $60 Million Gift Is Made To Library of Congress\n\n                         (By Francis X. Clines)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 4.--The Library of Congress has just \n     received the largest single donation in its history, $60 \n     million, and Dr. James H. Billington, the librarian, is \n     eagerly preparing to spend it repairing relations between \n     ``the thinkers and the doers,'' between a resident panel of \n     visiting senior scholars he plans for the library and the \n     politicians across the street in the Capitol.\n       ``These two worlds just kind of fell apart in the 60's and \n     haven't really come back together again,'' Dr. Billington \n     said as he explained his new program for the ultimate mix in \n     political town and academic gown.\n       He plans rotating far-flung scholars to Washington to \n     pursue fresh research and play a ``catalytic'' intellectual \n     role for Congress, the primary user of the national library.\n       Beginning next year, the program will endow eight senior \n     chairs plus a dozen fellowships for younger scholars. And \n     most prominently, it will create a $1 million prize for \n     intellectual excellence in the human sciences, a field that \n     Dr. Billington feels is neglected by the Nobel prizes.\n       ``We're trying to celebrate and facilitate not just the \n     life of the mind, but also the role of the life of the mind \n     in the life of the republic,'' he said of the new scholar \n     center, which will be named after its benefactor, John W. \n     Kluge.\n       A billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. Kluge \n     heads the library's Madison Council, which has been enlisting \n     advisers and donors from the private sector for the past \n     decade. After helping the library raise about $160 million in \n     the last 10 years from others, Mr. Kluge, now 85 and chairman \n     of the Metromedia International telecommunications and \n     entertainment company, has donated $60 million to it himself.\n       Based around the great hall in the library's newly \n     refurbished Jefferson building, the center--which will be \n     formally announced on Thursday--is to set aside suites of \n     offices and meeting rooms for the scholars and lawmakers. The \n     hope is they will intermingle for whatever discussions they \n     please about ideas large or small, pressing or serendipitous.\n       ``You can't legislate or buy depth but we're making some \n     probes,'' said Dr. Billington, a 71-year-old historian and \n     Russian specialist who diplomatically stressed that he has \n     nothing against the capital city's hedgerows of think tanks \n     and flocks of talking heads all now operating in the name of \n     thoughtfulness.\n       Still, he said, ``a deeper immersion'' and interplay \n     between scholarly ideas and political curiosity is needed. \n     ``There is already a great deal of applied intellect in this \n     city, even if a lot of it is in lobbying and advocacy.''\n       He vowed to reach out for scholars not usually associated \n     with a Washington intellectual life top-heavy with economists \n     and political scientists.\n       The initial senior scholars are to be chosen within the \n     next year, with the first Kluge prize for intellectual \n     excellence likely in 2002. Those under consideration will be \n     vetted from assorted disciplines by Dr. Billington and an \n     advisory council of scholars led by his deputy at the \n     library, Dr. Prosser Gifford.\n       Dr. Billington declined to speculate on choices. But he \n     said the standard would ideally be of the sort set by two \n     scholars he had previously coaxed into serving the library \n     briefly--Vyacheslav Ivanov, the linguist and lecturer on \n     semiotics, and the late philosopher Isaiah Berlin.\n       The eight specialties to be covered by the senior chairs \n     are broadly defined along the library's separate collections \n     to include the culture and society of the Northern (advanced) \n     and Southern (less developed) Hemispheres; technology's \n     interaction with society, American law and governance; \n     education; international relations; American history and \n     ethics; and modern culture, including the library's \n     formidable collections of music and films.\n       ``What we're trying to do is to make sure you get Greece \n     into Rome,'' said Dr. Billington, the 13th librarian of \n     Congress in the two century-history of the institution.\n       ``What's fascinating is that the link between learning and \n     lawmaking was here from the beginning,'' he said, describing \n     how the first joint committee was created by the founding \n     Congress to run the library.\n       Scholars have at least as much to gain in the untapped \n     resources of the library as in the interaction with \n     lawmakers, Dr. Billington said. He noted, for example, the \n     thousands of unread copyrighted novels in the library's \n     archive of more than 120 million items.\n       ``I tell my friends in academia that instead of \n     deconstructing novels that everybody used to enjoy before you \n     started writing about them, how about coming down and \n     discovering the unpublished novels that nobody has read,'' he \n     wryly added.\n       ``There is no magic bullet for interacting doers and \n     thinkers,'' he conceded, but he expressed faith in the idea \n     of simply bringing ``some of the scholars scattered all over \n     the country directly into the library'' that members of \n     Congress use--``people who already have a life of scholarly \n     accomplishment but who might be capable of distilling some \n     wisdom in roaming across the rich variety of things at the \n     library.''\n       Reviewing the institution's virtues, he cited its several \n     hundred book cataloguers as rich foragers. ``They're my \n     hidden heroes,'' he said.\n       ``It's going to be additive, it's going to be catalytic,'' \n     Dr. Billington insisted. ``It's not a little empire, or a \n     university or a new think tank.''\n       ``It's going to have an ever changing group of people,'' he \n     added, with most of them staying for a year or so. ``It will \n     work in that way America does things best--not with a giant \n     prefixed plan that you sit around and debate in the abstract, \n     but by working on the human elements and hoping that things \n     will jell.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. One of the interesting things about John Kluge's remarks \nwas when he referred to himself as a young boy who came to this country \nat the age of 8 as an immigrant and he had one possession. It was a \nsmall Dresden figurine; it was a horse. That is all he owned when he \ncame to this country.\n  Today, as Senator Dodd has said, through the process of freedom in \nthis country and his basic knowledge as a human being, he is one of the \nrichest men in the world. I think to be in the man's presence is an \nhonor. He is one of the great people of this country.\n  Yesterday, after I attended this ceremony and was going back on the \nsubway, one of the operators of the subway noticed I was smiling. That \nis strange around this place, as people know. I said: Yes, I've just \nbeen to a delightful\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\nceremony. I told him that this man came to this country as an immigrant \nboy of 8 with one little possession, that he still has, had amassed \nthis great fortune, and he had just given the Library of Congress $60 \nmillion.\n  The driver of the subway said: He came here with nothing? I said: \nThat is right. And he has just given this great gift to the Library? \nAnd I said: That is right. And he said: That man is truly blessed.\n  That is my feeling about John Kluge. He is a truly blessed man.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for his wonderful comments about John \nKluge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10048-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I went to Danville, KY, last evening, and I \nthought both Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney did an admirable job in \npresenting their respective points of view during the Vice Presidential \ndebate.\n  It will be understandable if I express a certain amount of parochial \npride in the performance of my colleague and friend from Connecticut, \nJoe Lieberman, who I thought did a magnificent job in laying out in \ncivil, polite, and in a courteous way, the differences between the two \nteams, the two parties, and the candidates for the Presidency of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I think all Americans benefited last night as a result of the very \neloquent, precise, thoughtful, and clear presentations. So it seems \nfitting for me to take a minute to commend them both, particularly my \ncolleague from Connecticut. When young people around the country are \nthinking about politics and wonder whether good examples are out there, \nit is my hope that they might be shown by their history teachers, the \nVice Presidential debate of the year 2000. Indeed, it was a wonderful \nexample of how people of significant differences of opinion and points \nof view can have a worthwhile, informative discussion and debate of \ncritical issues that face the future of our Nation.\n  I commend both, particularly my good friend and colleague from \nConnecticut. There is a collective sense of pride over the junior \nSenator from Connecticut. I may not call him ``junior'' Senator much \nlonger, but I want to tell my colleagues how very proud I was of his \nperformance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10048-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WORK REMAINS\n\n  Mr. DODD. I want to say briefly before the time runs out, I have \ngreat admiration for the work Senator Stevens has done as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. It is a tough job. We all know how hard \nhe works and how hard he tries to work out the differences in the \nspending bills. I have great respect for him and the work he has done \nas chairman of that committee.\n  That said, I also would be remiss if I did not mention that there are \nseveral important matters, generally speaking, that we have not \naddressed. We are about to wrap up, to finish over the next few days, \nwith maybe one or two votes left, I am told.\n  I am saddened that, despite the efforts of Senator Stevens, the \nleaders, and others, the Senate has thus far failed to act on several \nother important matters, including the 39 million seniors who will go \nwithout prescription drug benefits under Medicare. That is a great \nloss. We could have done it this year, and we didn't.\n  More than 11 million working families will not get the benefit of an \nincrease in the minimum wage. That is a great loss for those people. \nMr. President, 53 million children go to school every day in this \ncountry, and for the first time in 35 years we were not able to pass \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act to try to improve the \nquality of schools, reduce class sizes, and come up with good \nafterschool programs.\n  So, 53 million children lose, 11 million working people don't get an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and 39 million seniors fail to get \nprescription drug benefits. I think it is a sad day indeed. We could \nhave passed these measures, and we didn't. I am deeply saddened by it, \nas I think the American people are as well.\n  While I commend Senator Stevens and members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, including my colleague from Nevada, Harry Reid, and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who have worked \ntirelessly to get the appropriations work done, the fact of the matter \nis, a great deal of America's business has gone unattended.\n\n  Mr. President, I regret that the leadership of this Congress has \nfailed thus far to act on these and other crucial priorities. If we can \nfind two weeks to debate renaming National Airport, if we can spend \nmany days debating whether to provide estate tax relief to the 44,000 \nmost affluent Americans, then I would hope that in these waning days of \nthis Congress we could find the time to consider the needs of America's \nchildren, seniors, and working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10048-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10048-S10050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 3059\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come back to try to resolve this issue. \nBefore I ask for another unanimous consent agreement with some \ndifferent language, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the Secretary of Transportation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I would like to take this opportunity to \n     reiterate my views regarding the penalty structure for \n     Department of Transportation regulatory agencies such as the \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). I \n     expressed these views in testimony on the Firestone tire \n     recall before the full committee on September 12, 2000.\n       The Administration supports a three-tiered approach to the \n     enforcement of health and safety statutes: (1) administrative \n     penalties; (2) judicially enforced civil penalties; and (3) \n     in the case of egregious circumstances, criminal penalties \n     for those who knowingly and willfully violate the law. We \n     welcome the opportunity to work with the Congress to properly \n     structure this approach.\n       Most important, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects. I will work with you in any way I can to help shape \n     legislation that the Congress can approve and the President \n     can sign into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rodney E. Slater.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will read a portion of the letter:\n\n       I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my views \n     regarding the penalty structure for Department of \n     Transportation regulatory agencies such as the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). I expressed \n     these views in testimony on the Firestone tire recall before \n     the full committee on September 12, 2000.\n\n     and the last paragraph:\n\n       Most important, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects. I will work with you in any way I can to help shape \n     legislation that the Congress can approve and the President \n     can sign into law.\n\n  I repeat for my colleagues what the Secretary of Transportation says:\n\n       Most important, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects.\n\n  This legislation passed through the committee with the help of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, a member of that committee, a \nvalued member of that committee. This legislation passed through the \nCommerce Committee with the support of the majority leader of the \nSenate, a valued member of that committee.\n  Although I don't agree with the Transportation appropriations bill, I \nam not interested in blocking it. I am interested in trying to get \naction on this legislation before Congress adjourns.\n  I ask the Senator from Alaska if it would be acceptable if I modified \nthe unanimous consent agreement to say that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democrat leader, would set a specific time and \ndate for this legislation to be considered, and\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\nonly relevant amendments to the bill be in order of S. 3059.\n  It seems to me we could then achieve the goal of having a time and \ndate where we could address this issue, we could move forward with the \nimportant appropriations bill, which understandably the Senator from \nAlaska has as his highest priority, which is also understandable given \nthe fact that he is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I ask the Senator from Alaska if he would consider--and I will ask \nnow--I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democrat leader, could set a specific time and \ndate for the consideration to S. 3059 and that only relevant amendments \nto the bill be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat there is a process underway right now to see if it is possible to \nget such an agreement that the Senator from Arizona mentioned.\n  I have inquired, since the last exchange we had on the floor--and I \nam a person who has voted for this bill in committee, but the problem \nis there are objections on both sides of the aisle, I am informed, to a \nunanimous consent agreement which would be necessary to carry out the \nSenator's current unanimous consent agreement.\n  The difficulty is, there are some Members who are not members of the \ncommittee, our Commerce Committee, who have not had time to study that. \nThey have informed the staff on both sides of the Senate, both \nDemocratic and Republican, as I understand, that there are \nreservations. I cannot call them holds because they have not seen the \nbill yet; that is, as I understand it, the bill will come over from the \nHouse. It will be the House bill we would consider. It is just a very \ndifficult position for me to be in, but as a representative of the \nleadership in this matter right now, I am constrained to say I am \nforced to object to the bill I support. I do object to that request.\n  I urge the Senator from Arizona to be part of this process of trying \nto clear that bill. I will join him. I have been trying to work on that \nsince our last exchange, to see if we can clear bringing up that bill. \nBut there are reservations on both sides of the aisle to that bill, and \nI am constrained to be in the position, and I am in the position, to \nsay: I object to the request of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield so I can make a statement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before the Senator from Alaska leaves the floor, I would \nlike to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to respond before he leaves also. I will just take \na brief moment.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, we are not objecting to this request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, you are. We had a statement you are objecting.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Claiming the floor, it is clear on that side of the aisle \nthere is no objection to this unanimous consent request.\n  I don't understand the comment of the Senator from Alaska about \nnobody has read the bill and no one understands the bill. We passed it \n2 weeks ago out of the committee, No. 1. No. 2, this is not a low \nvisibility issue. No. 3, we want to pass this bill through the Senate. \nThe House will be passing the bill and we will go through the normal \nprocedures.\n  I want to say again to the Senator from Alaska, on an issue of this \nimportance--he said Members on both sides have reservations or \nobjections; clearly, it is on this side of the aisle--come down with \nrelevant amendments. We can reach time agreements and go through the \nnormal process. But to block consideration at any time between now and \nwhen we leave is a clear message, I say in all due respect to the \nSenator from Alaska, that there is an intention to block consideration \nof the passage of this bill.\n  I can understand the objection of the Senator from Alaska to me \nholding up the consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill. \nI can fully understand that. I cannot understand why the leadership \nwould not agree to taking up this bill with relevant amendments \nsometime between now and when we go out.\n  So, with all due respect to the Senator from Alaska, I don't get it. \nI do not understand why, when there is no objection on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, no; if the Senator will yield, Mr. President, I will \nstate categorically I am informed there is an objection on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respectfully say there is no objection on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  Mr. McCAIN. With all due respect to the Senator from Alaska, you have \nto respect the statement of the leader of the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona made a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nNevada for a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona made a request, a unanimous \nconsent request, to move forward with relevant amendments. We have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is abundantly clear, I say to the Senator from \nAlaska, there is no objection to moving forward on that side of the \naisle. The problem is on this side of the aisle.\n  Why in the world can't we come to an agreement, when the Secretary of \nTransportation says:\n\n       Most important, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects.\n\n  We are talking about a life-threatening situation here.\n  So all I can say is it is clear the problem seems to be on this side \nof the aisle. I am asking the Senator from Alaska, who represents the \nleadership, to agree to this unanimous consent request, which I think \nis eminently reasonable. So I guess, Mr. President, I will ask again, \nif I could get the attention of the Senator from Alaska, since it is \nclear there is no objection to this unanimous consent request from the \nother side of the aisle--and I am not trying to impede the progress of \nthe Transportation appropriations bill. We are only trying to get \naddressed the issue that there are life-threatening motor vehicle \nsafety defects--if we at least could have some agreement. If there are \nobjections to the legislation, then those objections, it seems to me, \ncould be articulated in the form of relevant amendments.\n  So, again, I don't understand the explanation of the Senator from \nAlaska. The bill was passed 2 weeks ago. This is a very high visibility \nissue. We would take it up and pass it. The House is going to pass this \nlegislation next Tuesday, according to all news reports. We could pass \nit, go to conference, and get this legislation to the President of the \nUnited States unless it is blocked on this side of the aisle--on this \nside of the aisle. This is a bill that passed 20-0 with the support of \nthe majority leader, with the support of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. THOMAS. This passed 2 weeks ago, Senator. Why hasn't it come up \nbefore this and not at the very end?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have been urging it, I respond to my colleague. Since \nthe day after we passed it, I have been begging the leadership every \nday to bring up this bill for consideration. This has been blocked.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the question of the Senator from Wyoming \nbecause we have been trying to do everything we can to bring this bill \nup. That is why--because I have been stymied in these efforts--I had to \ncome to the floor this morning to try to force some action on it since \nthere was no response from our leadership, on this side, because of \nholds on the bill and objections to it.\n  I again ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, in \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, establish a specific time and \ndate for consideration of S. 3059, and that only relevant amendments to \nthe bill be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving my right to object, I ask the Senator through \nthe Chair a question. Is that a unanimous consent agreement that \ninvolves\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\nbringing the bill before the Senate without the ability of any Member \nof the Senate to object at that time to its consideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As I understand it, the Senator is saying he would like \nto have the Senate agree that the two leaders can bring a bill before \nthe Senate for consideration that has not yet been passed by the House, \nand no Member would be able to object to consideration at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond quickly to the Senator from Alaska? This \nis not a House bill; this is a Senate bill I am asking to have \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate as we regularly do with \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I apologize, Mr. President. From the prior conversation, \nI understood the House had brought its bill out of committee. I \nunderstood we were going to await that bill.\n  In any event, I want to say it again, as one who has voted for the \nbill, I am in the position of representing the leader.\n  Mr. President, I sought to become leader of the Senate once. I lost \nby two votes. I understand what it means not to be leader, but I also \nunderstand what it means to be leader. The leader has asked me to \nobject on his behalf, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I just say again, and I want to clarify for the \nbenefit of the Senator from Alaska, this is a Senate bill. It was \npassed through the Commerce Committee by a vote of 20-0. Yesterday, the \nHouse, by a vote of 42-0, passed through their committee similar \nlegislation, although not the same legislation. They announced they \nwould be passing their legislation next Tuesday.\n  What I am seeking is for us to be able to pass the Senate bill and go \nto conference, as is normal.\n  I should not do this, but I want to make another commitment to the \nSenator from Alaska because of the time constraints, and that is, if \nthere are 50 relevant amendments filed and it looks as if the bill is \ngoing to be filibustered to death and we are not going to be able to \npass it, then I will ask that the legislation be withdrawn at that time \nbecause I understand the time constraints under which the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee is operating.\n  All I am asking is it be brought up with relevant amendments, as it \nwill be passed by the House next Tuesday, and conferees will be \nappointed, as is normal, and we will go to conference and report out \nlegislation hopefully that can be passed before we go out of session.\n  I say again to the Senator from Alaska, one, we passed it 2 weeks \nago; two, the House has acted in their committee, and they will be \npassing the bill next Tuesday. Right now we have no assurance of any \nkind that we can in any way take up this bill at any time. So when the \nSenator from Alaska objects on behalf of the leadership to \nconsideration at any time that would be in keeping with the majority \nleader's schedule, then it is clear the effect is to kill the \nlegislation, and we are talking about, as the Secretary of \nTransportation says, ``Most important, however, is expeditious action \non comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's ability to \naddress life-threatening motor vehicle safety defects.''\n  I ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee if he will do the \nfollowing: If we can just go into a quorum call for 10 minutes and see \nif the leadership will allow this unanimous consent request to move \nforward. I am not interested in embarrassing the leadership. In fact, I \nam interested in not embarrassing the leadership because if there is no \nobjection on the other side of the aisle and there is an objection on \nthis side of the aisle to taking up the legislation at any time, that \nis really not good. That is not a good thing to happen. I speak as a \nMember on this side of the aisle. Mr. President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business to speak about Yugoslavia for up to 10 minutes. If \nthat causes problems for anyone, I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to assure everyone, if the conference \nreport comes over, I will immediately cease and desist so we can \nproceed with the regular business of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10050-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10050-S10051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REVOLUTION IN SERBIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have had many debates on the floor of \nthe Senate, genuinely heartfelt debates about the role of the United \nStates of America in the world and the use of American force in the \nworld.\n  We have had a split in this body between the parties, and within the \nparties, about whether or not it is appropriate for the United States \nto take a leadership role in Europe, including, on occasion, the use of \nforce to promote our national interest and that of our allies.\n  There are several political cancers that exist in various parts of \nthe world. And the one remaining cancer on the continent of Europe--the \nprimary one--is Slobodan Milosevic.\n  I suggest that we all take a lesson from what is going on now in the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia--in Serbia. Many of us, Democrat and \nRepublican, have argued--myself; Senator McCain; Senator Lieberman; \nSenator Dole, when he was here--that the United States had an \nobligation, in its own self-interest and in the interest of our allies, \nand in the interest of humanity, to intervene, to stop the genocide and \nthe ethnic cleansing that was being perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic's \nvile nationalism.\n  I have been arguing for some time now that, absent our involvement in \nthat region of the world, there would be chaos in, if not the heart, \nthen the belly of Europe, and that if we acted with dispatch--swiftly \nand with resolve, and a willingness not to back away--Slobodan \nMilosevic, as with most thugs, would be stopped and would be \neliminated.\n  Some have said on this floor, and some will say in the various \nPresidential and Senatorial and House campaigns that are going on, that \nwe did not have an exit strategy when we committed American forces in \nKosovo or American forces in Bosnia. Some will say that we have not \nsucceeded because all is not tranquil, and if we were to withdraw \nAmerican forces, things would revert to the chaos that existed before, \nand that this serves as proof that what we had done had not worked. The \npress and others declared early on in the bombing campaign in Kosovo--3 \ndays into the 70-some day campaign--that it was a failure.\n  I am told, time and again, by some of my colleagues on the floor and \nI have read some pundits who state that, in fact, the American people \nare not patient, that they want instant results.\n  I say this. The end of Slobodan Milosevic is evidence of a number of \nthings. One, our involvement was not only positive and good and \nsuccessful, it was absolutely necessary. Without the leadership of the \nUnited States of America, I respectfully suggest our European allies \nwould not have been as aggressive, they would not have been as united, \nand they would not have been as resolved.\n  Second, I hope we take a lesson from this as well to demonstrate that \nthe American people have a great deal more patience and wisdom than we \ngive them credit for. I have not heard, nor have I heard anyone else \ntell me that, while they have been home in the last 4 years, they have \nbeen told, as they walked from the grocery store, or to the drugstore, \nor home, that it is urgent we withdraw American forces from the \nBalkans.\n  Quite frankly, the opposite has occurred. The American people \nintuitively knew this was a place where wars have started before, this \nwas a place where if chaos reigned it could not be contained, this was \na place where a man such as Slobodan Milosevic could do nothing but \nultimately harm the interest of Europe\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\nand the United States. They were resolved, and they are resolved, to \nkeep American forces in that area to maintain the peace and security of \nthe region, along with our allies.\n  I might add, parenthetically, that we make up only, roughly, 7,000 of \nthe nearly 41,000 troops that are in Kosovo, and that, in fact, we are \ndoing the Lord's work there. It is kind of interesting that, in the six \nor seven trips I have made to the region--the last one being a trip to \nKosovo--after I came back I remember having discussions here on the \nfloor, and I would hear about how down the morale was of the American \nforces and how circumspect they were about whether we should be \ninvolved.\n\n  That is not what I found, whether it was at Camp McGovern in Bosnia \nseveral years ago or at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo last year. What I \nfound was that these young women and men knew exactly why they were \nthere. They knew why they were there. They did not have to be told. And \nthey felt good about it. They knew they were doing the Lord's work. \nThey understood. They understood there was a purpose and meaning for \nbeing there. All they had to do was ride through the streets and they \nunderstood it. It is interesting that the retention rate and \nreenlistment rate is higher for those who have been in Kosovo or Bosnia \nthan for any other segment of the military.\n  So I would argue that what is happening in Yugoslavia now is making a \nlie of some of the assertions that were taken for granted around this \nplace by a majority of the people on the floor, as well as a majority \nof the press, as well as a majority of the people who are so-called \npundits.\n  This is the point I want to make.\n  We should not now, at this moment, change policy. Slobodan Milosevic \nis a war criminal. We should not, as former Secretary Eagleburger--a \nman for whom I have great respect--said yesterday on television, \naccommodate his departure from Serbia by winking and nodding and \nessentially letting him off the hook on the War Crimes Tribunal. We \nshould not do that.\n  The newly elected President of Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, is a lot \nof things that are good. But his record shows that he is also a fierce \nnationalist.\n  We should lift sanctions, but only when Milosevic goes. But again, \njust a word of caution, we should not lift all sanctions until we are \nclear that the new leadership in Serbia, in Belgrade, will honor the \nDayton accords and will not use force in Kosovo. This is no time to \nrelent. None--none--of us should relent now.\n  We have been right so far. A steady course, firm hand, U.S. power, \nU.S. leadership, and U.S. resolve have brought us this far. Without it, \nnone of what has happened would be, in fact, what the history books \nwill write about 2, 5, 10, and 20 years from now. History will record \nthat what we did was the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, \nand, even more importantly, in a Machiavellian sense, right for the \nnational interests of the United States, and essential for any prospect \nof long-term peace and security in Europe.\n  I said a week ago that Milosevic could not be sustained, no matter \nwhat he did from this point on. The tides of history have moved. We saw \nit some years ago in Bulgaria. We saw it in Romania. We saw it occur \nagain in Croatia. We saw it again in Bosnia. And we now see it in \nSerbia. For the first time in modern European history, there is a \nprospect--a serious prospect--that the Balkans will be integrated into \nEurope as a whole.\n  I can think of no more significant foreign policy initiative that \nthis Government has taken since the Berlin Wall came down that has been \nso clearly vindicated--so clearly vindicated. So now is not the time to \ntake an easy road out. Lift sanctions partially, make it clear to the \nSerbian people that we love them--our fight was never with them; they \nare a noble people--but I think we should have a steady hand. We are \nprevailing. The West is prevailing. Yugoslavia, in particular--most \npeople refer to it as Serbia--is about to come into the light of day. \nWe must not now send the wrong signal and let people in Serbia conclude \nthat there is not a price to pay for those who violate, in a massive \nway, the human rights of their fellow citizens and that we expect the \nnew government to behave in a way consistent with international norms.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10051-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3059\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Amidst all of the proposals and discussions and objections \nand debate that has gone on here on the floor, I rise to talk about a \nbill that has been very positive, which demonstrates the best of what \nthis body is all about--a pulling together and working together across \nthe aisle in a bipartisan way, all with the goal of making others' \nlives more fulfilling, both in the current generation and in future \ngenerations. This week, the U.S. Congress has sent to the President of \nthe United States for his signing a comprehensive bill that very much \nforms the backbone of efforts to improve the safety and health of \nAmerica's children.\n  This bill that has been sent to the President focuses on our \nchildren's health, the Children's Health Act of 2000. It was more than \na year ago that Senator Jim Jeffords and I reached out across the \nCapitol to Chairman Bliley and Representative Bilirakis to work \ntogether in a coordinated way on a whole variety of issues and bills \nthat are critical to children's health and safety. These included such \nissues as maternal and infant health, day-care safety, pediatric \nresearch, pediatric health promotion, and efforts to fight drug abuse \nand provide mental health services for young people today. I \nam delighted that both the House and the Senate have passed this bill, \nthat it has been sent to the President, and that we were successful in \nachieving our goal.\n\n  The bill addresses a range of issues. Just to give some flavor of \nthis bill and what it can achieve, what it will achieve, what it does \nachieve in its language, let me comment on a few.\n  Day-care safety. Currently, there are more than 13 million children 6 \nyears of age and less who are enrolled in day-care centers. Almost a \nquarter of a million are in Tennessee. One provision in this bill, the \nDay-Care Safety Act, recognizes the need to make these settings safer, \nimproving the health and public welfare of children in day care. \nParents should simply not be afraid to leave their children in the \nmorning when they drop them off in these day-care settings, fearing \nthat a licensed\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\nday-care facility is not safe over the course of that day. This bill \nhelps ensure that our childcare centers will be safer.\n  Secondly, children's health. Provisions included in this bill, the \nChildren's Public Health Act of 2000, some of which were introduced \nJuly 13 of this past year--that I introduced with Senators Jeffords and \nKennedy--address a number of children's health issues, including \nmaternal and pediatric health promotion and research.\n  Thirdly, traumatic brain injury. Traumatic injuries are the leading \ncause of death for every age group between 1 and 19 years of age. This \nbill strengthens the traumatic brain injury programs at the CDC, the \nNational Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.\n  Fourth, birth defects: Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \nmortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric \nadmissions.\n  This bill focuses on maternal and infant health. The legislation \nestablishes a national center for birth defects and developmental \ndisabilities at the CDC, the purpose of which is to collect and analyze \nand distribute data on birth defects.\n  Fifth, asthma. The bill combats some of the most common challenges, \nproblems, and public health issues in children today. In terms of \nasthma, it provides comprehensive asthma services and coordinates a \nwide range of asthma prevention programs in the Federal Government to \naddress this most common chronic childhood disease.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that this bill has passed both of these \nbodies with this body working together in a bipartisan way.\n  I understand that we are about ready to begin on the conference \nreport. Therefore, I will terminate my comments at this point, and \nlater in the day, during morning business, will extend my comments on \nthis very important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FRIST). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will continue to work on this with Senator \nMcCain. I understand other Senators are coming to the floor to discuss \nthe issues with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10052-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10052-S10059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to consider the conference agreement for the fiscal year \n2001 Transportation appropriations bill.\n  I believe that this bill strikes a funding balance between the modes \nof transportation, funds critical safety initiatives, reflects the \npriorities of the overwhelming majorities of both the House and the \nSenate, and provides adequate flexibility and direction for the \nDepartment as it transitions into the next administration.\n  Mr. President, allow me to take just a few minutes to summarize and \nhighlight a few of the provisions of the conference report that is now \nbefore the Senate.\n  Of the three issues that the administration indicated were critical \nto it in the safety arena, I'm pleased to report that we're three for \nthree. And, so is the administration. These issues have been negotiated \nin a fashion and with a spirit of accommodating the interests of the \nHouse, the Senate, and the administration. Through some creativity and \nwith an awareness of the specific concerns of all the parties, we have \nbeen able to meet everyone more than halfway.\n  The compromise language on the hours of service regulations in this \nconference report allows the Department to move forward with the \nanalysis of the docket, issue a supplemental NPRM, and do everything \nshort of issuing the final rule. I think that is a reasonable \ncompromise and one that should provide the incentive for the \nadministration to fully listen and solicit views on all sides of this \nissue.\n  As many of you know, I have a concern that NHTSA has ignored calls \nfrom consumer groups and critics of the proposes static stability \nfactor rating system in its rush to publish a rollover rating as part \nof the NCAP program. Notwithstanding that concern, I have been \nconvinced by the distinguished House Chairman, Mr. Wolf, that he \nbelieves that NHTSA, in light of our attention to the issue, will now \nact responsibly in this area.\n  Accordingly, the conference agreement maintains the Senate \nrequirement to conduct a 9-month study at the National Academy of \nSciences. The Academy is directed to investigate the usefulness of the \ninformation that NHTSA proposes to provide, the scientific \nunderpinnings of the NHTSA approach, and consideration of whether \ndynamic testing is preferable to the static stability factor \ncalculation--while simultaneously allowing NHTSA to move forward with \nits proposal.\n  This issue deserves all our attention as it evolved because rollovers \nare among the most deadly of accident types and providing bad \ninformation to consumers could well mean more highway fatalities. \nPeople have a right to expect that the information that the Federal \nGovernment provides is accurate, unbiased, and based on sound testing \nmethodologies. I am pleased that in the conference agreement NHTSA will \nhave to meet that standard, if not in the short term, at least in the \nlong term.\n  The funding levels keep faith with the recently enacted AIR-21 \ncapital and airport authorizations, and come very close to the \nPresident's budget request for FAA operations.\n  The Highway and Transit accounts are funded at the TEA-21 authorized \nlevels; the Coast Guard, adjusted for some of the capital projects \nfunded in the supplemental, is above the President's requested level \nfor fiscal year 2001; NHTSA is above the President's request once it is \nadjusted downward for the RABA shift that was a non-starter with both \nthe House and the Senate.\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\n  Amtrak is funded at the President's request and the remaining \naccounts: Pipeline Safety, the Inspector General, the National \nTransportation Safety Board are all at or above the President's \nrequest.\n  There is no tenable argument that can be made that there isn't enough \nmoney in this bill. The conference agreement includes approximately 14 \npercent more budget resources than the fiscal year 2000 enacted levels.\n\n  In addition, we have tried to reflect and accommodate the priorities \nof our subcommittee members, full committee members, and the membership \nof both the House and Senate. We have listened to what our members have \nrequested us to do and accordingly, the negotiated compromise reflects \nthe priority that members have put on highway and transit spending.\n  There are other issues that have been the subject of some attention--\nthe most notable of which is the .08 blood alcohol content. The Senate \nbill included a provision which would hold back a portion of highway \nfunds from states which fail to adopt a .08 blood alcohol content \nstandard.\n  The conference agreement modifies that provision by providing a more \ngraduated, phased-in approach of the highway holdback and more time for \nstates to adopt the .08 standard. I also want to point out that no \nstate incurs the loss of highway funds if they adopt the .08 blood \nalcohol content standard by 2007. Whatever funds withheld from them \nstarting in 2004 would be returned without penalty under the hold-\nharmless clause as long as a .08 standard is adopted by 2007. I think \nthis is a reasonable and fair transition to a standard that we know \nwill save lives.\n  Mr. President, there are a few people I would particularly like to \nthank before we vote. My ranking members, Senator Lautenberg, has been \na valued partner in this process during his final year as the ranking \nmember of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. While \nwe have had our disagreements and differences, I have been privileged \nto work with him and believe this nation's transportation policy have \nbenefitted by the substantial contributions he has made during his \ntenure in the Senate and on the subcommittee.\n  Senators Stevens and Byrd have provided guidance throughout the year, \nand made a successful bill possible by ensuring an adequate allocation \nfor transportation programs.\n  My House counterpart, Congressman Frank Wolf and his staff: John \nBlazey, Rich Efford, Stephanie Gupta, and Linda Muir, have been \nparticularly accommodating and collegial.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Steve Cortese and Jay Kimmitt \nof the full committee staff for their invaluable assistance and advice \nthroughout the process.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nConference Agreement on the Transportation Appropriations Act for \nFiscal Year 2001. I have served on the Appropriations Committee for all \nbut 2 years of my 18-year career in the Senate.\n  For 14 of those years, I have served either as chairman or ranking \nmember of the Transportation Subcommittee. I can say without \nreservation--and I compliment the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nShelby, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, for the work they did--that this is the best transportation \nbill in those 14 years.\n  The bill makes historic investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure and, simultaneously, takes dramatic steps forward in our \nefforts to improve safety.\n  Under this Conference Agreement, funding for highways will total \nalmost $33.4 billion, a 16 percent increase over the Fiscal Year 2000 \nlevel. Funding for our nation's mass transit systems will grow by 8.4 \npercent.\n  Investment in our nation's airports will grow by an astronomical 69 \npercent, and funding for the FAA's facilities and equipment account, \nwhich makes critical investments in the modernization of our nation's \nair traffic control infrastructure will grow by 22 percent. The bill \nalso includes substantial growth in the critical accounts that ensure \nsafety in all modes of transportation.\n  Funding for the Coast Guard's operating budget will grow by 15 \npercent and funding for the FAA's operating budget will grow by almost \n10 percent. The new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will \nreceive a funding boost of almost 70 percent--an investment that is \nlong overdue in addressing the problem of truck safety.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, this Conference Agreement includes a \nprovision establishing a new national intoxication standard at .08 \nblood alcohol content. This provision has passed the Senate twice \nbefore. First, during Senate consideration of the last highway bill \nand, most recently, as part of this Transportation Appropriations bill.\n  Indeed, this bill passed the Senate by a vote of 99-0, the first time \nin my memory that we had not even one dissenting vote on the \nTransportation bill.\n  The .08 provision contained in this conference report represents a \nhistoric step forward in the federal government's effort to combat \ndrunk driving.\n  Not since we passed the Minimum Drinking Age Act, a law I championed \nback in 1984, have we made such significant progress in saving lives on \nour highways.\n  The .08 provision in this conference agreement largely follows the \noutline of the Minimum Drinking Age Act.\n  It imposes sanctions on states' highway construction funds at an \nincreasing level until they adopt the national .08 standard. States \nthat have their funds sanctioned will have the opportunity to have that \nhighway funding restored so long as they adopt the national standard \nwithin the first six years after enactment of this bill.\n  But states should not wait for the sanctions to even begin--I urge \nstates to act as soon as possible and save lives now.\n  The reason for a national .08 standard is simple--the medical and \nscientific communities confirm that you are too drunk to drive at .08 \nblood alcohol content.\n  Critical driving skills, such as steering and braking decrease by as \nmuch as 60 percent at .08 BAC.\n  NHTSA estimates that this provision will save more than 500 lives per \nyear. And the Senate should be very proud of its efforts today to spare \n500 families from that horrifying phone call in the dark of night \ntelling them that one of their loved ones has died at the hands of a \ndrunk driver.\n  There are a great many people to thank for our success in this \nbipartisan effort. Most importantly, I would like to thank the \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Shelby, who has stuck by me on this \nprovision since the very beginning. As I've mentioned, this was truly a \nbipartisan effort. And it was not easy. We faced stiff opposition from \npowerful interests.\n  My Chairman showed great courage and stood up for the safety of \nAmerica's families.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Wolf, the Chairman of the House \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Through his six years as \nChairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Representative Wolf has \nbeen a true champion for safety.\n  He is the leading congressional expert in the area of truck safety \nand he spent months convincing his colleagues of the merits of a \nnational intoxication standard.\n  I also want to thank President Clinton and Vice President Gore who \nboth personally lobbied the Conferees on this issue, along with members \nof their staff, including John Podesta and Jack Lew of OMB.\n  I would also like to thank Millie Webb, a victim of a .08 driver and \nthe President of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n  She lost a daughter and a nephew--both about 4 years of age--to a \ndrunk driver. She then gave birth to a child prematurely who became \nblind early in her life. This has been Millie's interest for some years \nbecause the driver who committed this horrible crime had a blood \nalcohol content of .08. She is here today to witness this law becoming \neffective because she didn't want any other families to suffer the pain \nand grief she went through.\n  I also want to thank Brandy Anderson, MADD's Congressional \nrepresentative and the rest of the MADD leadership. In addition, I want \nto thank Jackie Gillan and Stephanie Mennen of Advocates for Highway \nSafety.\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\n  The help of these public interest groups was critical to getting this \nlaw passed. They deserve a great deal of credit.\n  In recent months, my office has resembled a ``war room'' on the .08 \nissue, doing everything we can in concert with MADD and Chairman Wolf \nto see to it that the .08 provision could become law this year.\n  I want to thank the members of Mr. Wolf's staff, especially John \nBlazey and Stephanie Gupta, as well as members of my own staff, Peter \nRogoff, Sander Lurie, Dan Katz, Denise Matthews, Gabrielle Batkin, and \nLaurie Saroff who have worked tirelessly on behalf of this provision.\n  I also want to thank one individual who is no longer on my staff. \nDuring consideration of TEA-21, Elizabeth O'Donohue was a tireless \nadvocate for the .08 provision. We were able to get the .08 provision \nadopted in the Senate on the TEA-21 bill, but we ran into an ambush in \nthe House of Representatives, thanks to the negative work of the liquor \nlobby.\n  While Liz is no longer with my staff, I want to recognize the \nextraordinary groundwork that she laid in past years. There is no \nquestion that her efforts contributed greatly to our success here \ntoday.\n  In addition, I want to thank Tom Howarth, a former member of my staff \nwho helped us get the 21 year old minimum drinking age passed, and has \nworked for years to make the .08 standard the law of the land.\n  I also want to thank Senator Shelby's excellent staff, including \nWally Burnett, Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, Tom Young and Kathy Casey.\n  Finally, as I make my parting comments as a leader on the \nTransportation Subcommittee, I want to make one last request of my \ncolleagues. When the Senate considers a new highway bill in 2002 or \nlater, I will no longer be a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee or the Senate and I certainly am not going to be in a \nposition to work as hard as I did in the past on this issue. There is \nno question, when the Senate considers a new highway bill, there could \nbe an attempt to repeal the national .08 standard. I am sure my \ncolleagues are sensible people and I implore them not to bend to the \npressure of those that would bring more bloodshed to our highways. I \nurge my colleagues not to flinch from their commitment to safety. \nPlease do not condemn 500 American families a year to the tragedy of \nlosing a loved one to drunk driving.\n  I urge my colleagues to maintain a national drunk driving policy \nbased on safety, sanity and science. You must not bend to those who \nwould seek to undo the progress we have made.\n  I yield the floor for this my last transportation bill as a Member of \nthe Senate. I have enjoyed my service on this subcommittee. I think it \nhas been important to the country, but particularly to my State, to see \nthe improvements we have been able to make on highway safety and mass \ntransit.\n  Finally, I think we are on our way to getting high-speed rail service \nand inner-city rail service in place. That is the only way to relieve \nthe congestion in the skies and on the highways. There is no more room \nin the skies for additional airlines, no matter what we put on the \nground.\n  I hope we will give high-speed rail the resources it needs to say to \nthose people who are unable to make their business appointments or \ntheir contacts because of delayed flights, here is one way to make a \ndifference in the way we travel in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the Senator from New Jersey to \nunderstand, before he leaves the floor, how appreciative I personally \nam, and the whole Senate is, for the work the Senator has done--not \nonly in the Transportation appropriations--for many years. The Senator \nhas set the pattern for transportation in the most rapidly growing \nState, Nevada. The Senator has been instrumental in the things we have \nbeen able to do with Senator Shelby, to come up with programs for the \nState of Nevada that have been remarkably efficient and good.\n  In addition to that, before the Senator leaves, this may be the last \nopportunity we have to speak publicly on the Senator's behalf as to the \nthings the Senator has done in relation to tobacco. I remember my \nchildren had respiratory problems and they hated to fly in an airplane. \nThere was smoking and nonsmoking. That was a fallacy; it was all \nsmoking. It is because of the Senator and his perseverance that we have \npeople flying smoke free on airplanes all over the country. It is a \ncrime to smoke a cigarette, as it should be, on an airplane.\n  This is just one of many things, including gun control, that the \nSenator has done on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We have \nserved together my entire 14 years in the Senate. The Senator has been \na leader in the area dealing with the environment. I speak not only for \nme but the entire Senate in gratitude for the great work the Senator \nhas done.\n\n\n                            fhwa its account\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nwork on the fiscal year 2001 Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill. The conference report we are considering today is \na balanced report. The bill meets fully the congressional commitment to \nhighway, transit and aviation spending in TEA-21 and AIR-21.\n  The bill makes transportation in our nation safer and more efficient. \nOur healthy economy is dependent on this bill. I would like to request \none small item of clarification. The report includes a remark in the \nFHwA's Intelligent Transportation Systems account directing $750,000 to \nallow the State of Montana to complete the STARS program. This a great \nnew program that I expect will receive national attention in the near \nfuture once long haul truck operators are made aware of the \nefficiencies it will provide them.\n  However, I have been made aware by my staff that the intention of \nthese funds were to allow the State of Montana to use these funds to \ncomplete deployment of the STARS programs and also establish a GIS/GPS \nframework on the State's public roadways which will benefit the safety \nof the traveling public in Montana.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for his support of this report. I \nagree with my colleague from Montana that the intention of these funds \nwithin the framework established by the ITS account are available to \nthe State of Montana for use in both completing the STARS program, as \nwell as, working on the GIS/GPS project.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with great regret \nthat I rise today to oppose the conference report to the Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  I want to begin by praising my colleagues on the Committee on \nAppropriations who have worked so hard on this bill and conference \nreport. I know they have faced many difficult issues, competing demands \nfor limited resources, and the pressure of time as this Congress winds \ndown. And there are many good provisions in this bill, including \nseveral that will benefit my home State of New Hampshire.\n  These include: $2 million of the extension of the Commuter Rail line \nfrom Boston to Lowell, Massachusetts into Nashua, New Hampshire; A \nprovision that designates the I-93 project as a national model for \nimplementation of environmental streamlining; $1.5 million for \nimprovements to U.S. Route 2 in New Hampshire; $500,000 for the Concord \n20/20 Vision project; $250,000 for the Bedford, New Hampshire Route 101 \nCorridor Study and Improvements; $200,000 for a Feasibility Study of a \nHigh Speed Rail Corridor from Boston, MA to Burlington, VT, through New \nHampshire; $10 million nationally for the Historic Covered Bridge \nProgram, under which N.H. communities can apply for funds to repair \ncovered bridges; $12 million for construction of the Broad Street \nParkway in Nashua, NH; Over $137 million to the New Hampshire \nDepartment of Transportation under the states' federal highway \nallocation authorized by the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century (TEA-21).\n  But this bill contains several objectionable departures from TEA-21, \nwhich are under the clear jurisdiction of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the authorizing committee which I chair.\n  First, I am concerned about the so-called .08 blood alcohol content \n(BAC) provision to mandate a nationwide standard for state drunk \ndriving laws by threatening sanctions on highway\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nfunding. In TEA-21 we specifically rejected this approach in favor of \nincentives to encourage stronger drunk driving laws. Congress worked \nhard to reach this compromise during TEA-21 so that states could \naddress highway safety and drunk driving in a variety of ways, without \nthe federal government forcing them to focus on whether their laws \ncontain .08 as the magic number. This heavy handed approach that was \npushed through on an appropriations bill threatens to take away highway \nfunds from 32 states. I will carry my strong opposition to funding \nsanctions into the next transportation reauthorization bill, and I hope \nwe have seen the last of this kind of federal intervention.\n  On this issue of funding, in TEA-21 we guaranteed collections into \nthe Highway Trust Fund would be redistributed to the states and to DOT \ndiscretionary programs. When these collections are above TEA-21 \nestimates, the additional funds, called RABA funds, are distributed \naccording to TEA-21.\n  This bill makes several major and minor adjustments to the RABA \nfunds--including failing to provide for some programs, and diverting \nthese funds to special projects.\n  On top of this, the bill also takes an extra $1.4 billion in funds \nfrom the Highway Trust fund to go to special projects.\n  This money is not authorized to be spent in TEA-21. This money comes \nout of Highway Trust Fund balances. This is like the balance in your \ncheckbook that is there to pay outstanding bills and checks that are \nwaiting to clear.\n  In TEA-21 we crafted careful compromises over how Highway Trust Fund \ndollars are spent and distributed. This bill ignores our work and \nincludes page after page of earmarks for unauthorized projects.\n  We have not been consulted on the viability of these projects, we \nhave no assurance that these projects are important, whether they have \nmet environmental clearances, or whether the funds provided are based \non engineering estimates for these projects.\n  The Highway Trust Fund money is to be distributed to states where \nthey have local control over which projects are funded and when. This \nbill attempts to circumvent this process with funding earmarks.\n  I object to this intrusion into the Highway Trust Fund. It is unwise \nto pick and choose highway projects to insert in the appropriations \nbill.\n  As I stated at the beginning, there are many good provisions in this \nTransportation conference report. I applaud the work that my colleagues \nhave done and appreciate the support they have given to important New \nHampshire projects. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I \noppose the conference report.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the \nConference Report on H.R. 4475, the Transportation Appropriations Act, \nbecause it contains a number of provisions that I support. Others have \nnoted the amount of special interest spending that was included in this \nbill. While I understand and share the desire of others to respond to \nparticular local concerns, the level of such spending in this bill has \nbecome so great that it undercuts the efforts we made in the last \nCongress to bring more equity to the way transportation dollars are \ndistributed.\n  Mr. President, beyond that I am greatly disappointed that this \nmeasure also includes a provision that is effectively a mandate on \nStates with respect to blood alcohol levels. This issue is classically \na matter of State discretion, and the Federal government has no \nbusiness engaging in what amounts to little more than extortion to \nimpose a policy on States in an area that is so clearly a State matter.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor before to talk about the \ndisturbing trend toward the federalization of matters that should be \nleft to state and local governments to decide. We have seen this in a \nnumber of policy areas, including our criminal justice system, but \nperhaps no area has been the subject of more inappropriate Federal \nintervention than transportation. From speed limits to seat belts, from \nhelmets to blood alcohol levels, Congress effectively has usurped State \nauthority to set public policy in this area.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to serve in the Wisconsin State \nSenate for ten years, and I can tell you that state legislators like to \nhave something to do. State legislators and governors are fully capable \nof understanding the arguments made in favor of adopting the .08 \nstandard, and the Congress should not interfere with a policy matter \nthat is so clearly a State prerogative.\n  Again, Mr. President, I regret I cannot support this measure. \nAdequate funding for the full spectrum of our transportation \ninfrastructure is one of my highest budget priorities. But the \ninclusion of the blood alcohol standard puts that very needed funding \nat risk for states like Wisconsin that have a different policy. As with \nthe special interest provisions that are included in this measure, it \nundermines the great strides that were made as part of TEA 21 to get \nWisconsin a fairer portion of the revenue Wisconsin taxpayers \ncontribute to the transportation fund.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States' transportation \ninfrastructure is vital to its success as a nation. The ability to \nregulate and move goods and people safely and efficiently by land, air \nand sea has defined industrialized countries, nationally and \ninternationally, for centuries. With our economy prospering, there have \nbeen significant increases in travel and movement of goods across our \ncountry. As a result, it is essential that critical transportation \nsafety and policy programs get proper funding. This Transportation \nAppropriations conference report takes some appropriate steps in that \ndirection.\n  However, while I agree with the need for increased funding, I do not \nagree with the need for increased pork. Unfortunately, once again, the \nappropriations committee has adopted the mantra that increased funding \nfor necessary programs equals increased pork-barrel spending for \nparochial projects.\n  Mr. President, while I was speaking on the floor Monday, I read aloud \nfrom an article in that day's Wall Street Journal about the \nCongressional scramble to wrap up budget negotiations while at the same \ntime, a frantic chase was underway by members seeking to ensure they \ncould take home plenty of earmarked port barrel projects for their \ndistricts and states. Well, that article was like reading a crystal \nball. And this enormously bloated transportation bill takes the cake. \nIt illustrates one of the most gluttonous, pork-driven, self-serving \nspending agendas we've seen yet.\n  Therefore, once again I must rise to object to the immense amount of \nspecial projects that have been earmarked in a conference report. \nThrough the appropriations conference, legislators have tacked on \nmillions of dollars in special interest ``projects''. These projects \nare pure pork tacked on for the benefit of a particular area or \ncommunity. While some of these projects may not be objectionable on \ntheir merits, the process by which they are added is unconscionable.\n  During closed-door conferences, decisions were made to tack on \nmillions of dollars in special projects. Other members were not allowed \nto participate in, or vote on, the outcome. While democracy is the \nfoundation of our government, the democratic process is shut out of \nthese closed-door proceedings. Members were not even allowed to view \nthe contents of this report until early this morning, even though it \nhas been reported the conference was completed Tuesday morning. No \nmember should be asked to consider a 146 page bill and 236 page report \nthey were given no time to review. I do not think the managers of this \nlegislation, nor, more importantly, the leadership of this chamber, \nshould be at all proud of how this process has been handled. Indeed, \nthis is not the kind of leadership we can expect the American voters to \nembrace.\n  This earmarking process takes away the discretion of the very Federal \nagencies created and empowered to disburse federal funding. At the \ncurrent levels of earmarking, we should just save the American \ntaxpayers billions of dollars and abolish all Federal agencies and let \nthe appropriators dole out money directly without any oversight.\n  This transportation appropriations conference report adds more than \n$3 billion over the Administration's FY 2001 funding request.\n  According to published reports, and I must rely on them, since \nneither I nor my staff have been allowed to view the\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\nreport until moments ago, more than $2 billion of these funds are \nearmarked for highway and bridge projects.\n  I note $600 million is earmarked for the project to replace the \nWoodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River between Virginia and \nMaryland. The project already was given an earmark of $900 million \nthrough the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, TEA-21--that \nis, $900 million in addition to the billions of dollars each state \nreceives in their annual highway funding allocation. To add insult to \ninjury, the additional money is being taken from the budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, mark my word, that project is the next ``Big Dig'' in \nthe making. The estimated costs of the project have already soared from \n$1.9 billion to $2.5 billion--and you can bet those costs will keep \ngoing up and up and up.\n  Besides earmarking more than $2 billion in extra funds for highway \nand bridge projects, of which the Wilson Bridge receives 25 percent of, \nthe conference managers earmarked nearly every other dollar available \nin the bill.\n  These earmarks reportedly include $102 million for the U.S. 82 bridge \nover the Mississippi River at Greenville, Mississippi, $100 million for \nI-49 in Arkansas and almost $20 million for I-69 in Tennessee. Mr. \nPresident, there are a lot of roads and bridges that need \nrehabilitation; I don't understand why Congress is substituting its \njudgment for the judgment of Federal agencies.\n  In addition, there have been a reported $700 million in transit \nearmarks for the Chicago Metro and Transit Authority in the home state \nof the Speaker of the House, for a rapid transit bus project at Dulles \nInternational Airport in the home state of the Chairman of the House \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee and for the Minneapolis \nHiawatha project in the home district of the ranking member of the \nHouse Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  According to his own press releases, and again, I had to rely on them \nsince I had no real opportunity to view the bill, the Chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation has managed to \nearmark almost $300 million in transportation funds for his home state. \nAgain that is $300 million in personal projects for his state!\n  Included in this amount is $100 million for the construction of \n``Corridor X'', a 97 mile highway through northwest Alabama; $34 \nmillion for construction of the Birmingham Northern Beltline; $10 \nmillion to construct a Transportation Technology Center at Auburn \nUniversity; $3 million to the State of Alabama to develop a training \nprogram for jobs in the automobile manufacturing field.\n  The conference report also provides $9 million to replace the \nWhitesburg Bridge in Alabama; $5 million for the Mobile Alabama \nMaritime Center; $2.5 million to initiate on-campus shuttle bus service \nat the University of South Alabama; $2 million for the University of \nAlabama-Birmingham to acquire fuel cell buses; and $2 million to the \nUniversity of North Alabama to improve transit and pedestrian access.\n  Mr. President, this is taxpayer money used to fund the personal pork \nprojects of the appropriators. And I have never seen the levels of pork \nthat we are reaching.\n  This year, for the first time ever, the appropriators have earmarked \n$300 million for specific discretionary projects in the FAA airport \nimprovement program. This past year, we fought long and hard with the \nappropriators and budgeteers to ensure that there was increased funding \nfor airport infrastructure. This was necessary to attempt to keep up \nwith the significant increase in air travel over the past 10 years and \nthe expected increase over the next 10. I congratulate Congress for \nmeeting the agreed upon levels of authorizations.\n  However, now that we have increased funding, the appropriators feel \nas if they have the necessary knowledge and expertise to determine \nwhere $300 million of these monies should go. Mr. President, I realize \nthat as members of Congress, we travel a great deal. However, I don't \nbelieve that experience supplies members with the necessary wisdom to \nreplace FAA's judgment on which projects deserve merit and which \nprojects do not.\n  The FAA is tasked with the safety of our aviation system. But \nCongress won't let it do the job. Now we are saying to--indeed, the \nbill directs--the FAA to spend this increased funding where Congress \nwants it to, not where it is needed. Mr. President, this is obscene and \nuntenable.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about pork-barrel spending and \nits effect on the taxpayer, but I will conclude with this thought. We \nhave acted responsibly to increase funding, we are not acting \nresponsibly by denoting where this money should go. I ask unanimous \nconsent that examples of this port barrel spending from the \ntransportation appropriations conference report be entered in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Objectionable Provisions in H.R. 4475, FY 2001 Transportation \n               Appropriations Conference Committee Report\n\n

Mr. President, it has now been 218 days--218 days that \nthe Judiciary Committee of the Senate has had Bonnie J. Campbell's name \nthere and not reported her out. She has had her hearings. Her paperwork \nis done. Yet she sits bottled up in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I understand that later today--or maybe early next week--there will \nbe a unanimous consent request to bring up for consideration and pass \nthe Violence Against Women Act. It is a very good bill, a good law, \nthat has done a lot to help reduce domestic violence in our country.\n  But we have an interesting dichotomy here. There will be a line of \nSenators out here talking about how they are all for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. It will go through here like greased lightning. But \nwhen it comes to the person who has been in charge of implementing the \nprovisions of the Violence Against Women Act, the person who has been \nin charge of the Office of Violence Against Women since its beginning \nin 1995--because it was created by the Violence Against Women Act--when \nit comes to that person who is widely recognized all over America as \nthe one person who has done more to implement that law than anybody \nelse--when it comes to that person, they say, no, we are not going to \nlet her be reported out of the Judiciary Committee. That is Bonnie \nCampbell.\n  It is all right to have the Violence Against Women Act but, no, it is \nnot all right to have her sit on the court of appeals--the one person \nwho knows this law intimately, the one person who has led the fight in \nthis country against domestic violence and violence against women in \ngeneral.\n  Bonnie Campbell has not been treated fairly by this Senate, by the \nRepublican leadership, and by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I have heard all the arguments--including the one that she she wasn't \nnominated until this year. Mr. President, she was nominated in early \nMarch. She had her hearing in May. Yet the other day we reported four \njudges out, all of whom were nominated later than Bonnie Campbell. \nThree were nominated in July, had their hearing, and were reported out \nall in the same week. Yet Bonnie Campbell sits there, 218 days today.\n  It is not as if the appeals courts are full. We have 22 vacancies on \nthe appeals courts. And we need more women serving on the appeals \ncourt. Out of 148 circuit judges, 33 are women--22 percent. Yet the \nRepublican leadership in this Senate and on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will not let Bonnie Campbell's name come out for a vote.\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\n  If somebody on the other side wants to vote against her, for whatever \nreason, that is their right. It is their senatorial privilege and even \ntheir responsibility, if they feel deeply about it, to do so. But I \ndon't believe it is anyone's responsibility, nor even a right, to hold \nthat name bottled up in committee when she is fully qualified. I have \nnot heard one Senator say Bonnie Campbell is not qualified for this \nposition--not one. I have heard no objections raised at all. She is \nsupported by both the Senators from Iowa--a Republican Senator, Mr. \nGrassley, and by me, a Democrat. So there has been strong, bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Again, she is a former attorney general of the State of Iowa and now \nhead of the Violence Against Women office. Yet they won't report her \nname out.\n  Yes, they will let the Violence Against Women Act come through, and \nwe will hear wonderful speeches about it, I am sure, from the \nRepublican side. The House of Representatives, last week, voted for the \nViolence Against Women Act, 415-3. Does anybody believe they would have \nvoted that overwhelmingly if the only person who has run that office \nhad done a bad job and had not enforced the law fairly and equitably \nand brought honor to the law and the position? Absolutely not. By that \n415-3 vote, they were saying Bonnie Campbell has done an outstanding \njob.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say this to the Senator from Iowa--and I wonder \nwhether he would agree with me--I think if we had an up-or-down vote on \nBonnie Campbell, it would be 100-0 or 99-1. Under the Violence Against \nWomen Act, in terms of dramatically affecting the lives of women and \ntheir children, we would not have been able to have made a real \ndifference without Bonnie Campbell. She is the one who made this a \nreality----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When it came to directly affecting their lives. If we \nhad a vote, I think it would be 100-0 or 99-1.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hadn't made that point, but yes, that is true. If we \nhad a vote, I daresay maybe one or two may have a problem for some \nreason, but I think it would be overwhelming.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Republican nominee for President, George W. Bush, has \nsaid what the Senate ought to do on all these nominees is, within 60 \ndays, vote them up or down, but at least bring them to a vote. Would \nthe Senator from Iowa agree with me that that is a good idea on what \nshould be done?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think that is a great idea.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would he also agree with me that if Governor Bush actually \nmeans that, he ought to pick up the phone and call the Republican \nleadership and say there are an awful lot of women and minorities and \nothers who have been bottled up, as well as Bonnie Campbell, a lot \nlonger than 60 days--I think one for more than 1,360 days--we ought to \nvote them up or down?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Lastly, would the Senator from Iowa agree with me that all \nhe wants and would be satisfied with--bring her down here, 9 o'clock in \nthe morning, or at night, whatever, and let's have a rollcall vote? I \ncan assure you, I have read all of her file, and I sit on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I have gone through every bit of this. Bonnie Campbell is \none of the most qualified people nominated by either a Republican or \nDemocrat in the 25 years I have been on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator from Vermont, my great friend \nwho does an outstanding job on the Judiciary Committee. He is \nabsolutely right. Governor Bush said we ought to have a 60-day \ndeadline. He should pick up the phone, as my friend said, and call the \nRepublican leadership. He is the leader of the Republican Party.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I will, as I do every day, ask unanimous consent to \ndischarge the Judiciary Committee on further consideration of the \nnomination of Bonnie Campbell, nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, \nand that her nomination be considered by the Senate following the \nconclusion of action on the pending matter, and that the debate on the \nnomination be limited to 2 hours equally divided, and that a vote on \nher nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I intend to make my point every day. And \nas you can see, an objection to bringing Bonnie Campbell's name out of \nthe Judiciary Committee so we can have a debate and vote is made every \ntime on the Republican side. That is who is holding this up. It is a \ndarn shame that this is being done to a person who has led an exemplary \nlife, done an outstanding job in public service both as attorney \ngeneral of Iowa and now as head of the Violence Against Women Office in \nthe Department of Justice. It is not right, it is not fair.\n  So every day that we are here I will continue to ask unanimous \nconsent to bring her name out. Before I yield the floor, once again, I \nwill point out that in 1992, when there was a Republican President and \na Democratic Senate, 9 circuit court judges had their hearings; there \nwere 14 nominated in 1992, during an election year, and 9 had hearings. \nOf all those who had hearings, they were all referred and all \nconfirmed--one as late as October of 1992, a couple in September, and a \ncouple were in August.\n  When the shoe was on the other foot, when there was a Republican \nPresident and a Democratic Senate, we had the hearings. Everyone who \nhad a hearing during the Bush Administration got a vote in Committee. \nAll but one got a vote on the Senate floor. Well, Bonnie Campbell had \nher hearing. All the paperwork is done. Yet she has been referred. \nEvery single one was confirmed in 1992.\n  Well, this is the year 2000 and we have had seven circuit court \njudges nominated this year. One has had a hearing and was referred and \nwas confirmed. That is one out of seven. In 1992, it was 9 out of 14. \nTell me who is playing politics around this place. Tell me who wants to \nplay politics with the circuit courts. It is not our side. It is the \nother side.\n  In 1992, as I said, we had nine circuit judges nominated and \nconfirmed. This year, there was only one. No. 1, it is a flimsy \nargument to say because she was nominated this year it is too late. No. \n2, it is a phony argument that, well, it is a circuit court and maybe \nGeorge Bush will win the election and, therefore, we will put \nRepublicans on there instead of somebody such as Bonnie Campbell.\n  In 1992, as I pointed out, when the roles were reversed, we confirmed \nnine circuit court judges that year. We could have said the same thing: \nBill Clinton may win, so don't confirm them. But we didn't do that. I \nbelieve the right course of action to follow is to report those out, \nlet them have a debate. If people want to vote one way or the other, \nthat is their right.\n  I will continue to take this floor every day until we adjourn sine \ndie, or whatever we do here. I will begin to use every means at my \ndisposal to get her name out of the Judiciary Committee and make sure \nshe is treated fairly by this Senate and that at least we have a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3059\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am doing a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, in \nconsultation with the Democrat leader, establish a date certain and \ntime certain for consideration of S. 3059, and that only relevant \namendments to the bill be in order.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Chair, is there no \ntime certain for the vote on the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time certain.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I have the reason for the objection?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we are very anxious to move forward on \nthis\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\nmatter, but we want a time for the vote.\n  Is this your request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my request.\n  Mr. REID. I thought it was a different matter; sorry. I withdraw my \nobjection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves the \nfloor, the Senator from Alabama should understand what he is doing.\n  This bill came out 2 weeks ago. This bill came out 2 weeks ago and \nthere are relevant amendments that are in order. The Senator from \nAlabama is going to bear responsibility for our failure to act.\n  Mr. President, I quote to the Senator from Alabama what the Secretary \nof Transportation says:\n\n       More importantly, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects.\n\n  I tell the Senator from Alabama, if we don't act expeditiously, we \nwill not address life-threatening motor vehicle safety defects.\n  The Senator from Alabama can have all the amendments he wants that \nare relevant, and he can have all the time he wants that is relevant. \nBy blocking the bill, the Senator from Alabama assumes great \nresponsibility, great responsibility. I hope he has a chance to talk to \nthe relatives of those who have already been killed, and those who are \ngoing to be killed if this legislation is killed.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, in \nconsultation with the Democrat leader, establish a date certain and a \ntime certain for consideration of S. 3059, and only relevant amendments \nto the bill be in order.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, that doesn't mean there is any time \nlimit or any limits on amendments. An objection to this can only be \nviewed as obstructionism. I say again, expeditious action on \ncomprehensive legislation will strengthen NHTSA's ability to address \nlife-threatening motor vehicle safety defects.\n  I intend to come back to the floor in about 15 minutes and propound \nthis unanimous consent agreement again, if there is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. How long does the Senator from Alabama desire to speak?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Montana has been on the floor for a long \ntime and he wants 10 minutes; the Senator from Connecticut desires 10 \nminutes. I ask permission from the Senator from Montana to allow the \nSenator from Alabama to speak for 5 minutes, and I ask unanimous \nconsent the speaking order be: the Senator from Alabama for 5 minutes; \nthe Senator from Montana, 15 minutes; the Senator from Connecticut for \n10 minutes, in that order; and following my having this consent \ngranted, I ask that the Senators from Minnesota and from Kansas be \nallowed to speak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. At most to proffer a unanimous consent. Could we do \nthat first?\n  I understand Senator Domenici seeks 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent Senator Domenici speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I will want to have 10 \nminutes following Senator Domenici for the purpose of propounding \nanother unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is a unanimous consent agreed to and worked out \nad nauseam on both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10061-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10061-S10062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3244\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 \na.m. on Wednesday the Senate proceed to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3244, the trafficking victims conference report and the \nconference report which has just passed the House, and be considered as \nhaving been read and considered under the following agreement for \ndebate only: 2 hours equally divided between Senators Brownback and \nWellstone, or their designees; 3 hours under the control of the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary committee; 1 hour under the control of Senator \nBiden; and 1 hour under the control of Senator Hatch.\n  I further ask consent that following the conclusion or yielding back \nof time, Senator Thompson be recognized to make a point of order \nagainst the conference report that the conference text, section 2001, \nregarding Aimee's law is not in the jurisdiction of the Foreign \nRelations committee and following the ruling by the Chair, Senator \nThompson would appeal the Chair's ruling and that appeal be limited to \nthe following: 1 hour under the control of Senator Thompson.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of \ntime, the vote relative to the appeal occur immediately on Wednesday, \nand if the Chair is not overturned, no other action occur and the \nSenate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report, \nimmediately, without any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, sometimes it is work to \nmanufacture a time for a vote. I note, so there is not any confusion, \nand notwithstanding the fact that the conference report was sent over \nwithout people seeing it, I am perfectly happy to have the vote on this \ntoday. I am perfectly happy to go to a vote today on each of the \naspects, so there will not be any question on that, and I understand \nthat notwithstanding the fact that we can't get any other work done \naround here, the Republican leadership, which is their right, is going \nto take a few days off again, but I want to at least have this debate \non the day we vote.\n  I commend the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Minnesota for \ntheir work in getting us to this point. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator from Arizona cares deeply about his \nlegislation. He cares deeply about every legislative piece he pushes. I \nhave some important legislation pending, too, and I haven't had time to \ndebate them.\n  The Paul Coverdell Criminal Laboratory for Forensic bill will \nprobably save more lives than this bill. However, I think his request \nis not unreasonable. I do believe the bill has problems. As a person \nwho prosecuted for over 15 years, I do not believe in a continual \nblurring of the lines between what is criminal liability and civil \nliability.\n\n  We are talking about making crimes out of defective building of an \nautomobile. I think we have to be careful about that. It has not gone \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. I have not had a chance to see it and \nI was very concerned about it. I indicated my concern to others.\n  As I have been briefed on this just 5 minutes ago, by my staff--they \nprovided a memorandum which I have not had a chance to even read--I was \nprepared to go forward with the Senator's request and not object. \nHowever, I find that several people expected that I would be objecting \nwho also wanted to object, and I felt I was obligated, due to that \nmiscommunication, to file an objection.\n  Two hours from now I will not object if no one else does. I am \nprepared to debate these problems and see if we can cure these \nproblems, but I do not feel it would be a collegial thing for me to do, \nwhen apparently it was thought that I would object, so that is why I \nobject.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield to me just for a comment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Alabama. I will be back in 2 \nhours. I want to assure him I understand those concerns, particularly \non criminal sanctions. No one knows the situation better than the \nSenator from Alabama, who was a former attorney general of his State, \nwho has more knowledge on those issues than I do. I want to work with \nthe Senator from Alabama on that. That is why relevant\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\namendments will be in order. I just hope the Senator from Alabama will \nallow this to move forward when we propound it again.\n  Again, I understand very well the concerns he has. That is why the \nunanimous consent agreement calls for simply relevant amendments, with \nno time limit. I think the stark political reality around here, as the \nSenator from Alabama knows, is that we are not coming back in until \nWednesday. If the Senator from Alabama and others who object just have \nnumerous amendments, there is no way we are going to be able to get a \nbill passed and then into conference with the House and move forward. \nSo I thank the Senator from Alabama for his consideration. I understand \nhis concerns. I look forward very much to working with him.\n  I yield and I thank my colleague from Montana for his indulgence.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a matter that \nhas impacted every inhabitant of the state of Montana: The wildfires of \nthe past 2 months. The recent rain and snow have finally brought the \nfires in Montana under control, but many of the largest fires are still \nsmoldering.\n  The Helena Independent Record Recently described the summer of 2000 \nas a:\n\n       Fire season marked by miracles and loss, heroism and \n     heartache, smoky skies and blackened backyards, of \n     evacuations, waiting, planning and prayer.\n\n  This photo showing two elk trying to escape the flames was taken on \nAugust 6th in the Bitterroot Valley by Forest Service firefighter John \nMcColgan. On this particular day several forest fires converged near \nSula, burning over 100,000 acres and destroying 10 homes. And this fire \nwas just one of dozens burning across Montana.\n  Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that these fires \nimpacted every inhabitant of Montana. Even people in our cities, miles \nfrom the front lines, lived with a constant reminder of the \nconflagration burning about them.\n  As you can see in this photo of Helena, cities all across the region \nspent weeks under a cloud of smoke.\n  Clearly, it was one of the worst fire seasons we've seen in the last \n100 years.\n  This is our cathedral, Saint Helena's Cathedral. You can see big \nsmoke columns rising. The fact is, this is dramatically an \nunderstatement. I have asked my office to see if there are other photos \nwhich more accurately describe the situation in my State, and this is \nall we could come up with at the time. But this town, Helena, I might \nsay, was so covered with smoke that my house--up just about 500, 600 \nfeet from here--as I was looking across the back alley through the \nkitchen window, I could not even see across the alley. The whole city \nwas just covered all the way down to ground level with smoke. That was \nthe rule. That was the rule for all Montana cities, with the exception \nmaybe of some of the eastern Montana cities. Most of them had just \ndense smoke impact for a long time. Clearly one of the worst fire \nseasons we have seen in over 100 years.\n  But, Mr. President, I didn't come to the floor to talk about how bad \nthe fires were--that's already apparent. Nor did I come down here to \ntalk about forest management policy and what we could have done to \nlessen the harmful impact of these fires--there will be plenty of time \nto address both topics in the weeks and months to come.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to commend the efforts of the \nthousands of people who pulled together to do battle with one of Mother \nNature's most unforgiving forces.\n  From New Zealand's finest, most experienced firefighters to the \nMontana volunteers who ran Red Cross evacuee camps, the fires brought \ntogether some of the most courageous and hard-working individuals I \nhave ever encountered.\n  Someone once told me that the true character of any community will \nreveal itself in the face of a natural disaster. I am proud of how \nMontanans and all of those who came to help rose to this challenge and \npersevered.\n  Of all the statistics--almost a million acres burned, over 300 \nstructures lost, over $200 million spent in battling fires--the one \nstatistic I am most proud of is the number of human casualties--zero. \nThat's right, in Montana not one life was lost during this disaster and \nno one was seriously injured.\n  I can't tell you how proud I am that safety remained the highest \npriority: of all of the firefighters who were in harm's way, the pilots \nwho flew risky missions dumping water or retardant chemicals over the \nfiery landscape, and the thousands of people who were evacuated--no one \nwas seriously injured. To me, that's one heck of a statistic.\n  That's why today, Mr. President, I want to extend a heartfelt ``thank \nyou,'' and I know I speak for every Montanan.\n  I want to thank firefighters from across the country, and around the \nworld. Volunteer firefighters who left their regular jobs. The \nemployees who let them go. Students who postponed attending classes. \nThe families left at home and the co-workers who put in overtime to \ncover for those who traveled to the west.\n  I might say in this photo, in the center is James Lee Witt, flanked \nby two members of the Montana delegation, myself on the left, and \nSenator Burns on the right. We are talking to a volunteer firefighter.\n  These are people who, when the fire comes, often are in an area next \nto a community--there are homes back in the woods and the volunteer \nfighters immediately rush out. They are the first ones there. They are \nthere without any pay. It is their community and they are fighting \ntheir hearts out. They are bleeding, almost literally--doing all they \ncan to prevent that structure from burning, to do all they can to force \nthe fire back. They are not paid. It is without compensation. The \nForest Service and smokejumpers are; there are others who are not paid. \nThe others are not. They are the first there and often the last to \nleave. They are just into it because it is their community.\n  I called James Lee Witt, pictured in the center of this photo. He \nvery quickly got some regulations changed so volunteer firefighters \ncould be reimbursed. Recently now they are receiving payment for the \nservices they rendered. But the point is, people came from all over. \nEmployers let volunteers leave work--it was lost work, but still the \nmain job had to be done fighting these fires. Students postponed \nattending classes at the University of Montana, or other classes, \nfamilies left at home, coworkers who put in overtime to cover those who \ntraveled to the West.\n  The Red Cross and its hundreds of volunteers who were there when \nfolks needed to see a friendly face. The various state agencies that \nworked diligently and expeditiously to implement emergency plans. The \nfederal agencies that came forward to help put the fires out and begin \nto rebuild these communities.\n  Specifically, I'd like to commend FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency for their efforts. On several occasions, they quickly \nreleased federal funds or waived personnel requirements. Cutting red \ntape so we could get the assistance we needed right away.\n  I especially thank FEMA Director James Lee Witt who spent countless \nhours working with me and other folks in Montana. When these fires \nstarted to blow in Montana, James Lee Witt said he was really booked up \nwith other plans, but he dramatically changed his schedule so he could \ncome to Montana. That made a huge difference in getting agencies to \nwork together, and it cut so much of this redtape. FEMA is still \nworking on recovery efforts, and we very much appreciate all they have \ndone and continue to do.\n  I also thank with the same enthusiasm the adjutant general of the \nMontana National Guard, Gene Prendergast, and all his troops. Gene \nreally stepped up. This guy really cares. He mobilized his troops, who \ncare just as much. He was also influential in working with Federal, \nState, and local agencies to coordinate plans and requests for Federal \nassistance. We owe Gene Prendergast a huge debt of gratitude.\n  At the high point of the fires, there were well over 12,000 people \nfighting blazes in western Montana. That includes Forest Service \nfirefighters and\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nNational Guard men and women. We had 3 active-duty battalions from the \nEast coming to fight fires in Montana. People came from everywhere--\nfrom 48 States and 3 countries--to Montana. Across the West, some \n30,000 brave individuals battled wildfires during this season.\n  We did not lose any lives in our State, thanks to the combination of \nsolid training, sensible fire strategy, and good luck. The dangers \nfaced by these individuals, however, were obviously real. Think of the \ndanger we put people into.\n  Last year, we took time to remember the Mann Gulch fire. That was a \nhuge fire in Montana which blew up about 50 years ago. Thirteen \nNational Forest Service smoke jumpers died in that blowup. They were \nfighting a fire 10 miles away from Helena, 10 miles from the photo I \nshowed earlier. It was not thought to be a fire that was going to \nthreaten lives or property. An observer described the Mann Gulch fire \nwith these words:\n\n       A terrific draft of superheated air of tremendous velocity \n     had swept up the hill exploding all inflammable material, \n     causing a wall of flame 600 feet high to roll over the ridge \n     and down the other side and continue over ridges and down \n     gulches until the fuels were so light that the wall could not \n     maintain enough heat to continue. This wall covered 3,000 \n     acres in 10 minutes. Anything caught in the direct path of \n     the heat blast perished.\n\n  Just 6 years ago, we lost 14 smoke jumpers in a similar firestorm \nnear Glenwood Springs, CO. This fire, like the Mann Gulch, was \nconsidered routine, and these were not even the most deadly fires in \nthe West's history. It is important to remember those who gave their \nlives fighting wildfires. It is also important to celebrate those who \nput their lives on the line day after day to keep our homes and \ncommunities safe.\n  A simple thank you does not seem to be enough to show our \nappreciation for these people and for everything they have done. That \nis why I have come to the floor to announce I am introducing \nlegislation to honor and commemorate the selfless sacrifices each of \nthese individuals has made to keep our families and our homes safe.\n  The legislation will direct the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of \nLand Management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense to work together to create a commemorative pin or \nbadge that will be issued to each firefighter at the end of a fire \nseason. This will serve as an emblem of the vital service they have \nprovided and a symbol of our gratitude, much as a soldier might receive \na band to record a tour of duty, because those who fight wildfires \nreally are soldiers who put their lives on the line every day in \ndefense of the people, communities, the lands of America. These \ncourageous men and women need to be recognized as the heroes they are.\n\n  As we properly focus on the work these brave firefighters do for us, \nlet us not forget the work we must do for them, for it is only by \ncreating and funding sensible forest management policy and by guiding \ndevelopment to reduce the risk to homes and property posed by wildfires \nthat we can keep more of our firefighters out of harm's way and prevent \nfuture tragedies like Mann Gulch.\n  As we commemorate our firefighters, let us make sure we rise to the \ntask of putting aside our differences and working together for \ncommonsense policies that will keep our forests healthy and \nfirefighters safe.\n  Again, I say thank you, thank you to all the heroes--firefighters, \nvolunteers, Government employees, ordinary citizens--who pulled \ntogether to protect life and home in Montana and across the West. \nPlease know that we are truly grateful for everything you have done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Montana leaves the \nfloor, I commend him for his fine remarks. Connecticut is a long way \ngeographically from the State of Montana. The Nation was transfixed \nover this past summer watching events unfold in the West and \nparticularly in his State where so many millions of acres were engulfed \nin flames.\n  I express the strong feelings of all of us across the country on the \ntremendous work these firefighters have done and note further that we \njust passed as part of the Defense authorization bill a provision, the \nFire Act, which will, for the first time, provide financial resources \nmuch along the lines of the COPS programs for fire departments, the \n30,000 of them that exist in this country--volunteer, paid, and \ncombination departments--to assist local communities and States in \nproviding the sophisticated technology today which firefighters need, \nparticularly the volunteer departments, where chemical and toxic \nsubstances and the tragedies of this summer demand a talent, education, \nand training unlike people even imaged a few years ago.\n  I commend the Senator from Montana for his fine work and express my \nsincere thanks to him and the fine people of Montana as well for a job \nwell done.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ssssions). The motion to proceed.\n  I believe the Senator has a time request to propound.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10063-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10063-S10065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OPPOSITION TO CUBA PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I express my strong opposition and \ndisappointment with the outcome of last night's Agriculture \nappropriations conference report with respect to U.S.-Cuba policy. It \nis rather ironic that those who rail against Fidel Castro's dictatorial \nbehavior seem to have adopted some of his tendencies; namely, a \nwillingness to abuse the democratic process and go against the will of \nthe majority in the Congress.\n  The proposed changes in the bill with respect to the sale of food to \nCuba are modest at best since these exports can only be financed using \nthird-country private commercial credit or cash. Such restrictive \nfinancing terms are a major hurdle for American exporters to overcome \nand are likely to significantly discourage any significant increases in \nsuch exports.\n  With respect to the codification of existing travel restrictions on \nAmericans wishing to travel to Cuba, I think this action is shameful \nand irresponsible. I predict the authors of this provision will live to \nregret deeply having taken away this and future administrations' \ndiscretion to grant licenses on a case-by-case basis in circumstances \nthat do not fall into the now codified categories of permissible \ntravel.\n  I also believe that Cuban Americans who want to keep in touch with \ntheir family members in Cuba are going to be extremely critical of the \nfact that their ability to visit loved ones is now frozen in statute.\n  I say to the authors of this provision that they are only kidding \nthemselves if they think this is going to stop Cuban Americans who are \ndetermined to visit their family members in Cuba several times a year \nfrom doing so. Sadly, they are going to encourage otherwise law-abiding \nindividuals to break the law. I think that is regrettable.\n  I am supportive of other provisions of this legislation which will \ndramatically loosen the licensing and financing restrictions on sales \nof food and medicine to other countries that have been designated as \nterrorist states--North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya. I strongly \nbelieve food and medicine should not be used as a sanctions tool, since \nthe impact of denying such sales falls most heavily on innocent men, \nwomen, and children in these countries.\n  This is not to confuse our sincere and deep objections and strong \nopposition to the Governments of North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya. \nBut, it is not an American tradition to take food and medicine and make \nthem a sanctions tool on a unilateral basis. We have understood in the \npast that you do not blame the innocent civilians of populations for \nthe cruel regimes of their dictators and rulers. It is not in the \nAmerican spirit to say to an innocent child--in any one of these \ncountries--that if we are able to get food and medicine to you, you \nought to be denied it as a tool of U.S. foreign policy.\n  I find it appalling that Cuba has been singled out, because in this \nbill we now say food and medicine can go to North Korea, Iran, Sudan, \nand Libya, but not to a little country of 11 million people 90 miles \noff our shore. I think that is\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nregrettable. Cuba has been singled out for even more restrictive \ntreatment than countries that are far more of a potential threat to \nUnited States foreign policy and national security interests than Cuba \nhas ever been.\n  I am sure the average American is extremely puzzled by the decision \njust taken by the Agriculture appropriations conferees. I do not blame \nthem for being confused, to put it mildly, and puzzled. Didn't the \nHouse and Senate go on record in support of less restrictive conditions \non the sale of food and medicine to Cuba? Seventy Senators--70--voted \nto lift restrictions on the sale of such items; 301 Members out of the \n435 Members of the House did so as well. And, 232 Members of the House \nalso are on record in favor of lifting all travel restrictions to Cuba.\n  Yet despite these overwhelming votes by both Chambers--majorities, \nbipartisan majorities--the advocates of ``tightening the screws,'' as \nthey like to say, on Castro are always quick to say they hold no ill \nwill against the Cuban people. Yet I somehow suspect that the residents \nof Havana or Santiago, Cuba, will not be applauding our recent actions \nin Washington.\n  But that isn't what last night's conference decision was about, in \nany event. Very little we do in Washington with respect to Cuba has \nanything to do with winning the hearts and minds of the Cuban people. \nRather, it is about attempting to win the hearts and votes of the \nresidents of some sections of the country--hardly a wise and moral way, \nin my view, to make foreign policy decisions.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Leahy and I introduced legislation that \nwould take United States policy in a different direction with respect \nto the island of Cuba. A companion bill was introduced in the House by \nMark Sanford. The bill is entitled the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of \n2000. It would have lifted the archaic, counterproductive, and ill-\nconceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba.\n\n  We offered this legislation because we believe the existing \nrestrictions on travel hinder rather than help our efforts to spread \ndemocracy as well as unnecessarily abridge the rights of ordinary \nAmericans. We were taught in civics class that the United States was \nfounded on the principles of liberty and freedom. Yet when it comes to \nCuba, our Government abridges these rights with no greater rationale \nthan political and rhetorical gain.\n  It is one thing if Castro does not want to let an American citizen \nin. I understand that. He is a dictator. What I do not understand is a \ndemocratic government saying to its own people you can't go somewhere. \nCuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of \nwater might as well be on a different planet. We have made a land ripe \nfor American influence a forbidden territory. In doing so, we have \nenabled the Cuban regime to be a closed system with the Cuban people \nhaving little contact with their closest neighbors on this Earth.\n  I note that in a few weeks the President of the United States is \ngoing to travel to Vietnam, a Communist government. There are 58,000 \nnames on a wall just a few blocks from here of Americans who died in \nthat conflict. Yet we have found it possible to rebuild diplomatic \nrelations, economic relations, and even an America President will \ntravel to a nation that only a few years ago we were in hostile \nconflict with and has a government with a political philosophy of which \ntoday we fundamentally disagree. Yet 90 miles off our shore there is a \ncountry to which you cannot even go to try to make a difference, and \nenlighten people about what democracy means.\n  Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of \nAmericans who might visit the island nation. Today Americans are free \nto travel to Iran, to Sudan, to Burma, to Yugoslavia, and to North \nKorea--but not to Cuba. Is there anyone who would come to this Chamber \nand suggest to me it is less dangerous to be in Sudan or Burma or \nYugoslavia than the island nation that is 90 miles off our shore? I \ndoubt it.\n  You can fly to Iran. They held hostages, we all recall, back in the \n1979-1980 period, yet I can go to Iran today. I can fly there, if I \nwant, without restriction. But I cannot go 90 miles off our shore to \nthe island of Cuba. What an inconsistency.\n  If the Cubans want to stop Americans, as I said, from visiting their \ncountry, then that is their business. I disagree with it, but I would \nnot be surprised that under a dictatorship they might pass such laws or \nprohibit such travel. But to say to an American citizen that you can \ntravel to Iran, where they held American hostages for months on end, to \nNorth Korea, which has declared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, \nbut you cannot travel 90 miles off the shore of this Nation to the \nisland of Cuba is more than just a mistake, in my view.\n  To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be \n``the Great Satan.'' That is what they like to call us. We hear it all \nthe time. Just two decades ago, Iran occupied our Embassy and took \ninnocent American diplomats hostage. To this day, protesters in Tehran \nburn the American flag with the encouragement of some officials in \ntheir Government. Those few Americans who venture into such \ninhospitable surroundings often find themselves pelted by rocks and \naccosted by the public.\n\n  Similarly, we do not ban travel to the Sudan, a nation we attacked \nwith cruise missiles several years ago for its support of terrorism; to \nBurma, a nation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world \ntoday; to North Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American \nservicemen through gun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of \nthe most egregious human rights records and is one of the foremost \nsponsors of terrorism.\n  I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values \nand ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. I \nfail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and \nfrom the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help \nbring about change we all seek serves our own interest.\n  The Cuban people are not currently permitted the freedom to travel \nenjoyed by many peoples around the world. However, because Fidel Castro \ndoes not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is no \njustification for adopting a similar principle in this country--a great \ndemocracy.\n  We need to treasure and respect the fundamental rights we embrace as \nAmericans. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to prohibit \nus from going there, that is their business. But for us to say that \ncitizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they would like to \ngo is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on our own people.\n  Today, every single country in the western hemisphere is a democracy, \nwith one exception: Cuba. American influence, through person-to-person \nand cultural exchanges, was one of the prime factors in this evolution \nfrom a hemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian and military \nregimes to one where democracy is the rule.\n  Our current policy toward Cuba limits these exchanges and prevents \nthe United States from using our most potent weapon, in my view, in our \neffort to combat totalitarianism, and that is our own people--our own \npeople. They are some of the best ambassadors we have ever sent \nanywhere. They are the best ambassadors to have.\n  Most totalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their \ncountries for that very reason. These countries are afraid of the \ngospel of freedom that might motivate their citizens to overthrow \ndictators, as they have done in dozens of nations over the last half \ncentury. Isn't it ironic that when it comes to Cuba, we do the \ndictator's bidding for him in a sense? Cuba does not have to worry \nabout America spreading democracy. Our own Government stops us from \ndoing so.\n  There is no better way, in my view, to communicate America's values, \nour ideals, than by unleashing the average American men and women to \ndemonstrate, by daily living, what our great country stands for, and \nthe contrasts between what we stand for and what exists in Cuba today.\n  I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting \nAmericans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion and an end to the cold war, I do not think any excuse remains \ntoday to ban this kind of travel. This argument that dollars and \ntourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime \nseems to\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nhave survived 38 years despite the draconian U.S. embargo during that \nentire period. The notion that allowing Americans to spend a few \ndollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and comfort to the \nCuban regime is without basis, in my view.\n  Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms \nof American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law \nwhich counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; \nnamely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--\naverage Americans--to travel freely to Cuba not make it even more \ndifficult to do so.\n  Mr. President, a small number of individuals in the Congress may have \ntemporarily succeeded in hijacking the democratic process with respect \nto this issue and in thwarting the will of the majority with respect to \nloosening U.S. restrictions on travel and sales of food and medicine to \nCuba. But let me assure you that this issue is not settled. Those of us \nwho want to see meaningful change in our Cuba policy will be back next \nyear raising this matter on the floors of the House and Senate. And I \npredict that when the democratic process is allowed to work, the \nresults of last night's conference will be decisively reversed and U.S. \npolicy toward Cuba will be finally put on the right track and the \nprospects of a peaceful democratic transition in that country greatly \nenhanced, and the 11 million Cubans will know that the American people \ncare about them despite their strong objections to the Government which \nruns that country today.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Mr. Domenici, \nand then Mr. McCain, have orders for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 20, the Senate lost \none of its own family members. Not a member with a capital ``M,'' \nelected by the people, but an unpaid, unsung, but O so important member \nof the Senate family. On Wednesday, Maureen Mansfield, the beloved wife \nof former majority leader Mike Mansfield, passed away.\n  It is safe to say that without the efforts, energy, dedication, and \nlove of Maureen Mansfield, the Senate and the people of Montana might \nnever have benefited from the extraordinary talents of Mike Mansfield. \nLike myself, Mike was raised by an aunt and uncle after the death of \nhis mother when he was just 3 years old. During the First World War, \nMike Mansfield dropped out of school and joined the Navy, and he also \nserved with the Army and the Marine Corps.\n  Upon his return to Montana, he worked as a mucker in the copper mines \nand did not resume the schooling he had left in the eighth grade.\n  Maureen, a high school teacher when her younger sister introduced her \nto Mike, encouraged him to return to school. She helped him to apply to \nMontana State University and helped him complete his high school \nequivalency courses before completing college. She cashed in her life \ninsurance and worked as a social worker in order to support her husband \nin school. Then both of them went on to earn Master's degrees. Maureen \nMansfield did not believe, and disproved, the old saw that you cannot \nchange a man and that all efforts to do so are futile.\n  Mike Mansfield's congressional career also benefitted from Maureen \nMansfield's support. Maureen would campaign for Mike in Montana, \nsometimes on her own when Mike could not get away from Washington. Mike \nMansfield served five terms in the House before his first election to \nthe Senate. In the Senate, Lyndon Johnson picked Mike for party whip.\n  In those days, it was different from what it is now because a leader \nwould not pick another Member for the office of party whip. That is a \nmatter that the Members will resolve.\n  Mike went on to serve as Majority Leader himself for sixteen years, \nlonger than any other Senator. I served as his party whip. I continued \nto hold Mike Mansfield in the highest respect. Mike and Maureen have \nalways been good friends to me and Erma, and we will both miss their \ncompanionship and the very deep affection and esteem with which they \ntreated each other, and which sustained them through 68 years of \nmarriage.\n  Erma and I have 5 more years to go before we can say we have been \nmarried 68 years. But Mike and Maureen set an example as an exemplary \ncreative family in that regard.\n  Mike Mansfield never lost his appreciation for his wife's support. He \nalways readily gave Maureen the credit that he felt she was due and \nwhich I, having enjoyed the same kind of love and support from my wife, \nreadily endorse. These talented, organized, gracious women, such as \nMaureen Mansfield and Erma Byrd, could have commanded armies. They \ncould have run universities or won Senate seats in their own right. But \nthey chose instead to hitch their stars to the wagons of their \nhusbands. And Mike Mansfield and I are definitely the better for it. I \nbelieve, too, that the nation is better off as result as well.\n  The demands of the Senate, particularly the demands placed upon \nMajority Leaders, are stressful, time-consuming, and exhausting. It is \neven more than a two-person job. I could concentrate on Senate matters \nknowing that Erma was there at home to support me and to give the love, \naffection, and attention to our two daughters that they so much \ndeserved. I am here to say that one old adage is certainly true, and we \nhave all heard it many times. That is, behind any great man is an even \ngreater woman. To the extent that I ever wanted to be great, I have \nbeen denied that. But I can say that I have Erma to thank for whatever \nI have been able to accomplish. I know Mike Mansfield would say the \nsame about Maureen.\n\n  Now that Maureen has found new life in the shelter of God's hand, I \nhope that Mike, his daughter Anne, and his granddaughter might \nsympathize with the words of ``The Beyond,'' penned by Ella Wheeler \nWilcox (1855-1919):\n\n     It seemeth such a little way to me,\n     Across to that strange country, the Beyond;\n     And yet, not strange, for it has grown to be\n     The home of those of whom I am so fond;\n     They make it seem familiar and most dear,\n     As journeying friends bring distant countries near.\n\n     And so for me there is no sting to death,\n     And so the grave has lost its victory;\n     It is but crossing with bated breath\n     And white, set face, a little strip of sea,\n     To find the loved ones waiting on the shore,\n     More beautiful, more precious than before.\n\n  We miss her here, but she surely waits for Mike.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to congratulate Senator \nByrd on his comments with regard to the very distinguished Mike \nMansfield, and what happened to him recently with the passing of his \nbeautiful and wonderful wife. I, too, in reading about him--I didn't \nexperience as much of him as the Senator from West Virginia did--but he \ndid things in a rather sensational and unique way.\n  Even though I didn't know him as long as the Senator from West \nVirginia, and didn't feel his presence as much, he is a very wonderful \nAmerican.\n  Can you imagine in his early life what he did, how he became educated \nand found himself majority leader of the Senate? He did that for a long \ntime, and is still the recordholder.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is. He was majority leader longer than any other \nSenator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, from what I understand, he did it with a very \ncool hand. Maybe it was different in those days. It was less \nconfrontational than today, as I understand it--with no criticism and \nno inferences; just that it was different when he was leading.\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We were in very different times, and we were dealing with \ndifferent personalities. He was a remarkable man, however.\n  I thank the very distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico for his \nwords.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10066-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10066-S10067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE GORE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, and maybe two previous \noccasions on the Senate floor, I discussed the Gore budget and what is \ngoing to happen to the huge amount of money that we are getting from \nthe taxpayers, which we have begun to call a ``surplus.'' I choose now \nto call it the ``tax overpayment.'' It is what the people are paying in \nthat we don't need.\n  I would like to, once again, make sure the Republican candidate for \nPresident, George W. Bush, and the candidate for Vice President--who \nlast night did such a marvelous job--the distinguished former Secretary \nof Defense, Dick Cheney--I urge them to continue to tell the American \npeople what the Gore budget will look like.\n  When it is mentioned, everybody says this came from the Budget \nCommittee staff and the Republicans, and, therefore, you shouldn't use \nit; that it is partisan; that it is like paper that is not even worth \nusing.\n  I say to our two candidates, keep using it. Keep saying it is true \nbecause they are about as good as any people we have ever had to look \nat budgets. I am chairman of that committee, and, frankly, I have \nrelied on their expertise year after year. I don't think I have to \nexaggerate and say they are the best. They are the best at getting to \nthe bottom of programs and analyzing them. I asked them to do it. They \ndid it. They gave us a major report on the subject, and I will say to \nour candidate--to the Governor of Texas, to the former Secretary of \nDefense, Dick Cheney--no matter what they say about it, you use it.\n  The Gore budget has 200 new programs in it. If you estimate \nappropriately their cost based upon what is said about the program, you \ncannot pay for those programs without using all of the on-budget \nsurplus and $700 to $900 billion of the Social Security surplus.\n  Now, that is our version. We think it is true. And we don't believe \nthe American people actually think when you finally have a surplus--\nbecause we are paying so much more in taxes than we need--we don't \nthink the American people want the Government to grow at the largest \nrate in modern history. Probably if you put the Gore expenditure budget \ninto effect, you will increase Government in 1 to 2 years, more than \nany modern year, excepting maybe the Lyndon Johnson Great Society \nyears.\n  Now, it doesn't matter to me as the chairman of the Budget Committee \nwhat Vice President Gore says about these figures, nor what our \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Vice Presidential nominee who I \nhave great, great respect for, it doesn't matter what they keep saying. \nThe truth is, we have an analysis of that budget. Early next week we \nwill have a full analysis. They finally put their budget on to sheets \nof paper. It is a very large budget. We will finally have that \nanalyzed. I am told it will come out no different. It will come out the \nsame way, 200-plus new programs, the largest new expenditure in the \nnext 5 years that we have ever had in the Government. If you take them \nat their word and do all of them, you cannot do it without spending \npart of the Social Security surplus. No matter what they say about its \nsource, it is as good as anything they have.\n  I have great respect for the Vice Presidential nominee. He knows \nthat. Last night he said something that wasn't true, and I ask him to \nrevisit this. He said their budget, the budget they have, analyzed for \nthe future, was done by a neutral body called the Congressional Budget \nOffice. That is to make sure that everybody would think it is authentic \nand that the Domenici budget analysis is not authentic. I assure \neveryone, the Congressional Budget Office does not do an analysis of \neither candidate's budget. In fact, that is not within their \nprerogative. They have not analyzed the Gore budget. They have not \nanalyzed the budget of the Governor of Texas, either. And they won't.\n  The Democrats have somebody analyzing theirs, watching out for them, \nwho is on their team, and they want everybody to think ours, and the \nmajority staff has worked on this for years, they want everyone to \nbelieve it has no credibility. I think to the contrary.\n  My friend Dick Cheney will be in my State in a few days. I hope he \ntalks about this subject. Let them bring up the fact that Democrats \ndon't think it is worth very much. We will make sure the public \nunderstands we have as good an analysis as anyone. If the Democratic \nnominee for President does every program he contemplates--there are \nsome that are superexpensive. There are some universal programs in \nthere that will never get adopted by Congress, but we might as well \nmake sure the public understands they are expected, they are \ncontemplated, they are out there to tell the people, elect us and we \nwill do all these things.\n  That is part of my reason for coming to the floor, so anyone who \nwonders whether that is authentic, I can assure Members, I will not \ngive ground on this through the election and after the election. I \nbelieve it is right. I think our candidates ought to use it.\n  Now I will talk about the so-called Al Gore tax cut plan and the \nGeorge W. Bush plan. I don't know if I have enough time today to go \nthrough the George W. Bush plan, which is very simple. I am not sure I \ncan do that because today I want to talk a little bit about a rather \nunique way to cut taxes, or allege you are cutting taxes, for middle-\nincome America when you are not.\n  If there is a middle-income American who happens to be listening, and \nthey say, oh, boy, Vice President Gore has spoken so much about giving \nthe middle class a tax cut, I will get a tax cut--my friends, you are \nnot necessarily going to get the tax cut. The Gore plan says the \nInternal Revenue Service will decide whether you get a tax cut. And you \nare going to apply for it when you file your tax return, and if you are \na family, you have to go through up to 25 different tests with the \nInternal Revenue Service to determine what you are entitled to. In \nfact, if the people think the Internal Revenue Code is complicated, and \nIRS is not doing a good job, then remember that every single so-called \ntax cut that Vice President Gore is telling you about is going to be \nadministered by the Internal Revenue Service, which is going to pass \njudgment on whether you are entitled to one of the scores of tax \ncredits or other tax benefits. Let me go further, the IRS will \ndetermine what tax refunds or government check you are entitled to, \nbecause under Vice President Gore's plan not only taxpayers get tax \nbreaks, people who pay no taxes get government checks.\n\n  People will fill out their federal tax return. They will find a check \nin the mail from the Internal Revenue Service, even though they pay no \ntaxes.\n  That is part of his tax plan. The part for middle Americans, middle-\nincome Americans, you cannot just file your tax return and say, I am a \nmiddle-income American earning $65,000, and I want my 5-percent tax \ncut, or 7 or 10, you have to ask yourself if you qualify for a tax \ncredit or a refundable tax credit under this plan. There are all kinds \nof reasons you might get some tax relief, but they are all going to \nadministered by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Isn't that nice? So if you apply, and the IRS agrees, you get to use \nyour tax money. If you apply and if you fit, you get to use your \ntaxpayer dollars for a certain specified purpose.\n  The most significant difference in the two men's tax proposals is \nthat George W. Bush gives you a tax refund and you can spend it for \nwhatever you want. The Vice President, the nominee from the Democratic \nParty, gives you no tax cut to spend as you may. Since it is your \nmoney, you have to qualify as if you were under a Federal program.\n  Gore wants to imbed social policy of the country into the tax code. \nWe are substituting the Internal Revenue Service as the one that gets \nto see whether or not you are going to be able to have these particular \nservices paid for by the Federal Government. I cannot believe when the \nAmerican people understand this that they are going to say they want \nthat tax approach.\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n  Let me repeat, in order to get all of the so-called Gore middle-class \ntax cut, a family has to meet 25 different tests, at least one for each \nof the 25 proposed pieces of the Gore Middle Class tax cut. That means \nif you don't meet the tests, you don't get any relief, any help. \nWouldn't it be better to have a 5-percent or a 10-percent tax cut, and \nyou use the money as you see fit, if you are $67,000, a $72,000 family \nor $35,000 or $40,000? You have to understand or try to understand and \nthen comply with 25 sets of rules before you see $1 of so-called tax \nrelief.\n  I thought tax policy was supposed to be neutral. The best tax policy \ndoes not try to engineer social behavior. I didn't think it was \nsupposed to be the vehicle by which you ran scores of social programs \nand you told Americans if you want that program, you can pay for it and \nwe will give you the money; but if you don't want that program, you \ndon't get any tax relief.\n  Gore proposes to substitute the Internal Revenue Service for a score \nof Government programs. Instead of saying let's create a new federal \nprogram in this area with Government, Al Gore says file a tax return, \nand if you fit the cookie cutter profile, you can help your great \ngrandmother who is sick--you get some of your tax overpayment back to \nhelp pay some of those expenses. The Government will help you. It will \nnot help you with a program, it will help you so that you will get a \npiece of the taxes you pay refunded--or deducted.\n\n  This is not a step toward tax simplification. It will make the Tax \nCode more complicated. If it is too complicated today, it will become \neven more complicated. I think it would not take 3 or 4 years before \nthe American people will force us to throw it out. But I do not think \nit will ever become law.\n  Some of the tax cuts are not even for taxpayers, much less for \nmiddle-class Americans. Because of the income limits, many people who \nthink they are middle class are left totally out because they earn too \nmuch money to pigeonholed into Al Gore's ``middle class,'' or to be \nentitled to one of the myriad tax credits the Vice President suggests \nis good tax policy.\n  A refundable tax credit is Tax Code talk for Government checks to \npeople who do not pay Federal income taxes. It sounds more like a way \nto have some welfare spending and use the income tax code to administer \nit. There is only one refundable credit in the code now, and many \nbelieve it is one too many. But I do not believe almost all of the \nentire surplus that is going to go to taxpayers ought to be done in \nthis way, with refundable tax credits going to people who pay no \nfederal income tax so long as the person does what the Vice President \nthinks you ought to do with your money. Refundable child care credits, \nrefundable day care, refundable after school care--all specific and all \nalready covered in the Earned Income tax credit. You don't have to be a \ntaxpayer to get a so-called middle-income tax cut for child care, \nfamily leave, or stay-at-home parents or kids in afterschool care, or \nexpanding the earned-income tax credit. More spending programs dressed \nup as tax cuts will be there for those who do not pay any taxes.\n  In addition to refundable credits, the Vice President proposes \ninitiates that this Administration has vetoed. For instance, tuition \nsavings accounts are listed now as one of those things in the long list \nof things that you might put your money away for and get some tax \nrelief. Al Gore says he would like to enact them. Interesting; this \nadministration vetoed that bill for them more than once.\n  The Vice President says he is for marriage penalty relief yet the \nAdministration vetoed the bill providing it. The Vice President's \nproposal is curious. Let me say there is no marriage penalty relief if \nyou own your own home and pay a mortgage. Isn't that interesting? This \nadministration boasts record numbers of American homeowners. Yet, they \nwill not give a dollar of marriage tax penalty relief to people who own \nhomes and pay mortgages, again, using the Tax Code for social \napproaches in the United States. Perhaps the reason for this one is \nthere are too many people who are building too many homes, and maybe we \nought to slow it down.\n  There is a tax credit for individual health insurance. Yet you get \npart of the middle-income tax cut if you need additional training, or \ncertification programs. That is a separate notion in their Tax Code.\n  So, today, I would like to start a series of discussions which I will \nbring to the floor regularly. The next one will be: What is the George \nBush tax plan. The next time I come, I will include in the Record the \nentirety of Vice President Gore's so-called middle-income tax relief. I \nwill bring the entire list. You might say: Why are you bringing a list? \nIsn't a middle-income tax cut just a percentage, just a cut?\n  No; it is myriad programs. If you do not qualify as having done one \nof those, or choose to do one of them, you do not get tax credits nor \nrefundable tax credits. That is a very new way to run America.\n\n  We are going to expand those beyond recognition. The most significant \none we have now is the earned-income tax credit. It is refundable. A \nlot of people who pay no federal income tax get a check from the \nfederal government under the Earned Income Tax Credit program. It is an \nencouragement for low-income workers to work--although we have changed \nthat, where you do not have to work. But, just think, we have a few of \nthem. The entire middle-income tax proposal of the Vice President is \ngoing to be specific things that specific Americans qualify for or they \ndo not get any tax relief.\n  Essentially, I am going to close saying the most significant aspect \nof the Bush tax cut is that the 15-percent bracket is cut to 10. This \nis a tax cut for taxpayers. That encompasses almost the entirety of the \ntax cuts--15 percent at the bottom goes to 10. But, you see, everybody \nat every bracket pays taxes on some of their income at the lowest \nrate--15-percent bracket. So cutting the lowest rate helps all \ntaxpayers. It is very simple. You get it because of the tax bracket and \nwhatever other things are in the current Tax Code.\n  I repeat, there is much talk about the top 1 percent. The top 1 \npercent pays 33 percent of the taxes in America. When the Bush plan is \ncompleted they will pay 34 percent of the total tax take of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to use 4 or 5 of those \nminutes in case someone who might object to the unanimous consent \nagreement would have time to come to the floor. I would like to say, \nwithin about 5 minutes I am going to try to get the unanimous consent \nagreement again.\n  Mr. President, this is from October 9, 2000, a copy of Newsweek \nmagazine:\n\n       At first, the death of 14-year-old cheerleader Jessica \n     LeAnn Taylor seemed simply to be a tragic tire failure. While \n     heading for a football game in Mexia, Texas, on a hot October \n     afternoon in 1998, the Ford Explorer in which Taylor was \n     riding flipped after its left rear Firestone tire shredded at \n     70 miles an hour. Jessica's grieving parents sued \n     Bridgestone/Firestone in March 1999. But over the last two \n     months, as congressional investigators probed the recall of \n     6.5 million Firestone tires, the Taylors became convinced \n     that Ford Motor Co. shares the blame for their daughter's \n     death. So late last month the Taylors sued Ford, too, and \n     when the case goes to trial next spring, the Taylors' lawyer \n     Randy Roberts says he will tell the jury: ``A piece of tire \n     tread never killed anybody. People die when the vehicle rolls \n     over. And the responsibility for the design and occupant \n     protection of that vehicle belongs to Ford.''\n       Since the safety crisis began, Ford executives have argued \n     the recall was strictly a ``tire issue.'' But as the death \n     toll mounts to 101 lives, [it has exceeded that since then] \n     questions about the stability of the Explorer are shifting \n     the focus onto Ford. The carmaker is facing 80 lawsuits \n     involving Explorers equipped with Firestones that shred at \n     high speeds. Meanwhile, Firestone is consistently trying to \n     blame Ford. ``We could remove every one of our tires from the \n     Explorer, and rollovers and serious accidents will \n     continue,'' Firestone executive John Lampe told a \n     congressional panel.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there have been well over 100 deaths. Last \nweekend, a 10-year-old boy was killed when the driver of a Firestone-\nequipped Explorer had an accident near Laredo, TX. Authorities said at \nleast one of the tires was shredded.\n  I am not going to repeat every human tragedy that takes place here.\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nBut we passed a bill out of the Commerce Committee on a 20-0 vote. The \nmajority leader is a member of that committee. He supported it. All \nRepublican members had an opportunity to amend it, as well as those on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  I would like to repeat; I have a letter from the Secretary of \nTransportation. In the last paragraph, he says:\n\n       Most important, however, is expeditious action on \n     comprehensive legislation that will strengthen NHTSA's \n     ability to address life-threatening motor vehicle safety \n     defects. I will work with you in any way I can to help shape \n     legislation the Congress can approve and the President can \n     sign into law.\n       Sincerely, Rodney Slater.\n\n  Mr. President, the Members of the House of Representatives are here \nto meet with me. They just passed a bill through the House, 42-0, from \ntheir committee.\n  They are prepared to take it to the floor of the House on Tuesday, is \nmy understanding from Chairman Tauzin and Congressman Upton. \nCongressman Upton, by the way, as we all know, is from a State where \nthe vehicles under question are manufactured and one of the reasons he \nhas taken a lead role here.\n  I hope we can get this agreement. I emphasize again my commitment to \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alabama, to work with him on \nserious concerns that he has about this issue. I assure the Senator \nfrom Alabama, again, my respect for him, his experience as former \nattorney general of his State, and I believe his views and his input \nwill be very important.\n  Also, in this unanimous consent request, there is no time limit and \nonly relevant amendments are in order. It would be fairly easy, the way \nthe Senate works, in the remaining days--because my understanding is \nnow we will not be back until next Wednesday--it would be fairly easy \nto block this legislation, although I certainly hope that will not be \nthe case.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his consideration of this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it now be in order for \nthe majority leader and the Democratic leader to determine the specific \ntime and date for the consideration of S. 3059 and that only relevant \namendments to the bill be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and I \nshall not object, but I would like to engage in a discussion with the \nSenator from Arizona. I have some substantive concerns about this bill \nand I and my staff need some time to review the bill. I have concerns \nthat if we are going to impose criminal penalties in this area, that \nstandard for triggering these penalties is a clear bright line. I am \nalso concerned that the reporting requirements as outlined presently \nare over broad and unworkable. I am very concerned about safety and \nwant to ensure that we enact solid workable legislation to protect \npeople. I am not trying to stop this bill, just ensure that it is \nsolid, clean, well thought through legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from Ohio and I \nrespect his right to object. I intend to work with the Senator to \nresolve his concerns either before we move the bill or through the \namendment process. As I have said from the beginning, all I am seeking \nis an opportunity for the Senate to address this matter before we \nadjourn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nsay to my friend from Arizona, I have been asked by a number of \nSenators who cannot be here at this hour to object in their behalf. So \nI do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was told by the majority leader that if \nSenators had objections, they would come to the floor themselves. That \nwas the word I had from the majority leader, that those who had \nobjections would come themselves. I have his word on that, so I took \nhis word.\n  I think the Senator from New Mexico should know that was the word I \nwas given by the majority leader of the Senate; That they would have to \ncome down and object to this unanimous consent request themselves. So I \nhope the Senator from New Mexico will withdraw his objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say again to my distinguished friend \nfrom Arizona, I have no such understanding and representatives on the \nfloor of the majority leader's office have asked me to do this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Will the Senator from New Mexico, for the Record, say which Member or \nMembers are objecting to this legislation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not believe I have to and I will not do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I did not imply the Senator had to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that. I have been asked to do this. You \nhave asked a number of times, and the objection has been raised just as \nI am raising it. I regret I have to do it. I am not here suggesting you \nhave not taken due diligence in producing this bill. I am saying in the \nwaning moments of this session, this is what I have been asked to do, \nand I must object.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is of interest that the Members on the \nother side of the aisle have no objection to moving forward with this \nlegislation, this unanimous consent request. Therefore, I intend to \ncontinue to propound the unanimous consent request as long as it seems \nthere might be some way to do so.\n  I say to the Senator from New Mexico--and I say this more in sorrow \nthan anger--by objecting, you do take responsibility in not allowing \nthis legislation to go forward, and I regret that deeply.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator does that, I ask for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona withhold?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you for your comments. I do not agree with you \nwith reference to my responsibility, but I think we know each other \nwell enough. I know what I had to do, and I know where my \nresponsibility lies, but I thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank you for your response. The fact is, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico lodged the objection.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator withhold his \nsuggestion and allow me to complete some remarks?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BYRD.

ROBERT KERREY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in this season of fall, the view from our \nwindow on the world transforms. As the stoic Greek philosopher \nHeraclitus has been quoted as saying, ``Nothing endures but change.''\n  Since I became a Senator in 1959, I have observed that every 2 years \nthe picture of the United States Senate also changes. This year will be \nno exception. Before we adjourn, we will wish a fond farewell to the \nmen who have chosen to leave the hallowed halls of the Capitol to \ntravel down new roads that will bring different vistas into view.\n  Five of our fellow Senators know, even before the election results \nare tallied in November, that come January 2001--the beginning of the \n21st century and the beginning of the third millennium--they will be \nstarting out on a new journey. One of these five has announced that he \nwill take a position that will allow him to continue his advocacy for a \nfine and noble pursuit, the pursuit of education. In January, Senator \nBob Kerrey, the Senior Senator from Nebraska, but the youngest Senator \nwho has announced his retirement from the Senate this session, will \nbegin a new life, far from his native Omaha, as president of the New \nSchool University of New York City. There he certainly will have a \ndifferent view from his window on the world, a much different view than \nthe one we see from Capitol Hill.\n  While many of us were surprised by Senator Kerrey's decision not to \nseek reelection at the youthful age of 57\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\nyears, setting off on new adventures is nothing new to Senator Kerrey, \nwho has already followed many different paths during his lifetime. \nWhile serving in the Senate, Bob Kerrey has never feared to take the \npath less trodden, to follow his convictions and his principles no \nmatter how rocky or lonely the road. His independence of thought and \naction is legendary.\n  After earning a Master of Science degree in pharmacy in 1966 from the \nUniversity of Nebraska, he volunteered for military service in Vietnam. \nNot only did he volunteer to bear arms for our Nation, he distinguished \nhimself during service. He earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, and as \na U.S. Navy SEAL. In doing so, Bob Kerrey displayed such courage, \ndedication, and heroism that he was awarded the Medal of Honor by \nPresident Nixon.\n  In March 1999, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the events \ngiving rise to his receiving the Medal of Honor, I joined with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to salute him for his courage, his \ndetermination, and his heroism. His heroic story is inspiring.\n  After Senator Kerrey's return from service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, he \nstarted a chain of restaurants and health clubs in his home State of \nNebraska. Then, in 1982, he ran for Governor of Nebraska and won. He \nserved as Governor of Nebraska until 1986, when he announced, to the \nsurprise of many, that despite a 70-percent approval rating, he would \nnot seek another term as Governor. He was prepared to take a turn down \na different road, and 2 years later, he won a seat in the United States \nSenate.\n  When his face was added to the Senate picture in 1989, he became a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. It was my pleasure to \nwelcome him, as I was chairman of that committee at that time. I \nappreciated the clear vision and the unflappable demeanor that Senator \nKerrey brought to the committee. In 1997, he chose to leave the \nAppropriations Committee for the Senate Committee on Finance. The \ncountenance of that important committee will drastically change when we \nreturn, God willing, in January, after Senators Moynihan, Bryan, \nKerrey, and Mack depart from the Senate, of their own volition and on \ntheir own choice.\n  I commend Senator Kerrey for his willingness to work hard on issues \nof interest to him and to his constituents.\n  During his 57 years of life, he has thus far been a scholar, a U.S. \nNavy SEAL, a Medal of Honor recipient, a scholar, a restauranteur, a \nfitness club founder, Governor of Nebraska, and a United States \nSenator. He has made his life unique. I wish the Senator from Nebraska \nwell as he sets off down the path for his next adventure. Knowing \nSenator Kerrey's propensity for taking his own road, I shall close with \nthe following lines of verse written by Robert Frost. We are all \nfamiliar with that great poem, ``The Road Not Taken.''\n\n                           The Road Not Taken\n\n     Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n     And sorry I could not travel both\n     And be one traveler, long I stood\n     And looked down one as far as I could\n     To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n     Then took the other, as just as fair,\n     And having perhaps the better claim,\n     Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\n     Though as for that the passing there\n     Had worn them really about the same,\n     And both that morning equally lay\n     In leaves no step had trodden black.\n     Oh, I kept the first for another day!\n     Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\n     I doubted if I should ever come back.\n     I shall be telling this with a sigh\n     Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n     Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--\n     I took the one less traveled by,\n     And that has made all the difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10069-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10069-S10071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PLANNING FOR OUR ENERGY FUTURE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again a critical region of the Middle \nEast is engaged in violent clashes. Over the last week, the death toll \nin the Gaza Strip and the West Bank has risen to 67 lives lost. I know \nthat Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Leader Yasser Arafat made heroic \nefforts to try to reach a peace agreement these last few months. They \neven met for part of the time in my own State of West Virginia. With \nU.S. support and encouragement, the Israelis and Palestinians stood at \nthe brink of a resolution, and they were as close as they have ever \nbeen to resolving a very longstanding dispute in that ancient, \nvolatile, and embattled part of our world. Though I hope these two \npeoples will return to the negotiating table, today that opportunity \nappears lost.\n  This disheartening incident again illustrates that the Middle East \npeace is very fragile and could erupt like flash powder. While Saddam \nHussein has been quelled for the time being, the world must always be \non the watch. We do not know if the Israelis and Palestinians will \nreach a peace accord. Americans are affected in many ways. We have \nsecurity and family interests in this region of the world, and the \nUnited States gets much of its energy resources from there as well. The \nU.S., our European allies, and many other industrial countries are \ntethered to the Middle Eastern oil chain. If we are ever going to break \nthat stranglehold, then it is time that we take action here at home.\n  Over the past 18 months, the national average price of gasoline has \nrisen from under $1 per gallon to $1.52 per gallon this week. As winter \napproaches and crude oil inventories remain at record low levels, both \ngasoline and fuel prices are expected to increase further. Americans \nare growing increasingly concerned about the seemingly endless \nvolatility in our energy markets.\n  What we are seeing, Mr. President, in the fluctuation of energy \nprices is a textbook study of how supply and demand can affect energy \nprices. First, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed \nlast year to reduce crude oil production, thus increasing the cost of \nproducing gasoline. Secondly, gasoline refineries, which had shut down \nsome operations when crude oil prices fell to record lows in 1998, \nsuddenly faced shortages of production capacity to produce gasoline and \nheating oil when demand spiked earlier this year.\n  In response, the administration has successfully lobbied for an \nincrease by OPEC in crude oil production over the past year. In March, \nOPEC's decision to increase crude oil production temporarily reduced \nthe cost of gasoline, but prices increased again going into the summer \ndriving season as demand for gasoline increased. Gasoline prices \ndecreased in late summer, but, as winter approaches and the expected \ndemand for crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline increases, prices could \nvery likely climb again. These are the ups and downs of the energy \nroller coaster that has taken the American public for a ride.\n  To make matters worse, this volatility in gasoline prices is \noccurring as the United States prepares itself for the upcoming \nPresidential election. This has added fuel to the fire as Members of \nCongress, the administration, and politicians everywhere position \nthemselves politically to avoid blame for the spike in energy prices. \nUnfortunately, such positioning is usually accompanied by a myriad of \nsnake-oil remedies and miracle cures that do little more than lull the \nAmerican public into believing that the problem is being fixed when, in \nfact, the problem is being exacerbated.\n  Two weeks ago, the administration announced such a proposal, against \nthe better judgment of the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, that would authorize the sale of 30 million \nbarrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next \nmonth. This is the same petroleum reserve that was created in response \nto the 1973 Arab oil embargo to store oil in case of a national \nemergency, such as a war in the Middle East. Like the Army, you hope \nnever to use the reserve. But, if you need to, it should be big enough \nto do the job.\n  Yet, the release of oil from this reserve is unlikely to have a \nsignificant effect on prices at the pump. The United States consumes \napproximately 19 million to 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. \nThe administration's proposal would provide for an additional one \nmillion barrels per day. Such a small amount of oil is unlikely to have \nmuch of an effect on gasoline prices, especially in light of the \nadditional 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil that will be produced \nby OPEC.\n  But what is worse is that this sort of intervention in the domestic \nenergy market, which may seem simple, could actually be self defeating. \nIf refiners expect more oil to be released from the reserve, these \nshrewd businessmen may\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\nhold off on buying more crude oil to produce gasoline and heating oil \nuntil the price of crude oil decreases, which would make it more \nprofitable to them, not to mention the oil companies that have posted \nstrong profits this year. Similarly, OPEC could easily offset any \nbenefits from the release of crude oil from the reserve by reducing its \nown production by an equal amount.\n  So, I am not sure that Americans should breathe a collective sigh of \nrelief at this announcement regarding releases from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It might be good public relations but not a good \nfaith effort to reduce prices. A similar ``fix all, miracle cure'' was \noffered this spring in response to high oil prices. Some Members of \nCongress proposed reducing the federal excise tax on gasoline in order \nto reduce prices at the pump. In their rush to score political points, \nthe proposal was brought to the Senate floor for a vote twice in \nApril--once as an amendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution \nand again as a freestanding bill. Both times, a sensible majority in \nthe Senate voted not to repeal the gasoline tax by substantial \nmajorities. I am proud that so many of my colleagues refused to swallow \nthis patent nostrum, realizing that first, the savings from the excise \ntax repeal would not filter down to the consumer, and, second, that a \nreduction in the excise tax would have a significantly negative effect \non the highway trust fund. Presumably, the sponsors of this dangerous \nproposition were going to provide tax relief to these oil and gas \ncompanies and delay highway projects just to make a political point. It \nis time to get beyond this campaign hysteria and last-minute \ngimmickery. These current concerns are really just symptoms of a larger \nproblem.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also be remiss if I did not raise disturbing \nevidence that oil companies are sending our own oil overseas. On \naverage, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil per day have been exported to \nthe Asian Pacific Region from Alaska's Northern Slope after an export \nban was lifted in 1995. This output equaled about 27 million barrels in \n1999. Why are we exporting oil from Alaska to countries like South \nKorea, Japan, Taiwan, and China when we face shortages at home? Are the \nsame voices advocating for increased production in Alaska also \nsupporting the export of oil overseas while simultaneously criticizing \nthe recent release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? These voices \nare singing the siren song for increased oil company profits, not the \nhallelujah chorus of relief for the average American.\n  So here we are today caught in a black hole that will do little to \nmove us down the road toward developing a sustainable energy policy. \nJust last week, a motion was made to proceed to S. 2557. I believe that \nwe should be deliberating proposals on energy security. I also believe \nthat we should not forget that there are other measures out there that \nshould be given equal attention. While this bill may have some valid \nenergy policy provisions, so do many other proposals. I note for the \nrecord, that Senator Daschle began an effort over two years ago to \nconstruct an energy security package. This effort, which I have \ncosponsored, addresses a number of important energy resources and \nindustries. If Senators wish to support greater energy independence and \nencourage cleaner, more efficient technologies, then I urge them to \nalso look at S. 2904, the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000.\n  We need to be talking about very complicated and critical energy \nmatters, asking what role and responsibility we all must play. What is \nOPEC doing? What are the oil and gas companies doing? What is the \nadministration doing? What is Congress doing? What are we doing \nindividually?\n  My call for a comprehensive national energy policy is longstanding. \nOn May 14, 1984, I took to the Floor with a warning that America should \nnot be so dependent on Persian Gulf oil. At that time, the Reagan \nAdministration was trying to eliminate the Department of Energy and its \nmany energy programs. I argued that this was a wrongheaded approach and \nthat short-term budget concerns should not dominate longer-term \nnational security interests. At that time, I said: ``Our energy \nsecurity rests upon our military might, not upon our natural resources, \nnor our technological genius.''\n  In another floor statement from August 6, 1987, I noted how the \nReagan administration was continuing to undercut funding for the \nfossil, renewable, and synthetic fuels programs. That administration \nhad slashed spending for energy conservation programs and vetoed \nlegislation to provide for emergency preparedness and national \nappliance efficiency standards. Additionally, the Reagan administration \nwas even balking at filling--not using--but filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. In reviewing that August 1987 speech, I warned:\n\n       Why must the energy security of the United States be \n     protected first with guns and not with brains or our \n     homegrown natural resources? . . . The Reagan \n     Administration's destruction of the Nation's long-term energy \n     policies--policies that have been developed and promoted by \n     every Administration since President Nixon--is imperiling \n     America's energy security.\n\n  What can Congress do to find some common ground? Energy security and \nenergy independence are a critical national, in fact, a critical \ninternational issue. Congress should find beneficial proposals and move \nforward on passing legislation in the 107th Congress that will get the \njob done. We should be looking at a variety of opportunities.\n  Let me offer one example from the recent past. Several weeks ago, \nwhile the Senate was debating the bill to grant China permanent normal \ntrade relations, I offered an amendment to increase the use of \nAmerican-made clean energy technologies in China. No Senator argued \nagainst this amendment on its merits. I believe that if a proposal like \nthis were offered on another bill, then it could very likely have \npassed by an overwhelming margin and would be a win-win-win opportunity \nfor business, labor, and the environment. I say to my colleagues, \nknowing that a multi-trillion dollar clean energy and environmental \ninfrastructure market will be exploding in the coming decades, we \nshould be taking every opportunity to promote market-based initiatives \nto deploy these American-made clean energy technologies at home and \nexport these same technologies to developing countries as soon as \npossible.\n  Still, I realize that an effective energy strategy will require much \ndebate and a good bit of negotiation. This is not something that can be \nresolved by depending on any one approach, technology, or resource. \nThere are many serious questions that must be examined when considering \nour energy choices. We must consider the pros and cons of each of our \nenergy resources and ask the following questions. With regard to oil \nand natural gas, how can the U.S. decrease its dependence on foreign \nproducers by increasing domestic production while also ensuring that \nenvironmental protection and conservation are promoted? Regarding \nnuclear energy, is it possible for the U.S. to continue utilizing our \nexisting nuclear energy facilities while also finding a workable \nsolution to the problem of nuclear waste? Can the U.S. find ways to \ndecrease the price for renewable technologies like wind, solar, \ngeothermal, and biomass in a very competitive energy market? Is it \npossible to reconcile the conflicts regarding hydroelectric power and \nsustainable fisheries? How can the U.S. continue to use coal while \nensuring that the air and water are made even cleaner? Finally, how can \nAmerican businesses and individuals use all of these energy resources \nmore wisely and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? No one \nindustry, no one resource, no one technology, no one approach is going \nto provide that one silver bullet to fix our energy security problems!\n  Our long-term energy security interest goes far beyond the current \nprice hikes in gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, or electricity. I \nfear that, as a nation, we are falling asleep at the wheel. We need \npolicies that buffer our economy and our people from decisions made by \nforeign suppliers. It is time to focus on increased research and \ndevelopment into advanced technologies, energy efficiency and \nconservation measures, and market-based incentives to rapidly move \nthese advanced technologies and conservation measures from the lab to \nthe field. I believe that a comprehensive national energy strategy can \ndo all of this and incorporate a strong environmental strategy as well.\n\n  Therefore, what would a comprehensive national energy strategy \ninclude?\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n Let me suggest a framework that I believe would help Congress craft \nsuch an energy policy. We must look at developing all of our energy \nresource sectors--fossil, nuclear, and renewables. A comprehensive plan \nmust include improved measures for all of the major energy consuming \nsectors--the transportation, manufacturing, residential, and commercial \nsectors. A national energy plan needs to address the development and \nthe conservation of our resources. It does no good to be producing more \nof our energy at home if we are not making further progress to conserve \nenergy as well, especially in a growing economy. We need to develop an \neffective pipeline for the development of more advanced energy \ntechnologies. This will demand that more money and effort must be \ndevoted to research and development, demonstration, and, ultimately, \ndeployment in the market place. This energy strategy must be sound \neconomically and environmentally. We must examine actions that can be \ntaken now as well as actions for the long-term. Finally, while taking \nthese steps domestically, we should also be finding ways that we can \nincrease the export of American-made clean energy technologies to other \ncountries that need these technologies just as much as we do.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been working for many years to \nprovide funding for a range of clean energy technologies. I note that \ntwo of these 21st century clean energy technologies, the Clean Coal and \nfuel cell programs, are being centered at our nation's newest national \nlaboratory, the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, WV \nand Pittsburgh, PA and I believe that Congress should continue to \nsupport critical efforts like these in the future.\n  These are 21st century clean energy technologies--not because this is \nthe 21st century, it is not, until next year. But we are talking about \ntechnologies that extend into the future.\n  These technologies are essential for growing our economy while also \nensuring that environmental improvements, energy security, public \nhealth, and air and water quality are met. I have been working for 15 \nyears on the Clean Coal Technology Program, and I believe that it is \npossible to bring together several complementary and mutually \nbeneficial proposals. Let me outline a framework for coal and Clean \nCoal Technologies that I believe should be included in an energy \nsecurity bill in the 107th Congress. This package must be bipartisan, \nand I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues who have supported this effort like Senator Daschle, Senator \nMcConnell, and others.\n  Senator Lott's bill, S. 2557, has requested a report from the \nDepartment of Energy regarding coal and the development of an effective \nresearch, development, and demonstration program. I agree it is time to \ndo a more comprehensive study of Clean Coal Technologies. Among other \nsteps, the Department of Energy should work with the private sector on \na study to find ways for achieving higher performance goals and should \nrecommend a road map for the development of these new technologies. The \nCongress should also consider authorizing additional funding to carry \nout a more advanced research, development, and demonstration program to \nachieve these ends. I will certainly put my shoulder to the \nappropriations wheel in an effort to assist in this regard.\n  A comprehensive energy package should also include a provision to \npromote the commercialization of Clean Coal Technologies, similar to \nthat included in S. 2904. This provision, which I and other Senators \nsupport, would help to establish incentives to increase the deployment \nof these advanced Clean Coal Technologies now and in the future.\n  Finally, it is time that the U.S. turn its attention to the current \nfleet of coal-fired power plants. These coal-fired powerplants generate \napproximately 56 percent of our Nation's electricity and are the work \nhorses of our electric generating capacity.\n  Up here is part of the work. Take a look at the lights in the \nceiling. When the curtains of night fall, look at the lights at the top \nof the Capitol and across both sides of the Capitol, and pause to think \nthat those lights are burning because coal is still being mined.\n  It is time that we examine market-based incentives to make emission \nreductions and efficiency improvements for the existing fleet of coal-\nfired electric power generation.\n  I believe that Americans witnessed a healthy discussion about our \nNation's energy security at Tuesday night's presidential debate between \nVice President Gore and Governor Bush. Both candidates put forward \ntheir views on how the U.S. can effectively develop a comprehensive \nnational energy policy. Each candidate made what I believe signify \ncomplementary goals regarding a comprehensive energy policy. \nPrincipally, Governor Bush expressed his belief that the U.S. should \ntake additional steps to increase the availability of our domestic \nenergy resources, and Vice President Gore asserted that the U.S. should \nalso find ways to decrease our energy consumption. Additionally, and \nparticularly, I welcome the comments by both Presidential candidates \nregarding clean coal technologies.\n  I have to say that this present administration and some of the \nbudgets that have come to the Hill have sought to defer funding on \nclean coal technology, and even this year sought to rescind some of the \nmoney. That is going in the wrong direction.\n  The Vice President, in his September 14, 2000, letter to United Mine \nWorkers President Cecil Roberts remarked, ``I strongly support \naccelerating the development and deployment of technologies that will \nallow us to use coal in cleaner and more efficient ways.'' Following \nhis announced support for clean coal technologies at a campaign stop in \nHuntington, WV a day before, Governor Bush also voiced his support at \nthe debate by saying, ``I want to develop the coal resources in America \nand have clean coal technologies.'' Responding to those comments by \nGovernor Bush, Vice President Gore said, ``I strongly support new \ninvestments in clean coal technology.'' I am heartened by the comments \nof both candidates, and I hope that the next administration will be a \nstrong advocate for the increased research and development, \ndemonstration, and deployment of these clean coal technologies in the \ncoming years. The next administration has an obligation to follow \nthrough on those commitments to help America's coal miners, develop our \nown resources and technologies, and to deploy these clean coal \ntechnologies in the market at home and abroad. If we want to have a \nnational energy strategy, then we must sit down together and put all of \nour interests on the table.\n  I heard a great deal of talk by both Presidential candidates in that \ndebate about what each is going to do. Each is going to do this and \neach is going to do that, and this is going to happen and that is going \nto happen. Very little mention was made in that debate about Congress.\n  Congress has to be a partner in carrying out whatever plans the \nwinning candidate may have in this respect and in other respects. So \ndon't leave out Congress, my friends. Congress is very much a partner. \nI hope both candidates will recognize that in their future debates. \nThey will think of Congress because it takes help from Congress, \nbecause Congress is made up of the elected representatives of the \npeople. You have to have Congress on your side, whoever becomes \nPresident. We will sit down together and put all of our interests on \nthe table.\n  We should judge the success of our energy strategy by how it affects \nthe average person. How will it benefit farmers, coal miners, home \nowners, and truck drivers? We need to help create more jobs and an even \nstronger economy and ensure that the U.S. does not quiver each time \nthat OPEC tries to flex its muscles. We must not allow ourselves to be \nswayed by the winds of the current political movement. The American \npeople are not fools. They realize that last-minute, short-term, quick-\nfix solutions do little to address the underlying problem: the need for \ncomprehensive national energy policy. It is my hope that Congress will \nbegin to take a serious look at energy security legislation in the \n107th Congress. Mr. President, I stand ready to meet these challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10071-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10071-S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ON THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nConnie\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\nMack, has decided to retire from the Senate after serving two \nsuccessful terms. This Senator from the Sunshine State has served his \npeople and his country well.\n  Following graduation from the University of Florida with a Bachelor \nof Arts degree in Marketing, the young Senator-to-be began a successful \nsixteen-year career as a community banker. Quickly emerging as a local \ncivic leader in Cape Coral, FL, he fought to ensure access to vital \nhealth care services in his community by leading the effort to build a \nlocal hospital.\n  Heeding the call of greater professional challenge, Connie Mack \nentered the political arena when he won election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1982, a position he would occupy for the next six \nyears. As a member of the House, he was recognized by U.S. News and \nWorld Report as one of the Nation's most effective ``rising political \nstars.'' His sincere dedication to public service and love for the art \nand the process of legislating further propelled him to seek and win a \nseat in the United States Senate.\n  It is obvious that his Florida constituents understand and appreciate \nthe degree of skill, dedication, and integrity that Senator Mack has \nbrought to his work. And, as Republican Conference Chairman and third-\nranking member of the Senate Republican leadership, it is obvious that \nhis Republican colleagues have understood and valued those qualities in \nSenator Mack as well.\n  In 1994, Senator Mack had the distinguished honor of being the first \nRepublican in Florida history to be reelected to the U.S. Senate. He \nreceived 70 percent of the vote, more than any other Republican Senate \ncandidate in the nation. In that same year, Senator Mack was named by \nCampaigns and Elections magazine as one of the 20 most popular elected \nofficials in America.\n  Mr. President, no Senator has fought more vigorously to protect and \npreserve the jewel-green waters, the soft, white beaches, and the \ninland springs that comprise the immense natural beauty of the \nmarvelous peninsula he so effectively represents. He has been an ardent \nsupporter of restoring the natural history and the fragile ecosystem of \nthe Florida Everglades, a true national treasure. Most recently, \nSenator Mack played a large role in the recent Senate passage of the \nlargest environmental restoration project in history--a $7.8 billion \neffort to rescue the Florida Everglades from years of environmental \ndegradation.\n  Senator Mack has been driven by his personal commitment to doing all \nthat he can to provide a better, healthier life for all Americans and \npeople of the world. He has worked long hours, and with great \ndetermination, in an effort to see that Federal dollars are wisely used \nto combat breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, and \nAlzheimer's disease. The junior Senator from Florida has long realized \nthe importance of providing researchers with the tools necessary to \ncontinue the tremendous advances being made in biomedical research.\n  In the Senate, Connie Mack has been a true champion of the fight \nagainst cancer. He impressively co-chairs the Senate Cancer Coalition \nwith Senator Diane Feinstein to heighten awareness of cancer research, \nearly detection programs, improving cancer prevention, and exploring \nvarious innovative cancer treatment options. Senator Mack and his wife \nPriscilla, have both escaped the clutches of cancer, and have led the \ncharge to ensure that all Americans take to heart the message that \nearly detection of cancer saves lives. The Senator and his wife have \nreceived numerous honors and awards in their crusade against cancer, \nsuch as the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship Ribbon of Hope \nAward in 1998 and the National Coalition for Cancer Research Lifetime \nAchievement Award in 1999.\n  Drawing upon his experience as a community banker, Senator Mack \nplayed a key role in defining the framework of landmark legislation in \nthe Senate to modernize our nation's banking laws and offer more \nconvenience for consumers. I supported this legislation. It has helped \nto shape the financial industry, enabling more efficient and \nappropriate responses to the burgeoning demands of an aggressive global \nmarketplace.\n  And so, Mr. President, as he prepares to leave the Senate, I offer my \nsincere gratitude to Senator Connie Mack for his professionalism, for \nhis friendship, for his leadership, for his candor, and for his many \nyears of dedicated service to our nation.\n  Always a gentleman, and that means a lot in this body and in life, he \nbrought to this Senate floor and to his committee work some of the best \nthat Florida has to offer this Nation--a willingness to work hard, to \nmake tough and principled decisions, and to seek common ground in order \nto serve the common good. It is these notable qualities which will be \nso sorely missed.\n  I wish my distinguished colleague from the Sunshine State well.\n  Next week I will have something to say about other colleagues who are \nretiring and about whom I have yet to state a farewell message.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10072-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10072-S10073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to note my deep disappointment \nthat hate crimes legislation has been dropped from the Department of \nDefense authorization bill in conference, despite the fact that both \nthe Senate and the House have voted to include it. This is a major step \nbackward for our commitment to civil rights.\n  The Senate passed the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, \nsponsored by Senators Kennedy and Gordon Smith, on June 20 by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 57-42. This legislation would strengthen current law \nby making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and \nprosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin. \nIt also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government \non the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their \nsexual orientation, gender, or disability.\n  The Senate bill also shows full respect for principles of federalism. \nIt strengthens Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but \nnot a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. It has received \nstrong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement \norganizations across the country, support that is particularly \nsignificant to me as a former prosecutor.\n  On September 13, the House voted 232-192 to instruct their conferees \nto agree to the Senate language, showing that a strong bipartisan \nmajority of the House also wanted to strengthen and expand our laws \nagainst hate crimes.\n  But the conferees have now ignored the will of both the Senate and \nthe House. They have dropped the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, \nwhich has the support of not just the Congress but the President and \nthe American people.\n  Their objection cannot be that this legislation is unimportant. Hate \ncrimes affect more than just their victims and their victims' \nfamilies--they inspire fear in those who have no connection to the \nvictim beyond a shared characteristic such as race or sexual \norientation. When James Byrd, Jr. was dragged behind a pickup truck and \nkilled by bigots in Texas for no reason other than his race, many \nAfrican-Americans throughout the United States surely felt diminished \nas citizens. When Matthew Shepard was brutally murdered in Wyoming \nbecause he was gay, many gay people throughout the United States felt \nless safe on our streets and in their homes. These crimes promote fear \nand insecurity that are distinct from the reactions to other crimes, \nand House and Senate have both agreed that they should have distinct \npunishments.\n  The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is \nunnecessary. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, \nbut especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to \nmake clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each \nof us, and it diminishes our Nation. As a Nation, we must say loudly \nand clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. All \nAmericans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. \nIn the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish \nviolent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. The hate crimes amendment this Senate\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\napproved and the House endorsed continues that great and honorable \ntradition.\n\n  The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is \nunconstitutional. This bill accomplishes a critically important goal--\nprotecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional \nresponsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts of violence and \nthreats of violence motivated by hatred and bigotry. The Constitution \ndoes not permit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea \nsimply because we disagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the \nConstitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression \nwe agree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects \nnot just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but \nfreedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, \nand I am confident that this bill does not contradict it.\n  The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation has not been \nproperly examined. In addition to gaining the approval of the Senate \nand the House this year, similar legislation passed the Senate last \nyear. It has been the subject of great discussion in the general public \nand in the halls of Congress. It is long past time to act on this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, the conferees's objection cannot be that hate crimes are \nrare occurrences. In addition to the terrible murders of Mr. Byrd and \nMr. Shepard, the last years have seen the murder of former Northwestern \nbasketball coach Ricky Byrdsong and others in a bigoted Illinois \nshooting spree, the terrible sight of small children at a Jewish \ncommunity center in Los Angeles fleeing a gunman who sprayed the \nbuilding with 70 bullets from a submachine gun, and racially-motivated \ncrimes in the Pittsburgh area by both African-American and white \noffenders.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, last week the Canadian people learned \nof the passing of their former prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau. \nHis funeral, which took place on Wednesday, brought Canada's many \npolitical factions together for an unusual moment of unity. I would \nlike to take this time to share with my colleagues my thoughts on this \nmomentous event for our neighbors.\n  Pierre Trudeau led Canada at a time when that nation made enormous \nprogress both internally and on the world stage. He served as prime \nminister from 1968 through 1984, with a brief nine-month hiatus in \n1979-80. During these years, Trudeau championed many initiatives, and \nsupervised the process by which Canada replaced its ties to Great \nBritain with a constitution of its own. His agenda affected Canadian \npolitics for years after he left office.\n  Pierre Trudeau's private life certainly made many headlines, but his \nmost enduring legacy was his success in addressing the separatist \nmovement in his native Quebec. Just two years after assuming the prime \nminister's post, he won plaudits from the Canadian people for his \ntoughness in dealing with separatist terrorists who had kidnapped a \nBritish diplomat and a Quebecois provincial official. Ten years later, \nin May 1980, Trudeau's leadership and persuasiveness convinced 59.6% of \nQuebecois to vote against separating from the national government. At \nthe same time, though, he was sensitive to his country's French-\nspeaking population; Canada was made officially bilingual in 1984.\n  I lived in Canada for seven years during the Trudeau era. As an \nAmerican in this foreign-but-nearby land, I learned first-hand how \nPierre Trudeau shaped and influenced the maturation of Canada. Although \nthe United States and Canada certainly had their differences during \nthis era, particularly on matters of arms control, I know that our \nnation fully respected his abilities and leadership qualities that \nguided Canada through some momentous times. Our friendly neighbor to \nthe north has lost a great leader, and I hope all of my colleagues will \ntake a moment to recognize the enormous legacy of Pierre Elliot \nTrudeau.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10073-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10073-S10074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE HAZARD SUPPORT SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once described how ``for \nwant of nail the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; \nand for want of a horse the rider was lost.''\n  I wish to call the Senate's attention today to a similar situation. \nFor $13 million, we could help prevent hundreds of millions of dollars \nin losses from forest fires.\n  This case involves a Federal program which can help detect wild fires \nand volcanic activity from space. It is a small program that has been \nin a pilot phase for a couple of years but which is now operational. \nExcept it is not operating. It stopped when funding for it ended on \nSeptember 30, 2000. Unfortunately, funds to keep it going have not been \nauthorized or appropriated for the next fiscal year.\n  The program, which only recently came to my attention, is called the \nHazard Support System. It is operated by the United States Geological \nSurvey (USGS) and is a forceful example of how today's modern \ntechnologies can be employed to the benefit of us all.\n  For several years, our fire and volcanic agencies have been working \nwith the Department of Defense to realize the potential dual use of the \nnation's ballistic missile warning satellites to argument existing fire \ndetection and suppression capabilities and to monitor global volcanic \nactivity.\n  We have heard a great deal about fires over the past few months. On \naverage there about 100,000 wildland fires in the United States each \nyear, destroying millions of acres of timber, rangeland, and homes at \nthe cost of hundred of millions of dollars. In 1994, federal fire \nsuppression cost $920 million.\n  Here is a system--the Hazard Support System--which can detect fires \nof less than a quarter acre in size and dispatch warnings via the \nInternet to fire fighters in five minutes, saving potentially millions \nof dollars--not to mention people's homes--and it is not being funded.\n  The system's utility is not limited to forest fires but also can be \nused to detect volcanic eruptions and to track ash clouds.\n  One can ask why should we care about tracking ash clouds?\n  Imagine cruising through an ash cloud in a airplane at 30,000 feet \nabove Alaska: volcanic ash is sucked into the jet's engines where it \ninstantly melts, coating the inside of the engines, cutting off the \nflow of oxygen, and causing the engines to stall. The plane drops to \n10,000 feet where the engines restart only because the rapid descent \nhas dislodged the ash crust. This actually happened to an aircraft in \nAlaska.\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\n  Jet radars and weather satellites cannot detect ash clouds. To these \nsystems, ash looks like water vapor. With ash from volcanic explosions \ntraveling around the world at high altitudes, we cannot fly safely \nunless we have the ability to track these clouds. Every year about 10 \nvolcanic eruptions penetrate the altitude range of air traffic. Seven \npassenger airliners have experienced engine power losses, and plane \nrepair and replacement costs, as of 1994, exceeded $200 million.\n  Most of the world's volcanoes can erupt without warning. There is no \nglobal volcano monitoring capability. Currently, less than half of \nAmerica's 65 potentially active volcanoes are monitored for signs of \nactivity--but not their ash clouds. We have active volcanoes in Alaska, \nWashington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. Most of the volcanoes in \nthe Aleutian Islands are active but, along this major international \nairline route, only 10 percent of these volcanoes are monitored. Only \n10 percent of the world's 1,500 potentially active volcanoes are under \nconstant surveillance.\n  The USGS' Hazard Support System fuses the fire- and volcanic-activity \ndetection capabilities of the world's environmental weather satellites \nwith that of our ballistic missile warning satellites--without \naffecting their primary national security mission--to provide 24-hour \nworldwide detection.\n  The cost of this system for its first year would be $13.5 million and \n$5 million thereafter. The benefits of this program for states in the \nWestern part of the United States are obvious. I have been assured by \nthe Administration that the only reason funding for this program was \nnot requested for the next fiscal year was because, at the time of the \nbudget preparation, the system was not yet operational. It is now \noperational and proven.\n  I intend to seek funding for a small program with a huge return in \nprotecting Americans from future forest fires and the danger of \ncatastrophic airline crashes. I would urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10074-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, October is Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, and I can think of no better way to start off the month than by \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and providing thousands of \nSouth Dakota women and children with the resources and protection from \nviolence and abuse.\n  As you know, programs contained in the Violence Against Women Act \nexpired October 1. I have sponsored legislation to reauthorize and \nexpand these important programs, and the reauthorization bill has \nreceived broad, bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. In \nfact, there are 72 Senators cosponsoring my bill. Also, the House of \nRepresentatives voted last week by an overwhelming 415-3 margin to \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\n  This Congress, that has failed to act on several important \nlegislative initiatives, has the opportunity to do something right this \nweek. Majority Leader Lott can schedule votes today on reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act, and it would pass overwhelmingly. \nThe President has promised to sign the bill as soon as possible. The \ntime to act is now.\n  In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic \nviolence were provided assistance last year. Shelters, victims' service \nproviders, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these \nfunds to provide assistance to these women and children. \nReauthorization of this legislation assures that South Dakota \ncommunities will continue to have access to critical funds for domestic \nviolence services.\n  A woman from South Dakota recently wrote me about this issue, and I \nshared her story on the Senate floor last week because I believe it \nmade the most compelling case for reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. This South Dakotan was abused as a child, raped as a \nteenager, and emotionally abused as a wife. Her grandchildren were also \nabused. In her letter, she pleads: Please reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Don't let another woman go through what I went \nthrough, and please don't let another child go through what my \ngrandchildren have gone through. You can make a difference.''\n  I also heard from a Rural Outreach Advocate in South Dakota who said \na grant from the Violence Against Women Act enables her and other \nadvocates to help battered women in our state. She noted that many \nassaulted women and children in our state live in remote, rural areas \nthat don't have available services. Without grants from the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, this Rural Outreach Advocate warned that we will be \nunable to help a majority of battered women and children on our state's \nfarms and in our state's small towns.\n  In addition to the need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct, I recently joined Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota in \nintroducing legislation called the National Domestic Violence Hotline \nEnhancement Act. Since 1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-\n800-799-SAFE) has received 500,000 calls from women and children in \ndanger from abuse. My legislation would create the National First Call \nfor Safety web site that would allow National Domestic Violence Hotline \noperators to quickly and easily find the most appropriate shelter for \ncallers. The highly secure and confidential web site would keep a \ncontinuously updated, nationwide list of available shelters and \ninformation about services and facilities offered by these shelters.\n  My legislation is modeled after the successful Day One program in \nMinnesota. Day One has run a web site linking every shelter in \nMinnesota and reports that 99 percent of women and children who call \nare assured to receive shelters and services that meet their needs.\n  While there are many worthwhile issues that must be addressed by this \nCongress in the next few weeks, I can think of no better accomplishment \nfor Congress than to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and \npass my National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. Simply put, \nthese laws will help keep wives, daughters, sisters, and friends from \nbecoming victims of domestic violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10074-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10074-S10075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RURAL LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a conferee last year on the satellite \ntelevision bill, I worked hard to include, along with several of my \ncolleagues, a provision that would have ensured that the benefits of \nthat bill would also be shared by rural Americans through a loan \nguarantee program.\n  Those benefits include providing local-into-local television over \nsatellite--which simply means that rural Americans would be able to \nreceive their local network stations over satellite if they owned a \nsatellite dish, along with the full range of weather, movie, \nsuperstation, sports and a host of other channels.\n  We wanted to ensure that rural Americans would get the same level of \ntelevision service over satellite as urban Americas would enjoy.\n  As it turns out, urban Americans can now receive the full array of \nlocal network channels over satellite--but the great majority of rural \nAmericans can not.\n  Unfortunately, the Chairman of the Banking Committee objected to the \nprovision--at the end of last year--that would have helped finance such \nservice to rural areas and we have been unable to resolve this matter.\n  At the time I was very worried this would happen which is why I \ndiscussed it at some length on the floor.\n  I want to stress, once again, to all of my colleagues that this is \nvery important to our constituents. We need to work together so that we \ncan resolve this problem and make sure that rural America is not left \nin the dark.\n  I am here today, to again stand with rural Americans. I have already \nmentioned on the floor several times that if we tried to hold a \nConference on this issue that we would be unable to pass the bill this \nyear.\n  I said few weeks ago that we simply do not have time to go through \nthe formal Conference process. The e-signature Conference, for example, \ntook many months. As I have warned everyone before--we do not have time \nfor a Conference.\n  However, if we work together we can easily finish a bill that will \nactually work and get local television stations carried over satellite.\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\n  With a few improvements to the House-passed or to the Senate-passed \nbills we can get this job done for rural America.\n  We need to make sure that the federal guarantee can cover providing \nhigh-speed Internet access to rural Americans. As long as we are going \nto help finance a satellite we should get the biggest benefit out of it \nby having it also help break down the digital divide.\n  Also, some of the bill provisions consist of such atypical, and \nonerous, credit requirement that I do not think that any lenders will \nwant to participate.\n  I have two basic concerns with the proposed language, and have \nserious concerns about the extraneous House provisions on cell \ntelephones and the like.\n  I also understand through lobbyists that efforts are being made to \ninclude language that would take away FCC authority to approve the new \n``Northpoint'' technology that could provide local-into-local \ntelevision in many areas of the country. My understanding is that some \nof the satellite providers are concerned that Northpoint could compete \nwith them.\n  In terms of the credit provisions of the bill, I am worried that \npotential borrowers may have long-term existing contractural \nobligations or security agreements whose contract terms would be \nabrogated by this law if they were to participate in this loan \nguarantee program.\n  If they received a guaranteed loan under the bill, their lenders \ncould pull back existing credit lines for violating their contracts by \ncomplying with the new law.\n  With respect to the default language, even a minor default could lead \nto liquidation which would reduce the ability of the United States to \nprotects its own interests and, in addition, could trigger unnecessary \ndefaults on loans or projects which the borrower may have with the \nUnited States, or other lenders.\n  The additional problem with the superpriority bankruptcy language is \nthat it is a backdoor ``taking'' of property because it would take the \nproperty rights of creditors that have other prior perfected security \ninterests in the borrower's property.\n  These contract property rights--which would be destroyed after the \nfact--could be very valuable and the bill could take them away.\n  Mr. President, I have provided language to most interested offices \nsome months ago to resolve these points which may appear at first blush \nto be technical but, in fact, could make it impossible for this program \nto work.\n  I have also proposed language to ensure that rural Americans are able \nto receive high-speed Internet access under this bill. The section on \nprerequisites for the loan does not list high-speed Internet access as \na purpose for the guarantee.\n  I recommend adding ``high-speed Internet access'' to that section so \nthat the Board could approve a guarantee which would include that \npurpose, as a secondary consideration.\n  I have pointed out before on the Senate floor that, ``computers are \non a development path that improves performance by a factor of 10 every \nfive years,'' according to Scientific American.\n  However, without high-speed linkage of these constantly improving \ncomputers rural America will be left behind.\n  In America, there is a growing disparity between the digital \n``haves'' and ``have-nots'' as portions of our society get left behind \nat the same lightning pace at which the Internet develops.\n  I would like the bill changed so that we can close the ``digital \ndivide'' that keeps rural America from fully participating in America's \neconomic boom under President Clinton.\n  I know that some are fighting to keep this disparity--but this \ndisparity between rural and urban America is self-defeating as the \nInternet becomes an increasingly important thread of our business and \nsocial fabric.\n  So I hope all my colleagues will join with me in working together to \nget this program in operation before Congress goes out of session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10075-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             APPROPRIATIONS--INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Interior \nAppropriations Bill for fiscal 2001 and our efforts here in the Senate \nto enact the Conservation and Reinvestment Act to provide permanent \nfunding for land, water, and wildlife conservation programs in this \nnation.\n  With the passage of the Interior Appropriations Bill for fiscal year \n2001, we have taken a step in the right direction toward providing a \npermanent conservation fund for this nation--but it is only a step.\n  The Interior Appropriations bill funds many important programs and \nprojects in Arkansas including refurbishing the historic Hot Springs \nNational Park Bathhouses, constructing a visitors center at the White \nRiver National Wildlife Refuge, and funding needed construction and \nmaintenance at recreation areas in the Ouachita National Forest.\n  The bill also increases the funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, Payments in Lieu of Taxes, Urban and Historic \nPreservation programs, State Conservation grants. And needed funding \nfor tackling the maintenance backlog in our nation's park system. But \nit leaves many of the programs that we have pushed for in the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act out completely. Specifically, it \nleaves out a permanent stream of funding for wildlife conservation and \neducation programs.\n  By establishing a permanent funding source for state based wildlife \nprograms, we can take steps now to prevent species from becoming \nendangered. This would enable us not only to conserve the significant \ncultural heritage of wildlife enjoyment for the people of this country, \nbut also to avoid the substantial costs associated with recovery for \nendangered species. In fact, all 50 states would benefit as a result of \nthe important link between these wildlife education-based initiatives \nand the benefits of wildlife-related tourism.\n  CARA also would have provided a permanent funding source for rural \ncommunity assistance and development funds, historic preservation, \nurban parks, conservation easements, and restoration of National Parks. \nThese provisions would annually provide almost $3 billion nationwide \nfor land, water, and wildlife conservation programs and include over \n$25 million in funding for Arkansas.\n  The 2001 Interior Appropriations bill is an important step toward \nproviding for the conservation of this nation's land, water, and \nwildlife, but we can do so much more. We must not let this opportunity \nslip away to enact what may well be the most significant conservation \neffort of the century. I strongly urge my colleagues to continue to \nwork toward passage of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10075-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10075-S10076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONCEALED GUN LICENSES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in recent years, lobbyists for the National \nRifle Association, NRA, have been pressing state legislatures around \nthe country to pass so called ``shall issue'' laws. ``Shall issue'' \nlaws require that licensing authorities shall or must issue concealed \nweapons permits to those who meet standard eligibility requirements. \nThe state laws take discretion away from local law enforcement \nagencies, who would ordinarily use their own criteria to determine who \nshould carry a concealed weapon.\n  When such a law was proposed in my home state of Michigan, every \nmajor law enforcement organization in the state spoke out against it. \nAthletes, entertainers, religious leaders and some lawmakers joined \nthem in their public plea to keep concealed firearms off our streets. \nIn the end, although both the State House and Senate passed the ``shall \nissue'' legislation, lawmakers yielded to public pressure and refused \nto proceed to a conference committee, thereby rejecting the law.\n  While Michigan's citizens acted quickly to ensure that lawmakers \nrejected the NRA backed proposal, other state legislatures embraced the \nlaw as their own. This week the Los Angeles Times published an \nextensive report on the effects of the relatively new law that gives \nTexans the right to carry concealed weapons into public places, \nincluding churches, hospitals, nursing homes, and amusement parks. The \nTimes story reveals that since the ``shall issue'' law's inception in \n1995,\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\nand its expansion in 1997, Texas has issued concealed weapons permits \nto more than 400 criminals with prior convictions, and has since \narrested more than 3,000 licensees.\n  Based on the LA Times investigation, it appears that the law billed \nas part of an ``anti-crime'' package could really be more accurately \ndescribed as pro-crime. A recently released study from the Violence \nPolicy Center disclosed that Texans with concealed-carry licenses were \n66 percent more likely to be arrested for firearms violations than \nTexans who did not have such licenses.\n  The LA Times story explains that part of the problem is that in many \ncases, concealed permits were given to those whose records should have \ndisqualified them. Perhaps the most disturbing case is that of Terry \nGist, also known to his friends as ``Holsters'' because of his well-\nknown affection for guns. Before he even applied for his permit to \ncarry a concealed weapon in Texas in 1997, Gist had already been to \ncourt for trying to choke his wife and threaten her with a gun (she had \na restraining order out against him) and arrested while in the army for \nbrandishing his handgun at a local citizen in Haiti. After he passed \nthe state background check and received his concealed weapons permit in \nthe mail, he was known to carry two semiautomatic handguns, sometimes \nthree, with him at all times. Gist bragged that he displayed one of \nthose guns to a driver during a ``freeway feud.'' In 1998, Gist was \narrested and convicted for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl \nwho said during the trial that she was afraid he was going to shoot \nher.\n  The most common category of problems associated with concealed \nweapons holders, however, are not those of Terry Gist, but those of \npeople like Paul Leuders. Leuders, a Houston computer analyst, became \nso upset when he almost missed his bus that the concealed weapons \nlicensee took out his gun and shot the bus driver in the chest.\n  Law abiding citizens, armed with concealed weapons, are too often \nturning what would otherwise be unpleasant but not catastrophic events, \nsuch as fender-benders and commuting hassles, into tragedies. The \n``shall issue'' laws in Texas and in states around the country don't \nmake us safer, they make us less secure. In addition, they send the \nwrong message to our children, that the way to deal with the problems \nof modern life is with a gun. People around the country reject the NRA \nlogic that they are unsafe in public places if they are not armed. \nLegislatures should do the same.\n  America has come a long way since the days of the wild west. Over the \nlast years our law enforcement agencies have developed better ways to \nreduce violent crime and keep our streets safe. ``Shall issue'' laws go \nin the wrong direction by increasing the number of weapons on the \nstreets and the dangers we and our children face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10076-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nNational Rural Development Partnership (NRDP) Act of 2000 introduced \nyesterday by my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, and 25 of our \ndistinguished colleagues.\n  The NRDP is a nonpartisan interagency working group whose mission is \nto ``contribute to the vitality of the nation by strengthening the \nability of all rural Americans to participate in determining their \nfutures.'' Today the NRDP is comprised of nearly 40 State Rural \nDevelopment Councils [SRDCs]. The NRDP also brings to the task of \ndeveloping rural America more than 40 agencies, in addition to state, \nlocal, tribal, for- and non-profit organizations.\n  The Partnership has thrived in recent years because of the hard work \nof thousands of dedicated Americans throughout the country who are \ncommitted to reinvigorating rural life through coordination of their \nefforts and those of the public and private sectors. However, the NRDP \nhas never been formally authorized. The future of this important \norganization can only be secured if the NRDP, the National Rural \nDevelopment Council, and the SRDCs are formally recognized by the \nCongress and authorized to receive appropriations.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what this legislation would do. \nAdditionally, the Craig-Conrad bill delineates specific \nresponsibilities for each component of the NRDP while refocusing and \nreinvigorating many current activities. It does not, however, create \nany new bureaucracy. This legislation grew out of a hearing of the \nAgriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and \nRural Revitalization that Senator Craig and I, as chairman and ranking \nmember, held on March 8 of this year. The support expressed at that \nhearing for the NRDP was broad-based and considerable.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the NRDP's work. Every \nregion of our nation has benefited. In my part of the country, the NRDP \nhas been particularly valuable in bringing together previously \nindependent rural development efforts, creating a synergistic effect.\n  As I have discussed on the Senate floor and in committee on numerous \noccasions, in the Upper Great Plains we are facing a crisis of \nstaggering proportions, placing unprecedented stress on every aspect of \neconomic and community life. This is a very serious matter for the \nentire country. The farms of the Dakotas and the surrounding states \nproduce wheat, corn, and soybeans in abundance, but something much more \nimportant: good families and great kids. The rural way of life helps \nfoster the values of hard work and fortitude that have made America \ngreat.\n  In my view, the ongoing crisis in agriculture represents as great a \nthreat to our nation's future as any of the foreign threats we face \ntoday. As we work to combat this domestic national security threat and \npreserve the rural way of life, the NRDP is a truly vital asset. I hope \nall my colleagues will join the 27 of us on this bill in pressing for \nits passage and enactment at the earliest possible moment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10076-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10076-S10077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   FATHER NICHOLAS MAESTRINI AND FATHER JOHN BORACCO CELEBRATE 70TH \n                   ANNIVERSARY OF PRIESTHOOD TOGETHER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Father \nNicholas Maestrini and Father John Boracco, two men who have dedicated \ntheir lives in service to the Catholic Church, and who have often found \ntheir paths cross along the way. On October 22, 2000, the paths of \nthese old friends will converge once again, as they will be honored \ntogether by the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) in \nDetroit, Michigan, in recognition of their 70th Anniversary of \nOrdination.\n  Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco began their long histories of dedicated \nservice to the Catholic Church together as seminary classmates in \nMonza, Italy. Shortly after becoming ordained priests, both chose to \nenter into the PIME missionary. PIME is an international community of \npriests, lay missionaries and lay volunteers who have dedicated their \nlives to service in foreign lands. Founded in Italy in 1850, it is now \na global organization that operates missions throughout the world. Its \ninternational headquarters are in Rome, Italy, while PIME U.S. Region \nis based out of Detroit.\n  Both Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco joined missions in Asia, and both \nexperienced struggle and hardship there during the chaotic period \nbefore, during and after World War II. Fr. Maestrini served as a \nmissionary in Hong Kong from 1931-50. During this time, he suffered \nthrough the strife of the Great War and of being interned by the \nJapanese. Fr. Boracco had it no easier in China, where he was stationed \nfrom 1934-54, first in the northern Henan Province and then at Kai \nPheng. He was forced to persevere through imprisonment, the Japanese \noccupation, and the Communist revolution. In 1954, he was condemned to \ndie at the hands of the Communists, but was instead expelled.\n  In 1951, Fr. Maestrini was named Superior of the PIME U.S. Region. \nFour years later, he was joined in Detroit by Fr. Boracco, who was \nassigned to help with the seminary expansion started by his friend. For \nthe next 19 years, the two formed the perfect team. Fr. Maestrini \nfocused his energy on external matters, such as public relations and \nfundraising, while Fr. Boracco served as rector and spiritual director\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\nof PIME's theological and high school seminars. With success, their \nroles expanded. Fr. Maestrini oversaw the establishment of three \nseminaries, two award-winning films, and many fund raising and public \nrelations programs benefitting the foreign missions. Fr. Boracco became \nDirector of the PIME residence for priests, brothers and seminaries. \nWhile Fr. Maestrini retired as Superior in 1974, Fr. Boracco retired \njust last year.\n  Both Fr. Boracco and Fr. Maestrini remain active within the Catholic \ncommunity. Aside from assisting at his local parish, Fr. Maestrini \npublishes a mission newsletter, and continues correspondence with \nmissionaries and benefactors. Fr. Boracco regularly assists several \nparishes in the Archdiocese of Detroit.\n  I applaud Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco on their extraordinary \nlegacies of service. For 70 years, they have tirelessly spread the \nmessage of faith and good will to others embodied by the Catholic \nChurch, and they have done so while forming a friendship that is truly \nunique. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate \nFather Nicholas Maestrini and Father John Boracco on 70 years of \nsuccessful service, and wish them both continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10077-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. BENNIE THAYER\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Senator Bond and I would like to \nsubmit for the Record a tribute to Mr. Bennie Thayer, a long-time \nbusiness advocate and remarkable man who passed away Monday.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I would like to join \nin making the following statement recognizing Mr. Thayer's lifetime \naccomplishments.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Mr. Thayer earned the respect and admiration of the small \n     business community. Until his passing, Mr. Thayer served as \n     the eloquently outspoken President and CEO for the National \n     Association for the Self-Employed. Representing more than \n     200,000 members nationwide, as head of NASE Mr. Thayer fought \n     for relief from unfair government regulations and pushed for \n     legislative action on issues ranging from taxes to retirement \n     plans. I think we will all remember him for his tireless work \n     to get 100 percent deductibility for health insurance \n     purchased by the self-employed. It wasn't easy. In fact, it \n     was a long, long fight, but he managed to build bi-partisan \n     support for 100 percent deductibility. How fitting it would \n     be for Congress to pass such legislation before we adjourn.\n       In addition to Mr. Thayer's leadership at NASE, he has \n     chaired and served on the board of many local and national \n     business associations covering economic development, credit \n     development, small-business enhancement, and general business \n     growth. Of course, Mr. Thayer knew what he was doing. He \n     could identify with the needs of small business owners and \n     the self-employed because he himself was co-owner of the \n     Board of Natural Health Options and A.W. Curtis Products, a \n     manufacturer of natural health products. In his distinguished \n     career, Mr. Thayer also was called upon at times to advise \n     the past three Presidents--President Reagan, President Bush, \n     and President Clinton.\n       But Mr. Thayer should be remembered for much more than his \n     impressive resume or for being a champion of and advocate for \n     small businesses and the self-employed. He served tirelessly \n     in several capacities as a leader in his community. For the \n     past seven years, Mr. Thayer was Senior Pastor of the United \n     Methodist Church of the Redeemer in Temple Hills, Maryland. \n     He also worked toward community development and youth \n     mentoring as a board member of such organizations as REDEEM \n     Inc. and the Board of Eagle Flight Inc.\n       In the most recent issue of ``Self-Employed America,'' \n     NASE's bi-monthly publication, there is an article entitled \n     ``Make Yourself Memorable.'' Mr. Thayer did. His first \n     impression was a lasting impression--a warm, sincere \n     handshake and an incredible, mesmerizing voice. Even if you \n     didn't agree with something he said, you always liked how he \n     said it. We will miss him.\n       Our condolences go out to his wife Bernice, his two \n     daughters, his two grandchildren and his home community in \n     Prince George's County Maryland, where he touched the lives \n     of so many. May God bless his family and friends, and may the \n     remarkable Bennie Thayer rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10077-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10077-S10078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING A COLUMBINE HERO, BOY SCOUT EVAN TODD\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a pair of statements I recently received from an exceptional \nyoung man in Colorado, Mr. Evan Todd of Littleton. Evan was one of the \nmany unfortunate victims of the horrific shooting that took place at \nColumbine High School on April 20, 1999. Evan was the first student \nshot in the library at Columbine High School, and despite his injuries \nhe assisted other students and administered first aid to a seriously \nwounded peer until emergency services could arrive. Evan, an active Boy \nScout, was awarded the prestigious Boy Scouts of America Honor Medal \nfor his inspiring actions. Still a Columbine student, Evan has \ndedicated a tremendous amount of time to speaking to other students and \nadults around the nation concerning the problems of youth violence and \nthe cultural influences on American youth. I am honored that Evan took \nthe time to write to me and I ask that a copy of Evan Todd's letter to \nhis fellow Scouts and a copy of a speech he delivered at ``The \nGathering,'' a meeting of victims of school violence, be included in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  The material follows:\n       Dear Fellow Scouts, I have been told that into each life \n     some rain must fall. Some get rained on more than others. The \n     rain that came down on us at Columbine High School was a \n     cloudburst of epic proportions. This act was senseless, \n     tragic and without justification, whatsoever. 13 murdered 25 \n     wounded and 1,951 students youth destroyed. As a student who \n     was shot and wounded in the library, it has changed my life, \n     forever.\n       I believe that the children of a society are nothing more \n     than the reflection of the society that they are brought \n     into. The event here at Columbine in Littleton Colorado, and \n     the events at Moses Lake Washington, Pearl Mississippi, \n     Jonesboro Arkansas, Edinboro Pennsylvania, Fayetteville \n     Tennessee, Springfield Oregon, Richmond Virginia, Conyers \n     Georgia, Los Angeles California and elsewhere indicate to me \n     that our nation has a serious character flaw. Since the \n     Columbine tragedy, I have tried to stay abreast of the \n     ``adult society'' debate as to the ``why'' and ``how'' of \n     these terrible incidents. The adults debate and argue over \n     what constitutes good and what constitutes evil; what is \n     right and what is wrong. At the time of the Columbine \n     tragedy, our national leader, the President, stated the youth \n     of this nation need to learn to resolve our differences with \n     words, not weapons. At the time this statement was made, we \n     as a nation, were bombing Yugoslavia. They tell us that the \n     youth of this nation need to be more tolerant, kinder, \n     gentler, more understanding. Yet our entertainment, music, \n     TV, movies, games (and actions of) the adult world provides \n     for our consumption are all too often filled with violence, \n     sex, death and destruction. If we were to take into our lives \n     what is provided to us by our society, our actions would also \n     violate the Scout Oath & Law. Other solutions to school \n     violence have been nametags to be carried around our neck as \n     millstones, metal detectors, increased video surveillance, \n     etc. Our nation has always had guns. Our nation has always \n     had children. What our nation hasn't always had is children \n     murdering children and their parents, and parents murdering \n     their children. The ingredient that has made America \n     different is the last couple of `adult generations', and \n     their changes towards what is right & wrong, good & evil. It \n     appears to me that our society is confused. The adult world \n     seems as a ship with no rudder being cast around by the wind \n     and storms of our times, with no control or understanding as \n     to why. Many of these storms appear to have been caused by \n     their own accord. It's as if our adult society has no \n     compass, no bearing, no standards for our society. I have \n     found them confused. Even at our age, we can discern the \n     difference between what you say and what you do. . . .\n       In regard to the solution of watching what comes out of us \n     by monitoring closely our world with surveillance cameras, \n     what we say, how we look, etc., our society needs to watch \n     carefully what goes into us. In my room is a picture of the \n     Grand Teton mountain range in Wyoming. Below the picture is \n     the following:\n\n\n                        ``the essence of destiny\n\n       ``Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Choose your \n     words, for they become actions. Understand your actions, for \n     they become habits. Study your habits, for they will become \n     your character. Develop your character, for it becomes your \n     destiny.''\n                                  ____\n\n       The good news for those of us that are Scouts is that we \n     are privileged to be a part of an organization that provides \n     us the tools and instructions to put into us that which \n     builds a better person, a better nation. Those tools are \n     called the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Robert Gates, former \n     Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and \n     our current President of the National Eagle Scout Association \n     (NESA) recently stated that there is a war going on for the \n     souls of our boys and young men in this nation. He sees \n     clearly. If you are to be a scout, don't be a scout in word \n     only. Learn and practice the Oath & Law in everything you \n     think, say and do. I understand well how hard that can be, \n     but ``Do Your Best.'' To the Boy Scouts of America, thank you \n     for defending our 90-year record and not allowing the Oath & \n     Law to be redefined. As you say, it has stood the\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\n     test of time. The generation that wants to change the Oath & \n     Law has not stood the test of time. To all the scouts across \n     America that sent me & my troop cards, letters, posters, your \n     thoughts and prayers, thank you from the bottom of my heart. \n     To you here tonight, I bid you vaya con Dios mi amigos, God \n     Bless you and God Bless the work you do. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10078-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GLASTONBURY YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The many programs offered by Glastonbury \nYouth and Family Services helps ensure that the town's children are \nexposed to the very best role models both inside and outside of the \nhome. Because of the hard work and dedication of the parents, children, \nand workers in this program, the future of Glastonbury is very bright \nindeed.\n  Glasonbury Youth and Family Services has already helped open doors \nfor countless young people, and I am confident that the children of the \ncommunity will continue to benefit from its services far into the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Glastonbury Youth and Family Services on this very \nspecial anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10078-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORWEGIAN CLUB OF DETROIT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nNorwegian Club of Detroit, which will celebrate its 75th Anniversary in \nOrchard Lake, Michigan, on October 14, 2000. Only Ireland has had a \nlarger percentage of its population immigrate to the United States than \nhas Norway. As Norwegians arrived in Michigan, the Norwegian Club of \nDetroit was there to help them adjust to their new homeland, while at \nthe same time continue to celebrate the familiar traditions of home.\n  The Norwegian Club of Detroit was organized in 1925. Originally \nconsisting of only engineers, it quickly expanded to include Norwegians \nfrom all walks of life, providing an important cultural, social and \nprofessional network for Michigan's Norwegian community.\n  An example of the Club's importance to the Norwegian community can \nclearly be seen during World War II, when members managed to mobilize \nand ultimately provide support to Norwegian military forces who escaped \nthe Nazi invasion. Members also organized training in Canada to assist \nin the war effort of the Allies.\n  The Norwegian Club of Detroit remains an important factor in \ncelebrating and promoting Norwegian and Scandinavian cultural, \npolitical and economic ties to the State of Michigan. One of the first \ngroups to participate in the Ethnic Festivals in Detroit, the Club also \nhas helped support performances by the Scandinavian Symphony, a visit \nby the Hjemkomst Viking ship reproduction, as well as various Norwegian \nperformers and artists.\n  Mr. President, 2000 is an extremely important year in the Norwegian-\nAmerican community. It is the 100th Anniversary of the founding of \nOslo, Norway's capital city, as well as the 1000th Anniversary of the \nViking discovery of North America. This year also marks 175 years of \nNorwegian immigration to the United States. Amidst all of this, and on \nbehalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the Norwegian Club of \nDetroit a Happy 75th Anniversary, and continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10078-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING SHIRLEY RAGSDALE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nShirley Ragsdale, the editor for the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Argus \nLeader newspaper, on her receiving the national Casey Journalism Center \nAwards 2000 Casey Medals for her outstanding coverage of the plight of \nSouth Dakota's children in the Juvenile Corrections facilities.\n  The Casey Medals for Meritorious Journalism honor distinguished \ncoverage of disadvantaged children and family, and the institutions and \nagencies charged with serving them. The Casey Journalism Center serves \nas an independent national resource center for professional journalists \nand it is operated by the University of Maryland and funded by the \nAnnie E.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate one of our nation's finest Olympians, Jenny \nThompson. This week, Jenny set herself apart from the rest of the \nworld. With 10 Olympic medals, 8 of which are gold, Jenny has become \nthe most decorated Olympic female swimmer of all time. As an American, \nI am very proud of our U.S. Olympic athletes, but I am especially proud \nof Jenny Thompson, from my home state of New Hampshire.\n  Jenny first appeared on swimming's national stage in the mid-1980's \nwhen she began swimming for the Seacoast Swimming Association in Dover, \nNew Hampshire for coach Mike Parratto. At the age of 15, Jenny just \nmissed making the 1988 U.S. Olympic Swim Team, but her success as a \nyoung athlete drew the attention of college swimming programs from \naround the country. Jenny began attending Stanford University in 1991, \nand in 1992, she became the first woman in 61 years to set a world \nrecord in the 100 meter freestyle event. She followed up on her new \nworld record by leading Stanford to a 27-0 dual-meet record, four PAC-\n10 titles and four consecutive NCAA Championships. Through her \nleadership and her firm sense of teamwork, Jenny Thompson was elevated \nto team captain and served as a mentor for Stanford's more recent \narrivals to the natatorium.\n  In addition to Jenny's team accomplishments, she managed to swim her \nway to 19 NCAA titles, the most in women's collegiate swimming history. \nHaving also captured 23 U.S. national titles, Jenny is the most \nsuccessful active swimmer in the United States.\n  When Jenny arrived in Sydney, Australia, she did so with five gold \nmedals and one silver medal. She has now added to her Olympic success \nby again leading the U.S. women's relay team to gold in the 4 x 100 \nmeter freestyle relay, setting another new world record, and the 4 x \n100 meter medley relay. Additionally, Jenny continued to show her \ncompetitive edge as an individual by medaling in the 100 meter \nfreestyle, winning the bronze.\n  Jenny Thompson's performance at the 2000 Sydney Olympics has made her \nthe most decorated female Olympian in the United States and the most \nsuccessful female Olympic swimmer in history. Aside from her \nachievements at the Olympics and Stanford University, Jenny has won \nnumerous World Championships and accumulated countless awards and \nhonors as an athlete. She has always displayed team spirit and \nprofessionalism in and around the pool, showing that character is one \nof her finest assets. Her contribution to the sport of swimming is \nunmatched and has left a lasting impression in the minds and hearts of \nall who have watched her represent the United States throughout the \nyears. Jenny Thompson has inspired a generation of young swimmers to \ndream and achieve their goals, to think positively and to work hard.\n  Jenny Thompson will enter Columbia University Medical School next \nfall, where I know she will be successful. Her drive and desire will \nsurely allow her to achieve her goals as she makes\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\nher way into a different stage of her life. I am confident that Jenny \nwill continue to be a role model for all, and I hope that she knows we \nare proud of her. New Hampshire is proud of her, our nation is proud of \nher, and we wish her nothing but the best in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10079-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COLUMBUS, GEORGIA'S HOUSE OF HEROES PROGRAM\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there is a great outpouring of \nhuman generosity taking place in our great country that I must speak \nabout here today. I was honored to be with my friends and colleagues, \nincluding the late Senator Coverdell, Representatives Mac Collins and \nSanford Bishop, Columbus Mayor Bobby Peters, Col. Frank Helmick, along \nwith Wayne Anthony of Hands On Columbus and many, many other \nvolunteers, as we embarked on the historic event of initiating the \nHouse of Heroes program. This program should serve as a model to \ncommunities all across the country to provide needed assistance and \nsupport for aging veterans who bravely served their country and their \nfamilies.\n  It is often said that ``Poor is the nation who has no heroes. Poorer \nstill is the nation which has them but forgets them.'' The House of \nHeroes project makes sure we don't forget this adage by having \nvolunteers take up shovels, paint brushes and brooms to show not only \nour veterans, but also their families, that they are not forgotten. \nThis past May at the home of Betty Cook of Columbus, in my state of \nGeorgia, the House of Heroes was inaugurated by federal, military, and \nlocal officials to help serve as a reminder to younger generations of \nAmericans how our nation's older men and woman veterans have proudly \nserved and sacrificed for their country to help preserve our freedom. \nThe inauguration ceremony reminded us all that honor, valor, and \nsacrifice come not only from service members, but from their spouses \nand family as well. While Mrs. Cook's husband served his country as a \nmedic in World War II, she fought the war at home. She supported their \nfamily on her own, while encouraging her husband to press on in battle \noverseas. Hundreds of thousands of G.I.'s fought for their families, \nsustained by the love they were getting from home. Victory was never \nwon alone.\n  The House of Heroes program relies on people who volunteer their \nservices to repair and improve the home of a veteran and/or their \nspouse as an act of appreciation from the Congress of the United States \nand people of this nation. I am especially proud of those who \ncontributed their time, effort and energy to help bring this project to \nfruition. It was especially uplifting to have witnessed the hard work \nthat was put into the project. I would like to express my gratitude to \neach and every volunteer who made this worthy event the great success \nthat it was.\n  I strongly support H. Con. Res. 395 that expresses the sense of the \nCongress that the House of Heroes project in Columbus, Georgia, should \nserve as a model for public support for the Nation's veterans and \nstrongly agree with everything this resolution represents. I especially \nthank Representative Mac Collins for introducing this worthy \nlegislation.\n  Today, Columbus, Georgia, remains home to thousands of service \nmembers and their families stationed at Ft. Benning and Columbus has \nalways been a critical area for our nation's defenses, both past and \npresent. The initiation of the House of Heroes program proves that from \nbeginning to end, this remarkable city is home to some remarkable \npeople. This event is only the beginning for the House of Heroes \nprogram as communities across the nation will begin to undertake their \nown House of Heroes programs modeled after the great program that the \nfine people of Columbus started.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10079-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM JAMES BUSHAW\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Captain \nWilliam James Bushaw, who is retiring from the United States Navy after \nnearly 30 years of service. Captain Bushaw leaves behind a legacy of \nversatility and consistency, as he has consistently been successful in \nwhatever area he has been asked to perform.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Michigan, Captain Bushaw \nattended Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. He was \ncommissioned as an ensign May 14, 1971, receiving the award of \nDistinguished Naval Graduate.\n  While on active duty, Captain Bushaw served as the Gunnery Officer \naboard the U.S.S. Joseph Strauss. From January of 1972 until August of \nthat same year he participated in several combat operations in Vietnam, \nincluding Operation Freedom Train, Operation Linebacker and Operation \nNotification Line. During these operations, U.S.S. Joseph Strauss fired \nover 15,000 rounds of ammunition, earning the Navy Unit Citation. \nCaptain Bushaw himself earned the Navy Achievement Medal with Combat V \nand the Combat Action Award.\n  Following active duty Captain Bushaw transferred to the selected \nreserve. As a drilling reservist, he served as Commanding Officer of \nthree Navy reserve units and Executive Officer of two other units. For \nhis efforts, he received a Navy Commendation Medal.\n  Captain Bushaw currently serves as the Emergency Preparedness Liaison \nOfficer to the Governor of the State of Michigan, representing the \nUnited States Navy in all issues of emergency preparedness. He recently \nreceived the State Legion of Merit award from the Adjutant General of \nthe Michigan National Guard.\n  I applaud Captain Bushaw on nearly thirty years of extraordinary \nservice to our Nation. I know that the United States Navy will greatly \nmiss his leadership, as will the many men he has commanded. On behalf \nof the entire United States Senate, I thank Captain William James \nBushaw for his service, and wish him the best of luck in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10079-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10079-S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS BROWN\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat Mainer and one of the most outstanding individuals I have had the \ngood fortune to know, Francis Brown of Calais, ME.\n  There are many rewarding aspects to public service, not the least of \nwhich is the opportunity to meet people like Francis Brown. It has been \nmy privilege to call Francis a friend for more than two decades now, \nand I know the people of Downeast Maine share my high regard and \ndeepest respect for this devoted family man who has given so much of \nhimself to the community and state he loves.\n  Francis is a leading citizen of Calais. He exemplifies the kind of \nvalues and ideals we frequently associate with those small towns \nthroughout the country where neighbors still help neighbors, and where \nservice to others is the standard by which a man or woman is measured. \nIndeed, for Francis, the concept of service is one indelibly woven \nthrough the fabric of his life.\n  As a student at the University of Maine, my alma mater, Francis spent \nfour years in the ROTC program, and went on to serve in World War Two \nas a Radar Officer and in Korea as a member of the military police. \nHaving more than fulfilled his duty to his country, Francis \nnevertheless later volunteered as an Army reservist with the Maine Army \nNational Guard from 1946 until 1967, when he retired with the rank of \nMajor.\n\n  When he was not serving his country in the armed forces, Francis was \nworking on behalf of his fellow Mainers not only in his law practice \nbut as a longtime and well-respected city solicitor. As is typical of \nhis nature, however, Francis was not content to allow his efforts in \nthe practice of law alone--significant as they were--define his \ncommitment to the community.\n  Giving generously of his time and talents, Francis has touched many \nlives and has made an indelible and positive mark on his beloved \nWashington County and the State of Maine. He was a member of the \nAdvisory Committee to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Criminal \nRules of procedure for thirteen years. A long-time active and integral \nmember of the Calais Rotary Club, he earned distinction as a Paul \nHarris Fellow in 1976.\n  Emblematic of his commitment to and interest in education, Francis \nbrought his tremendous wealth of knowledge and experience to his \nservice on the University of Maine Board of Trustees for more than a \ndecade. And\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nas a man whose faith has always been central to his life, he has served \nhis beloved United Methodist Church in Calais as a trustee for many \nyears.\n  Not surprisingly, Francis has been recognized with many awards over \nthe years, including the Arlo T. Bates Award for Outstanding Community \nService from the Calais Chamber of Commerce, the prestigious Jefferson \nPublic Service Award, and the University of Maine Presidential \nAchievement Award.\n  And just as predictably, Francis has never been very impressed by all \nthe recognition and adulation. For him, good deeds are always to be \ndone for their own sake. Acts of kindness are made because that is \nsimply the proper way to live one's life, not because they may bring \npersonal glorification. Indeed, Francis is one of the most genuinely \ndecent and humble people I have known.\n  Most of all, he is quite simply a wonderful person to be around. I \nwould dare say there was never a person who has met Francis who does \nnot like Francis. His generous spirit could warm even the coldest Maine \nday, and his humor could shine good cheer into the darkest of times. \nHow thankful we are for such gifts as those he has so selflessly given \nto us.\n  Today, it is our turn to return the favor. With Francis having fallen \nill in recent times, the hearts of many go out to him as do our \nprayers. It is not likely that any of us will be able to fully repay \nthe debt of gratitude we feel to this beloved friend, neighbor, and \nfellow Mainer. But we certainly feel compelled to try.\n  The great American author Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ``to know \neven one life has breathed easier because you have lived--this is to \nhave succeeded.'' By that measure, Francis Brown is unquestionably one \nof the most successful people I know, and I want him to know that I am \nproud to call him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10080-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 150TH BIRTHDAY OF ST. CLEMENT CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CENTER LINE, \n                                MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize St. \nClement Catholic Church in Center Line, Michigan, which will celebrate \n150 years of service to the Warren and Center Line communities with an \nanniversary mass on October 15, 2000. The story of St. Clement is one \nof continual adaptation and growth, but through it all the spirit that \nexisted in 1850 remains today, for the church has never stayed from its \noriginal purpose of teaching the timeless lessons of faith and love.\n  The perfect illustration of how important St. Clement is to the \nWarren and Center Line communities can be seen in how many times it has \nbeen forced to be reconstructed. In 1857, a school was added to the \nchurch. After expansions to the original building in 1868 and 1879, the \ngrowing size of the congregation forced a new building to be \nconstructed in 1880. In 1922, a new school had to be built to \naccommodate the growing number of students, and, ultimately, another \nschool was constructed anew in 1953. In May of 1960, ground broke on \nthe present church building. It is an extraordinary piece of \narchitecture, a Cruciform-shaped structure with a 65 foot high vaulted \nceiling, gables that form a cross, hundreds of stain-glassed panes, a \nmain altar of imported marble, a seating capacity of over 1,600 \nworshippers and two cry rooms.\n  An essential part of the success of St. Clement Church has been its \nleadership. From 1868-1890, Father William Hendrix guided the growing \nchurch to the point where it had firmly established its presence as the \ncenter of social activity in the Warren and Center Line communities. \nFrom 1890-1929, Father John Kramer's devotion to improving education \nwas essential not only to having the new school be built, but also to \nfilling it with nearly 400 students. Father Alexander Mayer guided the \nparish through the Depression, World War II and the Korean War, and his \nleadership enabled the church to make it through years of financial \nhardship.\n  Father Timothy Edward Murray oversaw the building of the third St. \nClement Church, as well as set up a program where St. Clement Schools \nbecame involved in a shared-time program with Center Line Public \nSchools. In 1976, Father James Murphy returned a warmth and camaderie \nto the parish. From 1992-97, the Rev. Dr. Arthur J. Jacobi, Jr.'s many \nskills both as an educator and as a professional businessman helped to \nlead St. Clement both spiritually and financially. And today, Father \nRon Victor continues in this strong tradition of leadership, overseeing \nthe growth and adaptation that is a necessary part of any church's \nhistory, while at the same time shepherding his parish on its \ncontinuous mission of faith and love.\n  For 150 years, St. Clement Catholic Church has been an essential part \nof the Warren and Center Line communities. It has been a constant \nsource of leadership within these communities, and has guided them \nthrough both good and bad times. It has also provided thousands of \nchildren with a solid foundation upon which to grow and become \nupstanding members of their own communities. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate St. Clement Catholic Church on 150 \nsuccessful years of leadership and growth, and wish the church \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10080-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OLYMPIC SWIMMER B.J. BEDFORD\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nB.J. Bedford, a gold medalist for the 2000 United States Olympic Swim \nTeam and originally from the town of Hanover in my home state of New \nHampshire. B.J. has been a competitive swimmer in national standings \nfor years. She competed in the 1988 Olympic trials when she was just 15 \nyears old. After three Olympic trials and a successful 12 year career \nin domestic competition, B.J.'s hard work has paid off this year as she \nsecured a spot on the U.S. Swim Team for the 2000 Summer Games.\n  B.J.'s participation in the XXVII Olympiad certainly adds to a long \nand illustrious career in swimming. B.J. Bedford has qualified and \ncompeted in four Olympic trials, winning the 100 meter backstroke this \nyear, set an American record in the 50 meter backstroke, and won seven \nU.S. National Titles in the 50, 100 and 200 meter backstroke and two \ngold medals for relays at the 1998 World Championships. On September \n23, 2000, B.J. Bedford became the holder of a new world record. \nSwimming the backstroke leg of the 4 x 100 meter medley relay, B.J. and \nthree of her teammates won gold in Sydney and smashed the previously \nheld world record by an incredible three seconds.\n  Her outstanding work in the pool, along with her display of \ndedication to her sport and her country, have helped to make the U.S. \nSwim Team more successful than any other country at the Sydney Games. \nThe United States won 33 medals in swimming, tying its highest total \nsince 1984. B.J. Bedford was an important part of this overall team \nvictory, as her experience undoubtedly made her a leader in the pool. \nB.J.'s athleticism, drive and determination have allowed her to claim \nher place in history. She has made both New Hampshire and the country \nproud, and I am confident that B.J. will be successful in all that she \nchooses to do.\n  I would like to congratulate B.J. for her fine work at the Olympics, \nfor the excitement that she brought to Americans this summer, and for \nher gracious representation of the United States. She is a positive \nrole model that will be looked up to by younger swimmers, and for that, \nshe should be proud. We wish her nothing but the best in all of her \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10080-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10080-S10081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IN RECOGNITION OF CORE CITY NEIGHBORHOODS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Core \nCity Neighborhoods of Detroit, Michigan, which will hold its 16th \nAnnual Meeting and Dinner on October 12, 2000. In its sixteen years, \nCore City Neighborhoods has been a leader in the field of community \ndevelopment, serving and supporting the residents and small businesses \nof Southwest Detroit in an exemplary manner.\n  The mission of Core City Neighborhoods is to strengthen the social \nand human development of the Southwest Detroit community while at the \nsame time helping to spur the physical and economic development of the \narea. The organization does this through a variety of programs, \nfocusing on such\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\nthings as youth and adult leadership to training and employment.\n  One of the most successful Core City Neighborhoods program has been \nan after school program for children aged 6-13. The program seeks to \nstrengthen academic and life skills, such as substance abuse and \nviolence prevention, as well as provide a safe and positive environment \nfor the youth involved. The program also provides children with \ntutoring and mentoring. They work on homework together, and play board \ngames and sports in an effort to aid in the development of teamwork \nskills and self confidence.\n  Another program sponsored by CCN is the Multi-Family Apartment \nBuilding Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program. The goal of this \nprogram is to prevent further loss of highly visible apartment \nbuildings, buildings which truly serve as the foundations of the \nSouthwest Detroit community. The program includes counseling. \nHomebuyers Club, Home Repair workshops, loans and referrals on such \ntopics as credit and budgeting.\n  Core City Neighborhoods has also been directly responsible for the \ndevelopment of nearly 200 units of housing, totaling over $12 million \nof reinvestment into the Southeast Detroit community. This includes the \ndevelopment of the Alberta W. King Village Apartments, which were built \nto house low to moderate income families.\n  I applaud the many people involved with Core City Neighborhoods on \nthe extraordinary work they have done on behalf of Southwest Detroit. \nNo group works harder to build up this community, both physically and \nspiritually. On behalf of the entire United States Senate I thank Core \ncity Neighborhoods for fifteen successful years of civic service, and \nwish the organization continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10081-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10081-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:19 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2941.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to a proposed mitigation policy for \n     portions of the Lake Michigan shoreline; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 209\n\n       Whereas, The United States Army Corps of Engineers, through \n     its Detroit district office, has issued a proposed erosion \n     mitigation policy for shore protection projects along the \n     eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan's Lower Peninsula. This \n     proposed policy is designed to minimize damage to the \n     delicate ecology of the shore by structures constructed to \n     save property threatened by erosion. The corps is seeking \n     public comment until September 29, 2000; and\n       Whereas, The policy proposed provides for a series of \n     requirements and reviews to safeguard the shoreline from \n     damage that may occur at locations that can be some distance \n     from any retaining wall or other project. A variety of permit \n     options are presented; and\n       Whereas, There are many aspects of the proposed policy that \n     have generated concern. One of the key problem areas is the \n     possibility that the Corps of Engineers may be impinging upon \n     the rights of private property owners to take reasonable \n     steps to protect their property. Requirements for private \n     property owners who follow regulations in constructing \n     protective seawalls to bear all of the costs of beach \n     nourishment can be a major obstacle for a property owner \n     protecting his or her property; and\n       Whereas, In any discussion of the erosion mitigation \n     policy, it is essential to determine the authority for the \n     establishment of policies and for the enforcement of them. \n     The line between congressional responsibility and the Army's \n     responsibility must be understood for both clarity and \n     consistency. This will also contribute to public support for \n     shore protection practices; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers to hold public hearings on its proposed \n     erosion mitigation policy for portions of the Lake Michigan \n     shoreline (file number 00-900-001-0); and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Detroit District of the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10082-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10082-S10083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, without amendment:\n        S. 1688: A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United \n     States Code, relating to the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program, to enable the Federal Government to enroll \n     an employee and the family of the employee in\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n     the program when a State court orders the employee to provide \n     health insurance coverage for a child of the employee, but \n     the employee fails to provide the coverage, and for other \n     purposes (Rept.

A bill to conduct a demonstration program to show that \nphysician shortage, recruitment, and retention problems may be \nameliorated in rural states by developing a comprehensive program that \nwill result in statewide physician population growth; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n rural states physician recruitment and retention demonstration act of \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico to introduce legislation that is intended \naddress a significant problem facing some rural states today--a serious \nshortage of physicians. The bills we are introducing are intended to \ndemonstrate that physician shortages, and recruitment and retention \nproblems can be ameliorated in some rural states by a multifaceted \napproach, including providing incentives for physicians in training to \npractice in areas where they are most likely to be needed.\n  The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) has for some time \nheld the position that the U.S., in the aggregate, has enough, if not \ntoo many, physicians. However, COGME's most recent report, published in \nMarch 1999, documented that almost half of the counties in our country \nare designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas--a remarkable \nfinding, given almost three decades of Federal government efforts to \naddress the geographic maldistribution of physicians.\n  In our State of New Mexico we have physician shortages that are \nworsening, with certain types of speciality physicians being in the \nshortest supply. According to 1998 data from the American Medical \nAssociation, New Mexico is 20 percent below the U.S. national average \nof 224 patient care physicians per 100,000 persons. In 15 New Mexico \ncounties, there is no more than 1 physician or less per 1000 \npopulation, and 1 New Mexico county has no physician at all to care for \nits population.\n  And, Mr. President, New Mexico is not alone. Other rural states are \nalso suffering.\n  A recent Health Care Finance Administration report showed that there \nhas been a decline over the past 5 years in certain types of specialty \nphysicians either practicing medicine or participating in the Medicare \nprogram in many rural states. The worst loss for New Mexico has \noccurred in thoracic surgery with a 35 percent decline. Several other \nspecialities, such as urology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry, are not \nthat far behind.\n  The only significant physician growth that can be seen is in primary \ncare and that's still not adequate. With losses occurring in certain \nphysician specialties, problems for all physicians' practices are \ncontinuing to worsen--they can't refer patients to specialists without \ngreat difficulty. For example, in New Mexico, there have been accounts \nof patients being referred to ear, nose and throat doctors having to \nwait up to 9 months for a non-emergency consultation. Without a timely \nin-state consultation, the patient's primary care physician may have to \nrefer the patient to an out of state speciality physician for care. \nThis is frustrating for the physician, and costly and time consuming \nfor the patient.\n\n  As many of you know, New Mexico is one of the nation's poorest \nstates, with a large uninsured population. In 1998, it ranked 48th in \nthe amount of personal income per capita. For many physicians, this \nmeans they may never get paid for much of the work they do.\n  The physician shortage is becoming so severe in our state that last \nyear the New Mexico Medical Society conducted a survey of our \nphysicians to try to find out about how doctors are faring in the \nstate. The response from New Mexico physicians was shocking--42 percent \nof the physicians surveyed said that they are seriously or somewhat \nseriously considering leaving their medical practice, and 40 percent \nsaid that reimbursement rates are a significant problem. Comments \noffered by physicians in this survey were very clear--``I make a good \nincome, but to do that I have to work 65-70 hours a week, in, and week \nout. The reimbursement rates are such that I could move to a lot of \nnice places and maintain my income and work three-quarters as much. \nFamily life is important.''\n  Almost weekly, New Mexico newspapers report about problems caused by \nprovider shortages. On September 7th, the Albuquerque Journal carried a \nstory about a women who had fallen, bruised her spinal cord, and \nrapidly developed paralysis of both hands and arms. She had to wait 18 \nhours to be seen on an emergency basis because of a critical shortage \nof neurosurgeons in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city. Stories \nlike this one are becoming more and more common. There are many \naccounts of New Mexicans having to wait up to 9 months for an \nappointment to be seen by a specialist, and of newborns having to be \ntransported out of state because the neonatal intensive care unit does \nnot have adequate physician coverage.\n  My offices in Washington, DC, and New Mexico are constantly receiving \nletters and phone calls, and visits from constituents who want to tell \nus about physician shortages, physicians leaving the State of New \nMexico, and the loss of their individual providers. They can't \nunderstand why this happening in a country with the greatest healthcare \nsystem in the world.\n  All of these problems clearly show that New Mexico's health care \nsystem\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nhas broken down. However, it is not only New Mexico that is \nexperiencing these problems. Other rural states are experiencing \nsimilar problems--they have become states that are being avoided by \nphysicians entering practice. With the population in these states \ncontinuing to grow, the problem just gets worse. If this situation is \nnot addressed right now, it will result in a complete breakdown of an \nalready fragile health care delivery system.\n  This is why we are each introducing this package of legislation \ntoday. These two bills, the ``Rural States Physician Recruitment and \nRetention Demonstration Act of 2000, will together, when enacted, \ndemonstrate that physician shortages and recruitment and retention \nproblems can be ameliorated in rural states by instituting a \ncomprehensive plan that provides for a proper physician speciality mix \nthat will address the needs of a rural state's population.\n  My legislation will require the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services to establish a demonstration program that will:\n  Target up to a 15 percent increase in physician residency slots \nidentified to be in short supply in demonstration states. These \nexpanded residency slots would carry with them a legally binding \ncommitment to practice in the demonstration state on a year of training \nfor year of service basis.\n  Establish a loan repayment program to provide incentives for \nphysicians in identified shortage specialities to locate their \npractices in demonstration states. This program will help physicians \nrepay their educational loans on a year of service for a year of loan \nrepayment basis in return for a commitment to practice in the \ndemonstration state.\n  Develop a demonstration state health professional data base to \ncapture and track the practice characteristics and distribution of \nlicensed health care providers. This data will be used to develop a \nbaseline and track changes in a demonstration state's health \nprofessions workforce, target this demonstration program to identified \nphysician specialities and determine a state's need for other types of \nsupportive health professionals.\n  Provide for an evaluation of each element of our comprehensive \ndemonstration by the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) for \nphysician workforce issues, and by Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n(Medpac) for Medicare reimbursement and Medicare funded graduate \nmedical education positions.\n  As I mentioned earlier, one of the primary reason physicians report \nthey are leaving New Mexico is because reimbursement is too low, \nparticularly when combined with other factors like long work days, \ninability to recruit speciality physicians, and provide comprehensive \npatient care in a reasonable period of time.\n  That's why the second part of this package, the Physician Recruitment \nand Retention Act of 2000, consists of legislation that will provide \nphysicians that are practicing in demonstration states with a special 5 \npercent Medicare part B reimbursement rate increase. This increase will \nprovide a financial incentive to physicians to continue to practice in \nthe underserved states and also to continue to participate in the \nMedicare program.\n  Both Senator Domenici and I anticipate that by the end of this \ndemonstration program, physician shortages, particularly in specific \nphysician specialities, will be greatly diminished or even have \ndisappeared.\n  Mr. President, the health care system in New Mexico is near collapse \nfor reasons too numerous and complex to get into here. These bills we \nare introducing today, in combination with the fixes we are making to \nthe problems resulting from the BBA of 1997, may stave off disaster for \na while.

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish minimum nursing staff levels for nursing facilities, to \nprovide for grants to improve the quality of care furnished in nursing \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               NURSING HOME STAFF IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the support of \nSenator Breaux in introducing The Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act of \n2000. This is an important piece of legislation for the 1.6 million \nfrail elderly Americans who reside in nursing homes across the nation.\n  A recently released and long overdue report from the Health Care \nFinancing\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\nAdministration was the immediate impetus for our bill. This report was \nfirst mandated by Congress in 1990. It took the Department of Health \nand Human Services 10 years to complete Part I of the report. It will \ntake almost another year to finish it. The first part of the study \ndocumented, to just about everyone's satisfaction, severe staffing \nshortages, severe staffing shortages in our nation's nursing homes. \nWhile we are waiting for the agency to complete the second and final \npart of the report, Senate Breaux and I want to begin to address the \nstaffing crisis in long-term care. Therefore, we are introducing this \nlegislation today.\n  We have a long way to go in meeting the staffing needs of elderly \nnursing home residents. The bill we are introducing today is not the \nanswer to the problem. It is only a first step. Yet, it is an extremely \nimportant step that Congress should take.\n  Before describing the bill Senator Breaux and I are introducing \ntoday, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to go over the history of \nour committee's work on nursing home quality of care and HCFA oversight \nof the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. It's important for me to \nemphasize the scope and depth of the problem in order to give my fellow \nSenators an appreciation of the context out of which this legislation \ndeveloped.\n  In the fall of 1997, serious allegations were brought to my attention \nabout the quality of care provided in California nursing homes. These \nallegations claimed that thousands of California nursing home residents \nhad suffered and met with untimely and unnecessary deaths due to \nmalnutrition, dehydration, decubitus ulcers, and urinary tract \ninfections.\n  In an effort to respond to these allegations, I asked the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] to conduct a thorough review of them and, more \ngenerally, of the quality of care in California nursing homes.\n  This review culminated in a 2-day hearing held on July 27-28, 1998, \nentitled ``Betrayal: The Quality of Care in California Nursing Homes.'' \nAt this hearing, the GAO released its report titled ``California \nNursing Homes: Care Problems Persist Despite Federal and State \nOversight.'' The findings of this report were explosive and disturbing, \nillustrating that residents in far too many California nursing homes \nwere threatened by seriously substandard care.\n  One week prior to this hearing, the Clinton administration announced \na broad set of new nursing home initiatives to improve enforcement of \nthe Nursing Home Reform Act and, hence, the quality of care in nursing \nfacilities. The administration was acting in response to the impending \nrelease of the GAO's study before the scheduled Aging Committee \nhearing. It acted also in response to a congressionally mandated report \nby the Department of Health and Human Services on nursing home \noversight that was completed just before the hearing. The Department's \nreport uncovered weaknesses on the part of the federal government in \nits oversight of nursing home quality of care. As the Federal agency \nwith regulatory oversight responsibility over our Nation's nursing \nhomes, the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] is responsible \nfor monitoring the compliance of nursing home facilities in meeting the \nrequirements of the Nursing Home Reform Act. For facilities found to be \nnoncompliant, HCFA is responsible for seeing that remedies or sanctions \nare imposed until the situation is corrected. The administration's \nreport found shortcomings in HCFA's enforcement of the Nursing Home \nReform Act of 1987. The agency's report was really a kind of self-\nindictment. Up to that point, the agency had failed in its \nresponsibility to protect nursing home residents.\n\n  As part of its multistep initiative, the administration called for \nimprovements in nursing home inspections, better and more timely \nenforcement against nursing homes that repeatedly violate safety rules, \nand more attention to quality of care for nursing home residents \nthrough prevention of bed sores, malnutrition and dehydration. HCFA was \ngiven the responsibility for carrying out this initiative. Under my \nchairmanship, the Senate Special Committee on Aging has taken an active \nrole in overseeing the implementation of the President's nursing home \ninitiative led by the Administrator of HCFA. At regular hearings and \nforums, 10 to be specific, I have heard from family members, health \ncare professionals and other long-term care experts about the progress \nand obstacles in achieving improved nursing home quality of care.\n  Anecdotally, we have heard from the very beginning of our work on \nnursing home quality of care that understaffing is a root cause of many \nof the problems facing nursing home residents. Because we desperately \nneeded a more systematic, research-based analysis of this understaffing \nproblem, I had persistently urged HCFA to finish the long delayed \nstaffing report I mentioned earlier.\n  On July 27, 2000, Part I of the report, entitled ``Appropriateness of \nMinimum Staffing Ratios in Nursing Homes'' was done, and our committee \nheld a hearing to take testimony on it. The report and the hearing \npresented groundbreaking new information on nursing facility staffing. \nIt was the first time that understaffing, and the consequences of \nunderstaffing, were described by a scientifically sound government \nreport. Although a Part II of the report will be required to completely \nvalidate the findings of Part I and to analyze a number of other \nquestions raised by Part I, the report showed for the first time what \nfamily members and resident advocates had been saying for years: that \nthe majority of nursing homes in our country are dramatically \nunderstaffed. Specifically, the report concluded that more than half of \nnursing facilities around the country employ too few nurses and nurse \naides to provide adequate care to residents.\n  As a result of these report findings, I began working on legislation \nto address the serious problems of understaffing. I started by seeking \ninput from interested parties, including the Administration, nursing \nhome providers, health care professionals, and resident advocates. I \nfinalized my proposal right around the same time the President \nannounced the administration's initiative in this area. The two \nproposals are similar in their goal to start addressing the problems of \nunderstaffing in nursing facilities.\n  As I said earlier, the impetus for my bill was the Report to Congress \non the ``Appropriateness of Minimum Nurse Staffing Ratios in Nursing \nHomes''. The major conclusions of the report are outlined in the \nFindings section of our bill. The report found that 2.0 nurse aide \nhours per resident day is a threshold below which residents' lives are \nat risk, not a standard for the provision of appropriate care. The \nfindings also showed that 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day are \nnecessary for a nurse aide to complete core resident care tasks, \nalthough, because of the very conservative estimates used in this part \nof the study, 2.9 hours probably significantly understates the staffing \nlevels necessary for a nurse aide to complete these core tasks. Part I \nof the report also indicated that Part II will analyze and report on \nminimum staffing levels according to a facility's resident acuity \nlevel. I urge Congress and the Administration to be careful in \naccepting either the 2.0 or 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day as a \nminimum goal for nursing facilities until these results are validated \nand case-mix is included in the equation. It is reasonable to expect \nthat staffing requirements will be substantially higher for facilities \nthat have residents with higher acuity.\n  Our bill calls for the completion of phase two of the study. It \nrequires the Secretary to complete the report not later than July 1, \n2001. It adds to the original authority a requirement that the study \nundertake several tasks that Part I of the report stated would be done \nin the second phase. Among other things, these tasks include a \nrequirement that the case mix analysis of Part I of the report be \nfurther refined and related to appropriate minimum staffing levels. It \nalso adds to the original authority a requirement that the report \nanalyze ``optimal minimum'' caregiver to resident levels and ``optimal \nminimum'' supervisor to caregiver levels of skilled nursing facilities \nparticipating in the Medicare program and nursing facilities \nparticipating in the Medicaid program. We modified the original \nauthority in this manner because we believed the public should know not \njust appropriate minimum\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\nstaffing levels, but also what more optimal staffing levels should be \nin nursing facilities.\n  My bill requires that minimum staffing levels be developed and \nenforced within one year of the completion of the Report. It requires \nthe Secretary to make recommendations regarding appropriate minimum \ncaregiver to resident levels and minimum supervisor to caregiver levels \nfor skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program \nand nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program. The \nSecretary further shall require through the administrative rulemaking \nprocess compliance with appropriate minimum staffing levels as a \ncondition for such facilities to receive payment under those programs. \nThe Secretary would be required to promulgate a final rule not later \nthan one year after completion of the report.\n  The bill requires that the Secretary establish appropriate minimum \nstaffing levels because we believed that a regulatory requirement \nshould establish those staffing levels that will assure that residents \nreceive the quality of care they have a right to receive under the \nterms of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. We assume that the \nresident case mix of a facility will have an effect on the appropriate \nminimum staffing levels of the facility.\n  In order to help States prepare for the minimum staffing levels that \nthe Secretary will promulgate by July 1, 2002, my bill establishes a \ncompetitive state grant program. The purpose of the grant program will \nbe to improve staffing levels in nursing facilities in order to improve \nthe quality of care to residents of such facilities. A state that \nsecures such a grant may provide technical or financial support to \nnursing facilities, labor organizations, nonprofit organizations, \ncommunity colleges, or other organizations approved by the Secretary. \nSuch support from the state shall be used for projects which will help \nto increase or improve recruitment and retention of direct care nursing \nstaff. Projects supported by a state must be consistent with the \nrequirements of sections 1818 and 1919 of the Social Security Act. No \nfunds may be made available to county or state-owned nursing \nfacilities. Funds used under a grant to a state may only be used to \nsupplement, not supplant, other funds that the state extends to carry \nout the activities that may be supported by this grant program. The \nSecretary shall evaluate this grant program and report to the Congress \non her findings not later than six months after completion of the grant \nprogram. Authorized to be appropriated are $500,000,000 for each of \nfiscal years 2001 and 2002.\n\n  My bill includes a requirement for reporting of accurate information \non staffing. Skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare \nprogram and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program \nwould be required to submit staffing information to the Secretary in a \nform and manner determined by the Secretary. Such information must be \nattested to as accurate by the reporting facility. The Secretary shall \nperiodically post and update such information on the Nursing Home \nCompare web site. Skilled nursing facilities participating in the \nMedicare program and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid \nprogram shall submit to the Secretary a classification of all residents \nof the facility according to the resident classification system \nrequired under current law. My understanding is that nursing facilities \nshould have data on hand and in a form that would be required by the \nSecretary for reporting to the Department, and, thus, the \nadministrative burden of this requirement should be minimal.\n  My bill includes a requirement for posting of facility staffing \ninformation. Facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid \nprogram would be required to post daily for each nursing unit and each \nwork shift the current number of licensed and unlicensed nursing staff \ndirectly responsible for resident care together with the number of \nresidents per unit and shift.\n  Throughout my work and oversight activity of nursing facility quality \nof care, I have made it a point to stress that there are many good \nnursing facilities. When a family is in need of a facility for a loved \none, it is critically important that individuals shop around and gather \ninformation in order to find the best nursing home to meet the needs of \ntheir loved ones. The provision in my bill calling for additional \nreporting of staffing and facility posting of staffing data will help \nfamilies which need to find a good facility for a loved one's \nplacement. It should also eventually have an effect on the overall \nquality of care in nursing facilities as families search out and choose \nbetter facilities.\n  The information collected by HCFA will help it improve and maintain \nits Nursing Home Compare web site. This is a database which contains \ninformation on every Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing home in \nthe country. You can locate nursing homes in your area and find \ninformation about compliance with Medicare and Medicaid regulations \nbased on the facility's most recent survey by state inspectors. \nAdditionally, the web site contains useful phone numbers for survey \nagencies and long term care ombudsmen on the web site's ``Phone \nDirectory'' page.\n  In closing, I plan to continue my work to improve quality of care and \nquality of life for nursing home residents. In my position as Chairman \nof the Special Committee on Aging, I will continue to monitor the \nquality of care provided to our nation's nursing home residents. With \nthe assistance of the GAO, I will continually assess and monitor the \nHealth Care Financing Administration's progress and commitment to \nimproving the quality of care in nursing homes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today as ranking member of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging and am proud to inform you that after the \nculmination of years of investigation and attention to the relationship \nbetween nursing home staff levels and quality of care, today Senator \nGrassley--my colleague on the Committee--and I are introducing \nlegislation on this important issue. Our ``Nursing Facility Staff \nImprovement Act of 2000'' would encourage increased quantities of staff \nbut also would improve the quality of those caring for our loved ones \nin nursing homes.\n  Chairman Grassley and I have been committed to ensuring that our \nseniors are getting the best quality care possible in our nation's \nnursing homes, and the Aging Committee has held numerous hearings \nregarding the best way to reach this goal. We have been working with \nHCFA to determine the best way to ensure state surveyors are \nappropriately monitoring the quality of care their residents receive. \nAdditionally, we held a hearing to learn from industry representatives \nabout the links between nursing home bankruptcies and quality care. And \nwe have continually and consistently sent the message that we will \nremain involved and committed to improvement for as long as it takes.\n  The bill we introduce today--the Nursing Facility Staff Improvement \nAct of 2000--is the result of bipartisan efforts to put something on \nthe books that will not only provide real incentives for nursing home \nstaff to strive to do their jobs well but will also be a huge step \ntoward defining what optional nursing home care should entail. I \ncommend President Clinton for building on the Aging Committee's \nfindings and making this very important issue one of his priorities.\n  More specifically, this bill will:\n  Call for the Secretary of HHS to establish a competitive grant \nprogram to the states to increase or improve the recruitment and \nretention of direct care nursing staff. Provide for $1 billion over two \nyears. Require that HCFA complete Phase II of their Nursing Home \nStaffing study and report back not later than July 1, 2001. Appropriate \nuse of grant monies would include: establishing career ladders for \nnurse aides; improving nursing management; providing additional \ntraining programs for staff.\n  In conclusion, it is exciting for me to put forth a piece of \nlegislation that offers tangible incentives to current and future staff \nand also directly encourages appropriate nursing home care for our \nloved ones. This effort has truly been one of joint cooperation between \nmy Republican colleague on the Aging Committee and myself and I am \nproud to introduce it to you today.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Iowa, \nthe Chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Aging, to introduce \nlegislation that we hope will begin to address an immediate and \ncritical labor\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\nshortage facing nursing home facilities across the nation as well as \nthe long term objective of establishing nursing home staffing \nthresholds.\n  In late July, the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, \nreleased the first phase of its long awaited report on the feasibility \nand appropriateness of minimum nursing home staffing ratios. The \ninitial phase of this report explored the relationship between staffing \nlevels and quality of care. The HCFA study found a strong correlation \nbetween certain staffing thresholds and the quality of care provided to \nnursing home residents. The report also found that nursing homes are \nhaving great difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff to \nwork in their facilities. Clearly, we can and should be doing more to \nensure that the care of our elderly and disabled is not being placed at \nrisk.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island, we have been dealing with a \ncritical shortage in the number of Certified Nursing Assistants, CNAs, \nin particular. CNAs provide direct care in a skilled nursing setting to \nresidents who need help with essential daily living tasks, such as \ndressing, feeding and bathing. A state task force comprised of long \nterm care providers and nursing home consumer advocates found that over \n26,000 individuals were licensed as CNAs, but only 14,000 are currently \nworking in the field. The task force also found that the turnover rate \nfor CNAs rose to an unprecedented 82.6 percent in 1999.\n  The two most important issues identified in the state report were \nwages and adequate staffing levels. In terms of wages, a person in my \nstate can make more in starting salary as a hotel maid in Providence \n($9.50/hour) than they would as a licensed CNA ($7.69/hour). Those \nindividuals who have dedicated their careers to caring for our most \nvulnerable citizens certainly deserve better and the legislation we are \nintroducing today will help to restore respect and dignity to the \ncaregiver profession.\n  The Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act will address these problems in \nessentially two ways. First, the legislation requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to complete the second phase of the nursing \nhome staffing report by July 2001. The Secretary will then be called \nupon to use the findings and recommendations of the final report to \ndevelop appropriate caregiver to resident and supervisor to caregiver \nratios for nursing facilities that participate in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. The second major component of the bill is the \nestablishment of a grant program to States for the purpose of \naugmenting staffing levels. This provision, which is based on a \ninitiative announced by President Clinton in mid-September, will \nsupport projects aimed at improving the recruitment and retention of \ndirect nursing staff. The bill also requires nursing homes to post, on \na daily basis, the number of staff and residents at the facility as \nwell as submit staffing information to the Secretary.\n  As a member of the Special Senate Committee on Aging, I am pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor of the Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act, a \nbalanced piece of legislation that I believe will go a long way in \nstabilizing nursing home staffing levels nationwide. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Grassley and my other colleagues to enact this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 3179. A bill to promote recreation on Federal lakes, to require \nFederal agencies responsible for managing Federal lakes to pursue \nstrategies for enhancing recreational experiences of the public, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      Recreation Lakes Act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Recreation \nLakes Act of 2000--a bill that will recognize the benefits and value of \nrecreation at federal lakes and give recreation a seat at the table in \nthe management decisions of all our federal lakes. I am proud to be \njoined in this effort today by Senator Cleland.\n  Recreation on our federal lakes has become a powerful tourist magnet, \nattracting some 900 million visitors annually and generating an \nestimated $44 billion in economic activity--mostly spent on privately-\nprovided goods and services. And by the middle of this century, our \nfederal lakes are expected to host nearly two billion visitors per \nyear.\n  Yet, even with the millions of visitors each year to our lakes and \nreservoirs, recreation has suffered from a lack of unifying policy \ndirection and leadership, as well as insufficient interagency and \nintergovernmental planning and coordination. Most federal agencies are \nfocused on the traditional functions of man-made lakes and reservoirs; \nflood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, irrigation, and \nnavigation. And often recreation is left out of the decision process.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will reaffirm that recreation is also \nan authorized purpose at almost all federal lakes and direct the \nagencies managing these projects to take action to reemphasize \nrecreation programs in their management plans. This legislation will \nemphasis partnerships between the federal government, local \ngovernments, and private groups to promote responsible recreation on \nall our federal lakes.\n  It will establish a National Recreational Lakes Demonstration \nProgram, comprised of up to 20 lakes across the nation. At each of \nthese federal lakes, the managing agency will be empowered to develop \ncreative agreements with private sector recreation providers as well as \nstate land agencies to enhance recreation opportunities. Rather than \njust building new federal campgrounds with tax dollars, we need to \ncreate new partnerships to provide support for building recreation \ninfrastructure that is in line with visitor and tourist desires for \nrecreation. The National Recreation Lakes Demonstration Program will be \na pilot project to test these creative agreements and management \ntechniques on a small scale to demonstrate their effectiveness at \npromoting recreation on federal lakes.\n  Second, this legislation will establish a Federal Recreation Lakes \nLeadership Council to coordinate the National Recreation Lakes \nDemonstration Program and coordinate efforts among federal agencies to \npromote recreation on federal lakes.\n  It also will include the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers in the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. The Fee \nDemo Program has had wide successes in Arkansas and across the country \nin allowing individual parks and recreation areas to keep more of their \nfee revenues on-site to reduce the often overwhelming maintenance \nbacklog.\n\n  The legislation will also provide for periodic review of the \nmanagement of recreation at federal water projects--something long \noverdue. A great deal has changed since many of the water projects were \nauthorized, yet the initial legislative direction from over 70 years \nago continues to be the basis for the management practices now in the \nyear 2000--and that is not right.\n  Finally, the legislation will provide new opportunities to link the \nnational recreation lakes initiative with other federal recreation \nassistance efforts, including the Wallop-Breaux program for boating and \nfishing.\n  Mr. President, let me give you a little background on how this \nlegislation was developed. In 1996, the U.S. Senate recognized that \nrecreation was becoming more important on federal lakes and conceived \nthe National Recreation Lakes Study Commission to review the current \nand anticipated demand for recreational opportunities on federally \nmanaged lakes and reservoirs. The National Recreation Lakes Study \nCommission was charged to ``review the current and anticipated demand \nfor recreational opportunities at federally-managed man-made lakes and \nreservoirs'' and ``to develop alternatives for enhanced recreational \nuse of such facilities.''\n  The Commission released its long-awaited report confirming the impact \nof recreation on federally-managed, man-made lakes in June of last \nyear. The Commission also recognized that we are far from realizing \ntheir full potential. The study documented that these lakes are \npowerful tourist magnets, attracting some 900 million visitors annually \nand generating an estimated $44 billion in economic activity--mostly \nspent on privately-provided goods and services.\n  During the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's hearing last year\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\non the Recreation Lakes Study, the Chairman and I spent some time \ndiscussing how children today do not take full advantage of the outdoor \nopportunities that are available to them. It is so important that we \nencourage our children to enjoy the great outdoors that often times is \nless than an hour's drive away.\n  As the mother of twin 4-year-old boys, I feel we need to encourage \nour children to be children, not to become adults too quickly, to learn \nhow to enjoy the outdoors. The only way we can do that is by exposing \nthem to it early and often.\n  In this nation we have nearly 1,800 federally-managed lakes and \nreservoirs. There are 38 in my home state of Arkansas. With so many \nfederal lakes spread throughout the country, there's no reason why we \nshouldn't do all we can to promote recreation on our federal lakes. I \nknow that in Arkansas, we don't think twice about getting away to the \nlake for the weekend to go boating or fishing, or to just get away from \nthe day-to-day grind. And that doesn't even begin to get into the \ntremendous economic impact from recreation on our federal lakes.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not an attempt to completely rewrite how \nfederal lakes in this country are managed or to put recreation in front \nof all other authorized purposes at federal lakes.\n  The Recreation Lakes Act of 2000 will work with all current laws and \nregulations to ensure that recreation is merely given a seat at the \ntable when the management decisions are made for our federal lakes.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. In everything from the creation \nof jobs to the money that tourists like myself spend at the marinas and \nlocal stores surrounding the lake--our Federal lakes and reservoirs \nhave an immense recreational value that can and does bring revenues \ninto our local economies. The best way to encourage and expand this \naspect is to ensure that recreation is given a higher priority in the \nmanagement of our federal lakes.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and look \nforward to the debate on how we can promote recreation on our federal \nlakes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 3180. A bill to provide for the disclosure of the collection of \ninformation through computer software, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10089-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10089-S10091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE SPYWARE CONTROL AND PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, how would you feel if someone was \neavesdropping on your private phone conversations without your \nknowledge? Well, if it happened to me, I would be very disturbed. And I \nthink that most Americans would be very disturbed to know that \nsomething similar may be happening every time they use their computers.\n  The shocking fact is that many software programs contain something \ncalled spyware. Spyware is computer code that surreptitiously uses our \nInternet connection to transmit information about things like our \npurchasing patterns and our health and financial status. This \ninformation is collected without our knowledge or explicit permission \nand the spyware programs run undetected while you surf the Internet.\n  Spyware has been found in Quicken software, which is manufactured by \nIntuit, Inc. So let me use this as an example. Imagine you purchase \nQuicken software or download it from the Internet. You install it on \nyour computer to help you with your finances. However, unbeknownst to \nyou, Quicken does more than install financial planning tools on your \ncomputer. It also installs a little piece of spyware. The spyware lies \ndormant until one day when you get on the Internet.\n  As you start surfing the Internet, the spyware sends back information \nto Intuit about what you buy and what you are interested in. And all of \nthis happens without your knowledge. You could be on Amazon.com or \nresearching health issues and at the very same time Intuit spyware is \nusing your Internet connection, transmitting some of your most private \ndata to someone you never heard of.\n  In the months since it was reported that Quicken contained spyware, \nthe folks at Intuit may have decided to remove the spyware from \nQuicken. However, Quicken is not the only software program that may \ncontain spyware. One computer expert recently found spyware programs in \npopular children's software that is designed to help them learn, such \nas Mattel Interactive's Reader Rabbit and Arthur's Thinking Games. And, \naccording to another expert's assessment, spyware is present in four \nhundred software programs, including commonly used software such as \nRealNetworks RealDownload, Netscape/AOL Smart Download, and NetZip \nDownload Demon. Spyware in these software programs can transmit \ninformation about every file you download from the Internet.\n  I rise today to introduce the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection \nAct of 2000. I believe that this legislation will help Americans regain \nsome control over their personal information and will help stop the \nloss of their privacy and the privacy of their families.\n  My proposal is common-sense and simple. It incorporates all four fair \ninformation practices of notice, choice, access and security--practices \nthat I believe are essential to effective computer privacy legislation.\n  First, the Act requires that any software that contains spyware must \nprovide consumers with clear and conspicuous notice--at the time the \nsoftware is installed--that the software contains spyware. The notice \nmust also describe the information that the spyware will collect and \nindicate to whom it will be transmitted.\n  Another critical provision of my bill requires that software users \nmust first give their affirmative consent before the spyware is enabled \nand allowed to start obtaining and sharing users' personal information \nwith third parties. In other words, software users must ``opt-in'' to \nthe collection and transmission of their information. My bill gives \nsoftware users a choice whether they will allow the spyware to collect \nand share their information.\n  The Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act allows for some \ncommon-sense exceptions to the notice and opt-in requirements. Under my \nproposal, software users would not have to receive notice and give \ntheir permission to enable the spyware if the software user's \ninformation is gathered in order to provide technical support for use \nof the software. In addition, users' information may be collected if it \nis necessary to determine if they are licensed users of the software. \nAnd finally, the legislation would not apply to situations where \nemployers are using spyware to monitor Internet usage by their \nemployees. I believe that this last issue is a serious one and deserves \nto be addressed in separate legislation.\n  Another important aspect of the Spyware Control and Privacy \nProtection Act is that it would incorporate the fair information \npractice known as ``access.'' What this means is that an individual \nsoftware user would have the ability to find out what information has \nbeen collected about them, and would be given a reasonable chance to \ncorrect any errors.\n  And finally, the fourth fair information practice guaranteed by my \nbill is ``security.'' Anyone that uses spyware to collect information \nabout software users must establish procedures to keep that information \nconfidential and safe from hackers.\n  Spyware is a modern day Trojan horse. You install software on your \ncomputer thinking it's designed to help you, and it turns out that \nsomething else is hidden inside that may be quite harmful.\n\n  I have been closely following the privacy debate for some time now. \nAnd I am struck by how often I discover new ways in which our privacy \nis being eroded. Spyware is among the more startling examples of how \nthis erosion is occurring.\n  Most people would agree that modern technology has been \nextraordinarily beneficial. It has enabled us to obtain information \nmore quickly and easily than ever before. And companies have \nstreamlined their processes for providing goods and services.\n  But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They \nhave made it easier to track personal information such as medical and \nfinancial records, and buying habits. In\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nturn, our ability to keep our personal information private is being \neroded.\n  Even sophisticated computer software users are unlikely to be aware \nthat information is being collected about their Internet surfing habits \nand is likely being fed into a growing personal profile maintained at a \ndata warehouse. They don't know that companies can and do extract the \ninformation from the warehouse to create a so-called cyber-profile of \nwhat they are likely to buy, what the status of their health may be, \nwhat their family is like, and what their financial situation may be.\n  I believe that in the absence of government regulation, it is \ndifficult, if not impossible for people to control the use of their own \npersonal information. Consumers are not properly informed, and \nbusinesses are under no legal obligation to protect consumers' privacy.\n  I believe that the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act is a \nreasonable way to help Americans regain some of their privacy. My \nlegislation does not prevent software manufacturers from using their \nsoftware to collect a consumer's online information. However, it gives \nback some control to the consumer by allowing him or her to decide \nwhether their information may be gathered.\n  My bill protects consumer privacy, while enabling software companies \nand marketing firms to continue obtaining consumers' information if the \nconsumer so chooses. Confidence in these companies will be enhanced if \nthey are able to assure their customers that they will not collect \ntheir personal information without their permission.\n  Privacy protections should not stop with computer software. I am also \nproud to be a cosponsor of the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, a much-\nneeded measure that would prevent Internet service providers, \nindividual web sites, network advertisers, and other third parties from \ngathering information about our online surfing habits without our \npermission.\n  And last fall, I introduced the Telephone Call Privacy Act in order \nto prevent phone companies from disclosing consumers' private phone \nrecords without their permission. Although there are only a few weeks \nleft in this congressional session, it is my hope that Congress will \npass meaningful privacy legislation soon.\n  Increasingly, technology is impacting our lives and the lives of our \nfamilies. I believe that while it is important to encourage \ntechnological growth, we must also balance new developments with our \nfundamental right to privacy. Otherwise, we may wake up one day and \nrealize that our privacy has been so thoroughly eroded that it is \nimpossible to recover.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Spyware Control and Privacy \nProtection Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spyware Control and Privacy \n     Protection Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

In the case of a State \n     government authority, such a court order shall not issue if \n     prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order \n     pursuant to this paragraph, on a motion made promptly by the \n     computer software provider may quash or modify such order if \n     the information or records requested are unreasonably \n     voluminous in nature or if compliance with such order \n     otherwise would cause an unreasonable burden on the provider.\n       (e) Private Right of Action.--\n       (1) Actions Authorized.--A person may, if otherwise \n     permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in \n     an appropriate Federal court, if such laws or rules prohibit \n     such actions, either or both of the actions as follows:\n       (A) An action based on a violation of subsection (a) or (b) \n     to enjoin such violation.\n       (B) An action to recover actual monetary loss for a \n     violation of subsection (a) or (b) in an amount equal to the \n     greater of--\n       (i) the amount of such actual monetary loss; or\n       (ii) $2,500 for such

Con. Res. 145\n\n       Whereas World War II is the defining event of the twentieth \n     century for the United States and its wartime allies;\n       Whereas in World War II, more than 16,000,000 American men \n     and women served in uniform in the Armed Forces, more than \n     400,000 of them gave their lives, and more than 670,000 of \n     them were wounded;\n       Whereas many millions more on the home front in the United \n     States organized and sacrificed to give unwavering support to \n     those in uniform;\n       Whereas fewer than 6,000,000 World War II veterans are \n     surviving at the end of the twentieth century, and the Nation \n     mourns the passing of more than 1,200 veterans each day;\n       Whereas Congress, in Public Law 103-422 (108 Stat. 4356) \n     enacted in 1994, approved the location of a memorial to this \n     epic era in an area of the National Mall that includes the \n     Rainbow Pool;\n       Whereas since 1995, the National World War II Memorial site \n     and design have been the subject of 19 public hearings that \n     have resulted in an endorsement from the State Historic \n     Preservation Officer of the District of Columbia, three \n     endorsements from the District of Columbia Historic \n     Preservation Review Board, the endorsement of many Members of \n     Congress, and, most significantly, four approvals from the \n     Commission of Fine Arts and four approvals from the National \n     Capital Planning Commission (including the approvals of those \n     Commissions for the final architectural design);\n       Whereas on Veterans Day 1995, the President dedicated the \n     approved site at the Rainbow Pool on the National Mall as the \n     site for the National World War II Memorial; and\n       Whereas fundraising for the National World War II Memorial \n     has been enormously successful, garnering enthusiastic \n     support from half a million individual Americans, hundreds of \n     corporations and foundations, dozens of civic, fraternal, and \n     professional organizations, state legislatures, students in \n     1,100 schools, and more than 450 veterans groups representing \n     11,000,000 veterans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is appropriate for the United States to memorialize \n     in the Nation's Capital the triumph of democracy over tyranny \n     in World War II, the most important event of the twentieth \n     century;\n       (2) the will of the American people to memorialize that \n     triumph and all who labored to achieve it, and the decisions \n     made on that memorialization by the appointed bodies charged \n     by law with protecting the public's interests in the design, \n     location, and construction of memorials on the National Mall \n     in the Nation's Capital, should be fulfilled by the \n     construction of the National World War II Memorial, as \n     designed, at the approved and dedicated Rainbow Pool site on \n     the National Mall; and\n       (3) it is imperative that expeditious action be taken to \n     commence and complete the construction of the National World \n     War II Memorial so that the completed memorial will be \n     dedicated while Americans of the World War II generation are \n     alive to receive the national tribute embodied in that \n     memorial, which they earned with their sacrifice and \n     achievement during the largest and most devastating war the \n     world has known.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10092-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10092-S10095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 146--A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING \n   THE ASSASSINATION OF FATHER JOHN KAISER AND OTHERS IN KENYA, AND \nCALLING FOR A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO BE CONDUCTED IN THOSE CASES, A \nREPORT ON THE PROGRESS MADE IN SUCH AN INVESTIGATION TO BE SUBMITTED TO \n     CONGRESS BY DECEMBER 15, 2000, AND A FINAL REPORT ON SUCH AN \n        INVESTIGATION TO BE MADE PUBLIC, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Grams) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 146\n\n       Whereas Father John Kaiser, a Catholic of the Order of the \n     Mill Hill Missionaries and a native of Minnesota, who for 36 \n     years served as a missionary in the Kisii and Ngong Dioceses \n     in the Republic of Kenya and advocated the rights of all \n     Kenyans, was shot dead on Wednesday, August 23, 2000;\n       Whereas Father Kaiser was a frequently outspoken advocate \n     on issues of human rights and against the injustice of \n     government corruption in Kenya;\n       Whereas fellow priests report that Father Kaiser spoke to \n     them of his fear for his life on the night before his \n     assassination;\n       Whereas the murders of Father Stallone, Father Graife, and \n     Father Luigi Andeni, all of Marsabit Diocese in Kenya, the \n     circumstances of the murder of Brother Larry Timors of Nakaru \n     Diocese in Kenya, the murder of Father Martin Boyle of \n     Eldoret Diocese, and the murders of other local human rights \n     advocates in Kenya have not yet been fully explained, nor \n     have the perpetrators of these murders been brought to \n     justice;\n       Whereas the report of a Kenyan governmental commission, \n     known as the Akiwumi Commission, on the government's \n     investigation into tribal violence between 1992 and 1997 in \n     Kenya's Great Rift Valley has not yet been released in spite \n     of several requests by numerous church leaders and human \n     rights organizations to have the Commission's findings \n     released to the public;\n       Whereas, after Father Kaiser's assassination, documents \n     were found on his body that he had intended to present to the \n     Akiwumi Commission;\n       Whereas the nongovernmental Kenyan Human Rights Commission \n     has expressed fear that the progress achieved in Kenya during \n     the last few years in the struggle for democracy, the rule of \n     law, respect for human rights, and meeting the basic needs of \n     all\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\n     Kenyans is jeopardized by the current Kenyan government; and\n       Whereas the 1999 Country Report on Human Rights released by \n     the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the \n     Department of State reports that the Kenyan Government's \n     ``overall human rights record was generally poor, and serious \n     problems remained in many areas; while there were some signs \n     of improvement in a few areas, the situation worsened in \n     others.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the violent deaths of Father John Kaiser and \n     others who have worked to promote human rights and justice in \n     the Republic of Kenya and expresses its outrage at those \n     deaths;\n       (2) calls for a thorough investigation of those deaths that \n     includes other persons in addition to the Kenyan authorities;\n       (3) calls on the Secretary of State, acting through the \n     Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and \n     Labor, to prepare and submit to Congress, by December 15, \n     2000, a report on the progress made on investigating these \n     killings, including, particularly, a discussion of the \n     actions taken by the Kenyan government to conduct an \n     investigation as described in paragraph (2);\n       (4) calls on the President to support investigation of \n     these killings through all diplomatic means; and\n       (5) calls for the final report of such an investigation to \n     be made public.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise to today to offer a \nresolution calling for thorough investigation into the murder of Father \nJohn Kaiser, a Catholic missionary from Minnesota who was brutally \nmurdered in Kenya last month, and requiring the State Department to \nreport to Congress on the progress of the investigation by December \n15th, and to make public the final findings of the investigation.\n  For those of you who know little of Father John Kaiser, let me just \nsay this: Father Kaiser was an amazing man. One of those rare \nindividuals who found his calling early in life, he remained dedicated \nto that calling throughout his life. A catholic of the Order of the \nMill Hill Missionaries, Father Kaiser served as a missionary in Kenya \nfor 36 years. Born in Minnesota in 1932 to a German father and Irish \nmother, from 1954-1957, prior to being ordained, he had served his own \ncountry in the U.S. Army training paratroopers in the 82nd Airborne.\n  Those who knew Father Kaiser recall him as humble and soft-spoken \nwith totally selfless zeal for the service of others. In Kenya Father \nKaiser was an outspoken advocate on the issue of human rights and \ninjustice, and advocated those rights on behalf of all Kenyans. In \nMarch of this year Father Kaiser was awarded the ``Award for \nDistinguished Service in the Support of Human Rights'' by the Law \nSociety of Kenya. This is the highest award given by the Law Society \nand it is usually awarded to three people annually--this year Father \nKaiser was the sole recipient. I have a copy of the speech given by the \nLaw Society in honor of Father Kaiser and I will ask that this speech \nbe inserted in the Record. I'd also like to note that earlier this week \nin St. Paul, Minnesota Father Kaiser was posthumously awarded the twin \ncities International Citizen Award.\n  Father Kaiser spoke frequently against the injustice of government \ncorruption in Kenya and some believe this is what led to his death. In \n1992 Father Kaiser was confronted for his political activism against \ncorruption. At an inquiry into why tribal clashes killed hundred in the \nrun-up to Kenya's first multiparty election in 1992, Kaiser had \ntestified that two Cabinet ministers had encouraged the strife in a \nploy to drive those in opposition off their land. After accusing high-\nlevel government officials of stealing land from the poor, he was \narrested last year and threatened with deportation. His most recent \nconfrontation with a powerful Kenyan involved Minister of State Julius \nSunkuli, considered by many to be the current Kenya President's \npersonal preference as a successor. Working with the Kenya chapter of \nthe International Federation of Women Lawyers, Father Kaiser had been \nhelping a female parishioner who claimed that Mr. Sunkuli raped her \nthree years ago when she was 14 and fathered her child. Father Kaiser \nwas killed one week before the court case was due to begin. A few days \nlater, the young women dropped the charge.\n  Father Kaiser's death is a manifestation of the corruption and \ninjustice rampant in Kenya today. In its annual survey issued two weeks \nago, the Transparency International watchdog organization named Kenya \nthe ninth-most corrupt country in the world, on par with Russia. In \nKenya, church leaders bemoan the fact that they are told to stay out of \npolitics. They argue that what the government calls politics--promoting \nhuman rights, social and economic justice--is part and parcel of their \nmission. Mr. President, colleagues, I believe the position of the \nleadership in Kenya is not unusual; religious persecution is up around \nthe world because religious mandates such as promoting human rights, \nsocial and economic justice, are inherently political. We must speak up \nabout this case not only to find the truth about Father Kaiser's death \nand to bring some relief to his family, but also to let Kenya and the \nworld know that the United States does not condone Kenya's behavior.\n\n  An investigation is underway for the killer of Father Kaiser. The \nKenyan Attorney General requested the help of the FBI in the \ninvestigation and today three FBI agents are in Kenya. The U.S. \nAmbassador has also met with the Kenyan Foreign Minister and the Kenyan \nAttorney General. This is a good start. I am hopeful that the State \nDepartment will continue to keep a close eye on this case. We must \nexpress our outrage at the violent death of Father John Kaiser, as well \nas the brutal murder of other activists fighting against injustice in \nKenya. And we must demand a thorough investigation into their deaths. \nProminent human rights groups and organizations like Transparency \nInternational, report that in Kenya corruption reaches to the highest \nlevel of government. It is for that reason that any investigation must \ninclude persons other than the Kenyan authorities and its final report \nmust be made public. That is what I call for in the Resolution I am \noffering today with my colleague from Minnesota. I urge you to join us \nin your support, not only for the family of Father Kaiser and the \nothers who lost their lives fighting injustice in Kenya but for the \ncountless victims who have given their lives fighting injustice \nworldwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Law Society speech \nhonoring Father Kaiser be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Law Society of Kenya--Statement in Support of the Award for \n Distinguished Service in the Promotion of Human Rights to Father John \n            Anthony Kaiser for the Year 2000, March 11, 2000\n\n       This year's Law Society of Kenya Awards ceremony is a rare \n     departure from its young tradition in that we have only one \n     recipient. But that man is rare, indeed, one of a kind. His \n     name is Father John Anthony Kaiser. And it is a name we have \n     all heard.\n       In conferring upon him the Society's award for \n     Distinguished Service in the Promotion of human rights for \n     the year 2000, we of the Society consider ourselves specially \n     honored to have known and dealt with this man of God who, \n     like the Biblical Elijah, is a voice of stern rebuke to all \n     those that trouble the people and think it a little matter to \n     deny sovereign citizens their God-given right to live, move \n     and have. To them, he is a poisonous troublemaker, an \n     unwelcome meddler and a pain in the flesh. But to us and to \n     all those that love life and liberty, he is a stalwart \n     defender of the defenseless and a man eminently deserving of \n     honor.\n       In his life Father Kaiser has lived for and upheld two \n     ideals namely the universality of human rights and the \n     principle that Kenya citizenship appeals and protects all \n     Kenyan in every part of the Republic of Kenya. In upholding \n     these noble truths in the 1990s in Kenya Father Kaiser \n     repeatedly found himself in trouble. Not that Father Kaiser \n     is a man who goes out of his way to court trouble. To the \n     contrary, he is a retiring, humble and soft-spoken ``Mzee.'' \n     He is a simple man without pretensions. Seeing him on a \n     normal day one could easily dismiss him for just another \n     tired old man. Though a tall one.\n       Those who know him will say he has a totally selfless zeal \n     for the service of others. But they will also tell you that \n     he is a man of singular candour. He is honest and forthright \n     in speech almost to a fault. He would speak that \n     uncomfortable truth with a startling naivete that at once \n     sets you thinking and charms you to a new respect for the \n     man.\n       Born in Minnesota, United States of America in 1932 to a \n     German father and Irish mother, the future Father Kaiser \n     attended a one-roomed school for eight years before he went \n     to a Benedictine secondary school.\n       After a two-year stint at a junior college where he studied \n     Greek and Latin, he joined the U.S. Army for some three \n     years. His true calling was elsewhere and he quit to join the \n     St. Louis College where he studied theology and philosophy. \n     This was to be followed by some four years across the \n     Atlantic, studying to become a priest at St. Joseph's Mill\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\n     Hill College. Father Kaiser was in 1964 posted to Kenya and \n     specifically to the Kisii Catholic Diocese to which he \n     dedicated 30 years of exemplary and emulable service mostly \n     in the humble hills and valleys of Gusiiland, away from any \n     sort of public limelight. Everywhere he went he exhibited the \n     best missionary spirit of uplifting enlightening and \n     supporting the poor. A strong man physically, he worked with \n     joyful energy setting up churches wherever he went sometimes \n     single-handedly. So thoroughly did he immerse himself in the \n     daily living of the locals that he speaks Ekegussi with \n     a fluency that would put most native speakers of the \n     language to shame. He became in a real sense a much loved \n     if not revered `Omogaka' to the Abagusii among whom he \n     lived and served.\n       Come 1993, Father Kaiser was sent to the Ngong Catholic \n     Diocese his first appointment being to the fateful Maela \n     Refugee Camp for the internally victims of the infamous \n     Tribal Clashes. It was while at Maela that he witnessed at \n     even closer hand some of the most dastardly and heinous acts \n     of man's inhumanity to man. Freeborn Kenyans who had been \n     violently and murderously driven out of homes they had lived \n     in all their lives were reduced to the most abject and \n     dehumanizing poverty. He saw disease, despair, hunger and the \n     elements ravish men and women; the young and the aged alike \n     whose only crime was the biological and historical accident \n     of having been born into the `wrong' tribes. Father Kaiser \n     busied himself in trying to alleviate in what small ways he \n     could the anguish of those unfortunate.\n       It was while in situ at Maela, and while lawfully engaged \n     in Christian service quite in consonance with the oft \n     repeated credo of being mindful of the welfare of fellow \n     Kenyans that the fell foul of the ubiquitous and often \n     tyrannical Provincial Administration.\n       The existence of the Maela Refugee Camp had become an acute \n     embarrassment to the government which was not so keen on \n     having the shocking truth of ethnic cleansing exposed to the \n     watching world. The camp was an eyesore abominable and \n     damning to the Government. Some evil genius in the \n     administration hatched the plan to erase evidence of the very \n     existence of the Camp. Thus, on the 27th of December 1994, \n     those hapless Kenyans, once betrayed, raped, and \n     dispossessed, were betrayed a second time. They were \n     descended upon in a whirlwind government operation that broke \n     up the camp and bundled its inhabitants into trucks that \n     would dump them in stadiums, abandoned playing fields and \n     roadsides in the Central Province. The same bright mind in \n     government had now invented a new term with which these \n     unfortunate victims were baptized: Land Speculators.\n       The Naivasha District Officer who spearheaded the Maela \n     mop-up was livid that among those at the camp and who \n     witnessed the wanton dehumanization of the refugees was \n     Father Kaiser. For merely being there and not approving of \n     what the officers of government were doing, Father Kaiser was \n     violently assaulted by those agents of our government, \n     handcuffed, as a common criminal would be removed from the \n     scene. He was held under house arrest with armed men in \n     guard. State-sponsored terrorism is no respecter of persons \n     even when they are harmless parish priests. Shortly after \n     Maela, Father Kiser was posted to Lologorian Parish in Trans \n     Mara District. And trouble followed him there. It is an \n     abiding if tragic fact of this country's sociopolitical \n     landscape that no place is safe or tranquil for any honest \n     man of pure convictions. Wherever such people are, the \n     tyrants, sycophants, rapist and land grabbers that dot \n     Kenya's public life will feel uneasy and attempt to make life \n     unbearable for them.\n       True to his prophetic calling as a voice for the voiceless \n     and defender of the defenseless among his flock, Father \n     Kaiser found himself on a collision cause with those who had \n     oppressed, displaced, dispossessed and marginalized whole \n     clans of the Maasai in an orgy of systematic and \n     avaricious land-grabbing. His consistent and conscientious \n     stance against this and other evils and ills in Trans Mara \n     was fast gaining a formidable horde of enemies at all \n     levels of the power structure. No less than a powerful \n     cabinet minister saw the hand of good Father Kaiser in \n     allegations of rape or defilement leveled by young girls \n     against the said minister. There is of course no question \n     that it is in the nature of Father Kaiser to insist and \n     demand that any man, no matter his rank, who proves to be \n     a pestilential monster against nubile girls must face \n     justice. It is a very Christian demand.\n       Father Kaiser's gift and burden has been his unshakable \n     commitment to truth and justice. It is therefore not \n     surprising that when the Commission appointed to investigate \n     the causes of the ethnic cleansing under the Chairmanship of \n     Court of Appeal Judge Akiwuni got down to business, he \n     appeared to testify as to what he saw, experienced and heard.\n       In his painfully forthright way, the priest told the \n     Commission the horrible things he had witnessed. He recounted \n     tales heart rendering in their pain and outrageous that they \n     should be true. Unquestionably, he was a witness of truth. \n     His testimony was one of a man with a deep and abiding need \n     to see the demons of our national shame exorcised, the ghosts \n     of our innocent dead compatriots finally laid to rest and the \n     tears of their beloved wiped dry at last.\n       Inevitably, he categorically and bluntly told the \n     Commission that on the basis of the facts in his possession, \n     responsibility for the horror that was the clashes lay at the \n     highest echelons of state. Mincing no words, he fingered the \n     very heart of State power as the first culprit in this crime \n     against Kenya holding the Government and its trusted \n     lieutenants responsible. Father Kaiser mentioned dates, \n     names, places and times.\n       It is a monumental irony that detailed and useful as Father \n     Kaiser's testimony was, the Commission thought it violated \n     some in-house rules against mentioning the Head of State and \n     promptly expunged the same from its record.\n       Whether offensive to the rules of the Commission or not, \n     and shorn of all the trappings, technicalities and \n     complexities of procedure, Father Kaiser's experiences and \n     observations in his own words are admissible in the Tribunal \n     of Truth and that of public opinion and, we trust, will some \n     day find judicial admission when those who threatened to \n     dismember Kenya are finally brought to book. His courage, \n     boldness and candor in saying it as it really is cannot have \n     been in vain.\n       It is in the aforegoing context that we view the attempt by \n     the Kenya government to deport our hero in late 1999. A day \n     after his testimony at the Commission, the agents of terror \n     that he had named and shamed made a public threat that Father \n     Kaiser would be deported from Kenya. Could what followed be \n     related to these threats? Still smarting from the priest's \n     insistent voice of conscience, someone suddenly remembered \n     that this cleric who may pass for an Ompgusii, a Maasai, a \n     Kalenjin or a Kikuyu and who had lived in Kenya for as long \n     as we have been a republic, was not a Kenyan and, by reason \n     of his inadvertent failure to renew his work permit was \n     deserving of immediate deportation. Evidently our laws on \n     citizenship are in urgent need of revision. For, if Father \n     Kaiser does not qualify for citizenship, who does?\n       The move by the Government was amateurish, its sinister and \n     vindictive motivation too transparent to miss. There was an \n     immediate chorus of condemnation of the government's \n     persecution of the priest from many quarters including \n     Catholic Bishops, the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the \n     American Embassy. We are happy to recall the Law Society of \n     Kenya added its voice in demanding that his permit be \n     renewed. We are happier to note with a certain satisfaction \n     that, left with no choice, Government relented and, as you \n     can see, Father Kaiser is still here with us.\n       The life and times of Father John Anthony Kaiser stand out \n     as a study in courage, determination and sacrifice on behalf \n     of the weak, oppressed and downtrodden. He has had the \n     loftiness of ideals to speak out against social ills and \n     defend the native rights and dignity of mankind in the face \n     of callus and blood-chilling abuse. He has paid the price of \n     his convictions in being beaten, arrested, insulted and \n     hounded but has remained true to his conscience. He has stood \n     up to tyrants big and petty and won many battles for which \n     the humble men and women of Kenya for whom he has striven are \n     the happier. And in all this he has retained his cool and has \n     urged victims of violence not to retaliate in kind. Indeed, \n     he is on record as still loving and still praying for his \n     persecutors.\n       He does not consider himself a civil rights worker. He \n     would not call himself a human rights activist let alone its \n     champion. He would not admit to all his achievements, which \n     have emboldened and inspired many to love truth, cherish \n     liberty and fight for human rights. Father Kaiser says he is \n     just a simple parish priest. We agree. And we honor him.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nalong with Senator Wellstone which addresses a very tragic event in \nKenya involving a native son of Minnesota, Father John Kaiser.\n  Sixty-seven years ago, Father Kaiser was born in Perham, Minnesota \nand grew up in Maine Township near Fergus Falls. He attended St. John's \nPrep in Collegeville, along with former Senator Dave Durenberger, and \nSt. John's University. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1964 after \nattending St. Joseph's Seminary in England.\n  His thirty-six years in the East African country of Kenya was spent \nbuilding schools and helping the people. He was a strong supporter of \nhuman rights and justice for the poor and oppressed. He was their \nspokesman and a highly visible reminder to the Kenyan government of the \ninjustices he sought to remedy. His courage in the face of death \nemboldened and strengthened the resolve of others in the human rights \ncommunity to stand for principle--for law and order, decency and \nrespect.\n  The cattle herders and farmers in the Great Rift Valley, the helpless \nyoung girls who may have suffered abuse at the hands of government \nofficials and the dedicated members of Father Kaiser's Mill Hill \nMission have lost a champion--but not the principles on which he \nstood--justice and equity and human rights for all.\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\n  I have addressed this issue at the highest level with Secretary of \nState Madeleine Albright during a recent Foreign Affairs Committee \nmeeting. The resolution of this United States citizen's death is \nimportant to Kenya's credibility in the world community. We intend to \nsee his assassins quickly brought to trial, and our Resolution reflects \nthe desire of Congress to step-up the investigation into his death. I \njoin Bishop John Njue, Chairman of the Kenyan Catholic Episcopal \nConference in saying ``Do not be afraid''--we are with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10095-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 368--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF RELOCATING AND \n                RENOVATING THE HAMILTON GRANGE, NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n                              S. Res. 368\n\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton, assisted by James Madison and \n     George Washington, was the principal drafter of the \n     Constitution of the United States;\n       Whereas Hamilton was General Washington's aide-de-camp \n     during the Revolutionary War, and, given command by \n     Washington of the New York and Connecticut light infantry \n     battalion, led the successful assault on British redoubt \n     number 10 at Yorktown;\n       Whereas after serving as Secretary of the Treasury, \n     Hamilton founded the Bank of New York and the New York Post;\n       Whereas the only home Hamilton ever owned, commonly known \n     as ``the Grange'', is a fine example of Federal period \n     architecture designed by New York architect John McComb, Jr., \n     and was built in upper Manhattan in 1803;\n       Whereas the New York State Assembly enacted a law in 1908 \n     authorizing New York City to acquire the Grange and move it \n     to nearby St. Nicholas Park, part of the original Hamilton \n     estate, but no action was taken;\n       Whereas in 1962, the National Park Service took over \n     management of the Grange, by then wedged on Convent Avenue \n     within inches between an apartment house on the north side \n     and a church on the south side;\n       Whereas the 1962 designation of the Grange as a national \n     memorial was contingent on the acquisition by the National \n     Park Service of a site to which the building could be \n     relocated;\n       Whereas the New York State legislature enacted a law in \n     1998 that granted approval for New York City to transfer land \n     in St. Nicholas Park to the National Park Service, causing \n     renovations to the Grange to be postponed; and\n       Whereas no obelisk, monument, or classical temple along the \n     national mall has been constructed to honor the man who more \n     than any other designed the Government of the United States, \n     Hamilton should at least be remembered by restoring his home \n     in a sylvan setting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes the immense contribution \n     Alexander Hamilton made to the United States as a principal \n     drafter of the Constitution; and\n       (2) the National Park Service should expeditiously--\n       (A) proceed to relocate the Grange to St. Nicholas Park; \n     and\n       (B) restore the Grange to a state befitting the memory of \n     Alexander Hamilton.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution that calls on the National Park Service to relocate \nthe Hamilton Grange, which is the home of Alexander Hamilton. As \nWashington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, delegate to the \nConstitutional Convention, Secretary of the Treasury, and founder of \nthe Bank of New York and the New York Post, Hamilton was instrumental \nin determining the direction of the nation in its early years. The only \nhome he ever owned is in New York City. It sits on a block in Harlem, \nbounded on the north by an apartment house and on the south by a \nchurch. The apartment house is inches away, the church a few feet.\n  For some forty years the National Park Service has been contemplating \nthe relocation of the Grange to a better site. The plan now is to go \naround the corner to St. Nicholas Park. The park was part of the \noriginal Hamilton estate and would be a far more appropriate location \nfor the house. The necessary civic approvals are nearly set. It will \nsoon be in the hands of the Park Service to get this done. The \nresolution simply states that the agency should do so expeditiously, \nand should then proceed with the restoration projects that have been on \nhold. Alexander Hamilton and those who come to see his home deserve as \nmuch.

Mr. President, I rise today to file an amendment on \nbehalf of myself, as chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, and Mr. Kennedy, Ranking Member of the Committee \nto H.R. 1102, the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, as \nreported by the Committee on Finance on September 12, 2000. Our \namendment concerns pension issues within our jurisdiction. It would \nsimplify and modify provisions of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 relating to employer pension plans.\n  More specifically, the amendment would expand the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation's (PBGC) Missing Participants program; reduce PBGC \npremiums for new plans of small employers; authorize the PBGC to pay \ninterest on premium overpayment refunds; simplify the substantial owner \nbenefit rules for terminated defined benefit plans; increase the PBGC \nguarantee of benefits in multiemployer plans; allow the Secretary of \nLabor to reduce or waive civil penalties for breach of fiduciary \nresponsibility; make parties that are jointly and severally liable for \nfiduciary violations also jointly and severally liable for the related \npenalty; and improve and better target notices of benefit suspension to \npension plan participants.\n  Mr. President, I ask that our more detailed description of the \namendment be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Description of Amendment No. 4301 to the ``Retirement Security and \n                   Savings Act of 2000'' (H.R. 1102)\n\n\n           1. extension of pbgc missing participants program\n\n     Present law\n       The plan administrator of a defined benefit pension plan \n     that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is maintained by a \n     single employer, and terminates under a standard termination \n     is required to distribute the assets of the plan. With \n     respect to a participant whom the plan administrator cannot \n     locate after a diligent search, the plan administrator \n     satisfies the distribution requirement only by purchasing \n     irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all \n     benefit liabilities under the plan or transferring the \n     participant's designated benefit to the Pension Benefit \n     Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC''), which holds the benefit of \n     the missing participant as trustee until the PBGC locates the \n     missing participant and distributes the benefit. The PBGC \n     missing participant program is not available to multiemployer \n     plans or defined contribution plans and other plans not \n     covered by Title IV of ERISA.\n     Reason for change\n       Terminating multiemployer plans and terminating defined \n     contribution plans face the same problems with missing \n     participants as single-employer defined benefit plans. \n     Allowing terminating multiemployer and defined contribution \n     plans to transfer pension funds for missing participants to \n     the PBGC would enable these plans to wind up their affairs \n     and would increase the chances that missing participants will \n     be able to locate their benefits.\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would direct the PBGC to prescribe for \n     terminating multiemployer plans and terminating defined \n     contribution plans (including plans under section 401(k) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code) rules similar to the present-law \n     missing participant rules applicable to terminating single-\n     employer plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective for distributions from \n     terminating plans that occur after the PBGC has adopted final \n     regulations implementing the proposal.\n\n\n            2. reduce pbgc premiums for small and new plans\n\n     Present law\n       Under present law, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n     (``PBGC'') provides insurance protection for participants and \n     beneficiaries under certain defined benefit pension plans by \n     guaranteeing certain basic benefits under the plan in the \n     event the plan is terminated with insufficient assets. The \n     guaranteed benefits are funded in part by premium payments \n     from employers who sponsor defined benefit plans.\n       The amount of the required annual PBGC premium for a \n     single-employer plan is generally a flat rate premium of $19 \n     per participant and an additional variable rate premium based \n     on a charge of $9 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits. \n     Unfunded vested benefits under a plan generally means (1) the \n     unfunded current liability for vested benefits under the \n     plan, over (2) the value of the plan's assets, reduced by any \n     credit balance in the funding standard account. No variable \n     rate premium is imposed for a year if contributions to the \n     plan were at least equal to the full funding limit. The PBGC \n     guarantee is phased in ratably in the case of plans that have \n     been in effect for less than 5 years, and with respect to \n     benefit increases from a plan amendment that was in effect \n     for less than 5 years before termination of the plan.\n     Reason for change\n       The number of single-employer defined benefit plans covered \n     by PBGC has declined dramatically in recent years--from \n     112,000 in 1985 to little over 39,000 in 1999. Most of the \n     decline is because of the termination of small plans. An \n     employer incurs a number of one-time costs to establish a \n     plan. The proposal is intended to remove the PBGC premium as \n     a disincentive to small employers establishing defined \n     benefit plans.\n       For very small employers, the variable-rate premium can be \n     a disproportionately large and unpredictable cost and can \n     discourage them from establishing or maintaining a \n     defined benefit pension plan for their employees. Very \n     small employers would be more likely to establish and keep \n     defined benefit plans if they could be assured that the \n     variable rate premium would be affordable.\n       While most of the decline in the number of defined benefit \n     plans is because of the termination of small plans, many \n     larger plans also have terminated. Further, larger employers \n     that establish plans are not choosing defined benefit plans.\n       Incentives are needed to encourage establishment of defined \n     benefit plans by larger employers. The PBGC variable rate \n     premium can be a disincentive to some plans. The proposal \n     would provide a limited break from the variable rate premium, \n     keyed to PBGC's guarantee limits in the early years of a \n     plan.\n     Description of proposal\n       a. Reduced flat-rate premiums for new plans of small \n           employers\n       Under the proposal, for each of the first five plan years \n     of a new single-employer plan of a small employer, the flat-\n     rate PBGC premium would be $5 per plan participant. A small \n     employer would be defined as a plan contributing sponsor \n     that, together with other members of its controlled group, \n     employs 100 or fewer employees on the first day of the plan \n     year.\n       Under ERISA, the ``employer'' consists of a plan's \n     ``contributing sponsor'' and all entities that are in \n     ``common control'' with it under the tax code. The \n     contributing sponsor together with the other entities in \n     common control are also referred to as members of the \n     ``controlled group.'' In the case of a plan to which more \n     than one unrelated contributing sponsor contributes, \n     employees of all\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\n     contributing sponsors (and their controlled group members) \n     would be taken into account in determining whether the plan \n     is a plan of a small employer.)\n       A new plan would mean a defined benefit plan maintained by \n     a contributing sponsor if, during the 36-month period ending \n     on the date of adoption of the plan, such contributing \n     sponsor (or controlled group member or a predecessor of \n     either) did not establish or maintain a plan subject to PBGC \n     coverage with respect to which benefits were accrued for \n     substantially the same employees as are in the new plan.\n       b. Reduced variable PBGC premium for new and small employer \n           plans\n       The proposal would provide that the variable premium is \n     phased in for ``new defined benefit plans'' over a six-year \n     period starting with the plan's first plan year. The amount \n     of the variable premium would be a percentage of the variable \n     premium otherwise due, as follows: 0 percent of the otherwise \n     applicable variable premium in the first plan year; 20 \n     percent in the second plan year; 40 percent in the third plan \n     year; 60 percent in the fourth plan year; 80 percent in the \n     fifth plan year; and 100 percent in the sixth plan year (and \n     thereafter). A new defined benefit plan would be defined as \n     under the flat-rate premium proposal relating to new small \n     employer plans.\n       In addition, in the case of any plan (not just a new plan) \n     of an employer with 25 or fewer employees, the per-\n     participant variable-rate premium would be no more than $5 \n     multiplied by the number of plan participants.\n     Effective date\n       The proposals relating to new plans would be effective for \n     plans established after December 31, 2000. The proposal \n     reducing the PBGC variable premium for small plans would be \n     effective for years after December 31, 2000.\n\n\n   3. Authorization for PBGC to pay interest on premium overpayment \n                                refunds\n\n     Present law\n       The PBGC currently charges interest on underpayments but is \n     not authorized to pay interest to plan sponsors on refunds of \n     premium overpayments.\n     Reason for change\n       Premium payors should receive interest on monies that are \n     owed to them.\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would allow the PBGC to pay interest on \n     overpayments made by premium payors. Interest paid on \n     overpayments would be calculated at the same rate and in the \n     same manner as interest is charged on premium underpayments.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective with respect to refunds \n     made on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n      4. rules for substantial owner benefits in terminated plans\n\n     Present law\n       Under present law, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n     (``PBGC'') provides participants and beneficiaries in a \n     defined benefit pension plan with certain minimal guarantees \n     as to the receipt of benefits under the plan in case of plan \n     termination. The employer sponsoring the defined benefit \n     pension plan is required to pay premiums to the PBGC to \n     provide insurance for the guaranteed benefits. In general, \n     PBGC will guarantee all basic benefits which are payable in \n     periodic installments for the life (or lives) of the \n     participant and his or her beneficiaries and are non-\n     forfeitable at the time of plan termination. The amount of \n     the guaranteed benefit is subject to certain limitations. One \n     limitation is that the plan (or an amendment to the plan \n     which increases benefits) must be in effect for 60 months \n     before termination for the PBGC to guarantee the full amount \n     of basic benefits for a plan participant, other than a \n     substantial owner. In the case of a substantial owner, the \n     guaranteed basic benefit is phased in over 30 years beginning \n     with participation in the plan. A substantial owner is one \n     who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the \n     voting stock of a corporation. Special rules restricting the \n     amount of benefit guaranteed and the allocation of assets \n     also apply to substantial owners.\n     Reason for change\n       The special substantial owner rules are inordinately \n     complex and require plan documents going back as far as 30 \n     years, which are difficult or impossible to obtain. The rules \n     penalize owners in plans that started out with modest benefit \n     levels and those with little control over plan decisions. \n     Changes are needed in the guarantee and asset allocation \n     rules to simplify determination of benefits and eliminate the \n     unduly harsh treatment of owners under the current law. The \n     proposed changes also will eliminate one of the reasons that \n     small business owners give for not establishing defined \n     benefit plans (i.e., the inadequacy of PBGC guarantees for \n     owners).\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would provide that the 60-month phase-in of \n     guaranteed benefits would apply to a substantial owner with \n     less than 50 percent ownership interest. For a substantial \n     owner with a 50 percent of more ownership interest \n     (``majority owner''), the guarantee would depend on the \n     number of years the plan has been in effect and would not be \n     more than the amount guaranteed for other participants. \n     Specifically, a majority owner's guarantee would be computed \n     by multiplying the guarantee that would apply if the \n     participant were not a substantial owner, by a fraction (not \n     to exceed 1), the numerator of which is the number of years \n     the plan was in effect, and the denominator of which is 10. \n     The rules regarding allocation of assets would apply to \n     substantial owners, other than majority owners, in the same \n     manner as other participants.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective for plan terminations with \n     respect to which notices of intent to terminate are provided, \n     or for which proceedings for termination are instituted by \n     the PBGC after December 31, 2000.\n\n\n               5. multiemployer plan benefits guaranteed\n\n     Present law\n       The PBGC guarantees benefits of workers in multiemployer \n     plans. The monthly guarantee is equal to the participant's \n     years of service multiplied by the sum of (i) 100 percent of \n     the first $5 of the monthly benefit accrual rate, and (ii) 75 \n     percent of the next $15 of the accrual rate. The level of \n     benefits guaranteed by the PBGC under the multiemployer \n     program is modest and has not increased since 1980. For a \n     retiree with 30 years of service, the maximum guaranteed \n     annual benefit if $5,850. The maximum guarantee under the \n     PBGC's single-employer program is adjusted each year to \n     reflect changes in the social security wage index.\n     Reason for change\n       The level of benefits guaranteed by the PBGC under the \n     multiemployer program is modest and has not increased since \n     1980.\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal adjusts the amount guaranteed in multiemployer \n     plans to account for changes in the social security wage \n     index since 1980. Under the proposal, the PBGC would \n     guarantee a monthly benefit equal to the participant's years \n     of service multiplied by the sum of (i) 100 percent of the \n     first $11 of the monthly benefit accrual rate, and (ii) 75 \n     percent of the next $33 of the accrual rate. The proposed \n     change would increase the maximum annual guarantee for a \n     retiree with 30 years of service to $12,870.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective for benefits payable after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, excluding benefits payable \n     under a multiemployer plan that received assistance payments \n     from the PBGC during the one-year period ending on the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n       6. Civil penalties for breach of fiduciary responsibility\n\n     Current law\n       Section 502(1) was added to ERISA by the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1989. In its current form, section \n     502(1) requires the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil \n     penalty against a fiduciary who breaches a fiduciary \n     responsibility under, or commits a violation of, Part 4 of \n     Title I of ERISA, or any other person who knowingly \n     participates in such a breach or violation. The penalty is a \n     flat 20 percent of the ``applicable recovery amount'' that is \n     paid pursuant to a settlement agreement with the Secretary or \n     that a court orders to be paid in a judicial proceeding \n     brought by the Secretary to enforce ERISA's fiduciary \n     responsibility provisions. The Secretary may waive or reduce \n     the penalty only if the Secretary finds in writing that \n     either (1) the violator acted reasonably and in good faith, \n     or (2) it is reasonable to expect that the violator cannot \n     restore all the losses without severe financial hardship \n     unless the waiver or reduction is granted.\n     Reson for change\n       Since its enactment, the section 502(1) penalty provision \n     has discouraged voluntary, prompt settlements of fiduciary \n     violations with the Department of Labor. This is because the \n     Secretary of Labor was given little authority to reduce or \n     waive the penalty in order to encourage prompt settlements \n     with violators. Moreover, administration of the provision \n     often raises difficult questions concerning whether a \n     particular payment to a plan was made pursuant to a \n     settlement agreement.\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would remove the current disincentive to \n     settlement and encourage parties to quickly settle claims of \n     violations that the Department brings to their attention. The \n     proposal would give the Secretary of Labor full discretion to \n     reduce or waive the penalty, and no penalty would be assessed \n     on any amount recovered by a plan or by a participant or \n     beneficiary within 30 days after the violator receives \n     written notice of the violation from the Department of Labor. \n     The Secretary would be given authority to extend the 30-day \n     grace period.\n       The proposal would make all persons who are jointly and \n     severally liable for a violation also jointly and severally \n     liable for the penalty. The proposal also would clarify that \n     the term ``applicable recovery amount'' includes payments by \n     third parties that are made on behalf of the violator. This \n     change would prevent avoidance of the penalty by having an \n     unrelated third party pay the recovery amount.\n       Finally, when a penalty is contested, the proposal would \n     give Administrative Law Judges the authority to decide both \n     the existence of the underlying violation and the applicable \n     recovery amount. This provision\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\n     would apply to any breach of fiduciary responsibility or \n     other violation of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA occurring on or \n     after enactment.\n     Effective date\n       (a) General effective date. The proposal would apply to any \n     breach of fiduciary responsibility or other violation of part \n     4 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 occurring on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Transition rule. Fiduciaries would have six months from \n     the date of enactment to undo continuing violations without \n     application of the amendments. Thereafter, all such \n     violations would be treated as having begun after the \n     effective date of the amendments for purposes of determining \n     the applicable recovery amount.\n\n\n                      7. Benefit suspension notice\n\n     Current law\n       Pension plans must provide a ``Benefit Suspension Notice'' \n     to retirees who have been receiving a pension who then decide \n     to return to work for that same employer. These same notices \n     are sent to employees who continue to work past normal \n     retirement age. The plan must provide this notice during the \n     first calendar month or payroll period after the employee \n     reaches normal retirement age or the plan risks losing its \n     tax exempt status.\n     Reason for change\n       The loss of tax exempt status is an excessive penalty for \n     failure to give a notice to employees reaching normal \n     retirement age. These ``Benefit Suspension Notices'' are \n     often regarded by employees who choose to continue to work \n     past normal retirement age either as a sign that the employer \n     is trying to force them into retirement or as a notice that \n     somehow the pension plan is being suspended. In either case, \n     for the employee who continues to work, and does not expect \n     to receive a pension, these notices are often cause for \n     alarm. The benefit ``suspension'' notice for benefit payments \n     that have not yet begun is irrational and should be \n     discontinued.\n       Benefit Suspension Notices sent to retirees who return to \n     work for their previous employer do not currently alert these \n     workers to reductions in the rate of benefit accruals that \n     may now apply to them because they are working past normal \n     retirement age, the plan has been amended or terminated, or \n     for other reasons. As a result, these workers may not be \n     prepared for these lower accrual rates (or no accruals in the \n     case of a terminated plan).\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would require that ``Benefit Suspension \n     Notices'' be sent only to those pension plan beneficiaries \n     who return to the workforce. Benefit Suspension Notices sent \n     to a retiree returning to work for a previous employer, must \n     include a statement that the rate of future benefit accruals \n     may be reduced, if a reduced accrual rate could apply to the \n     returning worker.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would apply to plan years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  WYDEN (AND CRAIG) AMENDMENT NO. 4302\n\n  Mr HAGEL (for Mr. Wyden (for himself and Mr. Craig)) proposed an \namendment to the bill (H.R. 2389) to restore stability and \npredictability to the annual payments made to States and counties \ncontaining National Forest System lands and public domain lands managed \nby the Bureau of Land Management for use by the counties for the \nbenefit of public schools, roads, and other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Forest System, which is managed by the \n     United States Forest Service, was established in 1907 and has \n     grown to include approximately 192,000,000 acres of Federal \n     lands.\n       (2) The public domain lands known as revested Oregon and \n     California Railroad grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay \n     Wagon Road grant lands, which are managed predominantly by \n     the Bureau of Land Management were returned to Federal \n     ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise approximately \n     2,600,000 acres of Federal lands.\n       (3) Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure \n     these lands in Federal ownership, the counties in which these \n     lands are situated would be deprived of revenues they would \n     otherwise receive if the lands were held in private \n     ownership.\n       (4) These same counties have expended public funds year \n     after year to provide services, such as education, road \n     construction and maintenance, search and rescue, law \n     enforcement, waste removal, and fire protection, that \n     directly benefit these Federal lands and people who use these \n     lands.\n       (5) To accord a measure of compensation to the affected \n     counties for the critical services they provide to both \n     county residents and visitors to these Federal lands, \n     Congress determined that the Federal Government should share \n     with these counties a portion of the revenues the United \n     States receives from these Federal lands.\n       (6) Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived from \n     National Forest System lands be paid to States for use by the \n     counties in which the lands are situated for the benefit of \n     public schools and roads.\n       (7) Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 75 percent of the revenues derived from \n     the revested and reconveyed grant lands be paid to the \n     counties in which those lands are situated to be used as are \n     other county funds, of which 50 percent is to be used as \n     other county funds.\n       (8) For several decades primarily due to the growth of the \n     Federal timber sale program, counties dependent on and \n     supportive of these Federal lands received and relied on \n     increasing shares of these revenues to provide funding for \n     schools and road maintenance.\n       (9) In recent years, the principal source of these \n     revenues, Federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed \n     and, as the volume of timber sold annually from most of the \n     Federal lands has decreased precipitously, so too have the \n     revenues shared with the affected counties.\n       (10) This decline in shared revenues has affected \n     educational funding and road maintenance for many counties.\n       (11) In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \n     Congress recognized this trend and ameliorated its adverse \n     consequences by providing an alternative annual safety net \n     payment to 72 counties in Oregon, Washington, and northern \n     California in which Federal timber sales had been restricted \n     or prohibited by administrative and judicial decisions to \n     protect the northern spotted owl.\n       (12) The authority for these particular safety net payments \n     is expiring and no comparable authority has been granted for \n     alternative payments to counties elsewhere in the United \n     States that have suffered similar losses in shared revenues \n     from the Federal lands and in the funding for schools and \n     roads those revenues provide.\n       (13) There is a need to stabilize education and road \n     maintenance funding through predictable payments to the \n     affected counties, job creation in those counties, and other \n     opportunities associated with restoration, maintenance, and \n     stewardship of Federal lands.\n       (14) Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \n     Management face significant backlogs in infrastructure \n     maintenance and ecosystem restoration that are difficult to \n     address through annual appropriations.\n       (15) There is a need to build new, and strengthen existing, \n     relationships and to improve management of public lands and \n     waters.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To stabilize payments to counties to provide funding \n     for schools and roads that supplements other available funds.\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\n       (2) To make additional investments in, and create \n     additional employment opportunities through, projects that \n     improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement \n     stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and \n     restore and improve land health and water quality. Such \n     projects shall enjoy broad-based support with objectives that \n     may include, but are not limited to--\n       (A) road, trail, and infrastructure maintenance or \n     obliteration;\n       (B) soil productivity improvement;\n       (C) improvements in forest ecosystem health;\n       (D) watershed restoration and maintenance;\n       (E) restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife \n     and fish habitat;\n       (F) control of noxious and exotic weeds; and\n       (G) reestablishment of native species.\n       (3) To improve cooperative relationships among the people \n     that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies that \n     manage these lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Sections 13982 and 13983 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66; 16 U.S.C. 500 \n     note; 43 U.S.C. 1181f note) are repealed.\n\n            TITLE V--MINERAL REVENUE PAYMENTS CLARIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Mineral Revenue Payments \n     Clarification Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Section 10201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1993 (Public Law 103-66; 107 Stat. 407) amended section 35 \n     of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) to change the \n     sharing of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from \n     geothermal steam from a 50:50 split between the Federal \n     Government and the States to a complicated formula that \n     entailed deducting from the State share of leasing revenues \n     ``50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriations of \n     the Department of the Interior and any other agency\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\n     during the preceding fiscal year allocable to the \n     administration of all laws providing for the leasing of any \n     onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States \n     for the production of the same types of minerals leasable \n     under this Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of \n     such laws . . .''.\n       (2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound \n     public policy rationale for deducting prior-year \n     administrative expenses from the sharing of current-year \n     receipts, indicating that this change was made primarily for \n     budget scoring reasons.\n       (3) The system put in place by this change in law has \n     proved difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes \n     between the Federal Government and the States as to the \n     nature of allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have \n     proven to be poorly suited to breaking down administrative \n     costs in the manner required by the law. Different Federal \n     agencies implementing this law have used varying \n     methodologies to identify allocable costs, resulting in an \n     inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal years 1994 \n     through 1996. In November 1997, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of the Interior found that ``the congressionally \n     approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in \n     fiscal year 1997 may not accurately compute the deductions''.\n       (4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993 \n     change in law and the complexity and administrative burden \n     involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the \n     enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 is \n     justified.\n\n     SEC. 503. AMENDMENT OF THE MINERAL LEASING ACT.\n\n       Section 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191(b)) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) In determining the amount of payments to the States \n     under this section, the amount of such payments shall not be \n     reduced by any administrative or other costs incurred by the \n     United States.''.\n\n                 TITLE VI--COMMUNITY FOREST RESTORATION\n\n     SECTION 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Community Forest \n     Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A century of fire suppression, logging, and livestock \n     grazing has altered the ecological balance of New Mexico's \n     forests.\n       (2) Some forest lands in New Mexico contain an unnaturally \n     high number of small diameter trees that are subject to \n     large, high intensity wildfires that can endanger human \n     lives, livelihoods, and ecological stability.\n       (3) Forest lands that contain an unnaturally high number of \n     small diameter trees have reduced biodiversity and provide \n     fewer benefits to human communities, wildlife, and \n     watersheds.\n       (4) Healthy and productive watersheds minimize the threat \n     of large, high intensity wildfires, provide abundant and \n     diverse wildlife habitat, and produce a variety of timber and \n     non-timber products including better quality water and \n     increased water flows.\n       (5) Restoration efforts are more successful when there is \n     involvement from neighboring communities and better \n     stewardship will evolve from more diverse involvement.\n       (6) Designing demonstration restoration projects through a \n     collaborative approach may--\n       (A) lead to the development of cost effective restoration \n     activities;\n       (B) empower diverse organizations to implement activities \n     which value local and traditional knowledge;\n       (c) build ownership and civil pride; and\n       (D) ensure healthy, diverse, and productive forests and \n     watersheds.\n\n     SEC. 603. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to promote healthy watersheds and reduced the threat of \n     large, high intensity wildfires, insect infestation, and \n     disease in the forests in New Mexico;\n       (2) to improve the functioning of forest ecosystems and \n     enhance plant and wildlife biodiversity by reducing the \n     unnaturally high number and density of small diameter trees \n     on Federal, Tribal, State, County, and Municipal, forest \n     lands;\n       (3) to improve communication and joint problem solving \n     among individuals and groups who are interested in restoring \n     the diversity and productivity of forested watersheds in New \n     Mexico;\n       (4) to improve the use of, or add value to, small diameter \n     trees;\n       (5) to encourage sustainable communities and sustainable \n     forests through collaborative partnerships whose objectives \n     are forest restoration; and\n       (6) to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate ecologically \n     sound forest restoration techniques.\n\n     SEC. 604. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this title--\n       (1) the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of Agriculture \n     acting through the Chief of the Forest Service; and\n       (2) the term `stakeholder' includes: tribal governments, \n     educational institutions, landowners, and other interested \n     public and private entities.\n\n     SEC. 605.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 annually \n     to carry out this title.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  COLORADO UTE SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                CAMPBELL (AND ALLARD) AMENDMENT NO. 4303\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Allard) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 2508) to amend the \nColorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 to provide for \na final settlement of the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Colorado \n     Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order to provide for a full and final settlement of \n     the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes on the Animas \n     and La Plata Rivers, the Tribes, the State of Colorado, and \n     certain of the non-Indian parties to the Agreement have \n     proposed certain modifications to the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (2) The claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes on all \n     rivers in Colorado other than the Animas and La Plata Rivers \n     have been settled in accordance with the provisions of the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 \n     (Public Law 100-585; 102 Stat. 2973).\n       (3) The Indian and non-Indian communities of southwest \n     Colorado and northwest New Mexico will be benefited by a \n     settlement of the tribal claims on the Animas and La Plata \n     Rivers that provides the Tribes with a firm water supply \n     without taking water away from existing uses.\n       (4) The Agreement contemplated a specific timetable for the \n     delivery of irrigation and municipal and industrial water and \n     other benefits to the Tribes from the Animas-La Plata \n     Project, which timetable has not been met. The provision of \n     irrigation water can not presently be satisfied under the \n     current implementation of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (5) In order to meet the requirements of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in \n     particular the various biological opinions issued by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the amendments made by this Act are \n     needed to provide for a significant reduction in the \n     facilities and water supply contemplated under the Agreement.\n       (6) The substitute benefits provided to the Tribes under \n     the amendments made by this Act, including the waiver of \n     capital costs and the provisions of funds for natural \n     resource enhancement, result in a settlement that provides \n     the Tribes with benefits that are equivalent to those that \n     the Tribes would have received under the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (7) The requirement that the Secretary of the Interior \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other national environmental laws \n     before implementing the proposed settlement will ensure that \n     the satisfaction of the tribal water rights is accomplished \n     in an environmentally responsible fashion.\n       (8) In considering the full range of alternatives for \n     satisfying the water rights claims of the Southern Ute Indian \n     Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, Congress has held \n     numerous legislative hearings and deliberations, and reviewed \n     the considerable record including the following documents:\n       (A) The Final EIS No. INT-FES-80-18, dated July 1, 1980.\n       (B) The Draft Supplement to the FES No. INT-DES-92-41, \n     dated October 13, 1992.\n       (C) The Final Supplemental to the FES No. 96-23, dated \n     April 26, 1996;\n       (D) The Draft Supplemental EIS, dated January 14, 2000.\n       (E) The Final Supplemental EIS, dated July 2000.\n       (F) The Record of Decision for the Settlement of the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Waters, September 25, 2000.\n       (9) In the Record of Decision referred to in paragraph \n     (8)(F), the Secretary determined that the preferred \n     alternative could only proceed if Congress amended the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 \n     (Public Law 100-585; 102 Stat. 2973) so as to satisfy the \n     Tribal water rights claim through the construction of the \n     features authorized by this Act. The amendments to the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 set \n     forth in this Act will provide the Ute Tribes with substitute \n     benefits equivalent to those that the Tribes would have \n     received under the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights \n     Settlement Act of 1988, in a manner consistent with paragraph \n     (8) and the Federal Government's trust obligation.\n       (10) Based upon paragraph (8), it is the intent of Congress \n     to enact legislation that implements the Record of Decision \n     referred to in paragraph (8)(F).\n       (c) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) Agreement.--The term ``Agreement'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 3(1) of the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (2) Animas-la plata project.--The term ``Animas-La Plata \n     Project'' has the meaning given that term in section 3(2) of \n     the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 \n     (Public Law 100-585; 102 Stat. 2973).\n       (3) Dolores project.--The term ``Dolores Project'' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 3(3) of the Colorado Ute \n     Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-\n     585; 102 Stat. 2974).\n       (4) Tribe; tribes.--The term ``Tribe'' or ``Tribes'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 3(6) of the Colorado \n     Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law \n     100-585; 102 Stat. 2974).\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 6 OF THE COLORADO UTE INDIAN \n                   WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1988.\n\n       Subsection (a) of section 6 of the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2975) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Reservoir; Municipal and Industrial Water.--\n       ``(1) Facilities.--\n       ``(A) In general.--After the date of enactment of this \n     subsection, but prior to January 1, 2005, or the date \n     established in the Amended Final Decree described in section \n     18(c), the Secretary, in order to settle the outstanding \n     claims of the Tribes on the Animas and La Plata Rivers, \n     acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, is specifically \n     authorized to--\n       ``(i) complete construction of, and operate and maintain, a \n     reservoir, a pumping plant, a reservoir inlet conduit, and \n     appurtenant facilities with sufficient capacity to divert and \n     store water from the Animas River to provide for an average \n     annual depletion of 57,100 acre-feet of water to be used for \n     a municipal and industrial water supply, which facilities \n     shall--\n\n       ``(I) be designed and operated in accordance with the \n     hydrologic regime necessary for the recovery of the \n     endangered fish of the San Juan River as determined by the \n     San Juan River Recovery Implementation Program;\n       ``(II) be operated in accordance with the Animas-La Plata \n     Project Compact as approved by Congress in Public Law 90-537;\n       ``(III) include an inactive pool of an appropriate size to \n     be determined by the Secretary following the completion of \n     required environmental compliance activities; and\n       ``(IV) include those recreation facilities determined to be \n     appropriate by agreement between the State of Colorado and \n     the Secretary that shall address the payment of any of the \n     costs of such facilities by the State of Colorado in addition \n     to the costs described in paragraph (3); and\n\n       ``(ii) deliver, through the use of the project components \n     referred to in clause (i), municipal and industrial water \n     allocations--\n\n       ``(I) with an average annual depletion not to exceed 16,525 \n     acre-feet of water, to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe for its \n     present and future needs;\n       ``(II) with an average annual depletion not to exceed \n     16,525 acre-feet of water, to the Ute Mountain Ute Indian \n     Tribe for its present and future needs;\n       ``(III) with an average annual depletion not to exceed \n     2,340 acre-feet of water, to the Navajo Nation for its \n     present and future needs;\n       ``(IV) with an average annual depletion not to exceed \n     10,400 acre-feet of water, to the San Juan Water Commission \n     for its present and future needs;\n       ``(V) with an average annual depletion of an amount not to \n     exceed 2,600 acre-feet of water, to the Animas-La Plata \n     Conservancy District for its present and future needs;\n       ``(VI) with an average annual depletion of an amount not to \n     exceed 5,230 acre-feet of water, to the State of Colorado for \n     its present and future needs; and\n       ``(VII) with an average annual depletion of an amount not \n     to exceed 780 acre-feet of water, to the La Plata Conservancy \n     District of New Mexico for its present and future needs.\n\n       ``(B) Applicability of other federal law.--The \n     responsibilities of the Secretary described in subparagraph \n     (A) are subject to the requirements of Federal laws related \n     to the protection of the environment and otherwise applicable \n     to the construction of the proposed facilities, including the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.), the Clean Water Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). \n     Nothing in this Act shall be construed to predetermine or \n     otherwise affect the outcome of any analysis conducted by the \n     Secretary or any other Federal official under applicable \n     laws.\n       ``(C) Limitation.--\n       ``(i) In general.--If constructed, the facilities described \n     in subparagraph (A) shall constitute the Animas-La Plata \n     Project.

Mr. President, today I am submitting an \namendment which supercedes S. 2508, legislation I introduced earlier \nthis year to provide for the final settlement of the Colorado Ute \nIndians Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. I am proud to have my \ncolleague Senator Wayne Allard as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  These amendments come after prolonged negotiations with officials of \nthe Department of Interior, the Tribes and other parties to this \nagreement. It is our last opportunity to fulfill our treaty obligations \nand prevent the Tribes from suing the federal government for the water \nthey were promised more than 12 years ago.\n  I am aware of the precious little time we have left in this session \nand the huge legislative task we have with the remaining important \nlegislation which remains on our calendar. Unfortunately, the Secretary \nof the Interior waited until September 25, 2000 to sign a Record of \nDecision supporting these amendments, amendments his staff helped \nnegotiate. It was my intent to move forward long before this.\n  However, I am compelled to introduce this amended legislation now, \nbecause by law, the Tribes already have the ability to sue the federal \ngovernment to have their treaty obligations for water fulfilled. And, I \nbelieve the Tribes will undoubtedly prevail and the damages awarded \nthem could far exceed what it will cost us to do what is already \nprescribed by law and federal treaty.\n  The record, the law and our moral obligation in this matter are \nclear. I believe the Administration and my colleagues agree with me, \nthe time to put this matter behind us has come. We teach our children \nthat our country was built on honesty, respect for the law and \nintegrity. But, we cannot hold up our respect for treaties we have \nentered into with American Indians, because we have never honored any \nof those treaties we have signed. It is time to do what is right and to \nmake water available to the Ute Tribes. This legislation does so in a \nmanner that minimizes the environmental impacts and the burden on the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation before \nCongress adjourns for the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10107-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10107-S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  On October 5, 2000, the Senate amended and passed S. 1756, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nStevens, and Mr. Thurmond, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the concurrent resolution \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 145) expressing the \n     sense of Congress on the propriety and need for expeditious \n     construction of the National World War II Memorial at the \n     Rainbow Pool on the National Mall in the Nation's Capital.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our former distinguished majority leader, \nMr. Dole, has headed up, together with others, an effort across \nAmerica, and indeed from abroad, to raise the funds and otherwise \nprovide for a memorial to be erected in the Nation's Capital in memory \nof those who served in World War II, and indeed those who were not in \nuniform but here on the homefront who, in every other respect, \nsupported that heroic effort during that period from the day beginning \nDecember 7, 1941, to and including the surrender of Japan in August of \n1945.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, World War II was the defining event of \nthe 20th century for the United States and its wartime allies with more \nthan 16,000,000 American men and women serving in uniform in the Armed \nForces. Over 400,000 Americans gave their lives for our nation and more \nthan 600,000 were wounded. In addition, countless Americans back home \nin the\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nUnited States organized and sacrificed to give their unwavering support \nto those in uniform.\n  Today, there are less than 6,000,000 surviving World War II veterans \nand we mourn the passing of greater than 1,200 veterans each day.\n  Mr. President, this is why the construction of the National World War \nII Memorial must follow an expeditious and critical path to completion. \nIn 1994, legislation was enacted which approved the location of a \nmemorial to this epic era in an area of the National Mall that includes \nthe Rainbow Pool.\n  Since July 1995, the National World War II Memorial site and design \nhave been subject to 19 public hearings that have resulted in an \nendorsement from the State Historic Preservation Officer of the \nDistrict of Columbia, three endorsements from the District of Columbia \nHistoric Preservation Review Board, and most significantly, four \napprovals from the Commission of Fine Arts and four approvals from the \nNational Capital Planning Commission. In July of this year, the \nCommission of Fine Arts approved the design of the memorial followed by \nfinal architectural design approval by the National Capital Planning \nCommission on September 21, 2000.\n  Mr. President, it is my feeling that construction of this magnificent \nmemorial, which has received a thorough review and given final approval \nby all jurisdictional authorities, should begin without delay. It is \nimperative that this fitting tribute to those brave and patriotic \nAmericans be completed and dedicated while surviving veterans are still \nalive.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to support this resolution and allow our \nWorld War II veterans, veterans of the most devastating war the world \nhas known, to see and be a part of the memorial they so fiercely \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I sought to get the cosponsorship of all those in this \nbody who served in World War II. The ability to do this, time-wise, \nprecluded that, but I am certain that almost all would have joined. \nTherefore, it is a particular privilege for me to submit this to the \nSenate. Congressman Stump will introduce the identical measure in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we take action on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the concurrent \nresolution?\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 145) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 145\n\n       Whereas World War II is the defining event of the twentieth \n     century for the United States and its wartime allies;\n       Whereas in World War II, more than 16,000,000 American men \n     and women served in uniform in the Armed Forces, more than \n     400,000 of them gave their lives, and more than 670,000 of \n     them were wounded;\n       Whereas many millions more on the home front in the United \n     States organized and sacrificed to give unwavering support to \n     those in uniform;\n       Whereas fewer than 6,000,000 World War II veterans are \n     surviving at the end of the twentieth century, and the Nation \n     mourns the passing of more than 1,200 veterans each day;\n       Whereas Congress, in Public Law 103-422 (108 Stat. 4356) \n     enacted in 1994, approved the location of a memorial to this \n     epic era in an area of the National Mall that includes the \n     Rainbow Pool;\n       Whereas since 1995, the National World War II Memorial site \n     and design have been the subject of 19 public hearings that \n     have resulted in an endorsement from the State Historic \n     Preservation Officer of the District of Columbia, three \n     endorsements from the District of Columbia Historic \n     Preservation Review Board, the endorsement of many Members of \n     Congress, and, most significantly, four approvals from the \n     Commission of Fine Arts and four approvals from the National \n     Capital Planning Commission (including the approvals of those \n     Commissions for the final architectural design);\n       Whereas on Veterans Day 1995, the President dedicated the \n     approved site at the Rainbow Pool on the National Mall as the \n     site for the National World War II Memorial; and\n       Whereas fundraising for the National World War II Memorial \n     has been enormously successful, garnering enthusiastic \n     support from half a million individual Americans, hundreds of \n     corporations and foundations, dozens of civic, fraternal, and \n     professional organizations, state legislatures, students in \n     1,100 schools, and more than 450 veterans groups representing \n     11,000,000 veterans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is appropriate for the United States to memorialize \n     in the Nation's Capitol the triumph of democracy over tyranny \n     in World War II, the most important event of the twentieth \n     century;\n       (2) the will of the American people to memorialize that \n     triumph and all who labored to achieve it, and the decisions \n     made on that memorialization by the appointed bodies charged \n     by law with protecting the public's interests in the design, \n     location, and construction of memorials on the National Mall \n     in the Nation's Capitol, should be fulfilled by the \n     construction of the National World War II Memorial, as \n     designed, at the approved and dedicated Rainbow Pool site on \n     the National Mall; and\n       (3) it is imperative that expeditious action be taken to \n     commence and complete the construction of the National World \n     War II Memorial so that the completed memorial will be \n     dedicated while Americans of the World War II generation are \n     alive to receive the national tribute embodied in that \n     memorial, which they earned with their sacrifice and \n     achievement during the largest and most devastating war the \n     world has known.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, the floor staff, and \nthe staffs of many Senators who were able to clear this resolution. I \nappreciate that.\n  I note the presence of another colleague on the floor. I would like \nto consult the Republican floor staff before I address the Senate \nfurther.\n  Mr. President, I understand our distinguished colleague wishes to \naddress the Senate for a period of time. How much time will he require?\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, twenty-two days ago I was here on the \nSenate floor helping to secure the support of 100 Senators in passing \nthe Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. \nIt was a good day for rural Americans when the Senate adopted S. 1608 \nunanimously.\n  Today is even better for rural Americans. A few minutes ago, the \nSenate passed legislation that now reflects an agreement among all \nstakeholders--the schools, the counties, the House and Senate and the \nAdministration--that assures House and Senate passage and the \nPresident's signature. This bill is the winning formula for everyone \nconcerned about rural communities.\n  The bill the Senate has passed is fundamentally unchanged from S. \n1608. The basics are the same: the purposes, the funding formula, and \nthe flexibility for counties to choose how to spend a portion of the \npayment. The bill will provide stable payments for education and roads \nin more than 750 timber-dependent counties across this country and real \nopportunities for environmental restoration on our national forests.\n  The bill will make sure our rural communities do not become economic \nsacrifice zones. It will help people in forest communities adapt to \nchanging national forest management policies by creating a funding \nformula alternative to timber receipts.\n  Policy changes in Washington, D.C. affecting logging on national \nforests across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an \naverage of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 \npercent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell \ndeeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some \nschools even had to close their doors at least one day a week.\n  This legislation will give rural communities a more predictable \npayment formula than the current roller coaster system based on timber \nreceipts. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-\n85 percent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from \nfiscal years 1986 to 1999. The amount would be calculated on a state-\nby-state, three-high-year basis, but would be distributed among the \ncounties on a county-by-county,\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\nthree-high-year calculation. Unlike today's system, a county will \nreceive its payment from the General Treasury, regardless of whether a \nsingle tree is cut on the national forests.\n  The bill before us today retains and improves upon a key element of \nS. 1608: that counties decide for themselves, in conjunction with other \nstakeholders, how they want to invest the remaining 15-to-20 percent of \nthe average payment. This bill clarifies and underscores county \nflexibility to use the funds other than those designated for schools \nand roads in any combination a county chooses for: fire prevention and \nfighting wildfires; forest-related education; easement purchases; \nemergency services reimbursement; stewardship projects; maintenance of \nexisting forest infrastructure; ecosystem restoration; and improvement \nof land and water quality on national forest lands.\n  There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the \ntraditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and \ncounties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county \npayments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and \nland. This bill will strengthen the bond between communities and \nneighboring Federal forests. The authorized projects are a way for the \nFederal government to recognize--without relaxing or compromising our \nenvironmental commitments--that timber towns grow not just trees, but \npeople, too.\n  S. 1608 is supported by thousands of groups, hundreds of counties, \nlabor organizations and school groups including the National Education \nAssociation, National Association of Counties, the American Federation \nof State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as the AFL-CIO.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Craig, Chairman of the Forests \nand Public Lands Subcommittee, for helping to bring us to where we are \ntoday. He has been tireless in his efforts. I also want to recognize \nthe outstanding commitment of Senator Bingaman, the ranking member on \nthe Energy Committee, and the incredible work of Senator Baucus, who \nbrought additional attention to non-federal land county projects, \nincluding wildfire prevention.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the work of the staff on this \nlegislation. In particular, Josh Kardon, my Chief of Staff, and Sarah \nBittleman, my Natural Resources Counsel, have done yeoman's work on \nthis legislation. Carole Grunberg, my Legislative Director, was always \nthere with support and encouragement. And Jeff Gagne, my Education \nadvisor, also contributed to the effort by figuring out the maze of \nOregon education spending. Special thanks also goes to David Dye, \nCounsel to the Senate Energy Committee and to Mark Rey of the Energy \nCommittee staff, whose steady hand and creativity helped resolve so \nmany problems successfully; to Bob Simon and Kira Finkler, of the \nEnergy Committee Democratic staff; and to Brian Kuehl with Senator \nBaucus, Sara Barth with Senator Boxer, and Peter Hanson with Senator \nDaschle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/06/senate-section/article/S10119-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL 2 P.M.
